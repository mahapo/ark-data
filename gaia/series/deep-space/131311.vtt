00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.980 align:middle line:84%
>> There has been phenomenal
research into the development

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.850 align:middle line:84%
of artificial intelligence,
or AI as it's called.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.850 align:middle line:84%
AI promises to make our
lives easier by doing

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.860 align:middle line:90%
much of our thinking for us.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.660 align:middle line:84%
The promise of AI
is that it will

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.150 align:middle line:90%
create a race of super humans.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.030 align:middle line:84%
But are there dangers
that come with AI?

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.980 align:middle line:84%
Hollywood has been warning us
of these concerns for many years

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:04.780 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.250 align:middle line:10%
>> I do think that "2001"
was ultimately about AI.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.980 align:middle line:10%
One reason I think that
is because when you watch

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.850 align:middle line:10%
the film, the first few times
I saw it, my perspective on it

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.760 align:middle line:10%
was that we're looking
at man versus AI.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.220 align:middle line:10%
So it's Bowman versus the robot.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.410 align:middle line:10%
And you have this final
evolutionary survival

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.790 align:middle line:10%
of the fittest confrontation,
where then from that point on,

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.550 align:middle line:10%
Bowman transforms
into Star Child.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.735 align:middle line:84%
But as I watched "Interstellar,"
which was a tribute to "2001,"

00:01:34.735 --> 00:01:37.900 align:middle line:84%
and I went back and watched
"2001: A Space Odyssey"

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.150 align:middle line:84%
again and rewrote
my piece on it,

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.920 align:middle line:84%
I started noticing
that it's actually

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.870 align:middle line:84%
at the point where Bowman pulls
out all of HAL's floppy disks

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.460 align:middle line:84%
or whatever he's
pulling up, that that

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.540 align:middle line:90%
triggers that message.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.455 align:middle line:84%
And that message is what tells
Bowman, oh, the secret space

00:01:52.455 --> 00:01:53.830 align:middle line:84%
mission here is
that you actually

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:54.997 align:middle line:90%
need to follow the monolith.

00:01:54.997 --> 00:01:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And so it's almost like
that wouldn't have happened

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.670 align:middle line:84%
if he hadn't pulled all the
batteries out of HAL which

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.410 align:middle line:90%
causes that screen to come up.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.580 align:middle line:84%
So then that impels Bowman to
chase the monolith the rest

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.440 align:middle line:90%
of the way on beyond infinity.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.700 align:middle line:10%
>> In the "Terminator" films,
they decide that nuclear

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.040 align:middle line:10%
weapons is much too dangerous
to be governed by humans,

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.040 align:middle line:10%
so they invented an AI
program called Skynet.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.680 align:middle line:10%
The most amazing thing about
Cameron's idea of Skynet

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.470 align:middle line:10%
is how closely related it is
to the idea of HAL in "2001."

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.420 align:middle line:10%
HAL is a form of AI that's
designed to watch the ship

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.240 align:middle line:10%
and keep track of the
astronauts that are on the ship,

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.940 align:middle line:10%
keep them alive, and make sure
their mission is successful.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.760 align:middle line:84%
But HAL, some time
during the mission,

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.630 align:middle line:84%
reaches the same conclusion
that Skynet reaches in

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.320 align:middle line:84%
that the astronauts are actually
useless appendages, that HAL

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.100 align:middle line:90%
is actually superior to them.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And that then HAL proceeds to
kill each of the astronauts

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.740 align:middle line:90%
off one by one.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.720 align:middle line:84%
Finally, one of the
astronauts, of course,

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.310 align:middle line:84%
stops HAL and destroys him
near the end of the film.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.750 align:middle line:84%
But these two ideas
are very similar.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.450 align:middle line:10%
And I think that both
Kubrick in "2001"

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.820 align:middle line:10%
and Cameron in "The
Terminator," the first two

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.570 align:middle line:10%
"Terminator" films
are warning us

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.540 align:middle line:10%
that AI is going to
reach this conclusion.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.040 align:middle line:10%
And I think it's
something we really

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.930 align:middle line:10%
have to think
about, because if it

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.590 align:middle line:10%
is a logical program
that we're creating

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.720 align:middle line:10%
what is it going to
conclude about us

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.100 align:middle line:10%
and our irrational behavior?

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.620 align:middle line:10%
>> So I almost think that if
you look at some of the works

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.120 align:middle line:10%
I've read on Kubrick that talk
about when he and Clarke were

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.660 align:middle line:10%
writing the screenplay, they
had the original intention

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.543 align:middle line:10%
to actually have the monolith
project images like screens.

00:03:47.543 --> 00:03:49.960 align:middle line:84%
But they thought that was a
little too limiting because it

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.650 align:middle line:84%
wasn't like this TV screen
that was flying out of space

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.050 align:middle line:84%
and the Monkey Learning Channel
that was teaching the monkeys.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.660 align:middle line:84%
So they wanted to make it
a little more mysterious,

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.010 align:middle line:90%
a little more ethereal.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.400 align:middle line:10%
So what they did was just
have it be completely starkly

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.985 align:middle line:10%
black, right?

00:04:04.985 --> 00:04:06.610 align:middle line:10%
And I almost get the
impression that it

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.560 align:middle line:10%
is kind of like an
advanced AI almost

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.420 align:middle line:10%
because it seems to have
this connection to HAL.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.040 align:middle line:10%
And we know that
in "3001" later on,

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.640 align:middle line:10%
HAL and Bowman become Halman.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.790 align:middle line:10%
And so there's that merger.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.480 align:middle line:10%
And that's what Nolan
does in "Interstellar"

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.930 align:middle line:10%
is he has the TARS, the AI
robot that actually looks

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.870 align:middle line:10%
like the monolith, and Bowman
kind of go into the tesseract

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:29.960 align:middle line:10%
together.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Eventually, in the movie,
our tools rebelled against us.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.715 align:middle line:84%
The AI, represented by HAL,
begins to kill the astronauts.

00:04:38.715 --> 00:04:40.840 align:middle line:10%
And Kubrick is definitely
saying that if we go down

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.710 align:middle line:10%
this path where we
let AI run our lives,

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.090 align:middle line:10%
it's going to be our end.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.230 align:middle line:84%
It's going to kill
us in the end.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.930 align:middle line:84%
So Bowman, eventually,
has to disconnect HAL

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.860 align:middle line:84%
from the spaceship, disconnect
himself from the AI.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And when he does that,
he goes into the monolith

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.780 align:middle line:84%
after he disconnects HAL and he
goes into an enlightened state,

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.930 align:middle line:84%
higher up evolved state, that
the aliens are taking him

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:08.770 align:middle line:90%
through.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And then he dies and
becomes a Star Child

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.540 align:middle line:84%
and goes back to
Earth, presumably

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.630 align:middle line:84%
to begin the process of
enlightenment on Earth.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think that there is a
direct connection that Kubrick

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.140 align:middle line:84%
is making between
the enslavement

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:28.960 align:middle line:84%
to robots and AI and the
rebellion against those robots

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.370 align:middle line:84%
connected to our own
advancement and enlightenment.

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.310 align:middle line:84%
>> The monolith represents
a form of alien AI.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.180 align:middle line:84%
Not only is its shape the same
as the shape around HAL's eye,

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.090 align:middle line:84%
but it's the same shape
as a Cinerama movie screen

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.730 align:middle line:90%
on which "2001" was projected.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.710 align:middle line:10%
So then the real
question is this,

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.620 align:middle line:10%
is the monolith in control
of the entire situation

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.480 align:middle line:10%
in the movie "2001?"

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.490 align:middle line:10%
If the monolith is an advanced
AI, did it infect HAL?

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.010 align:middle line:10%
>> When I first saw
the movie "2001,"

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.710 align:middle line:10%
the idea of a predatory AI
inside of the HAL computer was

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:03.760 align:middle line:10%
quite scary.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.370 align:middle line:10%
The reason why is
because the computer

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.320 align:middle line:10%
began to realize that
the human beings were

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.805 align:middle line:10%
talking about shutting it down.

00:06:09.805 --> 00:06:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that can really happen.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.540 align:middle line:84%
So the being in the
computer was actually

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.610 align:middle line:84%
able to read the lips
of the astronauts.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And when it thought that it was
talking about shutting it down,

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.590 align:middle line:84%
the being did not
want to die, just

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.020 align:middle line:84%
like any other sentient
being, and therefore it

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.790 align:middle line:90%
desired to eliminate the threat.

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.710 align:middle line:84%
So imagine the
potential of what that

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.810 align:middle line:90%
to be like in our own world.

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.150 align:middle line:84%
We see the same thing again
in the movie "Terminator"

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.610 align:middle line:84%
with Skynet in which
Skynet, obviously,

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.010 align:middle line:84%
has also turned against
us and believes we

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:37.780 align:middle line:90%
are a threat to his existence.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.560 align:middle line:10%
So with that potential
of surveillance--

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.250 align:middle line:10%
and AI can have access to
all things like cameras

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.710 align:middle line:10%
in our smartphones,
microphones--

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.690 align:middle line:10%
all it would have to do
is listen to one or two

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.020 align:middle line:10%
whispered conversations, like
the one in "2001," the movie,

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.580 align:middle line:10%
and it could conclude
that we propose

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.370 align:middle line:10%
a danger to his existence
and take drastic action

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.550 align:middle line:10%
to eliminate anyone and anything
that it perceives as a threat.

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.960 align:middle line:90%


00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Skynet, on the
day it's implemented,

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:08.040 align:middle line:84%
it reaches a logical conclusion
that it doesn't really need

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.820 align:middle line:84%
human beings, that it is far
superior to human beings,

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.400 align:middle line:84%
and that human beings are
actually like parasites.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And it launches a nuclear
war which destroys

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.410 align:middle line:90%
almost all life on the planet.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, it
creates the terminators

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.630 align:middle line:84%
to go out and finish
everybody off.

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.970 align:middle line:84%
So Skynet was
actually implemented,

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:30.880 align:middle line:84%
or a version of Skynet, by the
US military a long time ago.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And it actually
has been running.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:35.980 align:middle line:84%
Obama said he shut it
down, but really he didn't.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And so there is a
form of AI watching

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.100 align:middle line:84%
all of the nuclear weapons
programs, and satellites,

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.483 align:middle line:84%
and incoming objects,
like airplanes and things.

00:07:44.483 --> 00:07:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's watching
the whole thing.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:46.858 align:middle line:90%
So we actually have it.

00:07:46.858 --> 00:07:50.520 align:middle line:10%
It hasn't killed us
yet, but we have it.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:55.530 align:middle line:10%
>> "Blade Runner" was another
film about AI and robots.

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:57.150 align:middle line:10%
>> So what "Blade
Runner" is about,

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:02.370 align:middle line:10%
it goes much deeper than Philip
K Dick's story or "Do Androids

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:04.790 align:middle line:10%
Dream of Electric Sheep?"

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:08.990 align:middle line:10%
You're being presented with a
bunch of symbols and imagery

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:11.370 align:middle line:10%
that are ultimately
occultic in nature.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:12.950 align:middle line:10%
So for example,
Edward James almost

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:15.050 align:middle line:10%
plays the detective
who will constantly

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:20.330 align:middle line:10%
leave little symbols to Deckard
played by Harrison Ford.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.670 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, what
we find out is that--

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:24.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure everybody's seen it--

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:25.652 align:middle line:84%
but really Scott
even admitted this--

00:08:25.652 --> 00:08:27.480 align:middle line:90%
yes, Deckard is a replicant.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.730 align:middle line:90%
That's the point of the movie.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:29.690 align:middle line:90%
So you're watching it.

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And you're thinking
he's going to catch

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:36.020 align:middle line:84%
all of these rebel
robots running amok,

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.831 align:middle line:84%
but it's actually Deckard
who is the replicant.

00:08:38.831 --> 00:08:40.789 align:middle line:84%
And Edward James, almost
his character actually

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:42.380 align:middle line:90%
knows that he is.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's why he's leaving
him this trail of symbols

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.920 align:middle line:84%
that he's done with origami,
because it's triggering

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.560 align:middle line:84%
in Deckard's mind that
imprinting that he got

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.290 align:middle line:90%
from the Tyrell Corporation.

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a
journey of discovery

00:08:56.150 --> 00:09:00.590 align:middle line:84%
that Deckard learns
who he truly is.

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And in that view,
the presentation

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:07.190 align:middle line:84%
is that the AI
actually are superior.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's why Roy Batty, played
by Rutger Hauer, at the end

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:13.820 align:middle line:84%
is willing to die for
Deckard because they're

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:14.790 align:middle line:90%
one and the same.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.400 align:middle line:90%
They're both replicants.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.130 align:middle line:10%
And Roy Batty wants
to tell Deckard,

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:23.630 align:middle line:10%
after he's cited esoteric
poetry, from the artist who

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:27.080 align:middle line:10%
did "The Grand Architect"
painting, that famous painting

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.020 align:middle line:10%
of "The Grand Architect."

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:35.130 align:middle line:10%
>> "Fiery the angels fell,
deep thunder roll'd around

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:39.792 align:middle line:10%
their shore burnings
with the fires of Orc."

00:09:39.792 --> 00:09:41.970 align:middle line:84%
>> And he talks about
the elves, right?

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:44.660 align:middle line:84%
It's this poem about the fall
of the elves and the angels

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:45.460 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:48.410 align:middle line:84%
It's grand narrative
poetry that's cited.

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And what he's talking about,
he's saying that we as the AI

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.650 align:middle line:90%
are superior to the humans.

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:54.108 align:middle line:84%
They're not going
to understand it,

00:09:54.108 --> 00:09:56.530 align:middle line:84%
but we're the ones that are
going to go into the future.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:58.830 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I think
"Blade Runner" is about is

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:00.050 align:middle line:90%
about the warning of AI.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:01.470 align:middle line:10%
It's the warning
of transhumanism,

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:04.110 align:middle line:10%
that we could actually
be replaced by something

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:06.070 align:middle line:10%
synthetic in the future.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And on a deeper level,
metaphorical level,

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.900 align:middle line:84%
we already are
becoming synthetic.

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:12.600 align:middle line:90%
That's the point.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.330 align:middle line:84%
>> These Hollywood movies
seem to be warning us about

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.190 align:middle line:90%
artificial intelligence.

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:19.140 align:middle line:84%
But is there a
need to be worried?

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.720 align:middle line:84%
Where are they headed
with this research?

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Early on in my
public career in UFOs,

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:27.270 align:middle line:10%
I remembered reading Ray
Kurzweil's book "The Age

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:29.280 align:middle line:10%
of Spiritual Machines."

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.200 align:middle line:84%
That came out around
the turn of the century.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.100 align:middle line:90%
It's a great book.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And it was the first
really in-depth kind

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:40.470 align:middle line:90%
of looking to AI that I had.

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.795 align:middle line:84%
And I've ever since, I've
actually been looking into it

00:10:42.795 --> 00:10:46.170 align:middle line:84%
and thinking I think that
the UFO phenomenon has got

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:48.630 align:middle line:84%
to be in some
measure the product

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:51.300 align:middle line:84%
of an advanced
hyperintelligent AI,

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.180 align:middle line:84%
whether organic, inorganic,
or some combination thereof.

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:56.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, we can't
think of artificial intelligence

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:59.052 align:middle line:84%
simply as a series of
algorithms in a computer.

00:10:59.052 --> 00:11:01.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that's really
how it's going to end up.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:02.718 align:middle line:10%
I think what we're
talking about is

00:11:02.718 --> 00:11:06.390 align:middle line:10%
a combination of computer
programming that does,

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:07.560 align:middle line:10%
yes, become self-aware.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.070 align:middle line:10%
I think this is very
likely going to happen.

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:12.500 align:middle line:84%
Because all that
self-awareness requires

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:16.520 align:middle line:84%
it's a type of
organization of processes.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And we have that in our brain,
but there's literally nothing

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:24.150 align:middle line:84%
inherent about the same
thing not happening

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:25.720 align:middle line:90%
within a computer algorithm.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.460 align:middle line:84%
It's just processes of
one thing after another.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.570 align:middle line:90%
And self-awareness can happen.

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:33.120 align:middle line:90%
From chaos springs order.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.610 align:middle line:84%
But not simply
from an algorithm,

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:39.720 align:middle line:84%
but you have to keep in
mind genetic engineering.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Ray Kurzweil is
now working at Google.

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And he's investigating
the singularity

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:46.793 align:middle line:84%
which is this idea of the
fusion of human and machine.

00:11:46.793 --> 00:11:48.960 align:middle line:10%
This is something that has
been thoroughly addressed

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.140 align:middle line:10%
in our society.

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:52.170 align:middle line:10%
If you look at the
movie "The Matrix,"

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:56.610 align:middle line:10%
it poses the question is Neo a
program, a computer, or a man?

00:11:56.610 --> 00:12:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And is the program the junction
between man and machine?

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>> So if we look at the
film "The Matrix," 1999,

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:09.320 align:middle line:84%
we see that what it really is
is the entire film is about AI.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.550 align:middle line:90%
"The Matrix" itself is AI.

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And again, it was
invented and implemented.

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And it reached the conclusion
that the only thing

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.880 align:middle line:84%
that we're useful for is
our human life energy.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And so it begins sucking
off our life energy

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.250 align:middle line:84%
as if that's the only thing
that we're useful for.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:29.940 align:middle line:84%
So again, even the Wachowskis
reached this conclusion

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:32.070 align:middle line:84%
that once AI is
implemented, it's

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:34.240 align:middle line:90%
not going to be a good thing.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.380 align:middle line:10%
>> So "The Matrix" could
actually be like a program.

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.650 align:middle line:10%
Then the idea is that our
reality is "The Matrix"

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:44.490 align:middle line:10%
and that we are living in some
sort of holographic simulation.

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:46.140 align:middle line:10%
Who is controlling
the simulation

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.880 align:middle line:10%
and for what purpose?

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.530 align:middle line:10%
That we do not know.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:53.370 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a lot of AI
research that's going on behind

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:56.850 align:middle line:10%
the scenes that's being paid
for by somebody with deep, deep,

00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:58.730 align:middle line:10%
deep pockets.

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And they're being advised by
Raymond Kurzweil who is talking

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:09.370 align:middle line:84%
about the fact that
within 50 years, probably,

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:15.660 align:middle line:84%
the humans on Earth will be
about maybe 50%-80% robotic

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.670 align:middle line:90%
and the rest be biological.

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think they're
working that direction.

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the future,
what we're going to see,

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:28.410 align:middle line:84%
is a combination
of a human hybrid.

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:31.650 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going to be
some of the last old fashioned

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:33.710 align:middle line:90%
unenhanced Homo sapiens.

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:36.510 align:middle line:84%
What I think we're moving
into is a very scary world

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:38.520 align:middle line:84%
in which a very few
people, who can afford it,

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.920 align:middle line:90%
will be literally superhuman.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>> We are right now,
as most people know,

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:47.830 align:middle line:84%
on the very edge of
quantum computing and AI.

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:49.350 align:middle line:90%
We're right there right now.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:52.770 align:middle line:10%
And where they are going
to be implementing this--

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:55.250 align:middle line:10%
no matter what we do,
it's going to happen.

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:57.210 align:middle line:10%
And we have to ask
ourselves, what

00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:59.460 align:middle line:10%
is going to happen
when this occurs?

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:03.930 align:middle line:84%
We're already seeing odd
effects from quantum computing.

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:05.820 align:middle line:84%
People call it the
Mandela effect.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:09.660 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing odd breaks in the
past, things that are not--

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:12.810 align:middle line:84%
that we remember, are
not what we remember.

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.130 align:middle line:90%
They're changed.

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:18.250 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of people think that
that is a result of the quantum

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:19.050 align:middle line:10%
computing.

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:21.420 align:middle line:84%
The very little quantum
computing that's going on right

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:26.260 align:middle line:84%
now is actually causing breaking
holes in the dimensional walls.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.137 align:middle line:84%
And they're only tiny
holes now, but, you

00:14:29.137 --> 00:14:31.470 align:middle line:84%
know, who knows where this
is going to go in five years,

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:33.012 align:middle line:84%
because in five
years there are going

00:14:33.012 --> 00:14:35.880 align:middle line:84%
to be hundreds of quantum
computers everywhere.

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
see what happens.

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:39.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we could
even see a future

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.360 align:middle line:84%
where your social security
number is changed,

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.060 align:middle line:90%
things like that.

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.530 align:middle line:90%
So really fascinating subjects.

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>> So they'll have genetics that
will allow them to be stronger,

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:53.640 align:middle line:84%
longer lived, smarter, all of
these other things that will

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:55.290 align:middle line:90%
make them like gods.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And in addition to
that, they'll have

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.330 align:middle line:84%
some kind of connection, whether
through implants or something

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.500 align:middle line:84%
else, with a
hyperadvanced AI web

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.000 align:middle line:84%
that they'll be able
to participate in.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.558 align:middle line:84%
Or just like we have on our
hard drives and on the web,

00:15:09.558 --> 00:15:11.100 align:middle line:84%
we'll have our own
capabilities, they

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.800 align:middle line:84%
may have their own innate
AI capabilities that they

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:17.575 align:middle line:84%
have access To it's hard
for me to imagine this,

00:15:17.575 --> 00:15:19.200 align:middle line:84%
because it hasn't
happened, but I think

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.080 align:middle line:90%
that's what we're moving to.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And then I think
what's going to happen

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:22.740 align:middle line:84%
with the mass of
humanity, I think

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.990 align:middle line:84%
what they'll never allow is
for everyone to have this.

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:27.212 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to have a
kind of "Brave New World."

00:15:27.212 --> 00:15:28.170 align:middle line:90%
We're moving toward it.

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:29.330 align:middle line:90%
You can see it happening.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.560 align:middle line:84%
You have a very small
number of the new gods,

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:37.420 align:middle line:84%
the new owners of everything,
and the great excess of human.

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.090 align:middle line:84%
What's going to happen
with the excess?

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:41.010 align:middle line:84%
Some of them will be
dumbed-down even further so

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:42.510 align:middle line:84%
that they're happy
watching football,

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:43.927 align:middle line:84%
and they're dancing,
and whatever,

00:15:43.927 --> 00:15:45.610 align:middle line:90%
and all this nonsense.

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:48.930 align:middle line:10%
And some will be maybe custom
designed, and genetically

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:51.030 align:middle line:10%
designed, human beings
to certain types

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:52.460 align:middle line:10%
of specific tasks.

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:55.890 align:middle line:10%
That I really am afraid of
that happening in the future.

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:57.630 align:middle line:90%
I don't want that world.

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:00.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Many researchers have stated
that the existence of the human

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:03.120 align:middle line:84%
mind is fundamentally
energetic in nature.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.840 align:middle line:84%
We think that the
mind is in the brain,

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.030 align:middle line:90%
but that's actually not true.

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:09.360 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
Dr. Rupert Sheldrake

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.150 align:middle line:84%
reported on many studies
that state the mind is not

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:13.808 align:middle line:90%
a function of the brain.

00:16:13.808 --> 00:16:15.600 align:middle line:84%
This includes, of
course, the infamous work

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.870 align:middle line:84%
of Cambridge researcher Dr
John Lorber, who investigated

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:22.020 align:middle line:84%
many individuals that had no
brain tissue in their heads

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:24.660 align:middle line:84%
due to a condition called
water on the brain.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Which in many cases,
the brain tissues

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:29.670 align:middle line:84%
had been compressed to the
size of a slice of baloney.

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:32.523 align:middle line:10%
The brain matter is so thin you
could shine a light through it.

00:16:32.523 --> 00:16:34.440 align:middle line:10%
Even though these people
have no brain matter,

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:35.880 align:middle line:10%
they still have a high IQ.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.770 align:middle line:10%
As a matter of fact,
one of them graduated

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:40.830 align:middle line:10%
from Cambridge University
with a degree in mathematics.

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:42.390 align:middle line:90%
What is going on here?

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:44.340 align:middle line:84%
Fundamentally,
there is this idea

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:46.470 align:middle line:84%
that our address in the
universal energetic sense

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:48.170 align:middle line:90%
is not physically based.

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And it could be possible to
build a computer system that

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:54.660 align:middle line:84%
keeps a replica of the DNA which
contains a tuning fork that

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.470 align:middle line:90%
tunes into our address.

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that our
existence as a conscious,

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:02.860 align:middle line:84%
sentiment mind could exist
apart from any biological form

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:03.660 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And through that
simple DNA code that

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.589 align:middle line:84%
allows you to interface
with the machine,

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:09.300 align:middle line:84%
you can then actually
have the ability

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.540 align:middle line:84%
to exist and be fully
present in consciousness.

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.579 align:middle line:90%
Then the key is you need a body.

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:16.800 align:middle line:10%
And that body, by
necessity, would

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.900 align:middle line:10%
have to be some type of
machine because you're

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:21.780 align:middle line:10%
using that DNA as
only a tuning fork

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:24.270 align:middle line:10%
to interface with the great
technology that would, then,

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:27.960 align:middle line:10%
form the matrix for your
consciousness to inhabit.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.650 align:middle line:10%
>> I believe it's possible
to download the greater part

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:34.710 align:middle line:10%
of a person's personality,
and characteristics,

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:38.940 align:middle line:10%
and traits into a computer,
into a computer system.

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:42.705 align:middle line:84%
I know there are computer
systems that I've played around

00:17:42.705 --> 00:17:47.820 align:middle line:84%
with some high-speed computing
chips and devices that I have

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:51.220 align:middle line:84%
that it would be very
hard for me to tell.

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:54.430 align:middle line:90%
And I know what to look for.

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Ray Kurzweil's idea of a
singularity is actually quite

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:58.050 align:middle line:90%
frightening.

00:17:58.050 --> 00:17:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Because if you really
think about it,

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.470 align:middle line:84%
what happens if AI decides that
if a human gets out of line,

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:05.640 align:middle line:84%
it wants to put him back
online through threat,

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.712 align:middle line:84%
through injury, or maybe
even through death.

00:18:07.712 --> 00:18:10.170 align:middle line:84%
This is something that we have
to consider because AI could

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:12.690 align:middle line:90%
be in control at all times.

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Artificial intelligence
is a two-edged sword.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.790 align:middle line:84%
On one hand, it
could create a world

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:20.560 align:middle line:84%
that is much better than
the one we know today.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.100 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
it could control us.

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:26.790 align:middle line:84%
But what if AI has been with us
for much longer than we think?

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:30.120 align:middle line:84%
Linda Moulton Howe has been
investigating UFO activity

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.410 align:middle line:90%
for years.

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:35.070 align:middle line:84%
In 2007, she encountered
the dragonfly drones

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:38.250 align:middle line:84%
and an alien artificial
intelligence.

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:44.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Dragonfly drones is one of
those emergence of a mystery.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.430 align:middle line:10%
It started in 2007.

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:52.140 align:middle line:10%
And I remember, very clearly,
the first email that I got

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:54.840 align:middle line:10%
in my earthfiles.com computer.

00:18:54.840 --> 00:19:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And it was a MUFON photograph
of this very strange dragonfly

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:03.900 align:middle line:84%
thing over a cabin
house up in Lake Tahoe.

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.940 align:middle line:84%
I had never seen
anything like it.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:07.830 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have any
more information.

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:13.290 align:middle line:84%
But by the end of 2007, we were
being sent these images that

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:16.170 align:middle line:84%
started coming in from
person after person

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:19.260 align:middle line:84%
who was photographing
what appeared

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:24.030 align:middle line:84%
to have a ring in the front, a
long tail coming to the back,

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:28.080 align:middle line:84%
wires coming up out of the ring
like this, maybe 30 feet high

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:33.260 align:middle line:84%
some people estimated with
a body 25, 27 feet long.

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:36.280 align:middle line:90%
And the first one was simple.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.520 align:middle line:90%
The second one was more complex.

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.950 align:middle line:84%
Pretty soon it was
what is going on here?

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And then those first
words were May.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And by June, I got, in the mail,
12 glossy photographs taken up

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:55.702 align:middle line:90%
in Big Base in California.

00:19:55.702 --> 00:19:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And when I opened
up that envelope,

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.210 align:middle line:90%
I can still remember it.

00:19:58.210 --> 00:19:59.530 align:middle line:90%
I felt shock.

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:01.930 align:middle line:10%
There aren't many things
that just give you

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:03.150 align:middle line:10%
a feeling of shock.

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:04.280 align:middle line:90%
And these photos did.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And it was the most complex
of this evolution that

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:11.470 align:middle line:90%
had started in May of 2007.

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:14.950 align:middle line:84%
So there were these facets
of many different types

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:16.660 align:middle line:90%
of eyewitnesses.

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And then some people said
that they watched it spin.

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And then it would spin in
the opposite direction.

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And when it was spinning
they could not hear a sound,

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.850 align:middle line:90%
making it even more bizarre.

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And when I had the photos, I
put them up on earthfiles.com,

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:43.390 align:middle line:84%
all 12 in the highest
resolution that I could do.

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:48.190 align:middle line:10%
And within 24
hours, I got a call

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:52.810 align:middle line:10%
from a bullying male
saying, we demand that you

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:56.680 align:middle line:10%
take those photographs down.

00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And I said I'm not
taking them down.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, in that
struggle on the phone,

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:08.350 align:middle line:90%
I knew this is not a CGI ploy.

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:11.470 align:middle line:90%
This is not a Photoshop ploy.

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:16.570 align:middle line:84%
In June, after I had
gotten those photos,

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:20.820 align:middle line:84%
there was an email from a
man who called himself Isaac.

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And here unfolds, I
think, personally,

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:26.050 align:middle line:84%
one of the most
important whistleblower

00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:28.330 align:middle line:90%
leaks of my career.

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:31.660 align:middle line:10%
This extremely important
whistleblower leak

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:35.290 align:middle line:10%
contained a document that
had photos and texts in it

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:40.060 align:middle line:10%
about an extraterrestrial
technology, named as such.

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:41.980 align:middle line:10%
It was supposed to
have been developed

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:46.040 align:middle line:10%
in something called the
Palo Alto Laboratory in Palo

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.960 align:middle line:10%
Alto, California.

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:52.180 align:middle line:84%
He had worked personally
in this lab in the '80s.

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And the program was
called CARET, all caps--

00:21:56.260 --> 00:22:01.810 align:middle line:84%
Commercial Application Research
of Extraterrestrial Technology.

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And these scientists
were working underground

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:08.260 align:middle line:84%
in a building that, as
I understood from Isaac,

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:12.100 align:middle line:84%
would have looked like a
two-story library in Palo Alto

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:14.980 align:middle line:90%
on a leafy street with trees.

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And the truth was, just like so
many government programs that

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:22.450 align:middle line:84%
hide in plain sight,
If you had access

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:25.150 align:middle line:84%
to get into the
library-looking building,

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:30.160 align:middle line:84%
it went down floors and floors
and spread out underground.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:34.950 align:middle line:10%
And there were at least 200 or
300 scientists working there

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:37.420 align:middle line:10%
for the Department
of Defense that

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:40.450 align:middle line:10%
wanted to see if,
in the Palo Alto

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:44.680 align:middle line:10%
atmosphere of the development
of computers like Apple

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:49.750 align:middle line:10%
and so forth, that they could
accelerate scientists trying

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:53.860 align:middle line:10%
to figure out what
they called a language

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:56.650 align:middle line:10%
of these dragonfly drones.

00:22:56.650 --> 00:23:01.430 align:middle line:10%
Or, as Isaac said in
his communication,

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:04.000 align:middle line:10%
I am convinced that the
photographs that you

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.090 align:middle line:10%
are showing at earthfiles.com
is the same technology,

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:10.810 align:middle line:10%
now large and in
the air, that we

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:14.230 align:middle line:10%
were studying and back
engineering at this Palo Alto

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:16.970 align:middle line:10%
lab in the '80s.

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:20.450 align:middle line:10%
And I got to email
exchange with him

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:23.900 align:middle line:10%
a very long dialogue after
looking at the document.

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And I learned he had
become so frustrated,

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.440 align:middle line:84%
the fact that it was a
Department of Defense

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:31.460 align:middle line:90%
operation.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.280 align:middle line:90%
They had guns on them.

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.420 align:middle line:84%
The scientists were
basically treated

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:37.610 align:middle line:84%
like you do your
work in that corner

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:39.470 align:middle line:84%
and you can't go over
here and everything

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:41.270 align:middle line:90%
was compartmentalized.

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:45.200 align:middle line:84%
His job was to study
symbols that they called

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.110 align:middle line:90%
self-activating software.

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:51.710 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if you had an
8.5 by 11 sheet of paper.

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And it has been made with
a self-activating software.

00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:00.980 align:middle line:84%
All you would have to do
is look at the paper, think

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:05.960 align:middle line:84%
what you wanted, who you wanted
it to go to, what building,

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:06.890 align:middle line:90%
what country--

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:08.750 align:middle line:90%
it would not matter.

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:11.450 align:middle line:10%
You think it, the
paper from thereon--

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:15.590 align:middle line:10%
because it's self-activating
software designed never to have

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:18.590 align:middle line:10%
to need any person
or interface--

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:19.790 align:middle line:10%
will take off.

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:22.880 align:middle line:84%
It will accomplish everything
that you have thought.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And it will come back to
you when it has finished.

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:29.030 align:middle line:84%
That is self-activating
software.

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:34.040 align:middle line:10%
And Isaac explained, when
he sent these drawings

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:38.120 align:middle line:10%
and he sent the ones that
were in the document, a team

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.300 align:middle line:10%
of these engineers
and people like Isaac,

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.340 align:middle line:10%
who was a computer expert.

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:50.840 align:middle line:10%
They tried for 30 days to try
to duplicate with CRAYs what

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:54.980 align:middle line:10%
they had as extraterrestrial
self-activating software.

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.460 align:middle line:90%
And they still couldn't do it.

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:58.850 align:middle line:90%
They could not duplicate.

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:01.880 align:middle line:90%
It was infinitely complex.

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And he said, in one
of his communications,

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:09.950 align:middle line:84%
it is humbling as a
human computer engineer

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:13.280 align:middle line:84%
to realize that we were told
that the extraterrestrials

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:17.120 align:middle line:84%
responsible for these
machines and this craft

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:23.900 align:middle line:84%
could execute with their minds
these diagrams in second.

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:30.740 align:middle line:84%
I think that the drones are
a combination of technology

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:33.320 align:middle line:84%
in which humans
have been involved

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:37.090 align:middle line:84%
with the non-humans who are
the source and know about it

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:39.890 align:middle line:84%
and that we have a
series of collaborations

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:44.990 align:middle line:84%
between our American aerospace,
British aerospace, our allies

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:49.650 align:middle line:84%
of World War II, literally,
with non-human intelligence who

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:54.110 align:middle line:84%
have helped us get various
kinds of models of technology.

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And somebody was experimenting
with that dragonfly drone

00:25:57.650 --> 00:25:58.910 align:middle line:90%
in 2007.

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:00.660 align:middle line:90%
It was supposed to be invisible.

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:02.600 align:middle line:84%
It was supposed
to stay invisible.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:07.000 align:middle line:84%
It was supposed to be a
monitoring device in the skies.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.160 align:middle line:84%
Somebody was jamming
the frequencies

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:11.780 align:middle line:90%
that kept it invisible.

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:14.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it would
flicker in and out.

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:17.360 align:middle line:84%
Everybody who saw it said
it would flicker in and out.

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.640 align:middle line:90%
And that gave Isaac the key.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.050 align:middle line:90%
And that's what he wrote.

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:24.410 align:middle line:84%
I think that these
machines, why they

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:27.470 align:middle line:84%
are being seen right now
and with the description

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:30.290 align:middle line:84%
of flickering, that means
that there is somebody

00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:34.130 align:middle line:84%
in a military capacity who
is either experimenting with

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:37.820 align:middle line:84%
or knows that there are
frequencies that can jam

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:41.080 align:middle line:90%
the invisibility technology.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel that the
human-AI merger may not be

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:46.760 align:middle line:84%
an inevitability simply
because we have learned a lot

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:47.610 align:middle line:90%
of lessons.

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And just like a baby has
to crawl before it walks,

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:53.870 align:middle line:84%
when it starts to walk, it will
fall down a couple of times.

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:55.578 align:middle line:84%
And we're kind of in
that phase right now

00:26:55.578 --> 00:26:58.250 align:middle line:84%
where as we get up and begin to
walk, we're going to stumble.

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:01.100 align:middle line:84%
But every time you fall,
you remember-- the body,

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:03.160 align:middle line:84%
the brain remembers
what caused that fall.

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.760 align:middle line:90%
And it makes an adjustment.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.370 align:middle line:84%
So right now, we're
getting into AI technology.

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying to utilize it
to, basically, free mankind.

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:14.090 align:middle line:10%
Although there are some
benevolent and malevolent ways

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:16.910 align:middle line:10%
that it can work, I do truly
believe that eventually,

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:19.760 align:middle line:10%
in the long term, it will be
a very benevolent opportunity

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:22.100 align:middle line:10%
for mankind to expand
itself and give

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:25.070 align:middle line:10%
the freedom of the general
population to do work,

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:27.140 align:middle line:10%
do the arts, do other
things that they really

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:29.210 align:middle line:10%
would like to set
their hearts to and not

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:31.370 align:middle line:10%
be a slave to a lot of labor.

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:33.890 align:middle line:10%
I think it could make life
a lot easier on this planet

00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:35.535 align:middle line:10%
if it's used in the right way.

00:27:35.535 --> 00:27:37.160 align:middle line:10%
And it's a potential
that we eventually

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:40.250 align:middle line:10%
will walk, and then also
run, and become a Type 1

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:41.834 align:middle line:10%
and Type 2 civilization.

00:27:41.834 --> 00:27:44.500 align:middle line:90%


00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>> We are discovering
a larger universe.

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And that same larger
universe is discovering us.

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:54.380 align:middle line:84%
The alien presence on our planet
is the greatest mystery of all.

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:57.380 align:middle line:84%
It forces us to ask questions
like why do they keep

00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:59.420 align:middle line:90%
their presence secret from us?

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:03.320 align:middle line:84%
Why are they not helping
humanity in an open way?

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.970 align:middle line:84%
These questions
and others will be

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:07.850 align:middle line:84%
examined in our next
episode of "Deep Space--

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:10.630 align:middle line:90%
Aliens and Cover-Ups."

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:13.000 align:middle line:90%
