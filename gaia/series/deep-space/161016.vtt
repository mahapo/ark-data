There have been many
theories put forth as

to why he was killed.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.390 align:middle line:84%
Some say that he threatened
the Federal Reserve by daring

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.940 align:middle line:84%
to print money not backed
by the central bank.

[GUNFIRE]

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.210 align:middle line:84%
But there are other
intriguing reasons why

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.230 align:middle line:90%
Kennedy was murdered that day.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.720 align:middle line:10%
There are few who know
that Kennedy was intimately

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.220 align:middle line:10%
involved in the beginnings
of the secret space program.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.180 align:middle line:10%
>> I think JFK was very
knowledgeable about secret

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.930 align:middle line:10%
space programs.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.060 align:middle line:84%
I know that he was very close
with the first Secretary

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.980 align:middle line:90%
of Defense, James Forrestal.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.220 align:middle line:10%
In fact, he actually
was Forrestal guest

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.440 align:middle line:10%
on a trip to Germany in
1945, in July and August,

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.390 align:middle line:10%
where Kennedy was approached
by Forrestal to accompany him

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.080 align:middle line:10%
on the trip, because Forrestal
wanted to recruit Kennedy

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.090 align:middle line:10%
to his personal staff.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Over the years, a lot of data
has surfaced suggesting that,

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.410 align:middle line:10%
when he was president, John F.
Kennedy was briefed on the UFO

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.520 align:middle line:84%
subject by the intelligence
community, by the military,

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.860 align:middle line:84%
as to what they knew about UFO
sightings, possibly abductions,

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.740 align:middle line:84%
UFO crashes, what really
happened at Roswell.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And that would make sense
that when somebody achieves

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.980 align:middle line:84%
the position of
President, essentially

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.370 align:middle line:84%
the Commander in Chief,
they would be briefed

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.150 align:middle line:90%
on this particular subject.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And actually, in his
posthumously published book,

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.210 align:middle line:84%
called "Prelude to
Leadership," Kennedy, in there,

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.410 align:middle line:84%
describes being taken to see
some of the advanced maritime

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.870 align:middle line:84%
facilities that the
Nazis had developed.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And he saw the production
of the submarine fleets.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.350 align:middle line:10%
And this was something that was
very significant, because it

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.020 align:middle line:10%
was many of these
German submarines, that

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.260 align:middle line:10%
were used to transport
equipment and personnel over

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.720 align:middle line:10%
to Antarctica for the secret
space program down there.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And also, some of
these submarines--

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.250 align:middle line:84%
some early attempts were made
to retrofit these submarines

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.830 align:middle line:84%
with some kind of
anti-gravity technology.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Because a submarine,
because it's

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.330 align:middle line:84%
designed to be able
to go into the water,

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.395 align:middle line:84%
is a technology that could
be easily deployed into space

00:03:28.395 --> 00:03:31.930 align:middle line:84%
if you just replace
the propeller system.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.190 align:middle line:84%
You replace that with some
kind of anti-gravity device,

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.660 align:middle line:84%
and then you actually
have the technology

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.880 align:middle line:84%
that could actually
lift a submarine out

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.640 align:middle line:90%
of the ocean, up into space.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.760 align:middle line:84%
So this was the sort of thing
that was being kind of like

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.720 align:middle line:90%
developed in Germany.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And later on, I know that the
US Navy did the same thing

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.970 align:middle line:90%
in the 1970s.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.960 align:middle line:10%
They actually converted some
of the nuclear attack-class

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.100 align:middle line:10%
submarines, the Nautilus, into
these early space prototype

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.000 align:middle line:10%
vehicles that could use to
understand how the Navy could

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.060 align:middle line:10%
actually deploy ships in space.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.470 align:middle line:84%
John F. Kennedy
entered politics,

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.190 align:middle line:84%
but he was still very
close to Forrestal.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.750 align:middle line:84%
Forrestal and he were
still in communication.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.589 align:middle line:84%
And Forrestal, towards
the end of his term

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:20.390 align:middle line:84%
as Secretary of
Defense, actually he

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.940 align:middle line:84%
was sacked, because
he broke ranks.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.520 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to reveal
what was going on,

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.940 align:middle line:84%
because he realized that
the secrecy system was going

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.590 align:middle line:90%
to be perpetuated indefinitely.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.212 align:middle line:84%
And he was strongly
against that.

00:04:33.212 --> 00:04:34.670 align:middle line:84%
He realized that
this was something

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.430 align:middle line:90%
that could lead to great abuse.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And so he began sharing
that information

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.880 align:middle line:84%
with any congressmen
that would listen.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And one of the people
that he shared that with

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.420 align:middle line:90%
was with Kennedy.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And so, when Kennedy
became President,

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.180 align:middle line:84%
he wanted to get access
to that information

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.180 align:middle line:84%
and eventually assert
presidential control.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's what led to
the big confrontation

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.850 align:middle line:90%
with the Majestic 12 group.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, James Forrestal,
he was in a minority.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.950 align:middle line:84%
He basically wanted to
reveal what was going on.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.930 align:middle line:84%
Other members in the
Majestic 12 group

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.540 align:middle line:84%
basically saw Forrestal
as a loose cannon.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And so, Truman, on the advice
of the Majestic 12 committee,

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.800 align:middle line:84%
sent Forrestal, as the
Secretary of Defense--

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.360 align:middle line:84%
and basically, rather than
allow Forrestal to go public

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.580 align:middle line:84%
with what he knew,
they had Forrestal

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.510 align:middle line:84%
committed to the Bethesda
Naval medical facility.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And they had him confined
in on the 16th floor.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
during his confinement

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.610 align:middle line:84%
was that Forrestal
wasn't allowed

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:42.650 align:middle line:84%
to be visited by his advisors,
such as a Catholic priest

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.780 align:middle line:84%
that Forrestal was close
to and he confided with.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.730 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't allowed to
be visited by family.

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:51.950 align:middle line:10%
And his brother,
Henry Forrestal,

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.460 align:middle line:10%
wasn't allowed to
see Forrestal at all.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And what we know is, that during
his confinement at Bethesda

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.390 align:middle line:84%
Naval facility, he was visited
by a number of Majestic 12

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:04.190 align:middle line:90%
members.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.720 align:middle line:90%
Sidney Souers was one of them.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And one that people probably
aren't familiar with

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.770 align:middle line:84%
is Lyndon Baines Johnson, that
he actually visited Forrestal,

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.280 align:middle line:84%
because Johnson, at
that time in 1949,

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.100 align:middle line:84%
was working for the
Majestic 12 committee.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:24.050 align:middle line:84%
He was basically there to
give Forrestal the bad news.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And then, shortly after that,
on the very day that Forrestal's

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:32.150 align:middle line:84%
brother was supposed to come
in and collect James Forrestal,

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:37.310 align:middle line:84%
in May of 1949, Forrestal
supposedly commits suicide

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.340 align:middle line:84%
and kind of falls from the 16th
floor of the Bethesda Naval

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:42.140 align:middle line:90%
facility.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.460 align:middle line:90%
And he's dead.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.160 align:middle line:84%
But there have been
a number of people

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.750 align:middle line:84%
who were there at the event
and saw what Forrestal's body--

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.150 align:middle line:84%
and were familiar with the
circumstances leading up

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:54.830 align:middle line:90%
to Forrestal's death.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And they said it wasn't,
by any means, a suicide.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.990 align:middle line:84%
It was a hit job, and
the Majestic 12 group

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.840 align:middle line:90%
were behind it.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.030 align:middle line:90%


00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.740 align:middle line:10%
>> So, when I look at
Kennedy's public attempt to go

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:10.990 align:middle line:10%
to the moon, the Apollo
program that he devised--

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Altitude 1400 feet,
still looking very good.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.280 align:middle line:84%
>> --what I see is a president
who came into power knowing

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.240 align:middle line:84%
about aliens, knowing about
UFOs, wanting to find out more,

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.970 align:middle line:84%
found himself blocked by
the national security state,

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.820 align:middle line:84%
the CIA, the NSA,
Majestic 12, and said, OK,

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:30.820 align:middle line:84%
you guys are going to
tell me what you're doing,

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.580 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to tell
me what you're up to?

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:33.010 align:middle line:90%
F you.

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:34.330 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm going to do?

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.510 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to create my own
public space program, which

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.370 align:middle line:10%
is going to have a
secret purpose, which

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.180 align:middle line:10%
is going to go to the moon and
retrieve the technology that we

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.050 align:middle line:10%
know is there.

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.980 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to build
our own secret space fleet.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Man, in his quest for
knowledge and progress,

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.890 align:middle line:84%
is determined and
cannot be deterred.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.890 align:middle line:84%
The exploration of
space will go ahead.

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:59.750 align:middle line:90%
We choose to go to the moon.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:01.150 align:middle line:90%

and do the other things,
not because they are easy,

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:15.390 align:middle line:90%
but because they are hard.

00:08:17.875 --> 00:08:20.068 align:middle line:90%


00:08:20.068 --> 00:08:21.610 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a really
interesting memo.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:23.160 align:middle line:90%
It's called the burn memo.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And in the burn memo,
there's a sentence

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:26.095 align:middle line:90%
that's very, very chilling.

00:08:26.095 --> 00:08:29.900 align:middle line:84%
It says, of course Lancer
has been inquiring about

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:33.169 align:middle line:84%
our activities, which is
something we cannot allow.

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:35.867 align:middle line:84%
Lancer was JFK's Secret
Service nickname.

00:08:35.867 --> 00:08:37.534 align:middle line:84%
So what they're saying
there, basically,

00:08:37.534 --> 00:08:42.020 align:middle line:84%
is that JFK is trying to ask us
about what our activities are,

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.320 align:middle line:84%
which involve aliens and UFOs,
and we cannot allow this.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.410 align:middle line:84%
When they say, we cannot allow,
that implies they're going

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:49.510 align:middle line:90%
to do something about it.

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.930 align:middle line:90%


00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:56.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there any connections
between possible secret space

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.960 align:middle line:90%
programs and President Kennedy?

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.930 align:middle line:84%
Some evidence suggests
that there is.

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:05.020 align:middle line:84%
In June of 1947, a
strange occurrence

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:08.560 align:middle line:84%
happened in the Pacific
Northwest of the United States.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, the Maury Island
Incident is one of the early,

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:15.160 align:middle line:10%
important, very
interesting, controversial,

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:19.240 align:middle line:10%
engaging UFO incidents that
we have in our history.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.150 align:middle line:10%
So it was in June of 1947.

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:25.120 align:middle line:10%
This is right around the
time of the Kenneth Arnold

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.850 align:middle line:10%
famous sighting of the
so-called flying saucers.

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:29.650 align:middle line:10%
In the immediate
aftermath of that,

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:32.260 align:middle line:10%
at Maury Island in the state
of Washington, occurred

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.305 align:middle line:10%
and incident that to
this day, you know,

00:09:34.305 --> 00:09:36.430 align:middle line:10%
you've got different people
with different opinions

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:37.690 align:middle line:10%
on what happened there.

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:39.065 align:middle line:84%
But according to
the story, there

00:09:39.065 --> 00:09:41.740 align:middle line:84%
was a fisherman by name of
Harold Dahl who was in a boat.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:45.790 align:middle line:10%
He claimed to have seen a number
of aerial objects above him,

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:49.270 align:middle line:10%
one of which was in, what
looked like, trouble,

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:54.550 align:middle line:10%
struggling, dropped slag,
or something like slag,

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:56.070 align:middle line:10%
into the water.

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>> And he said that
these five craft--

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:02.050 align:middle line:84%
aerial craft that
are round-shaped,

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:04.960 align:middle line:84%
but had like a hole in
the center of them--

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:09.190 align:middle line:84%
that were above the water where
they were in Washington State.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And, all of a
sudden, this debris

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.865 align:middle line:84%
started falling
out of one of them.

00:10:14.865 --> 00:10:16.240 align:middle line:10%
There were five
of them that were

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.790 align:middle line:10%
all around this other one that
was in the center, this larger

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:19.590 align:middle line:10%
one.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And the Air Force base sent
two people to investigate this.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And these two
fishermen guys said

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.740 align:middle line:84%
that they turned over some
of the debris to them.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And these two-- A Lieutenant
and Captain, I believe,

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:36.070 align:middle line:84%
in the Air Force that
were assigned to do this

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:39.250 align:middle line:84%
investigation-- and they were
taking some of these materials

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:43.555 align:middle line:84%
back to the Air Force base
in a B-25, and it crashed--

00:10:43.555 --> 00:10:45.728 align:middle line:90%
[EXPLOSION]

00:10:45.728 --> 00:10:47.144 align:middle line:90%
--and killed them.

00:10:47.144 --> 00:10:50.460 align:middle line:90%


00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the main
people involved,

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.570 align:middle line:84%
connected to Harold Dahl, was
a guy named Fred Chrisman.

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Chrisman, I think, was one of
the paperclip people brought

00:10:58.410 --> 00:10:59.850 align:middle line:90%
over after the war.

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:03.990 align:middle line:10%
>> When they came across
mentions of Fred Chrisman

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:08.310 align:middle line:10%
in the Kennedy assassination
investigation conducted by Jim

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:11.590 align:middle line:10%
Garrison in New Orleans,
I started to think, well,

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:12.750 align:middle line:10%
wait a minute, what-- what?

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:13.980 align:middle line:10%
Chrisman was Maury Island.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.860 align:middle line:10%
What's he doing as a suspect
in the Kennedy assassination?

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.150 align:middle line:90%
>> In addition to that--

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:21.900 align:middle line:84%
as a little bit of a follow
up by Kenneth Arnold himself--

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Kenneth Arnold was always
a very reliable individual.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.110 align:middle line:84%
I think everyone who met
him felt this way about him.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:31.440 align:middle line:10%
And Arnold was given
a little bit of money

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:37.530 align:middle line:10%
by Ray Palmer of "Fate Magazine"
to do an investigative piece

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.180 align:middle line:10%
on Maury Island.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:41.970 align:middle line:84%
So Kenneth Arnold goes
to, I think, Tacoma,

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:44.310 align:middle line:84%
Washington to set
up his investigation

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:46.795 align:middle line:84%
and look into all of
this, meet the players.

00:11:46.795 --> 00:11:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And Kenneth Arnold-- and he
wrote about this in his book,

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:50.337 align:middle line:90%
"The Coming of the Saucers."

00:11:50.337 --> 00:11:54.840 align:middle line:84%
Kenneth Arnold said, my hotel
room was bugged, wiretapped.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.042 align:middle line:90%
We were monitored.

00:11:56.042 --> 00:11:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And, indeed, there
were a few things that

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:59.345 align:middle line:90%
would lend credence to that.

00:11:59.345 --> 00:12:00.710 align:middle line:90%
[CLICK]

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:03.920 align:middle line:84%
>> There was too many moving
parts for Maury Island.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.720 align:middle line:10%
And I'm looking at
it, and I'm suspecting

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.310 align:middle line:10%
that Harold Dahl at first
said, oh, yeah, the UFO

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:12.110 align:middle line:10%
phone exploded, killed
my dog, wounded my son,

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:13.490 align:middle line:10%
and all these other things.

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:15.960 align:middle line:10%
And then, later, he seemed
to retract all of that,

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.180 align:middle line:10%
which meant it was a hoax.

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:20.210 align:middle line:84%
But then, at the very
end, his widow is saying,

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:21.560 align:middle line:90%
no, it actually happened.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And he changed his story
because he felt he had to.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.720 align:middle line:84%
There was too much
light going on him.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.280 align:middle line:84%
There was too much
attention being paid.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And then, those two
guys on the airplane--

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:37.970 align:middle line:84%
and then, Chrisman pops up
in the 60s, 20 years later,

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:40.370 align:middle line:84%
as a suspect in the
Kennedy assassination.

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:43.490 align:middle line:84%
So I'm looking at
this, and I'm thinking,

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:45.050 align:middle line:84%
what's the connective
tissue here?

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:47.080 align:middle line:90%
This is too bizarre.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And so I start looking at
the UFO reports of the 1940s,

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:52.220 align:middle line:90%
at the post-war period.

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:55.850 align:middle line:10%
And then I find Guy Banister
name all over everything.

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:58.610 align:middle line:10%
You know, and Guy Banister was
another suspect in the Kennedy

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:01.220 align:middle line:10%
assassination
conspiracy by Garrison.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:05.990 align:middle line:84%
So Guy Banister, I have
the copies of his telexes

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:09.780 align:middle line:84%
and his airtels going back
to Hoover directly on,

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:13.910 align:middle line:84%
you know, subject matter
X. And this is the X files.

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:15.440 align:middle line:90%
This is the origin of it.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And these are X
files, the UFO reports

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:20.600 align:middle line:84%
were marked X and with
his initials, WCB,

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.965 align:middle line:84%
or with Guy Banister
or Banister.

00:13:22.965 --> 00:13:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, well, I
know Guy Banister for sure.

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:29.600 align:middle line:84%
He possibly was Oswald's
handler during the assassination

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.250 align:middle line:90%
conspiracy in New Orleans.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:34.310 align:middle line:10%
>> So, what you have is a
situation where something

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:36.230 align:middle line:10%
happened or seemed
to have happened,

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:40.190 align:middle line:10%
that did get the attention of
the intelligence community,

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:43.670 align:middle line:10%
that involved some
very shady characters--

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:45.670 align:middle line:10%
we're thinking Fred Chrisman--

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:49.250 align:middle line:10%
that involve the deaths of two
US military personnel, that

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:54.230 align:middle line:10%
was a UFO story
that, to this day,

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:56.750 align:middle line:10%
I don't really know if we've
got a definitive answer on what

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:58.005 align:middle line:10%
that was all about.

00:13:58.005 --> 00:13:59.630 align:middle line:84%

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:26.680 align:middle line:84%
These were people
who seemed to have

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:30.610 align:middle line:84%
very interesting connections to
the world of US intelligence,

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:33.390 align:middle line:84%
as well as to the
assassination of the President.

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And so, yeah, Garrison
was a guy who,

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:37.930 align:middle line:84%
by everything that
I've been able to see,

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:41.470 align:middle line:84%
really had true integrity
and some serious bravery

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:44.650 align:middle line:84%
to go after the system the
way he did and basically stand

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:49.090 align:middle line:84%
alone in the 1960s to look
at JFK's assassination.

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:51.760 align:middle line:84%
>> The connection of people
heavily involved in what could

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.570 align:middle line:84%
possibly be an early secret
space program accident at Maury

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:59.140 align:middle line:84%
island, with Jim Garrison's
investigation into the murder

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:03.230 align:middle line:84%
of John F. Kennedy, does
raise a lot of concerns.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.530 align:middle line:84%
It seems that Fred Chrisman
must have been working

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:07.750 align:middle line:90%
for an intelligence agency.

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:11.740 align:middle line:84%
It's as if we're witnessing
some kind of secret covert war

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:17.060 align:middle line:84%
that involves covering up UFOs
and the secret space program.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.920 align:middle line:10%
>> I think Kennedy's speech
of getting man to the moon

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:26.380 align:middle line:10%
in 1961, I think that was
something that he believed was

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:30.580 align:middle line:10%
important to kind of like begin
the process for colonization

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.110 align:middle line:10%
of space.

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:33.670 align:middle line:84%
I think Kennedy was
aware that there

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:38.140 align:middle line:84%
were a lot of programs
around that were using

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:39.580 align:middle line:90%
more advanced technologies.

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:42.280 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless, he realized
that rocket technology

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.350 align:middle line:84%
could still play
an important role

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:46.330 align:middle line:90%
in the colonization of space.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And Kennedy was a Navy
man, as was Forrestal.

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And Kennedy was basically
working with the Navy hierarchy

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:57.950 align:middle line:84%
in implementing the Apollo
program which had four stages.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:00.510 align:middle line:84%
The first stage was to
get man to the moon.

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:03.947 align:middle line:84%
>> That's one
small step for man,

00:17:03.947 --> 00:17:08.369 align:middle line:90%
one giant leap for mankind.

00:17:08.369 --> 00:17:12.069 align:middle line:84%
>> And that was critical for
just kind of getting people

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:16.359 align:middle line:84%
to accept that we can become
a space colonizing power.

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:19.690 align:middle line:84%
The second stage was to
establish five Navy bases

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:23.160 align:middle line:84%
on the moon, with a total
of 10,000 Navy personnel.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.849 align:middle line:10%
There was going to be a rocket
developed after the Saturn V.

00:17:25.849 --> 00:17:27.432 align:middle line:10%
It was going to be
much more powerful.

00:17:27.432 --> 00:17:28.750 align:middle line:10%
It was called the Nova rocket.

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:33.370 align:middle line:10%
And the Nova had 10 times the
payload of the Saturn V rocket.

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:37.200 align:middle line:10%
So you could deliver 10 times
as much equipment, resources,

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.240 align:middle line:10%
and people to whatever
your destination was.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.970 align:middle line:10%
So the Nova rocket
was going to be

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:45.390 align:middle line:10%
part of stage two of
establishing these Navy

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:46.980 align:middle line:10%
bases on the moon.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:48.900 align:middle line:10%
And then, the third
stage was going

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:53.540 align:middle line:10%
to be the colonization of Mars,
some of the moons of Jupiter,

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:57.150 align:middle line:10%
anything in the asteroid belt
that could be a suitable place

00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:58.410 align:middle line:10%
to establish a colony.

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:03.570 align:middle line:10%
That was going to be stage
three of the Apollo program.

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And then, stage
four, basically being

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:10.470 align:middle line:84%
able to develop a deep space,
interstellar-capable craft.

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:15.810 align:middle line:84%
That's when the development of
these anti-gravity technologies

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:16.900 align:middle line:90%
would have been completed.

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:20.010 align:middle line:84%
So that was seen to happen
sometime in the '70s and '80s.

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:21.340 align:middle line:90%
That was the projection.

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:25.050 align:middle line:10%
So Kennedy's Apollo
program was really

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:29.040 align:middle line:10%
a small part of this much
more elaborate Navy--

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:35.040 align:middle line:10%
very ambitious Navy program to
basically project Naval power

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.650 align:middle line:10%
deep into space.

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And so Kennedy basically
got the ball rolling

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:40.800 align:middle line:90%
with the Apollo mission.

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:45.900 align:middle line:90%


00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.830 align:middle line:84%
I think Kennedy was
assassinated for similar reasons

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:52.650 align:middle line:84%
to Forrestal in terms of
this information concerning

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:55.410 align:middle line:84%
secret space programs,
extraterrestrial technologies,

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:58.610 align:middle line:84%
and alien life
visiting our world.

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And we see this kind of
like towards the very end

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:04.580 align:middle line:84%
of Kennedy's
administration when,

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:08.810 align:middle line:84%
on November 12, 1963, 10 days
before the assassination,

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:12.110 align:middle line:84%
Kennedy reached an agreement
with Nikita Khrushchev,

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:14.450 align:middle line:84%
the Soviet Premier,
where they would

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:17.210 align:middle line:90%
do joint missions to the moon.

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And to do so, Kennedy
instructed NASA

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:23.510 align:middle line:84%
to cooperate with
the Soviet Union

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:27.140 align:middle line:84%
and share all information
concerning space.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:31.190 align:middle line:84%
But, in both cases, the
Majestic 12 group basically

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:33.230 align:middle line:90%
had Kennedy assassinated.

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Lyndon Johnson was a
key player in that.

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And also, Majestic 12 had
Forrestal assassinated.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.527 align:middle line:84%
And, again, Lyndon Johnson
was a key player in that.

00:19:42.527 --> 00:19:43.327 align:middle line:90%
[GUNSHOT]

00:19:43.327 --> 00:19:46.310 align:middle line:90%


00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:48.890 align:middle line:84%
>> As we advance our
understanding of the events

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:52.700 align:middle line:84%
that occurred on
November 22, 1963,

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:55.250 align:middle line:84%
we begin to see that many
of the players involved

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:58.730 align:middle line:84%
in the assassination of the
President of the United States

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:01.400 align:middle line:84%
were also involved in
the aerospace industry,

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.070 align:middle line:90%
in particular, Bell Helicopter.

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:05.366 align:middle line:10%
[WHIRRING]

00:20:05.366 --> 00:20:06.230 align:middle line:10%


00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:08.360 align:middle line:10%
As we untangle
the web of deceit,

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.540 align:middle line:10%
it becomes apparent that
there are very powerful forces

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:14.930 align:middle line:10%
within various communities,
including NASA, that

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:18.230 align:middle line:10%
wanted JFK [GUNSHOT] killed.

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:22.460 align:middle line:84%
One woman with deep associations
with JFK's assassination

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:25.010 align:middle line:84%
was a novelist from
Boston, who had friends

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:28.580 align:middle line:84%
high up in Washington,
DC's access of power.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:30.740 align:middle line:90%
Her name was Mary Bancroft.

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:33.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Mary Bancroft was the BFF--

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:36.200 align:middle line:84%
was the best friend
forever of a woman

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:40.010 align:middle line:90%
called Ruth Forbes Paine Young.

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:43.750 align:middle line:84%
The aggressively married
Ruth Forbes Paine Young--

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:45.860 align:middle line:84%
who had a series
of husbands-- she

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:48.950 align:middle line:84%
married someone called Paine
who was kind of a Trotskyite.

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And then she married
Arthur Young.

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And Arthur Young
was the inventor

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.740 align:middle line:90%
of the Bell Helicopter.

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:55.570 align:middle line:84%
He was very much
involved in part

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:57.700 align:middle line:84%
of the military
industrial complex.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.460 align:middle line:10%
But he walked away from it
at the end of World War II

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:04.630 align:middle line:10%
and devoted himself entirely
to the study of the paranormal,

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:07.045 align:middle line:10%
of Asian religions,
and mysticism, and ESP,

00:21:07.045 --> 00:21:09.340 align:middle line:10%
and telekinesis, and
all of these things.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:13.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Ruth Forbes Paine Young had
a brother named Michael who

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:15.220 align:middle line:90%
worked at Bell Helicopter.

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:18.820 align:middle line:84%
Michael's wife also happened
to be named Ruth Paine.

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:21.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'm reading the Warren
Commission testimony of a woman

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:27.220 align:middle line:84%
called Ruth Paine, who lived
in Texas, a Quaker lady who,

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:31.180 align:middle line:84%
according to all reports,
was trying to learn Russian,

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:33.010 align:middle line:90%
the Russian language.

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And, lo and behold, she comes
across a friend of hers,

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.660 align:middle line:90%
George de Mohrenschildt.

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And de Mohrenschildt
says, you know,

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:42.350 align:middle line:84%
I should introduce you to
somebody who's been to Russia.

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And he has a Russian
wife and introduces

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:49.660 align:middle line:84%
Ruth Paine to Lee Harvey
Oswald and Marina Oswald.

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.300 align:middle line:84%
Ruth Paine's brother
was Michael Paine.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:55.030 align:middle line:84%
Michael Paine knew Lee
Harvey Oswald also.

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Took him, actually, I
think, to an ACLU meeting,

00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:59.510 align:middle line:84%
if I'm not mistaken,
things like that.

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:02.890 align:middle line:84%
So he was trying to get Lee "out
of his shell," quote unquote.

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:05.830 align:middle line:84%
Michael Paine was
working for Bell

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:07.870 align:middle line:84%
which was Arthur
Young's old company

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:09.640 align:middle line:90%
that he no longer worked for.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:13.360 align:middle line:84%
But the man who was sort of on
the board of directors of Bell

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.100 align:middle line:90%
was Walter Dornberger.

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And Walter
Dornberger, of course,

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:19.960 align:middle line:84%
was a famous Nazi general
involved with Peenemünde--

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.330 align:middle line:84%
not involved with it,
running Peenemünde--

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:25.030 align:middle line:84%
was called over by
the US government

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:29.590 align:middle line:84%
under Operation Paperclip, a
rabid Nazi by all accounts.

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:32.200 align:middle line:84%
American intelligence, the
Counterintelligence Corps--

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.380 align:middle line:84%
CIC-- of the Army begged
them not to take Dornberger,

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:36.730 align:middle line:90%
because he was such a Nazi.

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.150 align:middle line:90%
But we didn't care.

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:38.950 align:middle line:90%
We hired him.

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:40.000 align:middle line:90%
We brought him over.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.840 align:middle line:10%
And we brought him to
Wright Field July of 1947,

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.185 align:middle line:10%
as the Roswell debris was
allegedly being brought.

00:22:46.185 --> 00:22:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think, we
know for sure, it

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.020 align:middle line:84%
was being brought to Wright
Field in July of '47.

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And there's Walter
Dornberger, in his civvies,

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.190 align:middle line:90%
waiting for the shipment.

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:58.600 align:middle line:84%
So Oswald, now, is
basically in the sphere

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.750 align:middle line:90%
of influence of Ruth Paine.

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And, ostensibly, because
Ruth wants to learn Russian.

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:07.570 align:middle line:84%
So Marina Oswald
stays with Ruth.

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And Marina also
already has a child.

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.260 align:middle line:84%
And she's expecting
her second child.

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.880 align:middle line:90%
She's staying with Ruth Paine.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:15.550 align:middle line:84%
Lee Oswald comes in and out
of the picture, staying there

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:17.800 align:middle line:90%
sometimes, sometimes not.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.740 align:middle line:90%
And then Ruth gets him a job.

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:24.100 align:middle line:84%
Ruth has a friend who has
a friend, maybe an uncle--

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- at the Texas
School Book Depository.

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:30.670 align:middle line:84%
So Ruth Paine arranges for Lee
to get this job at the Texas

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:32.410 align:middle line:90%
School Book Depository.

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:36.850 align:middle line:10%
In August/September
of 1963, Ruth Paine

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:42.880 align:middle line:10%
travels to visit Arthur Young
and Ruth Forbes Paine Young.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.310 align:middle line:84%
She goes to visit
Arthur and Ruth.

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:47.620 align:middle line:84%
She had to have
discussed with them

00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:51.320 align:middle line:84%
the fact that she has Russian
defectors living in her house.

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And, as I'm looking through
the Warren Commission

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:56.800 align:middle line:84%
testimony of Ruth Paine,
on the board, listening

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.390 align:middle line:84%
to her as she's
giving her testimony,

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:00.990 align:middle line:84%
is all the usual suspects,
plus Allen Dulles,

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:02.830 align:middle line:84%
who's a part of the
Warren Commission.

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:05.730 align:middle line:84%
Ruth Paine is talking about
how Lee got to her house,

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:06.620 align:middle line:90%
how Marina--

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:07.420 align:middle line:90%
all these things.

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:09.250 align:middle line:90%
She's going into the story.

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And then she starts
to talk about her trip

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.170 align:middle line:90%
to visit Arthur Young.

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:17.200 align:middle line:84%
Allen Dulles immediately
changes the subject. .

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.590 align:middle line:84%
Cuts her off before she
can talk about this trip.

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:22.330 align:middle line:90%
It's never brought up again.

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:24.908 align:middle line:84%
Allen Dulles makes some
joke about declaring

00:24:24.908 --> 00:24:26.450 align:middle line:84%
something on your
taxes or something,

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:28.540 align:middle line:84%
or something-- a
total non sequitur.

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:30.040 align:middle line:90%
The thing goes off the rails.

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.600 align:middle line:84%
We never hear what
Ruth Paine was

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.960 align:middle line:84%
going to say about her
trip to visit Arthur Young.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the name
Arthur Young jumps out at me.

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:38.700 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what--

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.510 align:middle line:84%
what does Arthur
Young have to do

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:42.610 align:middle line:90%
with the Kennedy assassination?

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:43.870 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:46.600 align:middle line:84%
>> While the major media
outlets presented Ruth Paine

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:49.810 align:middle line:84%
as a common housewife, it's
clear from the evidence that

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:53.260 align:middle line:84%
she was connected to some of the
top movers and shakers within

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:56.050 align:middle line:84%
the elite families
of the United States.

00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:57.820 align:middle line:84%
The fact that the
media is covering up

00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:01.120 align:middle line:84%
this important detail
of the JFK assassination

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.610 align:middle line:84%
can only mean that
this conspiracy runs

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:05.535 align:middle line:90%
deeper than previously thought.

00:25:05.535 --> 00:25:07.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, we also have the
connection of Kennedy with

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:09.910 align:middle line:90%
the space program, obviously.

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:12.010 align:middle line:10%
It was John F. Kennedy
who put us out there

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:14.530 align:middle line:10%
and committed us to
landing a man on the moon

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:16.330 align:middle line:10%
and returning him
safely to the Earth

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:18.070 align:middle line:10%
before the decade was out.

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:20.064 align:middle line:84%
Holy smokes,
unbelievable, right?

00:25:20.064 --> 00:25:20.864 align:middle line:90%
[EXPLOSION]

00:25:20.864 --> 00:25:21.664 align:middle line:90%


00:25:21.664 --> 00:25:24.820 align:middle line:10%
So, at the very least,
one could argue--

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:27.350 align:middle line:10%
one should argue
that the NASA program

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:31.270 align:middle line:10%
served as cover for a deeper,
more clandestine space program.

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And it makes sense when
you think about it.

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:37.670 align:middle line:84%
If you've got recovered, exotic
technology that can give you

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:41.060 align:middle line:84%
incredible propulsion
capabilities going off-world,

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:44.150 align:middle line:84%
and if you don't want the
world to know about it,

00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:46.628 align:middle line:84%
but you need to have
a presence in space,

00:25:46.628 --> 00:25:48.920 align:middle line:84%
you need a justification for
getting yourself out there

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:50.060 align:middle line:90%
in the eyes of the world.

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:55.550 align:middle line:84%
NASA fulfilled that
function to the T.

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:57.860 align:middle line:84%
So the evidence is
very strong now.

00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:02.480 align:middle line:84%
JFK knew a great deal about
the presence of others

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.710 align:middle line:90%
here on planet Earth.

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:06.650 align:middle line:84%
I say this because I give
credence to a particular memo

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:09.440 align:middle line:84%
that's leaked, come out,
dealing with Marilyn Monroe

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:13.700 align:middle line:84%
shortly before her death, a CIA
memo that talked about Marilyn

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Monroe at various
Hollywood parties,

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.910 align:middle line:90%
talking with Dorothy Kilgallen.

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:19.820 align:middle line:10%
And, in her anger at being
thrown overboard by the Kennedy

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:21.290 align:middle line:10%
brothers-- which she had been--

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:24.590 align:middle line:10%
talking quietly about
some of the pillow

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:29.090 align:middle line:10%
talk she had with JFK,
including his seeing beings

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:31.760 align:middle line:10%
from outer space at
a remote facility.

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:34.252 align:middle line:10%
Now, all of that was written
about in an alleged CIA memo.

00:26:34.252 --> 00:26:35.960 align:middle line:84%
There's actually been
some very good work

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:39.830 align:middle line:84%
done on that memo that,
to my satisfaction,

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:41.730 align:middle line:90%
indicates that that's authentic.

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:44.100 align:middle line:90%
I think it's real.

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.980 align:middle line:84%
>> So there were intimations
that there was some kind

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:49.920 align:middle line:84%
of a weird space
program connection

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.640 align:middle line:90%
to the assassination.

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:54.560 align:middle line:84%
But Lee Oswald himself,
according to at least one eye

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:57.120 align:middle line:84%
witness, said that
Lee was considering

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:00.330 align:middle line:84%
getting a job at NASA and, for
some reason, turned it down.

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Why would Lee have
turned down a job at NASA

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:05.520 align:middle line:84%
when he's working out the Texas
School Book Depository stacking

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:06.910 align:middle line:90%
boxes?

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:08.983 align:middle line:84%
So there's something
very fishy about that

00:27:08.983 --> 00:27:10.650 align:middle line:84%
which lends further
credence to the idea

00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:12.108 align:middle line:84%
that Lee was not
who he said he was

00:27:12.108 --> 00:27:13.275 align:middle line:90%
or not what he seemed to be.

00:27:13.275 --> 00:27:14.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Did you shoot the President?

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.147 align:middle line:84%
>> No, they're taking me in
because of the fact that I live

00:27:17.147 --> 00:27:17.980 align:middle line:90%
in the Soviet Union.

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:18.940 align:middle line:90%
>> We're talking treason then.

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:19.773 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm just a patsy.

00:27:19.773 --> 00:27:21.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Did you shoot the President?

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:23.820 align:middle line:10%
>> But there's another
connection between the JFK

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:26.880 align:middle line:10%
assassination and
the space program.

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.490 align:middle line:84%
In the late 1960s,
an odd document

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:32.430 align:middle line:84%
began to circulate among
the people investigating

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:33.840 align:middle line:90%
the murder of the President.

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.420 align:middle line:84%
It was called the
Torbitt Document.

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:40.070 align:middle line:10%
>> In the 1960s,
there was a samizdat,

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:44.080 align:middle line:10%
a mimeographed document,
that was circulated called

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.630 align:middle line:10%
the Torbitt Document.

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And it was allegedly
written by a Texas lawyer,

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:53.970 align:middle line:84%
in the late '60s, who used
the pseudonym of Torbitt.

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:56.970 align:middle line:84%
What the Torbitt
Document went on about,

00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:59.910 align:middle line:84%
at length, was the
Kennedy assassination

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:03.630 align:middle line:84%
and its connections to
NASA and Wernher von Braun.

00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:08.160 align:middle line:10%
The Torbitt document maintained
that Wernher von Braun

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:13.410 align:middle line:10%
commanded a special team called
DISC, the Defense Industrial

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:15.060 align:middle line:10%
Security Command.

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:19.740 align:middle line:10%
And DISC was run out of
Redstone Arsenal in Alabama.

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And what a lot of
people don't realize

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:25.320 align:middle line:84%
that the early space program
was really all in Alabama.

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.820 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't in Houston.

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:30.690 align:middle line:84%
That wasn't until later that
they moved things to Houston.

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:32.880 align:middle line:10%
And the Torbitt
Document maintained

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:37.020 align:middle line:10%
that, because of the
elements of the space program

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:41.640 align:middle line:10%
and with Wernher
von Braun, that DISC

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:45.870 align:middle line:10%
was somehow involved in
the Kennedy assassination

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:49.050 align:middle line:10%
and to coordinate
people from NASA

00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:52.050 align:middle line:10%
and other parts of
the military and CIA,

00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:55.170 align:middle line:10%
and then with Lyndon
Johnson having

00:28:55.170 --> 00:29:00.100 align:middle line:10%
control of the Dallas Police
force, and things like that.

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:04.230 align:middle line:84%
So the Torbitt Document
really is an oddball document

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:06.030 align:middle line:84%
about the Kennedy
assassination, because it

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:09.390 align:middle line:84%
gives a slightly
different slant on it

00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:15.690 align:middle line:84%
which brings in the military
and NASA missions to the moon.

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:19.560 align:middle line:84%
I got a book from NASA that
was about Wernher von Braun.

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And it was all these photos
of him and his life in NASA.

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:26.460 align:middle line:10%
And Johnson and Kennedy had
gone to Redstone Arsenal

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:30.900 align:middle line:10%
and met with Wernher von
Braun in the early '60s when

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:33.180 align:middle line:10%
Kennedy had announced
we were going to space.

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:37.210 align:middle line:10%
And, according to this book,
they had some huge argument

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:38.010 align:middle line:10%
together.

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And von Braun and
Kennedy and Johnson

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:44.100 align:middle line:84%
all had this big, big
argument about how

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:47.370 align:middle line:84%
we were going to go to the moon,
what the mission would be all

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:50.480 align:middle line:84%
about, what the American
people would get to see,

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.690 align:middle line:90%
all that kind of stuff.

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And, apparently, it
was Kennedy arguing

00:29:55.470 --> 00:30:00.180 align:middle line:84%
for different technology,
a more overt space program,

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:02.940 align:middle line:84%
one that would apparently
be quite different than what

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:05.010 align:middle line:90%
we were actually told.

00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And von Braun and Johnson
were completely against it.

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And, at that point, in a
sense, Kennedy his fate

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:16.390 align:middle line:90%
was perhaps sealed.

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>> The real story of
what happened in Dallas,

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:24.100 align:middle line:84%
Texas on November 22, 1963 will
probably never be known in its

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:25.420 align:middle line:90%
totality.

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:27.910 align:middle line:84%
But we can see from
this new evidence

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:29.710 align:middle line:84%
that President
John F. Kennedy was

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:32.710 align:middle line:84%
well aware of the
technological advances achieved

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:34.240 align:middle line:90%
by the Germans.

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:37.870 align:middle line:84%
He worked with James Forrestal
and very likely knew everything

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:39.460 align:middle line:90%
that Forrestal knew.

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:41.380 align:middle line:84%
He must have known that
getting to the moon

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:44.110 align:middle line:84%
with advanced
anti-gravity technology

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:48.070 align:middle line:84%
