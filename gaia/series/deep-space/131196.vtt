00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.240 align:middle line:84%
>> If there is a
breakaway civilization,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.790 align:middle line:84%
how do they get
people to join them?

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.420 align:middle line:90%
Is there a recruitment process?

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.070 align:middle line:84%
We shall discover
that getting people

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.320 align:middle line:84%
to join the Secret
Space Program is more

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.090 align:middle line:90%
complex than first imagined.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.440 align:middle line:90%


00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.810 align:middle line:90%
Some are asked.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.120 align:middle line:90%
Some are made.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And some appear to be
taken against their will.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.940 align:middle line:10%
>> There's recruitments where
certain individuals are picked

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.680 align:middle line:10%
to participate in projects and
to be a part of a particular

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.480 align:middle line:10%
agendas.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.310 align:middle line:84%
I have an experience
myself of being

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.778 align:middle line:84%
recruited to go off planet in
2006 to join a Mars colony.

00:01:32.778 --> 00:01:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And so there are
specific reasons why

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.612 align:middle line:90%
certain individuals are picked.

00:01:35.612 --> 00:01:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And to get to the bottom of
it is not the easiest thing,

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.020 align:middle line:84%
because, I mean, you're
unraveling a huge mystery.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's things like
quantum access technologies

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.340 align:middle line:84%
that are used to
target individuals.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.530 align:middle line:10%
What I discovered in
my recruitment process

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.807 align:middle line:10%
is something called Looking
Glass technologies was used

00:01:52.807 --> 00:01:54.390 align:middle line:10%
and something called
the Orion's Cube.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.600 align:middle line:10%
These were names that were
in the emails connected

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.970 align:middle line:10%
to how I was chosen.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And this isn't just tracking me
in this particular incarnation,

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.520 align:middle line:84%
there is a pretargeting
before I was born.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.175 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of strategies
are in place.

00:02:08.175 --> 00:02:10.740 align:middle line:10%
But if we kind of look at
the bigger picture in some

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.200 align:middle line:10%
of these controller groups
and how they manage timelines

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.940 align:middle line:10%
and how they work with
these technologies

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.153 align:middle line:10%
to achieve a specific,
desired result,

00:02:18.153 --> 00:02:20.320 align:middle line:10%
these things have been in
the works for a long time.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And so when we look at different
elements of the defense

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.650 align:middle line:84%
departments and things that
happened after the Second World

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.780 align:middle line:84%
War, we're dealing with
certain agendas that had

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.250 align:middle line:90%
good intentions to start with.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.320 align:middle line:90%


00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Laurie Eisenhower was
recruited for the Secret Space

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.310 align:middle line:90%
Program.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.890 align:middle line:84%
Specifically, they wanted
her to go to Mars where

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.950 align:middle line:90%
they said they had a base.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that humans
have a base on Mars?

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.210 align:middle line:84%
To confirm that we do
have a base on Mars,

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.970 align:middle line:90%
we spoke to Randy Cramer.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.000 align:middle line:84%
Randy claims to have spent
years as a soldier fighting

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.050 align:middle line:90%
a war on Mars.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.880 align:middle line:90%


00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.600 align:middle line:10%
>> Project Moon Shadow was
the project which genetically

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.240 align:middle line:10%
engineered and trained me and
299 other young boys and girls

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.450 align:middle line:10%
for a total of 300
of us in the project.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.330 align:middle line:84%
We were all genetically
engineered from the ground up,

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.850 align:middle line:84%
Petri dish level, and then
trained from pretty much--

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean the programming,
the sort of

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.890 align:middle line:84%
teaching-training programming
starts at an infantile toddler

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:35.690 align:middle line:90%
age.

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And then you start
physical, like showing up

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.720 align:middle line:84%
to physical locations for
training probably by four or 4

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.070 align:middle line:90%
and 1/2 years old.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.900 align:middle line:84%
So very, very, very
young starting.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.060 align:middle line:84%
But none of those early stage
training programs and so forth

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.900 align:middle line:84%
are like really shocking, or
violent, or scary, or anything.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.470 align:middle line:84%
They're all just
programs, and training,

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.070 align:middle line:84%
and systems designed to teach
you hand-eye coordination,

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.610 align:middle line:84%
group dynamic functions,
how to work as a team.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.860 align:middle line:84%
The whole process,
basically, is--

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean probably in the
very, very early days,

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.830 align:middle line:84%
in the '70s, before a lot
of the jumpgate technology

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.800 align:middle line:84%
was being used every day and
regularly, sometimes what

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.500 align:middle line:84%
they would actually do
is activate an implant.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.110 align:middle line:84%
You pop up out of bed,
walk right out the front

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:23.520 align:middle line:84%
or back door to a van waiting
that picks kids up and then

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.710 align:middle line:84%
takes them to a
vehicle that can then

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.510 align:middle line:90%
take them on a ride somewhere.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, a delta
wave emitter from a ship

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.140 align:middle line:84%
above makes everybody
sound asleep,

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.730 align:middle line:84%
because delta waves
are sleep waves.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And if you're imposing
a delta wave emitter

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.220 align:middle line:84%
over a neighborhood or
over a part of a city,

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.320 align:middle line:84%
everyone will just snooze
right through the whole thing.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And if you have someone who you
can activate in that process,

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.040 align:middle line:84%
be immune to the effects,
walk out of the room,

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.250 align:middle line:84%
get into a van, no one's
going to be awake for it.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.590 align:middle line:84%
No one's going to be
looking out a window.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.733 align:middle line:84%
Even someone sitting
at their kitchen table

00:04:57.733 --> 00:04:59.400 align:middle line:84%
is going to all of a
sudden feel drowsy,

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.080 align:middle line:84%
and pass out for a
few minutes, and then

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.050 align:middle line:84%
wake up, and go, oh, maybe
it's time I go to bed.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.040 align:middle line:84%
So I mean they'll just
knock everybody out.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.940 align:middle line:90%
So you could do that.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:07.920 align:middle line:90%
And no one would see anything.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.060 align:middle line:84%
There would be no
evidence of that.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.970 align:middle line:84%
Then once they started using the
jumpgates full time, then just

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.970 align:middle line:84%
a couple of jumpgate technicians
pop in, say, hey, time to go.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:16.770 align:middle line:90%
And you're OK.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.312 align:middle line:84%
And you go through the jumpgate
to whatever the next training

00:05:19.312 --> 00:05:20.112 align:middle line:90%
session.

00:05:20.112 --> 00:05:21.370 align:middle line:90%
And then they bring you back.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And because of
quantum dilations,

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.900 align:middle line:84%
which is essentially a
temporal loop where you're

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.300 align:middle line:84%
taking someone out
for a ride and then

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.360 align:middle line:84%
back again so that they can
exercise so much training time

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.210 align:middle line:84%
and you can go by and then
you bring them back 15 minutes

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.960 align:middle line:84%
after they left so that there's
no paradox of taking them out

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.930 align:middle line:90%
of time.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.140 align:middle line:84%
So also that way,
you can take someone

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.580 align:middle line:84%
away at 2:30 in the morning
for days, weeks, even

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.800 align:middle line:84%
for training period,
and then bring them back

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.260 align:middle line:84%
and everyone wakes
up the next morning

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.060 align:middle line:84%
not knowing that
anything occurred.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And even for the
subject, usually, you

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.200 align:middle line:90%
do remember things.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.000 align:middle line:84%
But I'm telling you,
when you wake up

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.370 align:middle line:84%
from that experience,
what you tell yourself,

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.010 align:middle line:84%
because you're in your bed,
it's the next day, wow, what

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.180 align:middle line:90%
a crazy long dream that was.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.340 align:middle line:84%
It seemed like I was
dreaming for days.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:19.120 align:middle line:84%
A project mannequin is a program
that manages augmented soldier

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.640 align:middle line:90%
projects for like everybody.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.720 align:middle line:84%
So the various military
intelligence programs

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.930 align:middle line:84%
have individual projects
that they work on and have

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.160 align:middle line:90%
been working on for decades.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And then project mannequin takes
parcels from those departments

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.930 align:middle line:84%
and organizes and
figures out where

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.890 align:middle line:84%
needs for soldiers are,
either terrestrial,

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.120 align:middle line:84%
Earthbound, or elsewhere, and
then work on the assignments

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.190 align:middle line:90%
on where everybody goes.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:52.210 align:middle line:84%
So they're kind of the
granddaddy organization

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:56.050 align:middle line:84%
of covert augmented genetically
augmented super soldier

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.860 align:middle line:84%
programs or genetically
augmented soldier programs,

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.780 align:middle line:84%
because they manage it
all and tell everybody

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.120 align:middle line:90%
where they're going to go.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:08.020 align:middle line:84%
You may have to wonder who
your creator is, who made you,

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.100 align:middle line:90%
and what your purpose is.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.650 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:14.260 align:middle line:84%
A roomful of guys in
lab coats and a couple

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.070 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrials
designed my DNA code,

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:22.430 align:middle line:84%
like assembled it,
took a fertilized cell

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.750 align:middle line:84%
and did all the augmentations
necessary for those

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.210 align:middle line:84%
to go together, implanted
me back in my mother's womb.

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And then nine months
later, I pop out all

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.370 align:middle line:90%
exactly like they want.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.995 align:middle line:84%
The standard covert
military space program tour

00:07:35.995 --> 00:07:37.000 align:middle line:90%
is a 20-year tour.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.750 align:middle line:84%
They really want to get
their money's worth.

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.590 align:middle line:84%
I've asked my
brigadier general what

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:46.330 align:middle line:84%
the estimated cost of training
me over my lifetime has been.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And he said probably
over $100 million.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:53.568 align:middle line:84%
That's probably fairly
standard for a soldier

00:07:53.568 --> 00:07:55.360 align:middle line:84%
who's in the covert
military space program.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.510 align:middle line:10%
That when you think about
all the cost of the programs

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:01.600 align:middle line:10%
and the dollar per
minute, per hour, per day

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.126 align:middle line:10%
per unit sort of cost
per person over decades,

00:08:05.126 --> 00:08:08.300 align:middle line:10%
yeah, it gets to be $100
million per person or something

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:09.100 align:middle line:10%
like that.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.350 align:middle line:10%
It's a really high,
high, high cost.

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:15.550 align:middle line:10%
Which I will emphasize if
there wasn't the covert secrecy

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:18.700 align:middle line:10%
problem that we have, that
cost would come way down.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's an inflated
cost due to secrecy.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And if we were no
longer in that state,

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.020 align:middle line:84%
then that cost
would come way down.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And you wouldn't have to
pay $100 million each.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:33.730 align:middle line:84%
I have said this 20-year
tour, 20-year healing process.

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:35.002 align:middle line:90%
Just straight up.

00:08:35.002 --> 00:08:36.460 align:middle line:84%
There's no other
way to look at it.

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:39.159 align:middle line:84%
It was a 20-year tour and
a 20-year healing process

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:44.049 align:middle line:84%
before I had a solid grip on
what the heck was going on.

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:44.890 align:middle line:90%
I was a soldier.

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:50.530 align:middle line:84%
So when you start young, you're
either designed for something,

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:54.380 align:middle line:84%
or as you develop, it becomes
clear what you're best at.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.630 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm a soldier.

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:58.300 align:middle line:84%
So I am best at killing things,
blowing things up, hunting

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:00.310 align:middle line:90%
things down, and fighting.

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:03.010 align:middle line:84%
So pretty much if it involved
fighting something, shooting,

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:04.750 align:middle line:84%
something blowing
something up, then

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:06.310 align:middle line:90%
that could have been my job.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And during the training
periods, there's

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.270 align:middle line:84%
a number of different
exercises which

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:13.120 align:middle line:84%
you go to do things to kill
people and blow things up here

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:17.230 align:middle line:84%
on planet Earth in training
exercises, field exercises.

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And then when I got deployed,
it was straight off to Mars

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:24.760 align:middle line:84%
for 17 years of
fighting things there.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.550 align:middle line:90%


00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:29.580 align:middle line:84%
Powered armor on a low-G
planet, that's fun,

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.695 align:middle line:90%
but that's about it.

00:09:32.695 --> 00:09:34.070 align:middle line:84%
It's a place I'd
like to go back.

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:36.020 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beautiful place.

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.600 align:middle line:84%
I was there in a war that
was the ugliest thing ever.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And I was being pumped
full of crazy drugs

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:44.140 align:middle line:84%
that made me angry
and aggressive.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.550 align:middle line:90%
No, it was not fun at all.

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:47.540 align:middle line:90%
I did not enjoy it.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:49.650 align:middle line:84%
There is a thin
oxygen atmosphere.

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's certainly easier
to breathe the farther

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:54.510 align:middle line:84%
towards the equatorial
region that you go.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:55.840 align:middle line:90%
We were up pretty high north.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.700 align:middle line:84%
So we could sometimes pop
our hoods on our helmets up.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.050 align:middle line:90%
And it was cold, thin.

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:04.610 align:middle line:84%
But you couldn't run or
really get enough air

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:06.630 align:middle line:84%
if you had to work,
cardio breathe.

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:09.840 align:middle line:90%


00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.180 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it was just too
cold to want to do it,

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:13.470 align:middle line:90%
like Antarctica cold.

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:17.350 align:middle line:84%
So you could, but it
was open your helmet,

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:21.510 align:middle line:84%
you know, your eyelashes
start to get icicles on them.

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:24.280 align:middle line:90%


00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:27.600 align:middle line:84%
The Mars Colony Corporation
was the first entity

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.770 align:middle line:84%
which was given permission
to start the Mars colonies.

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And in much the
same way that when

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:36.660 align:middle line:84%
colonies came over
to the Americas,

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:40.010 align:middle line:84%
like the Jamestown
Colony Corporation,

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:42.870 align:middle line:84%
that's all very standard
sort of colonial law.

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:45.060 align:middle line:84%
So creating the Mars
Colony Corporation

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:46.260 align:middle line:90%
was fairly standard.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Now the ICC, the International
Corporate Conglomerate,

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.320 align:middle line:90%
that came a little later.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.630 align:middle line:84%
That sort of came as an
entity, a banking organization,

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:58.240 align:middle line:84%
that eventually assumed a
lot of financial control.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.470 align:middle line:84%
So as I understand it, the
MDF, which is the Mars Defense

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:04.020 align:middle line:84%
Force, is a military
contractor which

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:08.730 align:middle line:84%
is run by the covert military
space program and it's officer

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:13.020 align:middle line:84%
caudre but it contracts
to the MCC and the ICC,

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:14.460 align:middle line:90%
specifically to the MCC.

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And the MCC answers to
the ICC and so forth.

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:20.200 align:middle line:84%
So that's sort of the
chain of command there.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.130 align:middle line:84%
So the MDF's a military
contractor that's not really

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:26.370 align:middle line:90%
owned by the MCC at all.

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:27.960 align:middle line:90%
It's contracted by.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.990 align:middle line:84%
So the MCC does not
own that technology.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:32.280 align:middle line:90%
They contract that technology.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.330 align:middle line:90%
It's very complicated.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:34.955 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I couldn't
say I understand it.

00:11:34.955 --> 00:11:36.750 align:middle line:10%
But as far as what
contractors own

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:38.970 align:middle line:10%
what, what military
organizations are in charge

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:41.640 align:middle line:10%
of what, and who gets to do
what, they have their own very

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.070 align:middle line:10%
complicated legal system
of doing things there

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:47.250 align:middle line:10%
that are very much like
the way we do things here,

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.770 align:middle line:10%
but they have their own
way that's not necessarily

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:51.120 align:middle line:10%
fun sometimes for people there.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:55.410 align:middle line:90%


00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:59.580 align:middle line:84%
Probably after I had been
there maybe 4.5, almost five

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.910 align:middle line:84%
years or something,
we started to have

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:07.500 align:middle line:84%
a presence of a fourth
person on the battlefield.

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.600 align:middle line:10%
And so when I say the
three main people who

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.440 align:middle line:10%
were on that battlefield
already were us,

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.400 align:middle line:10%
an indigenous insectoid
species, and an indigenous

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.950 align:middle line:10%
mantids or reptoid species.

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:22.230 align:middle line:10%
So another species
started to show up

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:24.840 align:middle line:10%
in different kinds of ships
with very different kinds

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.350 align:middle line:10%
of technology, with a
very different appearance,

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:31.880 align:middle line:10%
that didn't seem to get
along with anybody else.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.980 align:middle line:84%
That didn't seem to be
friends of anybody else's.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:37.560 align:middle line:84%
But there was a lot of
questions and dispute over

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.260 align:middle line:84%
whether this was another faction
from somewhere else on Mars,

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.600 align:middle line:84%
another reptoid faction, whether
friends of somebody's had

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.400 align:middle line:90%
come in.

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.590 align:middle line:84%
So all those questions
were being asked.

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think, initially, we just
had a lot of question marks.

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:54.570 align:middle line:84%
But what we knew for sure
is that when they showed up

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:59.070 align:middle line:84%
in the battlefield, that
changed the focus of attention

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:00.040 align:middle line:90%
of what was happening.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.130 align:middle line:84%
So that essentially
everything was then

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.920 align:middle line:84%
focused in that
direction on them.

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, that led
to a cooperative treaty.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:16.010 align:middle line:10%
And we all kind of were
able to join together

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:20.780 align:middle line:10%
forces, the three sort of ground
terrestrial, indigenous forces.

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:22.880 align:middle line:10%
Interestingly enough, the
reptiles on the mountain

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:25.610 align:middle line:10%
started to consider us
another indigenous species

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:28.057 align:middle line:10%
because we lived there,
which is not the same thing

00:13:28.057 --> 00:13:29.640 align:middle line:10%
as wanting to come
from somewhere else

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.410 align:middle line:10%
and just take, take, take.

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:33.077 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're just coming here
to take everything that we can.

00:13:33.077 --> 00:13:34.010 align:middle line:90%
We had moved in.

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:35.360 align:middle line:90%
We were neighbors now.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And we might get
into disagreements,

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:38.900 align:middle line:84%
but we lived there and
we were neighbors now.

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And they were willing
to respect that

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:42.140 align:middle line:84%
as long as we respected
that we weren't there

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:44.510 align:middle line:90%
to destroy the freaking planet.

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:46.970 align:middle line:84%
But someone else coming in
from outside as an invader

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:49.770 align:middle line:84%
is seen as a completely
different threat.

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And so we ended up, eventually,
getting together on that

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.350 align:middle line:90%
and ganging up on them.

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And then it got
interesting, because you

00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:00.740 align:middle line:84%
would have these just
incredibly crazy battles where

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:03.140 align:middle line:84%
these Draconians dropped
ships would show up.

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And you'd have battalions
of Mantids and battalions

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:08.570 align:middle line:90%
of humans.

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And then the crazy
swarms of insects.

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:20.020 align:middle line:10%
You have four distinct species
using four distinct modes

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:24.340 align:middle line:10%
of tactics, technology,
and battle sense

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:30.550 align:middle line:10%
all kind of working with
against one other group.

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:31.900 align:middle line:10%
It was nuts.

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:35.670 align:middle line:10%
I would call it a tactical
and strategical nightmare.

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:39.330 align:middle line:10%
>> Randy Cramer then told us
about his experiences visiting

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.300 align:middle line:10%
the base on the moon.

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.660 align:middle line:10%
>> Lunar operations come in a
couple of times like on the way

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:49.680 align:middle line:10%
out, on the way back, certainly
during the training period,

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.740 align:middle line:10%
it was a place that we went
back and forth to a few times.

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:54.610 align:middle line:90%
It's a big place.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:55.410 align:middle line:90%
It's big.

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's been there
since they probably

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:01.780 align:middle line:84%
broke ground on it like in 1953,
1954, or something like that.

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:03.555 align:middle line:90%
So it's been there forever.

00:15:03.555 --> 00:15:05.430 align:middle line:10%
One of the things that
I thought was the most

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:08.100 align:middle line:10%
fascinating about it was how--

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:11.430 align:middle line:10%
depending on the part of
the complex that you're in--

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:13.530 align:middle line:10%
you could really
feel like you're

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:17.040 align:middle line:10%
walking through time walking
from one end to the other,

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.850 align:middle line:10%
because you might be at a
park that was built in 1955.

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:24.810 align:middle line:84%
The doors, tile, clocks,
the signs over the doors,

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:27.760 align:middle line:84%
the light switches, the
desks are from 1955.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.492 align:middle line:84%
Like there's all this old
materials in some places.

00:15:30.492 --> 00:15:32.700 align:middle line:84%
They have not replaced or
upgraded in some locations.

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.200 align:middle line:10%
So you literally
feel like you're

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.860 align:middle line:10%
walking into almost like a
historical set from a World War

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:40.200 align:middle line:10%
II movie because of all
the sort of World War II

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.020 align:middle line:10%
era, 1940s, '50s
kind of materials.

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:45.588 align:middle line:10%
And then as you move
along to different areas,

00:15:45.588 --> 00:15:47.880 align:middle line:10%
you can get to all these
different upgrades of building

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.340 align:middle line:10%
materials, '60s, '70s.

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:52.950 align:middle line:84%
I remember walking down the
hallway to the administration

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:57.570 align:middle line:84%
section and noticing that
it was the same yellow wall

00:15:57.570 --> 00:16:00.570 align:middle line:84%
paint, the same yellow carpet,
that was in my doctor's office

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:03.240 align:middle line:84%
when I was in the '70s
with the same pleather

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.830 align:middle line:84%
chairs with that mustard
yellow color, right?

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:06.630 align:middle line:90%
Same stuff.

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:09.543 align:middle line:84%
The old carpet was all
ratty, and had holes in it,

00:16:09.543 --> 00:16:11.460 align:middle line:84%
and totally needed to
be torn up and replaced,

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:13.835 align:middle line:84%
but, nah, they weren't going
to spend money on that part.

00:16:13.835 --> 00:16:16.980 align:middle line:10%
But then you get to one of
the advanced medical sections

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:18.960 align:middle line:10%
and then it's like
you're in 2055.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.410 align:middle line:10%
And you've walked from
1945 to the future

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:25.510 align:middle line:10%
just because of when something
was built, no upgrading

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:26.310 align:middle line:10%
whatsoever.

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:27.705 align:middle line:84%
And you could walk through
a number of departments

00:16:27.705 --> 00:16:29.932 align:middle line:84%
and feel like you've
just walked through time

00:16:29.932 --> 00:16:31.140 align:middle line:90%
to get from end to the other.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.167 align:middle line:84%
That's what trips me
out sort of about it.

00:16:33.167 --> 00:16:34.000 align:middle line:90%
It's a trippy place.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:34.830 align:middle line:90%
But it's huge.

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:36.330 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't tell you
how many levels,

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:41.190 align:middle line:84%
how many square feet, how many
miles deep, wide, but it's big.

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Because it's been built and
expanded on over the decades so

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.040 align:middle line:90%
it gets bigger and bigger.

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:49.780 align:middle line:84%
>> But what was it like
to be out in deep space?

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.370 align:middle line:84%
>> It is the most
gorgeous thing ever.

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:55.280 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever been
out far out from light

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.840 align:middle line:84%
bleed out in the
middle of nowhere,

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.760 align:middle line:90%
super, super clear skies.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:02.010 align:middle line:84%
Zion National Park, probably
one of the places on the planet

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:05.020 align:middle line:84%
has some of the clearest,
starriest skies.

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And I've had people
tell me being

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:10.250 align:middle line:84%
out in the middle of the
ocean on a calm ocean

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:12.170 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the
night is very similar,

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:14.210 align:middle line:84%
because the stars
reflecting off of space

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:17.730 align:middle line:84%
make it feel like you are
completely surrounded by stars.

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:20.660 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about what
a starry night sky looks

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:24.569 align:middle line:84%
like in that clear,
away from the city light

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:29.120 align:middle line:84%
bleed looks like, which is
full of stars, full of stars.

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:33.680 align:middle line:84%
Imagine even more full of
stars, because you're actually

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.360 align:middle line:90%
outside the atmosphere.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.150 align:middle line:84%
You actually get farther
away from the sun.

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And those stars
get even brighter.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.320 align:middle line:90%
And so you see even more stars.

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:45.710 align:middle line:10%
So when you're
out in space, what

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:49.640 align:middle line:10%
you notice is if you
turn everything off

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.880 align:middle line:10%
and you're in the dark, so to
speak, nothing of the kind,

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:56.510 align:middle line:10%
you absolutely are lit
up in a sea of stars.

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:58.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean you could
read a book by it.

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:01.023 align:middle line:84%
It's that bright when
you're out there.

00:18:01.023 --> 00:18:03.440 align:middle line:84%
If the power goes out, I can
whip out the emergency manual

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.500 align:middle line:84%
and hold it up to the window
and I can read by starlight.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:12.210 align:middle line:84%
It's also not confusing because
we're in the arm of the galaxy.

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:13.010 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And so the band of
the Milky Way galaxy

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:18.000 align:middle line:84%
that goes across the sky when
you're looking up from the sky.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you're
in space, that's

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:21.770 align:middle line:84%
not a band that
arcs across the sky.

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:25.440 align:middle line:84%
It's a circle that goes
all the way around you.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And it is in the
horizon position

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.760 align:middle line:84%
because of where
we are in the arm.

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.970 align:middle line:84%
So when you're out there
in space, you look up

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:33.648 align:middle line:90%
and there's the northern stars.

00:18:33.648 --> 00:18:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And you look down and
there's the southern stars.

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:38.502 align:middle line:84%
And then all around you
are the constellations.

00:18:38.502 --> 00:18:40.466 align:middle line:10%
It's like clock position.

00:18:40.466 --> 00:18:43.340 align:middle line:10%
How space people navigated
in space forever, right?

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:46.220 align:middle line:84%
So when you're out there,
you can look in any direction

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.280 align:middle line:84%
and know pretty much where
you are, where you're going.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.210 align:middle line:84%
There's no sense of
I'm lost, where am I?

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:52.010 align:middle line:90%
It's dark.

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:53.330 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what's happening.

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:57.470 align:middle line:84%
It is absolutely the most
visible, beautiful, gorgeous,

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:58.890 align:middle line:84%
easy to figure
out where you are.

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And again to get that horizon
point, that up and down thing,

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:03.498 align:middle line:90%
all of a sudden--

00:19:03.498 --> 00:19:05.290 align:middle line:84%
because you think as
a pilot on the ground,

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:06.500 align:middle line:84%
oh, when I'm out
in space, there's

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:07.880 align:middle line:84%
not going to be an
up or a down. yeah,

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.255 align:middle line:84%
there's totally
an up and a down.

00:19:09.255 --> 00:19:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's the horizon line of
the galaxy that goes around you.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And that band,
it's a circle that

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:15.317 align:middle line:90%
goes all the way around you.

00:19:15.317 --> 00:19:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And you're never above or
below that horizon point,

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:21.560 align:middle line:84%
because you'd have to be
above or below the galaxy line

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:22.850 align:middle line:90%
to get out of that.

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And any direction
you go, you're not

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:26.990 align:middle line:84%
getting outside of
that horizon line.

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:29.850 align:middle line:90%
So that horizon is a constant.

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:32.930 align:middle line:84%
We have to leave the
galaxy for that ring

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:35.590 align:middle line:84%
around you, that horizon
point to disappear.

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:38.330 align:middle line:84%
When you're out there,
and it's totally dark,

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:41.150 align:middle line:84%
and it's totally quiet, and
the engine hum turns off,

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:43.520 align:middle line:84%
and the electrical
hum turns off,

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:47.420 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing, radio,
going on in your ear,

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:50.150 align:middle line:90%
space makes music.

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:52.460 align:middle line:84%
There is a musical
sound that it makes.

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.035 align:middle line:84%
And I am told by
extraterrestrials

00:19:55.035 --> 00:19:56.660 align:middle line:84%
who understand this
a bit better than I

00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:00.080 align:middle line:84%
do that if you become really
familiar and psionically

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:03.880 align:middle line:84%
attuned to hear that sound
you can navigate by it.

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.280 align:middle line:84%
That it actually will
tell you which directions

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.513 align:middle line:84%
you want to go by
which music you follow.

00:20:08.513 --> 00:20:10.430 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, when you're
out there really quiet

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:12.190 align:middle line:84%
and it's really
dark, you can hear.

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:13.420 align:middle line:90%
It is like background.

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.030 align:middle line:84%
I've heard people say,
it's like angels singing.

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:15.830 align:middle line:90%
It kind of is.

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:18.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's really just
this amazing music that's

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:19.930 align:middle line:90%
kind of indescribable.

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:25.538 align:middle line:90%


00:20:25.538 --> 00:20:27.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
else to describe it.

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:30.200 align:middle line:84%
But it also seems
to be psionic waves

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.480 align:middle line:84%
from civilizations and
species from those stars, too.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.690 align:middle line:90%
So it's not just the stars.

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:37.400 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be from the
people who are living there.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.440 align:middle line:84%
Because you certainly
get the sense--

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:40.820 align:middle line:90%
or I certainly did--

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:45.860 align:middle line:84%
looking at all those stars that
some of those are galaxies.

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:50.240 align:middle line:84%
But at those points, if you
could follow each point,

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.630 align:middle line:84%
there's billions
of people, beings,

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:57.470 align:middle line:90%
living somewhere near that dot.

00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And that dot, and that
dot, and that dot,

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:02.000 align:middle line:84%
all the dots if you
followed them out

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.930 align:middle line:84%
would lead to a neighborhood
of billions, and billions,

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:07.340 align:middle line:90%
and billions of people.

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:11.150 align:middle line:84%
So you don't ever think
like you're alone.

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:14.300 align:middle line:84%
It just becomes ultimately clear
that you live in the biggest

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:16.130 align:middle line:90%
neighborhood ever.

00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:19.160 align:middle line:90%


00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Obviously, being recruited
for missions such as Randy

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:26.810 align:middle line:84%
Cramer was on, would have to
be difficult to say the least.

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:28.700 align:middle line:84%
How could they get
anyone to volunteer

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.667 align:middle line:90%
for such dangerous work?

00:21:31.667 --> 00:21:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe there are a lot of
missing people on this planet.

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:35.870 align:middle line:10%
Thousands of people
documented are

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:38.360 align:middle line:10%
disappearing every single year.

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:41.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a book that came
out called "Alternative 3."

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And the third option
was to actually

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:47.330 align:middle line:84%
have a breakaway civilization
on another planet.

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And in this plan, they
also needed to take people.

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:52.990 align:middle line:84%
You had to have people in
specific industries, doctors.

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:54.620 align:middle line:90%
You had to have farmers.

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:56.600 align:middle line:84%
You had to have all
different types of people

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.130 align:middle line:84%
from all different
types of arenas

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:00.550 align:middle line:84%
so that you can actually
populate this new civilization

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:02.120 align:middle line:90%
and create the infrastructure.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Along with that,
it is very possible

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:07.820 align:middle line:84%
that they have used some type
of MKUltra or mind controlling

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:12.060 align:middle line:84%
device or even a serum
to convince people

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:13.730 align:middle line:84%
or to take people
off this planet.

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:18.140 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1977, a strange science
show aired on television

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:19.340 align:middle line:90%
in England.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:22.280 align:middle line:10%
The show was called
"Alternative 3."

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:27.320 align:middle line:10%
They never told us much just
that Robert, my brother,

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:32.000 align:middle line:10%
got this grant to do some
kind of work up there.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:38.240 align:middle line:10%
That's the last we heard it's
not knowing that's the worst.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.490 align:middle line:10%
>> The driving force
behind "Alternative 3"

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:43.190 align:middle line:10%
was this notion that the
Earth would suffer some sort

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:45.680 align:middle line:10%
of climatic collapse.

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:47.640 align:middle line:90%
The climate would run wild.

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.700 align:middle line:90%
There would be storms.

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.850 align:middle line:90%
And deserts would expand.

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:58.630 align:middle line:84%
There would be crop failures,
a lot of environmental damage.

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:00.700 align:middle line:84%
The powers that be
decided to attempt

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:05.470 align:middle line:84%
three alternatives to fix it, to
mitigate it, or to survive it.

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:08.560 align:middle line:84%
So the first alternative,
Alternative 1

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.440 align:middle line:84%
was to blow a hole in the upper
atmosphere using a high yield

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.940 align:middle line:90%
nuclear device.

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:17.360 align:middle line:84%
The idea behind this was to
vent carbon dioxide into space.

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:21.450 align:middle line:10%
Alternative 2 was this notion
that they could survive it,

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:22.250 align:middle line:10%
right?

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:25.850 align:middle line:84%
So what they wanted to do was to
build deep underground bunkers,

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:29.600 align:middle line:84%
large, large-scale
bunkers, and possibly

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.210 align:middle line:84%
connect them with an
underground rail network

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:34.880 align:middle line:84%
and then live in the bunkers to
wait out the climate collapse.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, as the
Earth commonly does,

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:41.270 align:middle line:84%
it would reset itself with
no human intervention.

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:44.360 align:middle line:84%
The assumption I would
make is that they figured

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:47.150 align:middle line:84%
people would survive
it, but those survivors

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:49.580 align:middle line:84%
would be limited to pockets
that they could probably

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:53.060 align:middle line:90%
control when they resurfaced.

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:56.420 align:middle line:84%
>> All I'm prepared to say is
there were three alternatives

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:57.540 align:middle line:90%
for discussion.

00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:59.240 align:middle line:90%
The first two were crazy.

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:01.100 align:middle line:90%
Forget about them.

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:05.770 align:middle line:84%
The third alternative
may be not so crazy.

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:07.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Alternative 3 was to leave.

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:10.840 align:middle line:84%
This idea that the Earth
had suffered such climactic

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:13.300 align:middle line:84%
damage that they had
to leave and come

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:16.660 align:middle line:84%
back later, maybe hundreds
of years, thousands of years.

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.550 align:middle line:90%
It's really kind of open-ended.

00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:20.380 align:middle line:84%
The other problem
with Alternative 2

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:23.770 align:middle line:84%
was that you can build vast
underground bunkers in cities,

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:26.170 align:middle line:84%
but you can't build
enough of them.

00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And it takes so
long to build them,

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:30.105 align:middle line:84%
that it's probably more
efficient to leave.

00:24:30.105 --> 00:24:32.260 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you mean go
to some other planet?

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:35.240 align:middle line:90%


00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean get the hell off this
one whilst there's still time.

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:42.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Carl Gerstein then
went on to discuss the kind

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:44.870 align:middle line:84%
of cross-section they
would like to see get away,

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:49.190 align:middle line:84%
a balance of the sciences and
the arts, in fact, all aspects,

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:51.770 align:middle line:84%
as far as possible,
of human culture.

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:54.320 align:middle line:84%
He said that the list
would never be complete,

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:56.790 align:middle line:84%
but it would be
better than nothing.

00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>> The movie itself is fake.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.380 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty obvious.

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:05.360 align:middle line:84%
If you're a fan of science
fiction films of the 1970s,

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.200 align:middle line:84%
you'll notice some
of the actors.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Ann, they won't let
us into the building.

00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:11.130 align:middle line:84%
They say they've
had orders not to.

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:11.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I know.

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:12.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, can you tell us
exactly what's going on?

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:14.240 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I'm sorry.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.350 align:middle line:90%
I can't go on with the film.

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:16.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm going away.

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:17.660 align:middle line:90%
>> What exactly is happening?

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:20.180 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't say anything.

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:25.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I've done everything
I can to try to get some kind

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:29.630 align:middle line:90%
of answer, but there's nothing.

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:34.140 align:middle line:84%
They just say, "We're sorry,
but we didn't know anything

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:35.970 align:middle line:90%
about your brother."

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:38.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Some operation of supreme
importance has been going

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:43.140 align:middle line:90%
on beneath the security cover.

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:47.580 align:middle line:84%
We believe that that operation
is Dr. Carl Gerstein's

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:50.000 align:middle line:90%
Alternative 3.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.070 align:middle line:84%
Whether a human survival
colony has already

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:56.070 align:middle line:84%
been established on Mars
or whether plans are still

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:58.290 align:middle line:84%
in preparation for
its transportation

00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:02.310 align:middle line:84%
from the moon to
Mars, we don't know.

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:04.440 align:middle line:84%
But we put out this
program tonight

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.800 align:middle line:84%
as a challenge to those who
do know to tell us the truth.

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Needless to say, as soon
as the program finished,

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:12.530 align:middle line:90%
pandemonium struck England.

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:14.160 align:middle line:84%
The station which
aired the program

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.860 align:middle line:84%
was inundated with
worried calls.

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:20.460 align:middle line:84%
It was then that they had to
admit that the entire show was

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:21.990 align:middle line:90%
a fake.

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:25.920 align:middle line:84%
Alternative 3 was a leak of high
level information concerning

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:28.950 align:middle line:84%
the Secret Space Program that
was already in full effect

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:32.880 align:middle line:84%
by the time of the airing
of the show in 1977.

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.910 align:middle line:84%
Many researchers thought
there was more to the program,

00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:38.490 align:middle line:84%
that it was revealing
a kernel of truth.

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Was the showing of
Alternative 3 a warning?

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:43.260 align:middle line:84%
Is there evidence of
people disappearing?

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:50.750 align:middle line:90%


00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:56.780 align:middle line:84%
That brings us to the research
of ex-policeman David Paulides.

00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:59.840 align:middle line:84%
First, David became aware of
the thousands of people missing

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.940 align:middle line:84%
from our National
Park System when

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:03.920 align:middle line:84%
he was approached by
two forest service

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:05.750 align:middle line:90%
rangers who were concerned.

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:09.180 align:middle line:90%


00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:11.700 align:middle line:84%
This sent him off
into an investigation,

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:14.720 align:middle line:84%
which just might answer many
of the questions surrounding

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:17.870 align:middle line:84%
this recruitment process for
the Secret Space Program.

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:21.120 align:middle line:90%


00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:23.680 align:middle line:84%
>> So I was doing some
research at a national park.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.990 align:middle line:10%
I was talking to people that
were contractors at the park.

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:29.780 align:middle line:10%
I noticed some park
rangers were following us.

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And sometime after
that, I left the park,

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:33.900 align:middle line:90%
went to an offsite location.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And one of the rangers initially
came up and knocked on the door

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.738 align:middle line:84%
and had a conversation
with me about people

00:27:38.738 --> 00:27:41.030 align:middle line:84%
who had disappeared at parks
that he and another person

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:42.440 align:middle line:90%
had worked at.

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And they explained that the
places that these people

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:46.760 align:middle line:90%
disappeared was unusual.

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:50.120 align:middle line:84%
How they disappeared,
et cetera, was strange.

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And after seven to
10 days of searching,

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:56.760 align:middle line:84%
the case kind of
disappeared and went away.

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.760 align:middle line:84%
It was at that point
that he got together

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.740 align:middle line:84%
with some other rangers
and started to talk

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:02.060 align:middle line:90%
about these disappearances.

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.482 align:middle line:84%
And then they started to
find some commonalities.

00:28:04.482 --> 00:28:06.440 align:middle line:84%
They thought it was
strange the locations where

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.090 align:middle line:90%
these people disappeared.

00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:10.700 align:middle line:84%
They thought it was strange
that there wasn't follow up.

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And they thought that somebody
ought to be looking into it.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:18.015 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of
how it all started.

00:28:18.015 --> 00:28:20.640 align:middle line:84%
So you have to look at a lot of
cases before you find patterns.

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And after looking at thousands
of missing person reports

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.970 align:middle line:84%
and search and rescue
reports, certain things

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:26.960 align:middle line:90%
float to the surface.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:29.130 align:middle line:90%
And I call them profile points.

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And one of the main ones is is
that when they bring canines

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:35.450 align:middle line:84%
to the scene, the scent
evaporates quickly

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:39.850 align:middle line:84%
and they can't find the
person using the dogs.

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:43.710 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be people
with super high intellect.

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And I've written about
a series of physicists

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:48.170 align:middle line:84%
that have disappeared
and haven't been found.

00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:50.360 align:middle line:84%
There's also a series
of college age men

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:52.610 align:middle line:84%
that have disappeared
and haven't been found.

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to be the cream
of the crop at that higher

00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:00.080 align:middle line:84%
level that seem to disappear
at a higher frequency

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.130 align:middle line:90%
than should be.

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:06.310 align:middle line:90%


00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:08.300 align:middle line:10%
There was a case I
just recently talked

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:12.200 align:middle line:10%
about regarding a
physicist from Germany

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:16.280 align:middle line:10%
who was at a conference in
Lake Arrowhead, California.

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:18.530 align:middle line:84%
He was on a trail with
a group of people.

00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:20.870 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't feel well.

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:22.790 align:middle line:10%
And simultaneously,
the counselor

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:26.180 align:middle line:10%
who was the last in line
also didn't feel well.

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:28.250 align:middle line:84%
So the group went
ahead and the counselor

00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:30.650 align:middle line:84%
and this physicist that
was at the conference, just

00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:32.750 align:middle line:84%
kind of sat on a
rock and waited.

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:35.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, the group
got farther ahead.

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And this physicist got feeling
a little better, he thought.

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't want to
get that far behind.

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And he told the counselor,
I'm going to take off.

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:43.200 align:middle line:84%
The counselor said,
hey, I'll wait here.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.000 align:middle line:90%
Well, he took off.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was the last
time he was ever seen.

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And that was a strange
one because it wasn't

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:52.730 align:middle line:90%
in a real deep wooded area.

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:56.760 align:middle line:84%
It was around Lake Arrowhead,
up above the LA County area.

00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:58.070 align:middle line:90%
And he's never been found.

00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:59.900 align:middle line:90%
It's been several years.

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:04.220 align:middle line:84%
Within the last 18 months,
certain things, again,

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:05.610 align:middle line:90%
keep floating to the surface.

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And one of those
things is we found

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:11.240 align:middle line:84%
is that people of
German ancestry

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:14.240 align:middle line:84%
have disappeared at a higher
frequency than normal.

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:16.790 align:middle line:90%
And it's unexplainable why.

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And there aren't a lot
of archived material

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:21.860 align:middle line:84%
that talk about a
person's ethnicity.

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:25.070 align:middle line:10%
But the times that it is, it
seems as though German comes
