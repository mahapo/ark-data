counteracting gravity in order

encountering mysterious

spherical objects that move
through the air in ways that

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.230 align:middle line:90%

about 100 miles off
the coast of San Diego.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.240 align:middle line:10%
What makes these particular
videos so significant

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.420 align:middle line:10%
is the fact that
in September 2019,

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.760 align:middle line:10%
the official spokesperson
for the Deputy

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.790 align:middle line:10%
Chief of Naval Operations
for Information Warfare

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.590 align:middle line:10%
confirmed publicly--

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.140 align:middle line:10%
>> The Navy designates the
objects contained in these

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.220 align:middle line:10%
videos as unidentified
aerial phenomena.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>> While that statement alone
is of historical significance,

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.690 align:middle line:84%
what the videos themselves
suggest is remarkable.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Ongoing incursions of
unidentified aerial phenomena,

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.000 align:middle line:84%
or UAPs, are being captured
on video by the US Navy

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.190 align:middle line:84%
that maneuver in ways
that are impossible

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.830 align:middle line:84%
for any current, acknowledged
aviation technology.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.370 align:middle line:84%
Might this be a smoking gun
for advanced exotic propulsion

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.340 align:middle line:84%
systems or might these
craft be evidence

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.460 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial
technology from off planet?

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.400 align:middle line:10%
>> When I'm looking at the
Flir videos, for example,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.750 align:middle line:10%
that were released by the Navy,
what I'm seeing is something

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.260 align:middle line:10%
that has a couple
of characteristics.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.960 align:middle line:10%
The one characteristic
that stands out the most

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.110 align:middle line:10%
is that it has no
flight surfaces, right?

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.540 align:middle line:10%
When you want something
to fly in the air,

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.360 align:middle line:10%
you need it to follow
the laws of aerodynamics.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.830 align:middle line:90%
It needs to have wings.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.450 align:middle line:90%
It needs to generate lift.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.060 align:middle line:84%
It needs to be able to
work against gravity.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.960 align:middle line:84%
So it needs to reduce
its drag, and so on.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.630 align:middle line:84%
Now secondly, they also don't
seem to leave any propulsion

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.430 align:middle line:90%
signature.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.270 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not seeing any
sort of exhaust coming out

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.520 align:middle line:90%
of them like you would expect.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's literally defying
the laws of physics

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.130 align:middle line:90%
as we know them.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's outmaneuvering
our pilots.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.690 align:middle line:84%
That is a very fascinating
and incredibly mind-blowing.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:12.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Roger that.

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Commander David Fravor was
leading a training exercise

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.430 align:middle line:84%
from the "USS Nimitz" Carrier
Strike Group when the incident

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.209 align:middle line:90%
occurred.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.320 align:middle line:10%
"The New York Times" reported
in an interview with Fravor

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.650 align:middle line:10%
that the objects appeared
suddenly at 80,000 feet

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.610 align:middle line:10%
and then hurtled toward the
sea, stopping at 20,000 feet

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.740 align:middle line:10%
and just remained hovering.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.900 align:middle line:84%
Then it either dropped
out of radar range

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.180 align:middle line:90%
or shot straight back up.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>> It accelerated like
nothing I've ever seen.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.200 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea what I saw.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.090 align:middle line:84%
It had no plumes, wings, or
rotors, and outran our F-18s.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>> When these craft clearly
demonstrate unconventional

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.570 align:middle line:84%
flight dynamics, there are a
number of hypotheses as to how

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.570 align:middle line:84%
they might be
accomplishing this.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Even though the
Tic Tac seems to be--

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.190 align:middle line:10%
from an outside observer--
seems to be moving at, say,

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.380 align:middle line:10%
20,000 miles an hour, it's
not generating any friction.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.190 align:middle line:84%
Like when a rocket comes
into the earth's atmosphere,

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.680 align:middle line:84%
the reentry problem
and it heats up.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.960 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't happen
with Tic Tac.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.780 align:middle line:84%
See, that doesn't
happen with the Tic Tac.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.920 align:middle line:84%
The way warp drive is it's
like surfing on a wave.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.860 align:middle line:84%
The wave is the curvature of
space, the rippling of space.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.190 align:middle line:84%
So the surfer is
not really moving

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.500 align:middle line:84%
relative to the
water he's around,

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.930 align:middle line:90%
he's moving with the water.

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.780 align:middle line:84%
That's the way
the Tic Tac moves.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.840 align:middle line:84%
But it's controlling the
way the space is warping.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.090 align:middle line:90%
See, it's controlling its path.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And it does it with
small amounts of energy.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.300 align:middle line:84%
So the hardest thing
for people to understand

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.110 align:middle line:84%
is that when you see a
flying saucer or a Tic Tac,

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.160 align:middle line:84%
it's not an ordinary vehicle
that's moving through air.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.460 align:middle line:84%
It's controlling the
gravitational field right

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.440 align:middle line:90%
around its fuselage.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.830 align:middle line:84%
For example, if the Tic Tac
wants to move to the east--

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.110 align:middle line:84%
let's say, if it
moves to the east--

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.670 align:middle line:84%
what it does, it's able to
contract the space in its nose

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.480 align:middle line:84%
and expand the
space in its tail.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.890 align:middle line:84%
It's folding space, sitting
still in space really.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:24.040 align:middle line:84%
But to the outside observer,
it looks as if it's moving.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Warp drive, as
the name implies,

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:31.510 align:middle line:84%
relies on warping space so that
you're stretching space on one

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:36.175 align:middle line:84%
end of your ship and expanding
it by a lot on the other.

00:06:36.175 --> 00:06:39.730 align:middle line:84%
So you're zipping
through space-time.

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:42.820 align:middle line:90%
That's how I like to imagine it.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.791 align:middle line:84%
However, anti-gravity
propulsion is different.

00:06:47.791 --> 00:06:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Anti-gravity is
where you can create

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.490 align:middle line:84%
your own gravitational field
that essentially repels

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.100 align:middle line:84%
or cancels the gravitational
field that you're

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.630 align:middle line:90%
being affected by.

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:02.590 align:middle line:10%
>> Well with anti-gravity, the
big advantage that thing would

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:06.580 align:middle line:10%
have is when you
encounter planets.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.440 align:middle line:84%
You can come and go
off of its surface

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.830 align:middle line:84%
without having to fight all
the gravitational forces

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.560 align:middle line:84%
of a planet, which
would cause you

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.190 align:middle line:84%
to build your ships with
different propulsion systems.

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:24.310 align:middle line:84%
If a warp drive system had
an anti-gravity system, that

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.910 align:middle line:84%
would be real handy because
you use your warp drive to get

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.060 align:middle line:84%
from place to place, switch
over to the anti-gravity

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.850 align:middle line:84%
when you get inside a
gravity field of a planet,

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:38.470 align:middle line:84%
and basically you will have
removed all the energy that's

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:45.730 align:middle line:84%
involved with magnetism, such
as kinetic energy, momentum,

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:50.640 align:middle line:84%
inertia, all that
would evaporate.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.750 align:middle line:10%
>> In his scientific paper, "Is
Low Power Warp Drive Possible,"

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:58.830 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Jack Sarfatti posits the
idea that quantum metamaterials

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:03.390 align:middle line:10%
may be used to produce low
power warp while staying true

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:07.410 align:middle line:10%
to Einstein's general and
special theories of relativity.

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:10.770 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Sarfatti believes he's
discovered a workable way

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:12.750 align:middle line:90%
to fold space-time.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Warp drive is just a
very elementary application

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:20.820 align:middle line:84%
of Einstein's general theory of
relativity of the gravitational

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:21.880 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And Einstein's field
equations basically

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:30.480 align:middle line:84%
show how you can use an
applied electromagnetic field,

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.880 align:middle line:90%
like a source, a pump.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And from that
electromagnetic field,

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:37.530 align:middle line:84%
you can generate a
gravitational field.

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:41.340 align:middle line:84%
The problem has been
that the coupling

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.169 align:middle line:84%
between the
electromagnetic input

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:46.590 align:middle line:84%
field and the induced
gravitational output field

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:47.940 align:middle line:90%
is very weak.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.130 align:middle line:84%
I found a way to
make it very strong.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:54.250 align:middle line:84%
That's simply it, using what
are called metamaterials.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:58.110 align:middle line:84%
Metamaterials are
artificially made.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:59.280 align:middle line:90%
They're made by man.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.960 align:middle line:84%
They don't exist
naturally in nature.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.200 align:middle line:84%
They're just like lattices
of artificial atoms.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.687 align:middle line:90%
We make these artificial atoms.

00:09:05.687 --> 00:09:06.770 align:middle line:90%
They're called meta-atoms.

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:08.370 align:middle line:84%
There are various
ways of making them.

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:09.720 align:middle line:90%
I won't go into detail.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And we just construct them like
they're like a neural network,

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.580 align:middle line:84%
just like lattices,
like crystals.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.370 align:middle line:10%
And these artificial atoms
are at definite positions

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:18.300 align:middle line:10%
of the crystals.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And they have extraordinary
electromagnetic properties.

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.750 align:middle line:90%
When we impose electricity--

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:28.553 align:middle line:84%
so in magnetic fields,
in the metamaterials,

00:09:28.553 --> 00:09:30.720 align:middle line:84%
they could go into what are
called certain resonance

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:31.520 align:middle line:90%
states.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And they can generate
strong gravitational fields.

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:39.000 align:middle line:84%
So the metamaterials
is a way of generating,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.400 align:middle line:84%
inside the metamaterial,
a strong gravity

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:46.020 align:middle line:84%
field from a very weak
electromagnetic field.

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:50.880 align:middle line:84%
>> I think metamaterials are
very important to faster than

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:56.680 align:middle line:84%
light UAPs, or just the idea
of UAPs for two reasons.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.630 align:middle line:84%
First of all, there was
the bismuth magnesium part

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.910 align:middle line:84%
that was theorized
to be a metamaterial.

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:08.070 align:middle line:84%
That really got people thinking
that, OK, maybe metamaterials

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:11.550 align:middle line:90%
are an important part of UAPs.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:13.062 align:middle line:90%
So that's one line of thought.

00:10:13.062 --> 00:10:14.520 align:middle line:84%
The second line of
thought, though,

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.250 align:middle line:84%
of why they would be
important, however,

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:20.130 align:middle line:84%
is just intrinsically
for their value, right?

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:22.740 align:middle line:10%
There's no way you can really
build advanced technology

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.950 align:middle line:10%
that's manipulating electric
fields and, let's say,

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:29.370 align:middle line:10%
coupling with the gravitational
field in some anomalous way

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:32.670 align:middle line:10%
without at least being able
to intelligently manipulate

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.990 align:middle line:10%
and control
electromagnetic waves,

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:39.400 align:middle line:10%
so through vis-a-vis
metamaterials.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.040 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a whole bunch
of optical metamaterials.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.460 align:middle line:10%
But for a space
propulsion, they tend

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.680 align:middle line:10%
to work at the
microwave frequencies.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And they were developing
microwave metamaterial.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Like the Boeing cube, for
example, developed by Boeing.

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:58.780 align:middle line:84%
Interested Boeing was involved
in this classified work.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:01.900 align:middle line:84%
So why are they
working metamaterials?

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.950 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is a connection.

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:06.820 align:middle line:84%
It's possible, like
they talk about the arts

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:11.740 align:middle line:84%
parts, the skin of the craft
that crashed in Roswell,

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.500 align:middle line:90%
that it's layered material.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And that could act
as a metamaterial.

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:24.520 align:middle line:84%
Theoretically, if you took a
5,000 terahertz beam, which

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:28.180 align:middle line:84%
would probably in the far
infrared and aimed it at it,

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:29.580 align:middle line:90%
you should get propulsion.

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:30.830 align:middle line:90%
You should be able to move it.

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:33.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's a form
of metamaterial.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:37.030 align:middle line:84%
It's basically layers
of magnesium and bismuth

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:42.820 align:middle line:84%
that are spaced just right
to interact with this beam.

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.820 align:middle line:84%
>> While the significance of
metamaterials is being explored

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:48.880 align:middle line:84%
by scientists from
different perspectives, Dr.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.210 align:middle line:84%
Jack Sarfatti believes he
understands how to apply them

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:54.190 align:middle line:90%
to the UAP discussion.

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I've discovered, along
with other physicists,

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:59.950 align:middle line:84%
mainly Keith Wanser, full
professor of Physics,

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Cal State Fullerton, we
think we know, in principle,

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:07.390 align:middle line:84%
how to increase the coupling
between electromagnetism

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:10.150 align:middle line:84%
and gravity in order to
control the gravity field with

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:14.690 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetism using
small amounts of energy.

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:17.330 align:middle line:84%
The trick is in
metamaterials we can

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.390 align:middle line:84%
make the effective speed
of light very tiny.

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And by doing that, we
increase the coupling

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.970 align:middle line:84%
between electricity
and magnetism

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:28.420 align:middle line:84%
and the gravitational
field it creates.

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.740 align:middle line:90%
So that's the trick.

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:32.820 align:middle line:84%
We're playing with the
electromagnetic properties

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:36.710 align:middle line:84%
of metamaterial to amplify
the effect of the input

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:40.501 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic field on the
gravitational field it creates.

00:12:40.501 --> 00:12:42.084 align:middle line:84%
>> They're all going
against the wind.

00:12:42.084 --> 00:12:44.570 align:middle line:90%
The wind's 120 knots to the west

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:46.550 align:middle line:84%
>> We can then, with
theoretical physics,

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:49.100 align:middle line:84%
can take a Tic Tac doing
a certain maneuver.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And then from that,
we can calculate

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:54.156 align:middle line:84%
what kind of gravitational
field is required to do that.

00:12:54.156 --> 00:12:55.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Look at that thing!

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.020 align:middle line:90%


00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:57.420 align:middle line:90%
>> It's rotating.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:00.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And then how much energy
do we have available?

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And then we could design a
material that will do it.

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:05.610 align:middle line:10%
You know, it's a
complicated thing,

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:10.040 align:middle line:10%
but with teams of
scientists we can do it.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:14.030 align:middle line:10%
>> That raises the question, how
fundamental are metamaterials

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:16.790 align:middle line:10%
to understanding
how UAPs maneuver?

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:19.610 align:middle line:10%
>> It explains how
those things work.

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:21.390 align:middle line:10%
It's pretty
elementary, actually.

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:22.820 align:middle line:10%
But once you have
the right idea,

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:24.420 align:middle line:10%
everything falls in place.

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.910 align:middle line:10%
There's no mystery.

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.940 align:middle line:84%
I am saying there's no mystery
as to how this technology

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.920 align:middle line:90%
fundamentally works.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:32.760 align:middle line:90%
There's no mystery.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.520 align:middle line:84%
It's just, now, a matter
of engineering development

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.980 align:middle line:84%
of the right kinds
of materials that we

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:41.700 align:middle line:84%
could use to amplify the
effect of electromagnetism

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.190 align:middle line:84%
in creating a
gravitational field.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:47.250 align:middle line:10%
That explains the
close encounters

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:49.440 align:middle line:10%
of the "USS Nimitz,"
the "Roosevelt,"

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.600 align:middle line:10%
and, apparently,
many other close

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.780 align:middle line:10%
encounters that are
still classified.

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:57.220 align:middle line:90%
>> And yet not everyone agrees.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.000 align:middle line:84%
Scientists find no
theoretical consensus

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.490 align:middle line:84%
as to how this
technology functions.

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:05.670 align:middle line:84%
>> When it comes to
describing how the physics

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:09.240 align:middle line:84%
of the unidentified craft
that the "USS Nimitz"

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.030 align:middle line:84%
encountered in 2004
and, in general,

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:14.880 align:middle line:84%
the UAPs that the Navy
have been reporting.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.240 align:middle line:84%
I think that there is a
couple of good guesses

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.750 align:middle line:84%
that I could present as
to how I think it's done.

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:26.100 align:middle line:84%
And only time and empirical
scientific evidence

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.160 align:middle line:84%
will truly tell
us how it's done.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.520 align:middle line:84%
But that being said, what
I believe is happening

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:36.330 align:middle line:84%
is an extremely
controlled interaction

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:39.960 align:middle line:84%
at the quantum level
between gravitons

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.840 align:middle line:84%
and the rest of the
ship in such a way

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:47.490 align:middle line:84%
that they can somehow control
that entire interaction better

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:50.030 align:middle line:90%
than we can.

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:52.970 align:middle line:84%
It has yet to be proven
that gravitons does exist.

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:56.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm assuming they
do in this scenario.

00:14:56.190 --> 00:15:00.110 align:middle line:84%
So they're managing this
interface with space-time.

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And that allows them to be
able to do multiple 1,000 G

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:06.080 align:middle line:90%
maneuvers.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.870 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the average
F-18 would crush

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:11.450 align:middle line:90%
under just 8-10 Gs of forces.

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:14.090 align:middle line:90%


00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:18.020 align:middle line:84%
If the G-forces aren't
being felt and experienced

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:21.170 align:middle line:84%
on the actual ship
and that they are only

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.630 align:middle line:84%
measured and
experienced relative

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:27.650 align:middle line:84%
to our frame of reference,
in that scenario,

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:30.920 align:middle line:84%
the way that they
would be surviving

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:34.740 align:middle line:84%
is what I guess would be
anti-gravity method one.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:38.270 align:middle line:84%
So that would be just canceling
the entire gravitational field

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:39.570 align:middle line:90%
that they're experiencing.

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:42.980 align:middle line:84%
So for them, it doesn't matter
how quickly they accelerate

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.230 align:middle line:84%
left, right, up, or
down, they're calm

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:48.320 align:middle line:90%
and still inside their ship.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.760 align:middle line:90%
That's what it would look like.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:53.960 align:middle line:10%
I think that we can
passively describe

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.510 align:middle line:10%
what we're observing with
current classical physics

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:59.040 align:middle line:10%
and just even today's
quantum physics,

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:02.690 align:middle line:10%
but to truly explain the physics
behind what we're seeing,

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:06.000 align:middle line:10%
we're going to have
to find new physics.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>> So I would prefer thinking
in terms of superluminal

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:12.740 align:middle line:90%
propulsion.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'd deal more with the ether
rather than warping space-time.

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.320 align:middle line:10%
The idea of warp
drive is based on more

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:24.350 align:middle line:10%
of the conventional view of
space-time being warped somehow

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:28.760 align:middle line:10%
and creating a gravity
gradient by warping space-time.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.930 align:middle line:84%
That's based in the general
relativity paradigm, which

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:38.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't ascribe to because I
believe it's a failed paradigm

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:42.450 align:middle line:84%
since it doesn't predict
electrogravitics, for example.

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And there are other
replacements for it.

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:50.300 align:middle line:10%
Superluminal propulsion
is using propulsion

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:53.010 align:middle line:10%
to go faster than
the speed of light.

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:55.070 align:middle line:10%
Well there's
various technologies

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:57.770 align:middle line:10%
you could do to achieve this.

00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:02.110 align:middle line:84%
One is, for example,
Podkletnov's gravity impulse

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:03.500 align:middle line:90%
beam.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.190 align:middle line:10%
He's achieved speeds
of the gravity waves

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:10.369 align:middle line:10%
that his beam puts
out into the thousands

00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:12.089 align:middle line:10%
times the speed of light.

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:14.869 align:middle line:10%
So if you use that
pushing on a spacecraft,

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:17.359 align:middle line:10%
theoretically it could go
thousands of times speed

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:18.530 align:middle line:10%
of light.

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:22.760 align:middle line:84%
Another is Townsend Brown's
electric kinetic thrusters.

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:26.300 align:middle line:10%
Those are less power
hungry, but the question

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:30.920 align:middle line:10%
is would they be able to get
you over the speed of light.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:35.730 align:middle line:84%
The other technology involves
electogravitics, basically.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And with that, you
could go superluminal

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.210 align:middle line:84%
with a minimum amount
of energy expenditure.

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:46.970 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that's actually
the most reasonable to use.

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:50.900 align:middle line:84%
His diagram is from
something I wrote up

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:57.290 align:middle line:84%
in 1985 when I first discovered
about electrogravitics.

00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Here you see a
disk-like craft sort

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:02.480 align:middle line:90%
of levitating in the midair.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And you see the pluses
and minuses on its hull

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.820 align:middle line:90%
represent electric charges.

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about
very high voltages

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:13.550 align:middle line:90%
here in the millions of volts.

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:16.340 align:middle line:84%
Now this gets into
electrogravitics,

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:20.660 align:middle line:84%
how you can create
gravitational potentials

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:22.520 align:middle line:90%
using electric potentials.

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:26.540 align:middle line:84%
This was discovered by
Townsend Brown at the beginning

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.991 align:middle line:90%
of the 20th century.

00:18:28.991 --> 00:18:32.330 align:middle line:10%
T. Townsend Brown, best
known for the phenomena

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:36.110 align:middle line:10%
called the Biefeld-Brown
Effect and electrogravitics,

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:39.020 align:middle line:10%
was an American inventor
whose pioneering research

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:42.230 align:middle line:10%
anti-gravity and
electric fields paved

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:45.380 align:middle line:10%
the way for many other
scientists and researchers that

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:46.400 align:middle line:10%
followed him.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.340 align:middle line:10%
>> In the physics I've been
developing called subquantum

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:53.120 align:middle line:10%
kinetics, the important thing
that comes out of this--

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.130 align:middle line:10%
that you don't see
it anywhere else,

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:57.410 align:middle line:10%
not conventional physics
or any other theory--

00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:02.030 align:middle line:10%
is that negative charges
are anti-gravitic.

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:05.690 align:middle line:84%
Very important to know because
with that just that concept,

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:07.880 align:middle line:84%
you can create all
sorts of engineering

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.310 align:middle line:90%
and space propulsion.

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:13.130 align:middle line:84%
Positive charges
create gravity wells.

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:15.200 align:middle line:84%
So when you charge
the capacitor,

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.490 align:middle line:84%
you're creating a gravity
hill on the negative side

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:20.150 align:middle line:84%
and a gravity well
on the positive side.

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And you create, therefore,
a gravity gradient

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:24.500 align:middle line:84%
through the capacitor
that propels it

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:28.520 align:middle line:84%
in the direction of
the gravity well.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:32.900 align:middle line:84%
>> We seem to be so fixed on
action and reaction drives,

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.720 align:middle line:84%
Newtonian physics,
and linear distances.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.570 align:middle line:84%
So we're probably more
on the warp drive level

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:40.100 align:middle line:90%
where we want to go.

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.580 align:middle line:84%
But even the warp drive,
it won't help that much.

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:47.270 align:middle line:90%
A good example is Voyager.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:49.880 align:middle line:90%
You have the Captain Janeway.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And they got caught in a
wormhole and got spit out I

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:58.010 align:middle line:84%
think it was over in the
Alpha quadrant of our galaxy.

00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And she's told her crew
9.3 warp, running 24/7,

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:07.320 align:middle line:84%
it's going to take us
75 years to get home.

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.740 align:middle line:90%
That's a little upsetting.

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:13.590 align:middle line:84%
However-- and that's
in warp drive.

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Once again, warp drive is not
that good for linear distance.

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:21.068 align:middle line:84%
Einstein put a challenge
out on us one time.

00:20:21.068 --> 00:20:23.610 align:middle line:84%
He asked everybody, he said,
how can you go millions of times

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:28.920 align:middle line:84%
faster than the speed
of light and not

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.830 align:middle line:90%
break the speed of light?

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:33.420 align:middle line:90%
How are you going to do that?

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:34.620 align:middle line:90%
Figured out a way to do it.

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:36.510 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example here.

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:40.440 align:middle line:84%
What you have here
is Milky Way galaxy.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.900 align:middle line:84%
What you have over
here is Andromeda.

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.780 align:middle line:84%
Now to get across this
page on a straight line

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:51.210 align:middle line:84%
at speed of light, which is
186,756 miles per second,

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:54.270 align:middle line:84%
it would take you 200
million years at that speed

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:56.190 align:middle line:90%
to get across this page.

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:59.010 align:middle line:84%
Well that's just not
going to be acceptable,

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:00.690 align:middle line:90%
because life forms--

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:03.670 align:middle line:84%
you know 80 years for
us, maybe a couple

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:08.620 align:middle line:84%
hundred for others, but
not no 200 million years.

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:11.610 align:middle line:90%
So you got to cut that down.

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:14.430 align:middle line:84%
In my drive, I'm not
really moving that much

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:17.430 align:middle line:84%
on a linear plane
as I am becoming

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:19.530 align:middle line:90%
an artificial black hole.

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And you pull the fabric
of time around yourself,

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:24.930 align:middle line:84%
jump through it's
dimensional barriers,

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:27.900 align:middle line:84%
shut it off, come on the other
side of it, and there you are.

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And you get around
pretty good that way.

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:33.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm pretty sure a lot
of the life forms,

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:38.240 align:middle line:84%
they're using some kind of
form like that, of drive.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>> David Adair has not only
worked on advanced propulsion

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:45.020 align:middle line:84%
systems, but has also witnessed
advanced technologies housed

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:48.650 align:middle line:84%
at the highly classified
military base commonly referred

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:49.970 align:middle line:90%
to as Area 51.

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:54.440 align:middle line:90%


00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.690 align:middle line:84%
Could the technology
he observed have been

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:59.430 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial in origin?

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>> This giant thing
sitting up there?

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:03.770 align:middle line:90%
No weld lines.

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:05.300 align:middle line:90%
No seams.

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:06.120 align:middle line:90%
No nuts.

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:06.920 align:middle line:90%
No bolts.

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.300 align:middle line:90%
No screws.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:14.420 align:middle line:84%
It looked like it just
grew into this machine.

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:15.820 align:middle line:90%
Now how did you do that?

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:19.148 align:middle line:90%


00:22:19.148 --> 00:22:22.040 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't us.

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.530 align:middle line:90%
And this thing was exoskeleton.

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:28.580 align:middle line:84%
It looked organic, but
it's an inorganic machine

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:32.960 align:middle line:84%
that has all the characteristics
of organic organism.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.840 align:middle line:84%
You know how you pull
an engine out of a car,

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.070 align:middle line:90%
set it on the ground?

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:39.950 align:middle line:84%
There is the car over
there, here's the engine.

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:41.460 align:middle line:90%
Same thing.

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:46.010 align:middle line:84%
So this power plant, by
proportional size of it,

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:48.980 align:middle line:84%
I could estimate the size
of the craft it came out of.

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:53.450 align:middle line:84%
It came out of something the
size of an aircraft carrier.

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:56.120 align:middle line:90%
This thing was powerful.

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:59.960 align:middle line:84%
This thing had the power
of the sun on steroids.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:04.340 align:middle line:84%
Inside the magnetic fields, the
magnetic walls in this thing,

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:06.110 align:middle line:90%
it looked like--

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:07.670 align:middle line:90%
first how it's shaped.

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:10.250 align:middle line:90%
Its skeleton was on the outside.

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:12.200 align:middle line:90%
And I mean the skeleton.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:17.090 align:middle line:84%
They looked like
vertebrates, and shinbones,

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:18.410 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:20.185 align:middle line:90%
You had two round spheres.

00:23:20.185 --> 00:23:23.180 align:middle line:84%
It looked like two
octopuses having sex.

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:28.460 align:middle line:84%
All the tentacles was
the piping of the plasma

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.095 align:middle line:90%
drives of the shields.

00:23:30.095 --> 00:23:32.570 align:middle line:84%
It's in a figure
eight formation.

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And this thing
probably at idle, it'd

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:43.380 align:middle line:84%
be 100 million degrees
centigrade at idle.

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:46.850 align:middle line:84%
That 10,000 times
hotter than our sun.

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:48.380 align:middle line:90%
It could be a heat transfer.

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:53.240 align:middle line:84%
Like you have electromechanical
into electric into electric.

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:59.360 align:middle line:84%
It could be sheer propulsion,
equal and opposite reaction.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:02.210 align:middle line:84%
If you put a plasma
being down the cord

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:05.690 align:middle line:84%
line of this thing, the center
of it, and open up an orifice,

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:07.580 align:middle line:84%
you would have a
spew of material

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:12.970 align:middle line:84%
going out of there that
would be endless, eternity.

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:19.050 align:middle line:84%
What I learned is, first
thing, you're not alone.

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:22.630 align:middle line:84%
Very first thing, there is
somebody else out there.

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that
I heard voices.

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:29.650 align:middle line:90%
It's impressions, feelings.

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:32.050 align:middle line:90%
These beings are old.

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:34.750 align:middle line:84%
They're born between
the galaxies.

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Where we thought it was just
dark matter, deep space,

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:43.030 align:middle line:84%
nothing, they said, no, there's
entire solar systems out there.

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:46.450 align:middle line:84%
Just recently Hubble
has found solar systems

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:48.220 align:middle line:90%
between the galaxies.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:49.060 align:middle line:90%
We didn't know that.

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.760 align:middle line:90%

Dr. Jack Sarfatti
believes this may also

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:08.050 align:middle line:10%
be characteristic of the
infamous Tic Tac UAP.

>> The machine itself
is a conscious entity.

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:13.590 align:middle line:84%
So the hull, the
fuselage of Tic Tac

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:16.140 align:middle line:84%
is a special kind of
metamaterial which also, it

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:18.990 align:middle line:84%
turns out, is a
conscious computer.

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:21.250 align:middle line:84%
It's a conscious
artificial intelligence,

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:22.530 align:middle line:90%
artificial neural network.

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:24.540 align:middle line:84%
The metamaterial is
kind of like the brain,

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:26.920 align:middle line:84%
like neurons in the
brain, the metamaterial.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.800 align:middle line:84%
So the metamaterial,
it can generate

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.520 align:middle line:90%
a strong gravitational field.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And it also generates
consciousness.

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:35.820 align:middle line:84%

00:26:51.718 --> 00:26:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And it said it was a
computer aboard a spacecraft

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:58.350 align:middle line:84%
from the future, and that I was
part of a group of young kids

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:00.030 align:middle line:90%
that they were contacting.

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And was I willing to
be part of the project?

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:10.570 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yes, although I was
scared, but I'm compressing it.

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:12.315 align:middle line:10%
But the point is
that they said that I

00:27:12.315 --> 00:27:15.180 align:middle line:10%
would begin to meet others in
20 years in the future, which

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:59.420 align:middle line:10%
1972 until 1991, classified

"parapsychology."

the UK, France, and Italy
are going to develop

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:13.660 align:middle line:84%
actually reverse engineered
extraterrestrial technology?

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:15.106 align:middle line:90%

[VOICE OVER RADIO]

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:21.560 align:middle line:84%
>> In the photos that you have
of this UFO, your Tic Tac,

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.750 align:middle line:84%
I believe that's
reverse engineered.

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:27.740 align:middle line:84%
The reason why,
it's clumsy looking.

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:29.930 align:middle line:84%
It's not all that
real sophisticated.

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:32.570 align:middle line:84%
You got this little blunt
thing moving through the air.

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's linear
moving, obviously.

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:39.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's confined on a linear
basis, point A to point B.

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:45.260 align:middle line:84%
It's probably using some
kind of action reaction.

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:49.430 align:middle line:84%
Or, that thing could very well
be using a magnetic field,

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:54.600 align:middle line:84%
because you see no exhaust
or intakes or anything on it.

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.720 align:middle line:90%
So it could be doing that.

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:59.960 align:middle line:10%
But I've just kind of feeling
it's reverse engineered,

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:05.210 align:middle line:10%
because it's just doesn't
have the slickness

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:09.650 align:middle line:10%
of an alien intellect on it.

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:11.390 align:middle line:90%
It's human.

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:13.850 align:middle line:90%
And we've probably cheated.

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:19.010 align:middle line:84%
We've copied some little alien's
paper and jumped to that.

00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And when you copy
something, you're

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:23.270 align:middle line:90%
not the original inventor.

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:25.850 align:middle line:84%
There's stuff that you
don't know about it,

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:27.260 align:middle line:90%
but you're just mimicking it.

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:30.080 align:middle line:90%


00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:34.320 align:middle line:84%
We're not as sophisticated
as people think we are.

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:38.100 align:middle line:84%
There may be certain
fractions of humans

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:40.980 align:middle line:84%
that have access to
technology that would

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:44.490 align:middle line:90%
be 24th, 25th century level.

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's annoying
to think about

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:49.920 align:middle line:84%
that somebody has
access to that and we're

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:54.090 align:middle line:84%
over here with chemical
rockets and told to celebrate.

00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:56.200 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] God.

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:59.620 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know.

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:02.200 align:middle line:84%
I think we got a lot of
reverse engineered stuff.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:05.620 align:middle line:84%
I saw something one time
and there were two of them.

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:06.550 align:middle line:90%
They were crafts.

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:09.160 align:middle line:84%
They looked like
flying arrowheads.

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:12.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's the way I saw them
that made it really cool.

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:16.050 align:middle line:84%
Just one out of
a billion chance,

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:18.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm leaning against
the back of a pool.

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And the sun went down
behind the building.

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Now you're not blinded
by the yellow ball,

00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:26.280 align:middle line:84%
but you see the
corona perfectly.

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Well flying into the corona,
as it came into the corona,

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:31.932 align:middle line:90%
it solid up.

00:31:31.932 --> 00:31:33.390 align:middle line:84%
As it's passing
through the corona,

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:35.130 align:middle line:90%
it's completely visible.

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:37.440 align:middle line:90%
Looks like a flying arrowhead.

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:40.500 align:middle line:84%
Goes out and when it goes
out, starts disappearing.

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:43.470 align:middle line:84%
When it's out of the
corona, completely gone.

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:45.420 align:middle line:84%
One second later, here
comes another one right

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:46.220 align:middle line:90%
underneath it.

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:47.460 align:middle line:90%
There's two of them.

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:48.780 align:middle line:90%
And did the same thing.

00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:54.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm going, my god, the sun's
corona decloaked these things.

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And the direction they were
going from where I was setting,

00:31:57.610 --> 00:32:00.570 align:middle line:84%
they were heading
straight for Area 51.

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:03.570 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, we got
stuff like that.

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:06.660 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think we're
far along as everybody

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:09.240 align:middle line:90%
thinks we are.

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:15.010 align:middle line:84%
I think we give way too much
credit to these covert groups

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:18.820 align:middle line:84%
when they're made up of
people just like you and me.

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:21.940 align:middle line:90%
Their IQ can't be 500.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:25.270 align:middle line:84%
They just got access to
stuff we haven't seen.

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:28.460 align:middle line:90%


00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Could you imagine you
turn over a Nissan Altima

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:33.230 align:middle line:90%
and give it to a caveman?

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:35.397 align:middle line:84%
How far are they going to
get along with that thing?

00:32:35.397 --> 00:32:37.490 align:middle line:90%
Not too far.

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:38.480 align:middle line:90%
We're the same way.

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.430 align:middle line:90%
We've got these vehicles.

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:43.640 align:middle line:84%
We probably don't even know
what 5% of them work on it.

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:46.160 align:middle line:84%
We do it trial by error,
which could be real dangerous,

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.707 align:middle line:90%
get you killed doing that.

00:32:47.707 --> 00:32:50.910 align:middle line:90%

>> Dr. Paul LaViolette
also questions the origins

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:56.490 align:middle line:90%
of the Tic Tac technology.

00:32:56.490 --> 00:33:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>> One possibility is that the
Tic Tac technology was reverse

00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:03.360 align:middle line:84%
engineered from an
extraterrestrial craft.

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:09.090 align:middle line:84%
But I think more probable,
we developed it on our own.

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Because, basically, if you
know about Townsend Brown's

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:15.510 align:middle line:84%
electrogravitics, you
know about Tesla's work

00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:18.690 align:middle line:90%
with non-reversing pulses.

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:21.120 align:middle line:84%
Tesla was working
with negative pulses,

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:22.920 align:middle line:90%
which are anti-gravitic.

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And he was observing
forces pushing with these.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:31.450 align:middle line:84%
Somebody's going to click
and say, OK, if we use this,

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:35.730 align:middle line:84%
we can use this in terms
of space propulsion.

00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:39.180 align:middle line:84%
So with a little
experimentation and money

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:42.960 align:middle line:84%
thrown into the project, they
would have developed this.

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe it's very possible
that this technology is

00:33:46.050 --> 00:33:47.520 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial.

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:49.000 align:middle line:90%
And how do I know that?

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.560 align:middle line:84%
Because nobody can
prove that it's not.

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:56.820 align:middle line:84%
There's literally not
a single physicist--

00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:59.400 align:middle line:84%
the very fact that we can't
even describe the physics,

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.440 align:middle line:84%
our physics isn't
even accurate enough

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:03.960 align:middle line:84%
to properly encode
what's being observed

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:08.489 align:middle line:84%
and explain it should tell us
how far behind we are whoever

00:34:08.489 --> 00:34:10.739 align:middle line:90%
is making that technology.

00:34:10.739 --> 00:34:15.690 align:middle line:84%
Because everybody is still
on combustion-based vehicles

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:18.540 align:middle line:84%
and machines, I see
no reason to believe

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:21.060 align:middle line:90%
that it's human technology.

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:25.230 align:middle line:84%
Whoever owns that technology
will become god on Earth.

00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:27.780 align:middle line:90%
And I see no such person.

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:30.840 align:middle line:90%


00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>> I have no reason to
think there aren't aliens,

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.929 align:middle line:84%
but I think the only advanced
intelligences that are

00:34:36.929 --> 00:34:41.370 align:middle line:84%
interested in humans on this
planet are our future selves

00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:44.159 align:middle line:84%
who want to come back, who will
have to come back in order that

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:47.699 align:middle line:84%
everything that they don't
disrupt the timeline.

00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:51.320 align:middle line:90%
It's a self-creation process.

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:55.520 align:middle line:84%
In quantum mechanics,
in quantum physics,

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:59.600 align:middle line:84%
you have to have the
future influencing

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:04.550 align:middle line:84%
the present in addition to the
past influencing the present.

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:09.080 align:middle line:84%
That's what nonlocal quantum
entanglement is all about--

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:12.600 align:middle line:84%
the future influencing
the present.

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:17.400 align:middle line:84%
The machine itself is
a conscious entity.

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:21.810 align:middle line:10%
>> The discovery of special
relativity by Einstein in 1905

00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:25.500 align:middle line:10%
and of quantum mechanics in
the 20th century by Einstein,

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:30.780 align:middle line:10%
Planck, Bohr, Schrodinger, and
Heisenberg led to the creation

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:36.490 align:middle line:10%
of the atomic hydrogen bomb,
as well as computer chips,

00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:40.750 align:middle line:10%
the world wide web, and Silicon
Valley's multibillion dollar

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:42.340 align:middle line:10%
corporations.

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:45.520 align:middle line:84%
The lesson is that breakthroughs
in fundamental physics,

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:47.980 align:middle line:84%
both theoretical
and experimental,

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:52.090 align:middle line:84%
have always led to
profound paradigm shifts.

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:55.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Well I believe that free
energy and advanced space

00:35:55.690 --> 00:35:58.330 align:middle line:84%
propulsion technologies,
anti-gravity,

00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:03.790 align:middle line:84%
and so on will have a very
positive impact on humanity.

00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:07.240 align:middle line:84%
It will be disruptive
to the old technologies,

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:10.390 align:middle line:90%
but it could be phased in.

00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Man, if you get any of these
propulsion units, anti-gravity,

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:20.890 align:middle line:84%
warp drive, fusion containment,
you get any of these things

00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:25.090 align:middle line:84%
online, then you
got Star Trek, man.

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:27.040 align:middle line:90%
You got star ships.

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And vast distances
would not be a problem.

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:34.480 align:middle line:84%
The very essence of
where you're at in life

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:37.360 align:middle line:84%
will change if these
kind of technologies

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:41.590 align:middle line:84%
roll up and out onto the
platform that we can use them.

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:44.360 align:middle line:90%
And it will affect your life.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:45.910 align:middle line:90%
And I don't care who you are.

00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:50.120 align:middle line:84%
If you're just a ditch digger,
it's going to affect your life.

00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.765 align:middle line:84%
>> Well what are
the implications?

00:36:51.765 --> 00:36:53.390 align:middle line:84%
What were the
implications for humanity

00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:55.035 align:middle line:90%
when they discovered fire?

00:36:55.035 --> 00:36:56.660 align:middle line:84%
What were the
implications for humanity

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:57.945 align:middle line:90%
when they discovered writing?

00:36:57.945 --> 00:36:59.570 align:middle line:84%
What were the
implications for humanity

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:01.842 align:middle line:90%
when they discovered gunpowder?

00:37:01.842 --> 00:37:03.675 align:middle line:84%
What were the implications
for humanity when

00:37:03.675 --> 00:37:05.120 align:middle line:90%
they discovered electricity?

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:05.930 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:08.462 align:middle line:84%
What were the implications
when they discovered computers?

00:37:08.462 --> 00:37:09.420 align:middle line:90%
Well this is like that.

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:10.610 align:middle line:90%
This is next step.

00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:13.070 align:middle line:90%
This is the big thing.

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:16.730 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
surviving death.

00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:19.730 align:middle line:84%
We understand how human souls
are generated in matter.

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:21.410 align:middle line:84%
We understand that
now in principle.

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:24.290 align:middle line:90%
We understand it.

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And we understand
how these things fly.

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:30.840 align:middle line:84%
We understand how to
manipulate space and time.

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:33.660 align:middle line:90%
We are the conquerors of time.

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:36.907 align:middle line:84%
We are the conquerors
of space and time.

00:37:36.907 --> 00:37:37.740 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:40.130 align:middle line:90%
It means the stars are ours.

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:44.030 align:middle line:90%
We are going to be men like God.

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:46.100 align:middle line:84%
The point is that
civilization itself

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:47.840 align:middle line:90%
was created from the future.

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:51.620 align:middle line:90%
I call this the destiny matrix.

00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:52.945 align:middle line:90%
There is nothing bigger.

00:37:52.945 --> 00:37:54.320 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
bigger than this.

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:57.170 align:middle line:90%


00:37:57.170 --> 00:38:00.350 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is the
future creating itself,

00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:03.710 align:middle line:84%
then could that future also
include us reverse engineering

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:07.250 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial technology
to fly in ways conventional

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:08.960 align:middle line:90%
aircraft cannot?

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:11.540 align:middle line:84%
Or might that future
creating itself

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:13.790 align:middle line:84%
allow for human
ingenuity to create

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:15.830 align:middle line:90%
these remarkable machines?

00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And if so, why is this
technology being suppressed?

00:38:20.570 --> 00:38:23.120 align:middle line:10%
Either way, the
Tic Tac technology

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:28.700 align:middle line:10%
is a smoking gun that demands
more scientific scrutiny.

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:30.980 align:middle line:84%
In our next episode,
we examine the pyramid

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:35.210 align:middle line:84%
shape UAPs that appeared over
the Kremlin and Pentagon.

00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Might this be a
message for humanity?

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:39.550 align:middle line:90%
