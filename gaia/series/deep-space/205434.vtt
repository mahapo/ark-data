00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>> What we experience through
our mind and senses are all

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.910 align:middle line:90%
part of our reality--

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.620 align:middle line:84%
what we hear, what we
see, what we touch.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.410 align:middle line:84%
But what if life
as we think of it

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.000 align:middle line:84%
is only part of a
much greater story?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.100 align:middle line:84%
Throughout history,
many scholars

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.770 align:middle line:84%
have postulated an
assortment of theories

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.110 align:middle line:84%
to explain the fundamental
nature of reality.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.390 align:middle line:84%
One of these theories
suggests the universe

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.160 align:middle line:90%
is like a hologram.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.450 align:middle line:84%
They believe that our 3D reality
is more like a projection

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.450 align:middle line:84%
from a flat
two-dimensional field that

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.760 align:middle line:84%
exists on a thin surface at
the edge of the universe.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.670 align:middle line:84%
As extraordinary
as this seems, it's

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.070 align:middle line:84%
a theory that
initially emerged years

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.660 align:middle line:84%
ago from scientists
studying black holes.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.260 align:middle line:84%
If this is the case and
the universe is a hologram,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.500 align:middle line:84%
then it begs the
question, what are we?

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.930 align:middle line:84%
Are we existing as
light projections

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.610 align:middle line:90%
within the hologram?

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And how might that impact
our perception of reality?

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Holographic reality--
the physical that isn't.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.280 align:middle line:10%
And how we can appear
to be experiencing

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.500 align:middle line:10%
a world of solidity when
it's nothing of the kind.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.930 align:middle line:90%
>> It's similar to video games.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.710 align:middle line:10%
When you're moving in three
dimensions in a video game,

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.169 align:middle line:10%
what you're really
doing is just changing

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.020 align:middle line:10%
two-dimensional pixels,
and changing the colors,

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.010 align:middle line:10%
and making it seem like you're
moving in different dimensions.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.800 align:middle line:84%
When you look at these
scenarios, like the black hole,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.430 align:middle line:84%
you start realizing
that, OK, maybe this

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.480 align:middle line:84%
might just be a giant
hologram of some sort.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:34.340 align:middle line:84%
>> We are living in a reality
where the base form is

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.600 align:middle line:84%
waveform, waveform
information like Wi-Fi.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And the five senses pick up
that waveform information.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.390 align:middle line:84%
They turn it into
electrical information.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.070 align:middle line:84%
They communicate
it to the brain.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And then the brain decodes
it into digital holographic

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.340 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.730 align:middle line:84%
It's the same information, but
in a different decoded form.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.767 align:middle line:84%
Just as the information
in a Wi-Fi field

00:03:04.767 --> 00:03:06.350 align:middle line:84%
looks very different,
even though it's

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.540 align:middle line:84%
the same information,
when it's decoded

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.140 align:middle line:90%
onto the screen of the computer.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>> According to Professor Kostas
Skenderis at the University

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.390 align:middle line:84%
of Southampton, the idea is
similar to that of ordinary

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.580 align:middle line:84%
holograms where a 3D image is
encoded in a two-dimensional

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.870 align:middle line:84%
surface, such as in the
hologram on a credit card.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.990 align:middle line:10%
However, this time, the
entire universe is encoded.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.170 align:middle line:10%
>> So the idea of the
holographic universe is

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.640 align:middle line:10%
a similar idea where there is a
higher reality that is the true

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.690 align:middle line:10%
reality.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And it is the source
of this reality.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And then that higher
reality has encoded

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.720 align:middle line:84%
a substrate of some kind
with this information.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a
coherent source of energy

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.170 align:middle line:90%
that flows through that.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And then that
information projects

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.740 align:middle line:90%
into this physical universe.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.200 align:middle line:84%
So with the
holographic universe,

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.330 align:middle line:84%
it's saying that the
most fundamental thing

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.830 align:middle line:90%
in this universe is information.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And then that
information informs

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.459 align:middle line:84%
how the universe is formed,
whether it's in form of energy,

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.510 align:middle line:84%
forces, particles, and so
forth, through even us.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.440 align:middle line:10%
>> And some of the more
recent developments,

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.520 align:middle line:10%
certainly in my theories with
the holographic mass solution,

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:36.450 align:middle line:10%
where we see that the universe
very much acts like a hologram

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:43.560 align:middle line:10%
in terms that it seems that
all the information is present

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.800 align:middle line:10%
in every point.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.400 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, in
the theory I'm writing,

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.490 align:middle line:84%
we were able to figure
out, for instance,

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.030 align:middle line:84%
the correct temperature
for the background

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.270 align:middle line:84%
radiation of the universe, the
correct size of the universe,

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.130 align:middle line:84%
the correct mass
for the universe,

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.570 align:middle line:84%
the correct values for many
of the fundamental constants

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.500 align:middle line:84%
of the universe just
by studying one proton.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.450 align:middle line:84%
In the dynamics of that one
proton is all the information

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.730 align:middle line:84%
necessary to understand
the whole universe,

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.470 align:middle line:84%
which is very much a
holographic principle.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And so there is
a lot of evidence

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.730 align:middle line:84%
that's emerging supporting
a holographic view

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.530 align:middle line:84%
of the mechanics
of our universe.

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.510 align:middle line:90%


00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Physicist Leonard Susskind,
one of the originators

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.860 align:middle line:84%
of the holographic principle,
has stated that a hologram

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.880 align:middle line:84%
takes three dimensions of
information and stores it

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.370 align:middle line:90%
on a 2D surface.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.070 align:middle line:84%
In the same way,
even though objects

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:53.600 align:middle line:84%
are physically consumed by black
holes, all of their information

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.280 align:middle line:84%
remains imprinted on the
event horizon as a hologram.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.950 align:middle line:10%
>> The information
that creates us,

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.180 align:middle line:10%
creates a physical universe,
comes from the very edge

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.880 align:middle line:10%
of our own physical universe.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.710 align:middle line:84%
But in the same way that
we look at a hologram

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.740 align:middle line:84%
and we can perceive some
kind of 3D perspective to it,

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.110 align:middle line:84%
that's exactly what
is going on down here.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.220 align:middle line:84%
So everything that we see,
everything that we feel

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.940 align:middle line:90%
is simply a projection.

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.540 align:middle line:90%


00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like a sea of
information or a sea of energy.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And waves on that
ocean, they intersect.

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And that forms the
information patterns

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:39.430 align:middle line:84%
that, then, project
into the universe.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:44.200 align:middle line:84%
>> When the wave is the ocean
and the ocean is the wave,

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.220 align:middle line:84%
when the universe is within the
proton and the proton is within

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:55.370 align:middle line:84%
the universe, understanding this
fundamental perspective is key.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.180 align:middle line:84%
The implication here
is that the universe

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:02.710 align:middle line:84%
is the flow of information
where each point of information

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.970 align:middle line:90%
contains the whole of creation.

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:09.440 align:middle line:84%
>> It's as if all the
information is in every point,

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.550 align:middle line:90%
then all scales are related.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:19.150 align:middle line:10%
And so the scalar relationship
from, for instance,

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.210 align:middle line:10%
all the way from the
Planck scale all the way

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:26.350 align:middle line:10%
to the universal scale going
with protons, electrons,

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:30.130 align:middle line:10%
planets, stars, galaxies,
superclusters, and so on,

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.940 align:middle line:10%
all these scales are
like fractal division

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.850 align:middle line:10%
of this holographic
structure of space.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And so this fractal
division of the space

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:47.770 align:middle line:84%
that produces all of the scales
in the holographic structure

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:53.630 align:middle line:84%
means that every scale is then
embedded in every other scale.

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:56.860 align:middle line:84%
So from every scale,
you have access

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:01.840 align:middle line:84%
to the network of information
of all the other scales.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, you can
see the universe and creation

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.990 align:middle line:84%
as a whole as
information transfer

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:15.640 align:middle line:84%
across scales, from infinitely
big to infinitely small,

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.780 align:middle line:84%
like a flow of
information in which we

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:25.480 align:middle line:84%
are at one of the scales, at
the center between the Planck

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.600 align:middle line:90%
in our universe.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And so we are part of
this information flow.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:35.200 align:middle line:84%
The event of self-awareness,
and consciousness, and so on,

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.210 align:middle line:90%
being part of that flow.

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And that means that from
being part of that hologram,

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:45.940 align:middle line:84%
from being part of this
fractal, holographic structure,

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:50.260 align:middle line:84%
you have access to all the
information, information

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:51.850 align:middle line:90%
that's non-local to you.

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:55.300 align:middle line:84%
That means information that's
not necessarily directly

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:59.260 align:middle line:84%
in your environment, but maybe
information about something

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.380 align:middle line:84%
very far away from
you because everything

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:06.280 align:middle line:84%
is entangled into this
holographic nature

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.980 align:middle line:90%
of our universe.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>> This suggests that the
information comprising what we

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:17.420 align:middle line:84%
perceive as 3D reality is
stored on a 2D surface,

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:19.270 align:middle line:90%
including time.

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:21.430 align:middle line:84%
This means,
essentially, everything

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:24.700 align:middle line:84%
we see and experience
that appears as real

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:28.020 align:middle line:90%
may, in fact, be an illusion.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>> So this reality is a
holographic dream, in effect.

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:38.990 align:middle line:90%
But it seems so real.

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:42.800 align:middle line:84%
When so many of our
dreams don't seem real.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.830 align:middle line:90%
We know they're dreams.

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:44.630 align:middle line:90%
We wake up.

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.080 align:middle line:90%
We say I've had a dream.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:51.970 align:middle line:84%
But this one seems
incredibly real,

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:56.170 align:middle line:84%
because of the
power of the mind.

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:59.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't know
about your dreams.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:04.330 align:middle line:84%
I dream often in three
dimensions, if you like.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:10.090 align:middle line:84%
I experience in my dreams what
appears to be the world that I

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:11.830 align:middle line:90%
experience here.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:13.480 align:middle line:90%
But how can that be?

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Because we accept that dreams
are actually going on here.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.880 align:middle line:90%
So it can't be physical, can it?

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:25.720 align:middle line:84%
We're having
multiple experiences

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:29.710 align:middle line:84%
at the same time over multiple
dimensions at the same time.

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:34.180 align:middle line:84%
But the one we are actually
aware of that seems real

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:35.590 align:middle line:90%
is this one.

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:39.940 align:middle line:84%
As the brain decodes this
waveform information into what

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.520 align:middle line:90%
appears to be this solid world.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:46.880 align:middle line:90%


00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>> We share our existence with
other holographic universes,

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.590 align:middle line:84%
if you like, that
coexist with us.

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And they can be seen
as a part of what might

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:01.380 align:middle line:90%
be seen as the multiverse.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.490 align:middle line:84%
The multiverse itself
would be the source.

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:07.950 align:middle line:90%
That would be the projectionist.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:10.470 align:middle line:84%
In other words, that
which is creating

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.110 align:middle line:90%
all of this in the first place.

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:16.800 align:middle line:84%
But then what is the
projector itself?

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.220 align:middle line:84%
The projector is,
essentially, what

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:26.010 align:middle line:84%
we would call the ether,
the actual structure

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:32.670 align:middle line:84%
of the multiverse through
which information is carried.

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:38.910 align:middle line:84%
We are living in a multifaceted
series of dimensions

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:42.630 align:middle line:84%
or universes that all
overlay each other,

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:46.980 align:middle line:84%
and are all accessible,
and that are bound together

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:49.920 align:middle line:84%
by some kind of
primordial source.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And that primordial source is
what I call the mind of God.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.350 align:middle line:84%
Note that I said
the mind of God.

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.910 align:middle line:90%
I didn't say God himself.

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:04.730 align:middle line:84%
This is all thought, all
consciousness bound together

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:08.570 align:middle line:84%
through the process of
quantum entanglement.

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:12.470 align:middle line:84%
Quantum entanglement is the
idea that every particle

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:14.960 align:middle line:90%
that's created has a twin.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And no matter how far
away those twins get,

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.260 align:middle line:90%
they are still entangled.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:25.100 align:middle line:84%
They are still linked
instantaneously.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.110 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
if you tweak one,

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:30.020 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter how far
away the other one gets,

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:33.980 align:middle line:84%
it will respond in an
equal and opposite manner

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.920 align:middle line:90%
instantaneously.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:40.950 align:middle line:10%
>> As a layperson trying to
understand consciousness,

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:43.580 align:middle line:10%
which I think is what
we're talking about here,

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:47.720 align:middle line:10%
I believe we are all
part of a consciousness.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Some would call the
source, whether you

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.760 align:middle line:84%
want to label that with
bigger names or whatever.

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.670 align:middle line:84%
I call it the source,
universal awareness,

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:58.350 align:middle line:90%
lots of different names.

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>> One time, I believe it was
Wolfgang Pauli or Schrodinger,

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:05.960 align:middle line:84%
one of those fathers of
modern quantum physics.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And they asked how many minds
are there in the universe?

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:13.670 align:middle line:90%
And the answer was one.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:15.350 align:middle line:90%
There's only one mind.

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And so we may
experience ourselves

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:20.720 align:middle line:84%
as having these
individual minds.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.730 align:middle line:10%
Like my mind is mine.

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:25.520 align:middle line:10%
But in reality,
we are tuning in.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:29.630 align:middle line:84%
Our brain is like a receiver,
like a radio receiver,

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:33.140 align:middle line:84%
for this field of
consciousness and mind

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.520 align:middle line:90%
that we are all bathing in.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.680 align:middle line:90%
We're like fish in the sea.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.230 align:middle line:84%
So similar to the
fish maybe not knowing

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:41.270 align:middle line:84%
that there's water
around it, we are

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:43.140 align:middle line:90%
in the sea of consciousness.

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And we may not know that there's
consciousness all around us,

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:48.590 align:middle line:84%
and we're just tuning in to
these different frequencies

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:51.380 align:middle line:84%
or stations of
consciousness based on how

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.390 align:middle line:90%
we have tuned our frequency.

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's by our will
and our intention

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:59.000 align:middle line:84%
that we shift our dial to
tune in to different levels

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.385 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:14:00.385 --> 00:14:03.300 align:middle line:90%


00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:07.380 align:middle line:84%
>> If the universe is a
hologram, that means we are,

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:08.640 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.740 align:middle line:84%
This may mean that
each one of us

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:15.360 align:middle line:84%
contains the entire
universe within ourselves.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:20.760 align:middle line:84%
>> If you take the holographic
print, that waveform print,

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:25.290 align:middle line:84%
and you cut it into four
and fire the laser at each

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:33.460 align:middle line:84%
of the four pieces, you will not
get a quarter of the picture.

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:39.970 align:middle line:84%
You will get a quarter-sized
version of the whole picture.

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:45.120 align:middle line:84%
So every part of the hologram
contains the information

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.520 align:middle line:90%
of the whole hologram.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.130 align:middle line:90%
>> What does this actually mean?

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.470 align:middle line:84%
What it means is
that our reality

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:57.450 align:middle line:84%
is the product of a
multi-dimensional emanation

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:00.010 align:middle line:90%
coming from a primary source.

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:04.350 align:middle line:84%
So almost like a singularity
that as it emanates out,

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:09.300 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like it is broken
up, like light through a prism.

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And that every single ray
that comes through that prism

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:16.710 align:middle line:84%
could be seen as an
individual universe.

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And that that thereafter
is broken up again,

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:21.570 align:middle line:90%
and again, and again.

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And all we, ultimately, are
is one part of that emanation.

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:31.687 align:middle line:10%
>> Information is the main
fundamental building block

00:15:31.687 --> 00:15:34.020 align:middle line:10%
of this universe, at least
that's what science is saying

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:36.360 align:middle line:10%
now with the holographic model.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.490 align:middle line:84%
That information is
most fundamental.

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And then that information
informs what gets manifested

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:44.880 align:middle line:84%
or what gets materialized
out of the quantum field.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.120 align:middle line:84%
So those particles
and energy, everything

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:52.410 align:middle line:84%
that we experience here in
this sensory, physical world,

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.610 align:middle line:90%
is real.

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:57.180 align:middle line:84%
It's just informed
by information

00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:02.700 align:middle line:84%
that comes from a source
beyond this physicality.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:05.100 align:middle line:84%
>> If the universe
is holographic,

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:09.840 align:middle line:84%
the question people often ask
is why does it appear solid?

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:13.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Well there's a misconception
about what we call the material

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:14.715 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:16:14.715 --> 00:16:22.710 align:middle line:84%
If you look really precisely
at what the material world is,

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:26.790 align:middle line:84%
you don't actually
find a thing, right?

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:28.860 align:middle line:90%
It's not a thing.

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:33.420 align:middle line:84%
Like if you look at an atom,
if you look at a proton, what

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:34.420 align:middle line:90%
are you seeing?

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, you're
seeing 99.9999999% space.

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:45.720 align:middle line:90%
The atom is mostly space.

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:49.920 align:middle line:84%
So right there, you know
it's not that thing.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.480 align:middle line:90%
It's not a billiard ball.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:55.140 align:middle line:90%
It's actually a no thing.

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.030 align:middle line:90%
It's mostly space.

00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And the boundary that we define,
that we see, that we touch,

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:09.150 align:middle line:84%
that we bounce against
is a electrostatic field

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:13.619 align:middle line:84%
that is basically a little
bit of oscillating energy.

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And this electromagnetic
oscillating energy

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:21.210 align:middle line:90%
bounce against each other.

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:23.790 align:middle line:90%
And it feels like solid.

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:27.630 align:middle line:90%
It's like solid space, right?

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at the protons
in the nuclei of the atom,

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:33.450 align:middle line:90%
we find the same thing.

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:38.850 align:middle line:84%
All we can say about a proton is
that there is a region of space

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:43.350 align:middle line:84%
where there's a little bit of
a denser electromagnetic field

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:45.280 align:middle line:90%
or denser electrostatic field.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.830 align:middle line:84%
We call it the
particle and so on.

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:50.010 align:middle line:84%
But basically all
we're describing

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:53.160 align:middle line:84%
is little energy
advance in the space.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.070 align:middle line:90%


00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:59.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Based upon the research
and conclusions of American

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:04.320 align:middle line:10%
scientists David Bohm and Karl
Pribram a universe in which

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:08.700 align:middle line:10%
individual brains are
actually indivisible portions

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:12.600 align:middle line:10%
of the greater hologram and
everything is holographically

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:16.600 align:middle line:10%
interconnected, the
parapsychological phenomena,

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:20.280 align:middle line:10%
such as telepathy, may
merely be the accessing

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.530 align:middle line:10%
of the holographic level.

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:27.300 align:middle line:84%
>> To put it another way, in
a universe that is a hologram,

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:32.040 align:middle line:84%
our brain, indeed every neuron
and every atom in our brain,

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:37.500 align:middle line:84%
contains, in some semblance,
the whole universe.

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And we are truly all
part of a global mind.

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe our brain is like
a physical modem for translating

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.740 align:middle line:90%
our multidimensional awareness.

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:53.130 align:middle line:84%
So it's giving us something
in a physical form for us

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:56.610 align:middle line:84%
to be able to relate to and
have a physical experience.

00:18:56.610 --> 00:19:02.340 align:middle line:84%
But consciousness, whether you
call that mind, is nonphysical.

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:06.960 align:middle line:84%
The way that I've come to
understand reality is this--

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:13.440 align:middle line:84%
we have a physical container of
a certain frequency with mind.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.860 align:middle line:10%
I call the brain the modem
that allows us to translate it

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.870 align:middle line:10%
into physical form so that we
can actually understand it.

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:21.900 align:middle line:10%
So that's what the brain is.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.630 align:middle line:10%
But consciousness,
whether you call

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:30.390 align:middle line:10%
that mind, is non-physical,
is an awareness

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:35.130 align:middle line:10%
that is connected to
humanity's the matrix,

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:38.580 align:middle line:10%
but also to humanity's
consciousness,

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.270 align:middle line:10%
if you like as well.

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're doing is
having an individual perception

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:49.140 align:middle line:84%
through our human brain
of a human experience that

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:52.500 align:middle line:84%
will be different for everyone
perceiving that same consensus

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.330 align:middle line:90%
reality.

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:58.750 align:middle line:84%
So that we have all
that unique experience,

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:01.920 align:middle line:84%
but ultimately we're all coming
from the same place, which

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.680 align:middle line:84%
is our consciousness, which
is connected to everything,

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:08.400 align:middle line:84%
not just human beings,
but the star beings,

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:12.090 align:middle line:84%
the interdimensionals,
and all creatures.

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Just because we see it
as solid, doesn't mean it

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.010 align:middle line:90%
isn't conscious.

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:21.640 align:middle line:84%
It just means that we are not
aware of its consciousness.

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:26.260 align:middle line:90%
>> The body is the mind.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:33.500 align:middle line:84%
The body is just a decoded,
holographic expression

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:34.760 align:middle line:90%
of the mind.

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:38.090 align:middle line:84%
Yes, even the body,
everything is holographic.

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:42.170 align:middle line:84%
Therefore we are decoding
the energetic fields

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:44.210 align:middle line:84%
that we call the body,
the information fields,

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:48.080 align:middle line:84%
the waveform fields
into the very body

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:51.050 align:middle line:90%
that we think we're inhabiting.

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And our perceptions will dictate
the nature of how we do that

00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:01.870 align:middle line:90%
and how we experience that body.

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:05.950 align:middle line:84%
>> I wouldn't say that the
holographic universe is

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:07.540 align:middle line:90%
a product of mind.

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:13.240 align:middle line:84%
I would say that the
dynamics of information

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:17.360 align:middle line:84%
flow through the
structures of our universe,

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:21.010 align:middle line:84%
or of the holographic,
fractal universe,

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:25.360 align:middle line:84%
produce the effect
that we call mind

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.610 align:middle line:90%
or that we call consciousness.

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:30.760 align:middle line:84%
But that effect
is at every scale,

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:34.000 align:middle line:90%
it's not isolated to the human.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.410 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that in order for the
human to become self-aware,

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:43.090 align:middle line:84%
it had to have all the steps
of evolution along the way

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:44.450 align:middle line:90%
to get to there.

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:50.920 align:middle line:84%
So every bit of that is part of
the mind, of the consciousness,

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.680 align:middle line:90%
of the evolution of the whole.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.290 align:middle line:84%
It's one thing
learning about itself.

00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And so you could say it
from that perspective

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:06.070 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness and the
mind is present at all levels.

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:11.140 align:middle line:84%
It's the result of this
evolutionary transformation

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:15.280 align:middle line:84%
that's occurring every
billionth of a second everywhere

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:18.250 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:22.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Bohm and Pribram have also
suggested that many religious

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:26.560 align:middle line:84%
and mystical experiences, such
as a feeling of transcendental

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:30.970 align:middle line:84%
oneness with the universe, may
also be due to the accessing

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:33.250 align:middle line:90%
of the holographic realm.

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:37.690 align:middle line:84%
As they note, perhaps the
reason so many great mystics

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:40.690 align:middle line:84%
of the past have talked
about experiencing

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:43.870 align:middle line:84%
a feeling of oneness
with all things

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:45.820 align:middle line:84%
is simply that they
have learned how

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:47.890 align:middle line:84%
to reach that part
of their minds

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:52.930 align:middle line:84%
in which all things really
do possess cosmic unity.

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:58.630 align:middle line:84%
>> The mechanism that
information is transferred

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:01.660 align:middle line:84%
on a multidimensional
level throughout,

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:05.650 align:middle line:84%
not just this universe,
but every universe.

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And the information
that is being conveyed

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:12.310 align:middle line:84%
is the same as what we
would call consciousness.

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And that consciousness is the
product of human interaction

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:23.710 align:middle line:84%
or the interaction of any life
form with a primordial source

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:28.000 align:middle line:84%
of knowledge, of
wisdom, which I like

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.840 align:middle line:84%
to refer to as the
mind of God, something

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.420 align:middle line:90%
that is all information.

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:38.770 align:middle line:84%
Every aspect of life
anywhere in the universe,

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:41.530 align:middle line:84%
not just in our universe,
but every universe

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:43.960 align:middle line:90%
is contributing to this.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.060 align:middle line:90%
And that this is the source.

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And that the conveyance of this
information through the ether

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:57.640 align:middle line:84%
allows the manifestation
of the physical reality.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:01.130 align:middle line:84%
>> As a layperson, I
just see it as frequency.

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:03.860 align:middle line:84%
So for me, we're
in a 3D frequency,

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:06.640 align:middle line:84%
which everything appears
solid, but, obviously, really,

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.970 align:middle line:84%
everything isn't solid in terms
of what science is showing us.

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:11.830 align:middle line:90%
It's all molecular.

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:14.860 align:middle line:84%
You go to the very atom and
that there's nothing actually

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:16.160 align:middle line:90%
solid at all.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's only because we are
perceiving it as solid simply

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:24.670 align:middle line:84%
because we're the same frequency
as whatever it is around us.

00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:27.610 align:middle line:84%
That's why we can't see
spirits, or at least some of us

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:29.950 align:middle line:84%
can't see spirits because
they're a different frequency.

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And extraterrestrials are
a different frequency.

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:35.800 align:middle line:84%
So as we expand in our
consciousness and awareness,

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:40.520 align:middle line:84%
the more we can see those other
realities and frequencies.

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:44.990 align:middle line:84%
>> The theory that reality as
we consciously experience it is

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:49.760 align:middle line:84%
actually a hologram goes back
to many ancient cultures around

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:54.335 align:middle line:84%
the world who believed that we
exist in a dream or illusion.

00:24:54.335 --> 00:24:57.150 align:middle line:90%


00:24:57.150 --> 00:25:00.720 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the best examples
of the ancients having

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:03.690 align:middle line:10%
an understanding of what we
would call the holographic

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:07.480 align:middle line:10%
universe is the Hebrew Kabbalah.

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And this talks about the fact
that the physical universe

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:15.120 align:middle line:84%
in which we live is
merely emanations

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:20.220 align:middle line:84%
of a primordial divine
source before he entered

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:23.250 align:middle line:90%
into the physical world.

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:27.000 align:middle line:84%
There was like this
lightning bolt of activity

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.870 align:middle line:84%
that penetrated through
into physical reality

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:34.200 align:middle line:84%
and penetrated
through into humanity.

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And that we all have some facet
of that original emanation

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:42.090 align:middle line:90%
within us.

00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:46.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Many of them said they
got this from the sun gods,

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:47.940 align:middle line:90%
wherever.

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:53.190 align:middle line:84%
They knew that the
material world was actually

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:56.040 align:middle line:90%
the result of a deeper reality.

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And this deeper
reality is actually

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:04.450 align:middle line:84%
a field of information that's
occurring at the quantum scale.

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And so what we see in our
world is really the iceberg tip

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:14.490 align:middle line:90%
of what reality is.

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And those discovery
meet nicely with some

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:24.510 align:middle line:84%
of these ancient knowledge about
the deeper meaning of reality.

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:28.290 align:middle line:90%


00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Assuming that we're living
in a holographic reality,

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:35.640 align:middle line:84%
what then are the
implications for humanity?

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:40.080 align:middle line:84%
>> The implication of living in
a holographic universe would,

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:44.590 align:middle line:84%
essentially, mean that
we are part of a larger,

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:46.500 align:middle line:90%
higher dimensional object.

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And it would be prudent
for us to figure out

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.670 align:middle line:90%
what that object is.

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:53.970 align:middle line:84%
Because in theory, if we
could get and understand

00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:56.850 align:middle line:84%
that object in its
entirety, we would

00:26:56.850 --> 00:26:59.640 align:middle line:84%
be able to know what
direction humanity is headed.

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:03.872 align:middle line:84%
We would be able to see the
universe front and back.

00:27:03.872 --> 00:27:06.780 align:middle line:84%
We would essentially time
travel in many respects

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.580 align:middle line:84%
if we could actually
see the entire,

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:11.160 align:middle line:84%
let's say, four-dimensional
object that we're part of

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.020 align:middle line:90%
or a higher dimensional object.

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And so it would be
kind of like finding

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:19.670 align:middle line:90%
the cheat codes to the matrix.

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>> If we could understand that
we exist within a multiverse,

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:31.370 align:middle line:84%
and that overlaid on our own
physical reality are multiple

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:35.000 align:middle line:84%
other universes,
quite literally,

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:41.360 align:middle line:84%
then an understanding of this
process could bring us closer

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:46.310 align:middle line:84%
to the intelligences, and, thus,
the knowledge and wisdom that

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:51.320 align:middle line:84%
might be held by
beings, consciousness,

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:55.220 align:middle line:84%
intelligences as a whole
that exist within these other

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:57.230 align:middle line:90%
realms.

00:27:57.230 --> 00:28:03.010 align:middle line:84%
So to try and find out the route
back to the original source

00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:09.490 align:middle line:84%
could, then, take us beyond
that into these other universes.

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:12.250 align:middle line:84%
>> We are
multidimensional beings.

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And we have so
much more potential

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.420 align:middle line:84%
to direct the course
of things here.

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:20.050 align:middle line:84%
So rather than being
in reaction to all

00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:22.090 align:middle line:84%
these outer
circumstances that we're

00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:24.550 align:middle line:84%
presented with in
our world, we can

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:29.500 align:middle line:84%
shift into being more
realizing that we are at cause.

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And through our consciousness
and through our remembering

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:36.400 align:middle line:84%
of who we really are, and the
potential that's within us,

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:39.440 align:middle line:84%
and the fact that we
are the source of this,

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:42.970 align:middle line:84%
then that is when we can really
shift the course of things.

00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:45.130 align:middle line:84%
That is when we can
really start to put

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:48.040 align:middle line:84%
in new codes and new
information into this hologram

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:51.130 align:middle line:84%
and then manifest it here
in this physical reality.

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:54.160 align:middle line:84%
>> The take away, if we believe
that this is a holographic

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.530 align:middle line:84%
universe and we
are all part of it,

00:28:56.530 --> 00:28:59.350 align:middle line:84%
is not to take
life too seriously,

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:04.150 align:middle line:84%
to enjoy the adventure, and to
realize that it's offering us

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:07.690 align:middle line:84%
so much awareness
and understanding.

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And that at the end
of the day, it's

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:14.290 align:middle line:84%
far better to see your
reality in that way

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:19.320 align:middle line:84%
than as a victim of it, because
it's quite exciting down here.

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:22.670 align:middle line:90%


00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:26.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that if there is
an intelligence behind this

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:30.200 align:middle line:84%
holographic universe, it
would be, what I guess,

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:34.070 align:middle line:84%
would be some sort of
like alien simulator.

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:37.580 align:middle line:84%
It would have to be somebody
or something extremely

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:40.820 align:middle line:84%
interested in
creating simulations

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:44.040 align:middle line:84%
of this universe
for whatever reason.

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:47.930 align:middle line:84%
So I would almost have to
venture that it's a scientist,

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:50.510 align:middle line:90%
but maybe that's bias.

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>> It really is a self
introspective of our being,

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:59.720 align:middle line:84%
about who we are, of who
we are in relationship

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.790 align:middle line:90%
to the universe, to reality.

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:03.240 align:middle line:90%
How come we're here?

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.880 align:middle line:90%
How come we're where?

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:08.160 align:middle line:90%
How come we have self-awareness?

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.860 align:middle line:90%
How did this happen?

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:13.130 align:middle line:84%
What are the mechanisms
that made that happen?

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And then we can
align our technology

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:20.930 align:middle line:84%
to the same mechanism so
that we become harmonious.

00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:23.600 align:middle line:84%
It teaches us about
the fact that we

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:27.620 align:middle line:84%
are all part of the
same source, and that we

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:32.600 align:middle line:84%
should unify as human beings
and take care of each other,

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:36.650 align:middle line:84%
and support each other,
and transform our society

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:41.330 align:middle line:84%
to a society that's thriving
instead of a society that's

00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:47.780 align:middle line:84%
struggling in conflict trying
to have more of the resources

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:48.630 align:middle line:90%
than others.

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And this can lead, this
understanding these physics,

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:56.870 align:middle line:84%
can lead to the unification
of the human race.

00:30:56.870 --> 00:31:00.200 align:middle line:90%


00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>> We are the
imagination of ourselves.

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's that imagination
that manifests

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:16.340 align:middle line:84%
in the way we decode information
into holographic reality

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:21.470 align:middle line:84%
and, thus, the nature of
the physical experiences

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:23.670 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:26.690 align:middle line:84%
But the great news
is now that we

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:31.670 align:middle line:84%
are in a time when
people are beginning,

00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:37.490 align:middle line:84%
like never before in my
experience, to question again,

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:40.580 align:middle line:84%
not only what's really
behind world events but,

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:43.700 align:middle line:90%
hey, what is this place?

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:46.620 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:48.890 align:middle line:90%
What is going on?

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And the answers will
transform this world.

00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And it will
transform human life.

00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:00.270 align:middle line:90%


00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:03.330 align:middle line:84%
>> In a universe where
individual minds are actually

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:07.110 align:middle line:84%
fractals of the greater
hologram and everything is

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:11.550 align:middle line:84%
interconnected, the holographic
universe theory may well be

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:18.060 align:middle line:84%
the intersection of cosmic unity
where science and spirituality

00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:19.440 align:middle line:90%
merge as one.

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:22.610 align:middle line:90%


00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:25.970 align:middle line:84%
In our next episode
of "Deep Space,"

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:29.630 align:middle line:84%
think energy, frequency,
and the role of plasma

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:31.580 align:middle line:84%
if you want to
understand the universe.

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:34.030 align:middle line:90%
