00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Perhaps the most intriguing
planet in the solar system is

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.070 align:middle line:90%
Mars.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.110 align:middle line:84%
For years, there's
been speculation as to

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.720 align:middle line:84%
whether or not there was
an active civilization

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.160 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.440 align:middle line:84%
In the late 19th century,
Giovanni Schiaparelli

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.790 align:middle line:84%
thought he saw a canal
network on the planet.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.520 align:middle line:84%
Later, Percival Lowell would
also make the same claim.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.500 align:middle line:84%
The famous scientist
Nikola Tesla

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.040 align:middle line:84%
thought he was hearing
radio signals from Mars.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Mars was always seen as a
very interesting place to go.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.518 align:middle line:84%
In the past, people that
were looking at Mars

00:01:11.518 --> 00:01:13.060 align:middle line:84%
through primitive
telescopes believed

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.430 align:middle line:84%
that they were seeing
canals, or large areas that

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.870 align:middle line:90%
were being built intelligently.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.820 align:middle line:84%
So there's always been
this pull towards Mars.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And of course, as
telescopes got better,

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.753 align:middle line:84%
the canal theory was
originally disproven.

00:01:22.753 --> 00:01:24.670 align:middle line:10%
But I think that they're
covering something up

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.160 align:middle line:10%
because when you analyze the
images coming off the NASA

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.352 align:middle line:10%
servers from all
the Mars missions,

00:01:29.352 --> 00:01:31.060 align:middle line:10%
you begin to see that
there may have been

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.910 align:middle line:10%
some type of advanced structures
and some type of a water system

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.680 align:middle line:10%
existing on Mars.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1726, Jonathan
Swift wrote his satire,

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.240 align:middle line:84%
"Gulliver's Travels," in which
he relates that Mars has two

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.930 align:middle line:90%
moons.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.840 align:middle line:84%
More than 150 years
later, two moons

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.980 align:middle line:90%
were discovered orbiting Mars.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.390 align:middle line:84%
They're called
Phobos and Deimos.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.570 align:middle line:10%
These two moons are one of
the most mysterious aspects

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.760 align:middle line:10%
of our Mars exploration.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.260 align:middle line:10%
>> Take the moons of Mars.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.810 align:middle line:90%
They are two very small rocks.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.963 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they couldn't
cause an eclipse at all.

00:02:05.963 --> 00:02:06.880 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they're small.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.360 align:middle line:10%
They're not even
round like our moon.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.950 align:middle line:10%
And those moons
are very strange.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.010 align:middle line:84%
They orbit in
opposite directions.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.640 align:middle line:84%
Early on as well, a
number of scientists,

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.560 align:middle line:84%
including Soviet
scientists, suggested

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.050 align:middle line:84%
that the moons of Mars
were artificial somehow.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.650 align:middle line:84%
Because they just didn't
seem like natural objects

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.320 align:middle line:90%
that a planet would have.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.470 align:middle line:84%
If there is some
habitation there,

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.920 align:middle line:84%
it would probably, again,
be inside of those moons.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And those months may well
be hollow objects, too.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.560 align:middle line:84%
>> We should go boldly where
man has not gone before.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.710 align:middle line:90%
Fly by the comets.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:47.660 align:middle line:90%
Visit an asteroid.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.320 align:middle line:90%
Visit the moon of Mars.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.140 align:middle line:84%
There's a monolith there,
a very unusual structure

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.650 align:middle line:84%
on this little
potato-shaped object.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.900 align:middle line:84%
When people find out about
that, they're going to say,

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.950 align:middle line:90%
who put that there?

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.270 align:middle line:90%
Who put that there?

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.370 align:middle line:90%
Well, the universe.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.360 align:middle line:84%
>> The monolith that's on Phobos
has been talked about for many,

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.260 align:middle line:90%
many years.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.530 align:middle line:10%
And I believe that this
structure which, first of all,

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.760 align:middle line:10%
it's miles high, number one.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.440 align:middle line:10%
You could tell by the shadow.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.440 align:middle line:84%
It's very easy to
get a size on this.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.700 align:middle line:84%
So you see that it's a
supermassive structure coming

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.750 align:middle line:84%
up vertically out of this
oblong type of a moon.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.270 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the moon
itself is actually artificial.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And this structure
potentially is artificial.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.500 align:middle line:84%
It could have been a command
center, a command post.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.072 align:middle line:84%
It could have been a lookout
overseeing the planet.

00:03:33.072 --> 00:03:35.030 align:middle line:84%
It could've had many,
many functional purposes.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.910 align:middle line:84%
But I just don't believe it's
a natural rock formation.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.597 align:middle line:10%
>> In 2009, a photograph was
taken by one of the Mars probes

00:03:41.597 --> 00:03:44.180 align:middle line:10%
of something on Mars that would
appear to be sticking straight

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.278 align:middle line:10%
up out of the sand.

00:03:45.278 --> 00:03:47.570 align:middle line:10%
Since then, numerous photographs
have been taken of it.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.300 align:middle line:10%
There's four or
five different sets.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.100 align:middle line:10%
And in all of them, it
appears to look exactly

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.650 align:middle line:10%
like the monolith from
"2001, A Space Odyssey."

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.800 align:middle line:10%
It has the exact same height,
width, and proportion.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.960 align:middle line:10%
It's casting a
shadow that indicates

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.870 align:middle line:10%
it has this rectangular
monolithic shape.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.020 align:middle line:84%
And to me, the weirdest part
of it is when you look at it,

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.870 align:middle line:84%
there's sort of a raised mound
around it that it's sitting in.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.540 align:middle line:10%
And when you look at the footage
from "2001," where they uncover

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.230 align:middle line:10%
the monolith on
the moon, there's

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.708 align:middle line:10%
this raised mount where they've
dug out around the thing.

00:04:17.708 --> 00:04:19.250 align:middle line:10%
And the monoliths
are sticking in it.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And in the film, they
said the only thing

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.710 align:middle line:84%
we know about it for
sure, sir, is that it's

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.300 align:middle line:90%
about four million years old.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And it appears to have
been deliberately buried.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.340 align:middle line:10%
And if you look
at the photographs

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.970 align:middle line:10%
of the monolith
on Phobos, you can

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.050 align:middle line:10%
see that the mound upon
which this thing is inserted

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.400 align:middle line:10%
is a different color
than the soil around it.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.200 align:middle line:10%
It's much darker.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.600 align:middle line:84%
That is an indication that
somebody dug up the soil

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.410 align:middle line:84%
and put it around this thing
to bury it to keep it there.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.660 align:middle line:84%
So it appears to be,
like the monolith

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.060 align:middle line:84%
in "2001," an object that
was deliberately buried.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.450 align:middle line:10%
>> It hasn't been covered up
by natural erosion or other

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:57.250 align:middle line:10%
forces.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.470 align:middle line:10%
It seems to have been
deliberately buried.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:01.670 align:middle line:10%
>> Deliberately buried.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.980 align:middle line:10%
>> Deliberately buried.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.230 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a lot of evidence
pointing to the fact that

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Phobos may not be a real
moon, that it may be an actual

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.410 align:middle line:90%
artificial structure.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.890 align:middle line:84%
First of all, the moon
itself has been scanned.

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And it actually
appears to be hollow.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.570 align:middle line:10%
This is actual real data
coming from the official space

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:18.410 align:middle line:10%
agencies.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.240 align:middle line:84%
Now also, on top
of that, the moon

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.210 align:middle line:90%
is actually losing its orbit.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.120 align:middle line:84%
It's actually slightly
degrading in orbit,

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.810 align:middle line:84%
which means it doesn't have
enough mass to sustain itself.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And that, again, tells
you and verifies the fact

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.290 align:middle line:90%
that it may be a hollow moon.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.320 align:middle line:84%
Now when you look at very
close images of this moon,

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.980 align:middle line:84%
if you want to call it
that, you can see these00

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.718 align:middle line:90%
what looks like weapons fire.

00:05:38.718 --> 00:05:41.010 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't look like just
random rocks were hitting it,

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.635 align:middle line:84%
and you have little
tiny pockets there.

00:05:42.635 --> 00:05:45.260 align:middle line:84%
It looks like it was like when
something just came across it

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.140 align:middle line:90%
and fired at it several times.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And there's even octagonal
and hexagonal anomalies

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:51.920 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of
this thing, which

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.470 align:middle line:84%
if you were to maybe get a
lot of that ancient dust off,

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.420 align:middle line:84%
there may be something you
can see through there or maybe

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.670 align:middle line:90%
some technology there as well.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.150 align:middle line:90%


00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And then there's the oddball
photos from the Soviet Space

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:10.170 align:middle line:84%
Missions there in the late '80s
where they sent their own probe

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.900 align:middle line:84%
to Mars, which was
also called Phobos.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.610 align:middle line:10%
And it took a photo of this
huge airship moving along,

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:18.990 align:middle line:10%
right along Phobos.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.590 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the airship itself
was bigger than the moon.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Phobos has always been
this really interesting body

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:26.460 align:middle line:90%
in the solar system.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.072 align:middle line:90%
It's supposedly a moon of Mars.

00:06:29.072 --> 00:06:31.530 align:middle line:84%
It appears to really just be
nothing more than an asteroid.

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.522 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting thing about
it is, as far back as 1989,

00:06:34.522 --> 00:06:36.480 align:middle line:84%
when it was first
photographed by the Phobos II

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.460 align:middle line:84%
probe the Russians
sent up, you can

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.720 align:middle line:84%
see this weird, wire-mesh kind
of cross hatching pattern on it

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.920 align:middle line:90%
even in those early images.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And now, when we go with newer
probes like Mars Reconnaissance

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Orbiter, and Mars Global
Surveyor, the ESA's Mars

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.700 align:middle line:84%
Express Mission, they take
photographs of Phobos.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.290 align:middle line:84%
And we can now see
in great detail

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:59.200 align:middle line:84%
that there are lines on this
body running at 90 degree

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.000 align:middle line:90%
angles.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.208 align:middle line:90%
And that's just not possible.

00:07:01.208 --> 00:07:03.510 align:middle line:84%
If they're caused
by boulders, I don't

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.910 align:middle line:84%
know how the boulders on
Phobos run at 90 degree angles

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:06.710 align:middle line:90%
to each other.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:08.610 align:middle line:84%
It's just a very,
very weird phenomenon.

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.430 align:middle line:84%
But it fits with the idea
that actually what's happening

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.380 align:middle line:84%
is that Phobos has
this underlying

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.520 align:middle line:84%
sort of cross-hatching
90 degree mesh.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.210 align:middle line:84%
>> I think Phobos, given
its orbit around Mars,

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:25.650 align:middle line:84%
and its size, it's not an
object that would be captured

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:29.250 align:middle line:84%
in the way a conventional moon
would be captured by a planet.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.780 align:middle line:90%
It's orbiting too close to Mars.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And that would be
indicative of some kind

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:39.960 align:middle line:84%
of artificial
construction of Phobos.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And that any space probes
that try to get too close

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.790 align:middle line:90%
are simply blown out of the sky.

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:50.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Many well-known scientists,
like the late Carl Sagan,

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:52.910 align:middle line:84%
have speculated that a
hollowed-out asteroid might

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:57.510 align:middle line:84%
make the best and safest vehicle
for a long-term space travel.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:00.370 align:middle line:84%
The hard rock surface would
protect inner inhabitants

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:02.920 align:middle line:84%
from radiation and
the occasional strike

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.780 align:middle line:90%
from another asteroid.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:09.460 align:middle line:84%
But is there an easy way
to hollow out an asteroid?

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:12.520 align:middle line:84%
>> How would you
create a hollow moon?

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, here's how
you would do it.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.960 align:middle line:10%
You'd go to the asteroid
belt, grab yourself

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.970 align:middle line:10%
a nice, big asteroid.

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And with your super technology
and whatnot, your tractor beam,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.970 align:middle line:84%
you bring it to Mars, or
the Earth, or whatever.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:29.320 align:middle line:84%
And then, like a glass
blower blows glass,

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:35.409 align:middle line:84%
you would take that asteroid,
make it a molten blob

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:39.159 align:middle line:84%
and then blow it
up as molten rock.

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:41.200 align:middle line:90%
And it will solidify.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.230 align:middle line:84%
And it could be a round
shape like our moon,

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:48.880 align:middle line:84%
or more sort of oddball-shaped
like Phobos and Deimos are.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:53.890 align:middle line:84%
But then, you're going to have
a craft that's solid and sturdy

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:57.290 align:middle line:84%
and a cavity inside it
which could be occupied.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And it may well be
that the moons of Mars

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.670 align:middle line:90%
are like that, hollow.

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And our own moon is also
possibly hollow too.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.400 align:middle line:84%
>> While the moons of
Mars are intriguing,

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.460 align:middle line:84%
there are many odd things on
the surface of Mars that deserve

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:12.260 align:middle line:90%
closer attention.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:16.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's a lot
of evidence that Mars,

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.940 align:middle line:84%
at some point in its history,
was very fertile and habitable.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.430 align:middle line:84%
That's something that
scientists now widely agree on,

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:27.470 align:middle line:84%
that their study of Mars'
atmosphere and the surface

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:32.010 align:middle line:84%
shows that they were once
vast, flowing water on Mars,

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:34.580 align:middle line:84%
that there was
vegetation on Mars,

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.950 align:middle line:84%
and much more oxygen
than there is now.

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:40.340 align:middle line:10%
So there's agreement
that, millions of years

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:44.270 align:middle line:10%
ago, that Mars was a
very lush, fertile place.

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:47.030 align:middle line:84%
We know that there have been
a number of whistleblowers

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:49.970 align:middle line:84%
who have come forward to
talk about Mars actually

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:53.180 align:middle line:84%
being a place that is
populated by extraterrestrial

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:54.650 align:middle line:90%
civilizations.

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:58.070 align:middle line:84%
What I find fascinating
is that the CIA actually

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:59.840 align:middle line:90%
was also interested in this.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And they got one of their remote
viewers, Joseph McMoneagle,

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.990 align:middle line:90%
to remote view ancient Mars.

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is actually
one of the CIA files

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.780 align:middle line:84%
that was recently released
on the CIA website.

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.190 align:middle line:90%
It's called CREST.

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And so there you can
actually read the data

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:20.630 align:middle line:84%
where the remote viewer, who
we know now is McMoneagle,

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:23.120 align:middle line:84%
but who's unidentified
in this document,

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.570 align:middle line:84%
talks about a civilization
on Mars fleeing

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:30.410 align:middle line:84%
Mars during some great
cataclysmic events

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:34.820 align:middle line:84%
that is destroying the
surface or the environment.

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And the atmosphere
on Mars is all

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:40.550 align:middle line:84%
being destroyed through
some great cataclysm.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:44.180 align:middle line:84%
The refugees are being
taken to some other world.

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's described
as a very kind

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.190 align:middle line:84%
of volcanically-active
world, which

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:52.830 align:middle line:84%
tends to fit what the Earth
would have been like, say,

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:56.870 align:middle line:84%
500,000 to a million years ago,
much more active volcanically,

00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:00.730 align:middle line:84%
especially in places
like Antarctica.

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:04.850 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1975, Nasa launched
the Viking Probe to Mars

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:07.400 align:middle line:84%
to photograph the
surface of the planet.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.590 align:middle line:84%
The mission imaged
an odd artifact

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:12.710 align:middle line:84%
on the surface that
looked like a human face.

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:16.400 align:middle line:84%
It became known as
the face on Mars.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.130 align:middle line:84%
>> When we analyzed the
enigmatic face on Mars,

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:21.320 align:middle line:84%
we see something
that's totally amazing.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.780 align:middle line:84%
What's really interesting
is, if you go back to 1956,

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.660 align:middle line:84%
Jack Kirby actually
wrote a book.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And on the cover of this
book, there's a face on Mars

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:32.250 align:middle line:84%
long before we even got to
Mars or even saw a face.

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:33.050 align:middle line:90%
How could this be?

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:34.370 align:middle line:84%
How did we know that this
was going to be there?

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And how in the world could
that face look exactly

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:38.600 align:middle line:90%
like the one that's on Mars?

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.670 align:middle line:10%
Much later, Nasa
tried to cover it up

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.140 align:middle line:10%
and say that the
face didn't exist.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And they tried to show
different light angles

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:46.007 align:middle line:84%
to say that the face was
there and it was just

00:11:46.007 --> 00:11:47.300 align:middle line:90%
a trick of light and shadow.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.830 align:middle line:84%
But further image analysis did
show that the face was real.

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:51.830 align:middle line:90%
And it really did exist.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And it was actually a
very massive structure

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:55.650 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of Mars.

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:57.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's really an
amazing structure.

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And it also proves
that maybe there

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:02.120 align:middle line:84%
was some type of advanced
civilization on Mars

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.655 align:middle line:90%
at one time in the distant past.

00:12:04.655 --> 00:12:08.040 align:middle line:84%
>> There's no real reason why
Mars couldn't have had a past

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.320 align:middle line:84%
civilization, even today
could hold some kind

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.250 align:middle line:90%
of a civilization.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:14.070 align:middle line:84%
We know there's water
there and an atmosphere.

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, some people, like
George Leonard and others,

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:19.920 align:middle line:84%
have suggested that there's
atmosphere on the moon,

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:24.120 align:middle line:84%
that our moon and Mars
are not so different.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Both are desert
planets, in a sense--

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:28.020 align:middle line:84%
though Mars has
a lot more water.

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And they're now saying that
the moon has water too.

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.860 align:middle line:10%
How incredible is that?

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.760 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of
even that there's--

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.260 align:middle line:84%
I believe there is
life on the moon.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:41.430 align:middle line:84%
But that's going to be more of
a high-tech space-based type

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:42.280 align:middle line:90%
of thing.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's probably what
perhaps is on Mars, too.

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:48.270 align:middle line:84%
But we may well
find that there's

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:51.570 align:middle line:84%
some kind of strange
underground on Mars.

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And this is really
what you're going

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.740 align:middle line:90%
to do in extreme environments.

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And what we do in
Antarctica too.

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:01.140 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to go too
far underneath a planet

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:06.060 align:middle line:84%
to find stable cool areas that
don't have large temperature

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.800 align:middle line:90%
fluctuations.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite possible
with explosive devices

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.740 align:middle line:84%
to create giant
glass-lined caverns,

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.290 align:middle line:84%
and anywhere you want
one, just by detonating

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:19.310 align:middle line:90%
a nuclear device of some kind.

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:23.970 align:middle line:90%


00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:27.400 align:middle line:10%
>> John Brandenburg, who's
done some studies of Mars,

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:32.730 align:middle line:10%
and he shows that there are
isotopes in the atmosphere

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:36.810 align:middle line:10%
of Mars, which is indicative of
a nuclear war having occurred

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:39.030 align:middle line:10%
at some point in Mars' history.

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:42.240 align:middle line:84%
So you have some
credible scientific data

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.310 align:middle line:84%
showing that you actually
have nuclear weapons being

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:46.110 align:middle line:90%
used on Mars.

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:48.090 align:middle line:84%
So there's evidence
there that there

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:49.830 align:middle line:90%
was an ancient civilization.

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:52.530 align:middle line:84%
We know Richard Hoagland
has done a lot of work

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:54.870 align:middle line:84%
in terms of identifying
the face on Mars

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:57.720 align:middle line:84%
as being artificially
created, and pyramids on Mars

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.130 align:middle line:90%
being artificially created.

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:01.860 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
kind of information

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:05.940 align:middle line:84%
that you get from
Nasa, images and Nasa

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:11.790 align:middle line:84%
probes of Mars that support Mars
actually once being populated.

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:15.330 align:middle line:84%
What we've got more recently
is a few whistleblowers

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:19.500 align:middle line:84%
who have come forward to
talk about their experiences

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:20.620 align:middle line:90%
on Mars.

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:27.090 align:middle line:84%
So these whistleblowers are
all familiar with bases on Mars

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:32.020 align:middle line:84%
that have been created
since the 1940s, and 1950s.

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And they date them to this kind
of early German colonization

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:40.620 align:middle line:84%
program that began
out of Antarctica.

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is a critical
part of our history.

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:46.920 align:middle line:84%
Then in the 1940s and
the 1950s, especially,

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:51.090 align:middle line:84%
that a large number
of German colonists

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:53.560 align:middle line:90%
first establish bases on Mars.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And then in the
'50s and the '60s,

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:58.140 align:middle line:84%
after agreements were
reached with the Eisenhower

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:01.530 align:middle line:84%
administration, the US
military industrial complex

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:03.900 align:middle line:84%
began collaborating
comprehensively

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.630 align:middle line:84%
with the German space
program out of Antarctica

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:11.430 align:middle line:84%
and transporting large amounts
of equipment and personnel

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:16.260 align:middle line:84%
to Mars to build up these
bases down over there.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And so today, on Mars,
there are estimates

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:24.930 align:middle line:84%
of many millions of people
up there with multiple bases

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:27.420 align:middle line:84%
developing incredibly
advanced technologies,

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:31.080 align:middle line:84%
far more advanced than we
would ever think possible

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.830 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth, and so
advanced that it's said

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:38.360 align:middle line:84%
that up to 900 different
extraterrestrial civilizations

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:42.510 align:middle line:84%
are trading with
the Mars colonists

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:47.120 align:middle line:84%
up there who are basically
controlled by a corporation

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:51.120 align:middle line:84%
called the Interplanetary
Corporate Conglomerate.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.820 align:middle line:84%
>> The whistleblowers who have
come forth with new evidence

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:57.410 align:middle line:84%
of the history of that planet
and its interaction with Earth

00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:02.520 align:middle line:84%
are revealing a far more complex
past than previously thought.

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:05.767 align:middle line:84%
>> Many researchers have looked
into World War II and come up

00:16:05.767 --> 00:16:08.100 align:middle line:84%
with the understanding that
the Germans may have made it

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.300 align:middle line:84%
to Mars on something
called the Haunebu 4 craft.

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And that craft had
supposedly taken

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:16.778 align:middle line:84%
one of the actual Nazi
generals to Mars with it.

00:16:16.778 --> 00:16:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And they could have come
across this face on Mars

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:20.612 align:middle line:84%
when they got there
and realized that there

00:16:20.612 --> 00:16:21.840 align:middle line:90%
was an ancient civilization.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.190 align:middle line:90%
How did they know about Mars?

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:25.100 align:middle line:84%
It's very possible that when
they took their journey out

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.712 align:middle line:84%
to Antarctica and
came into contact

00:16:26.712 --> 00:16:28.170 align:middle line:84%
with this race of
beings down there

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:30.090 align:middle line:84%
that gave them the information
on how to build these Haunebu

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:32.820 align:middle line:84%
craft could have told them
about their progenitor race,

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.310 align:middle line:84%
or maybe an ancestor
race of people that

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:36.870 align:middle line:84%
were living on Mars,
which gave them

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:38.885 align:middle line:90%
the idea to even go to Mars.

00:16:38.885 --> 00:16:40.260 align:middle line:84%
What's really
amazing is when you

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.450 align:middle line:84%
look into some of
the ancient tablets,

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:44.600 align:middle line:84%
like the Atra-Hasis
Epic or the Enuma Elish

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.500 align:middle line:84%
and the Seven
Tablets of Creation,

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:49.170 align:middle line:84%
you find out that something
written thousands of years

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:53.300 align:middle line:84%
ago talks about this Igigi
working class Anunnaki race

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.980 align:middle line:84%
that was living on Mars and
made their way to Earth.

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:57.810 align:middle line:84%
These could possibly
be the fallen angels

00:16:57.810 --> 00:16:59.160 align:middle line:90%
mentioned in the Bible.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.290 align:middle line:90%
So they came down to Earth.

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:01.290 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:03.330 align:middle line:84%
Supposedly, according
to these tablets,

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:05.880 align:middle line:84%
they were mining and working
for resources on Mars

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:06.980 align:middle line:90%
and got very tired of it.

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:09.204 align:middle line:84%
They were doing it literally
for thousands of years.

00:17:09.204 --> 00:17:11.579 align:middle line:84%
They wanted some type of relief
that they weren't getting

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:12.780 align:middle line:90%
from their rulers or kings.

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.150 align:middle line:84%
So the kings were Enki and
Enlil, who were running--

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:16.980 align:middle line:90%
primarily ruling over Earth.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.480 align:middle line:84%
So they fell from Mars
to Earth, so to speak.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And they came here
to go to battle.

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.609 align:middle line:84%
They were going to have a coup
against the kings of Earth.

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And then that's when Enki
said, I have a suggestion.

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.040 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to genetically
modify the existing hominids

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.110 align:middle line:84%
on this planet and make
them into a slave race

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:32.670 align:middle line:90%
to take over your workload.

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:34.310 align:middle line:90%
And an agreement was made.

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:36.450 align:middle line:84%
But before the Igigi
working class left,

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:38.440 align:middle line:84%
they said we're going to take
some of these daughters of man.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.390 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take
some of the women

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:40.830 align:middle line:84%
with us, because
we have no women.

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:43.590 align:middle line:84%
They literally took women
with them back to Mars.

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And this could be why something
happened in the human genome

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.620 align:middle line:84%
where scientists and
researchers have found out

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:51.990 align:middle line:84%
that the circadic
rhythm of a human being

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:54.870 align:middle line:84%
is more attuned to the day
and night cycle on Mars

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:56.040 align:middle line:90%
than it is on Earth.

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.618 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that we went
to Mars in ancient times

00:17:58.618 --> 00:18:00.910 align:middle line:84%
and then somehow made our
way back to the planet Earth?

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:03.620 align:middle line:90%


00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:06.810 align:middle line:10%
>> I think it was the Martians
that basically colonized

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:07.610 align:middle line:10%
Atlantis.

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:10.730 align:middle line:84%
That was the Martians
that ended up on the moon.

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And that they eventually
began colonizing Antarctica.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, they probably did
it in successive waves.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.890 align:middle line:84%
I think some of the Martians
would have gone to the moon,

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:26.000 align:middle line:84%
spend extended periods of time
there, because it was more

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.230 align:middle line:84%
suited as an artificial object
that could accommodate billions

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:31.860 align:middle line:90%
of refugees if necessary.

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And so after the
great catastrophe,

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:38.000 align:middle line:84%
I think the Martians, some of
them ended up on this moon.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.780 align:middle line:84%
Some of them traveled to the
Earth and established colonies

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:42.710 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:47.150 align:middle line:84%
Probably in Antarctica, because
if the CIA remote viewing

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:49.670 align:middle line:84%
document is accurate,
the place that

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:54.590 align:middle line:84%
was identified as being very,
very volcanic was Antarctica,

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:56.120 align:middle line:84%
especially around
places like Mt.

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.120 align:middle line:84%
Erebus, which we know is
volcanically very, very active

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.970 align:middle line:84%
now, and there are
other volcanic hotspots.

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:05.960 align:middle line:84%
This is a place that I think
is where the first Martian

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.280 align:middle line:90%
colonists landed.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:11.090 align:middle line:84%
Then later on you had more
Martians arriving via the moon,

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:13.880 align:middle line:84%
and establishing a
global civilization

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:19.550 align:middle line:84%
around 60,000 years ago that
became known as Atlantis.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:23.450 align:middle line:10%
>> I think that there probably
was some past civilization

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:24.987 align:middle line:10%
on Mars.

00:19:24.987 --> 00:19:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>> More and more we're seeing
images from Mars that defy

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.850 align:middle line:90%
common sense.

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:31.190 align:middle line:84%
There are very good images
that have been taken down

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:33.590 align:middle line:84%
by many researchers
over the last 10 years

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:35.450 align:middle line:84%
that show what look
like structures all

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:37.250 align:middle line:84%
over the planet's
surface, and also

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:39.080 align:middle line:84%
what look like
potential things that

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.600 align:middle line:90%
may be statues or statuettes.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.370 align:middle line:84%
We can't say exactly
what they are,

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:45.500 align:middle line:84%
but they just don't
appear to be rocks.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.487 align:middle line:84%
Now, granted, a lot of
people look at the rocks

00:19:47.487 --> 00:19:49.070 align:middle line:84%
and think that they've
seen something.

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of that stuff
has been debunked.

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:53.740 align:middle line:84%
But there's also a lot of stuff
that is very, very compelling.

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:56.240 align:middle line:84%
NASA has shown us these tubes
that clearly look like they're

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.150 align:middle line:84%
made of glass but don't
look like anything that

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:00.610 align:middle line:90%
would be naturally occurring.

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:02.360 align:middle line:10%
And we've heard from
engineers that if you

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:05.540 align:middle line:10%
use a nuclear controlled
underground drill, as they move

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.760 align:middle line:10%
along underground they
superheat the rock

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.290 align:middle line:10%
and turn it into glass.

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:10.940 align:middle line:90%
They become glass tubes.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:14.240 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if they just drive
through at a steady speed

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:17.000 align:middle line:84%
all of the tubes would
have the same consistency.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.430 align:middle line:84%
If there is an earthquake,
they will break and collapse

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:20.468 align:middle line:90%
over long periods.

00:20:20.468 --> 00:20:22.760 align:middle line:84%
So what they learned is that
they had to drive a little

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.530 align:middle line:84%
and stop and let
the rock melt more.

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:26.810 align:middle line:84%
That created more
glass in that area.

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:29.780 align:middle line:84%
Then drive again and stop again,
and this creates the appearance

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:31.550 align:middle line:84%
of ribs, which is
exactly what we

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:34.590 align:middle line:90%
see in the glass tubes of Mars.

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:36.380 align:middle line:84%
So why isn't NASA
releasing this data?

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.338 align:middle line:84%
And why are they showing
us things that clearly

00:20:38.338 --> 00:20:39.770 align:middle line:90%
defy natural explanation?

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:42.110 align:middle line:84%
I really do believe that
NASA may be covering up

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:43.970 align:middle line:84%
evidence of an ancient
civilization on Mars

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:47.245 align:middle line:84%
simply because the military
industrial complex may not

00:20:47.245 --> 00:20:49.370 align:middle line:84%
want the population of
Earth to know that there was

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:51.230 align:middle line:90%
an advanced civilization there.

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't know about
it, they can go there

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.467 align:middle line:84%
and they can clean up a lot
of the technology that's

00:20:55.467 --> 00:20:57.530 align:middle line:84%
been left behind, because
knowledge is power.

00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:00.780 align:middle line:90%


00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:05.320 align:middle line:10%
>> When you see movies, like say
the first "Total Recall" movie,

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.530 align:middle line:10%
which was a pretty
interesting movie,

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:11.280 align:middle line:10%
having all kinds of elements
of mind control, going to Mars,

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:14.730 align:middle line:10%
they too, in that movie they're
occupying Mars, but, again,

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:16.380 align:middle line:10%
it's mainly underground.

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:18.690 align:middle line:10%
And they're in these
underground cities.

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:22.500 align:middle line:10%
Mars as some kind of
prison planet and place

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:25.270 align:middle line:10%
that we are exiled to or
something like that, I mean,

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:26.850 align:middle line:10%
that's a fascinating idea.

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:29.193 align:middle line:84%
>> When we analyze the
Mars images from NASA,

00:21:29.193 --> 00:21:31.860 align:middle line:84%
we see structures that look very
similar to the pyramids we have

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:33.000 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that
the pyramids on Mars

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:39.525 align:middle line:84%
are done by the same exact
architect as the one on Earth?

00:21:39.525 --> 00:21:41.400 align:middle line:84%
Basically, are we saying
here that maybe they

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.050 align:middle line:84%
were built by the
same exact people,

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:45.360 align:middle line:84%
or at least the same
architectural design

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:48.060 align:middle line:84%
was laid out throughout
this entire solar system?

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:49.770 align:middle line:10%
Because when you look
into ancient texts,

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:51.870 align:middle line:10%
you find that the
pyramids are mentioned

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:54.787 align:middle line:10%
throughout the entire solar
system, even in other galaxies.

00:21:54.787 --> 00:21:56.370 align:middle line:84%
So that's really
amazing that pyramids

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:59.430 align:middle line:84%
would be consistent
throughout the entire galaxy.

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:00.930 align:middle line:10%
Also, when you look
at pyramids, you

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:03.030 align:middle line:10%
start to discover
that they were used

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:04.750 align:middle line:10%
for various different purposes.

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:06.000 align:middle line:10%
Some were temples.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.250 align:middle line:10%
Some were actually used
for healing purposes.

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:09.750 align:middle line:10%
Someone would walk
into the pyramid,

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:11.730 align:middle line:10%
and because of the
resonant design,

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:14.075 align:middle line:10%
it would create a specific
type of a hologram

00:22:14.075 --> 00:22:16.450 align:middle line:10%
that a physician could actually
check out a person's body

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:18.540 align:middle line:10%
and see where they
were injured or sick.

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:21.098 align:middle line:84%
Also, some pyramids were
used as power generators,

00:22:21.098 --> 00:22:22.390 align:middle line:90%
kind of like the Great Pyramid.

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:24.773 align:middle line:84%
It appears to be built
on top of an aquifer

00:22:24.773 --> 00:22:26.940 align:middle line:84%
and that it may have been
a power generation source,

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:29.940 align:middle line:84%
and also, maybe even a multi
functional stone computer.

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:32.370 align:middle line:84%
Because there are other
technological aspects

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:36.060 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid that just
can't be explained even today.

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:39.150 align:middle line:84%
When you look at Mars, there's a
clear five sided pyramid, which

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:40.992 align:middle line:90%
is a pentagonal structure.

00:22:40.992 --> 00:22:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And when you analyze
it, it you see

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:44.840 align:middle line:90%
these buttresses in the corners.

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, these spherical
buttresses look just

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:50.760 align:middle line:84%
like the same beams that
give strength to cathedrals.

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:53.430 align:middle line:84%
But what's fascinating, when you
look at the five sided pyramid,

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:55.640 align:middle line:90%
the line is slightly off center.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.390 align:middle line:84%
So if you place Da
Vinci's "Vitruvian Man"

00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:59.310 align:middle line:84%
over that shape, it's
actually the shape

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:02.410 align:middle line:84%
of a human being rendered
out as a pyramid.

00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:03.420 align:middle line:90%
The head is at the top.

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.610 align:middle line:84%
The two arms will be
at the two top sides.

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:08.370 align:middle line:10%
And then the two feet will
be at the two bottom sides.

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:12.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's a pyramid designed in
the shape of a human being.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.400 align:middle line:84%
Richard Hoagland
talked about the idea

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.260 align:middle line:90%
that this could be an arkology.

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Meaning it could be
a vast civilization

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:19.815 align:middle line:90%
inside that pyramid.

00:23:19.815 --> 00:23:21.690 align:middle line:84%
You could have countless
people living inside

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:23.990 align:middle line:90%
of an object that size.

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:26.100 align:middle line:10%
And if you go just
west of that structure,

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:28.020 align:middle line:10%
you see another pyramid
there that looks

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:30.030 align:middle line:10%
amazingly, from an
aerial view, just

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:31.460 align:middle line:10%
like the Great Pyramid of Giza.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.210 align:middle line:10%
The likelihood that
those objects are just

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:36.260 align:middle line:10%
randomly placed and they're just
a trick of light and shadows,

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:39.280 align:middle line:10%
it just doesn't make any sense.

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.350 align:middle line:84%
Experts like Errol
Torin concluded

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:44.170 align:middle line:84%
that the actual amount of
geometric anomalies in the area

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:47.237 align:middle line:84%
is much higher than any
other area on Mars, which

00:23:47.237 --> 00:23:49.570 align:middle line:84%
is consistent with the algebra
you would get if you were

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:52.030 align:middle line:84%
comprising an artificial
human settlement surrounded

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:53.170 align:middle line:90%
by a desert.

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And you have all of these
anomalies around this face.

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And the fate itself could be
a very large structure, maybe

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:00.280 align:middle line:90%
even a building.

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:01.990 align:middle line:84%
According to some of
the ancient texts,

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:04.600 align:middle line:84%
it may have been attributed
to an ancient Atlantean

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:07.030 align:middle line:90%
or Anunnaki name, Alalu.

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:09.280 align:middle line:84%
Regardless, it's a
very strange object,

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.590 align:middle line:84%
and you even have it where
the sun rises in the east

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:13.547 align:middle line:84%
and illuminates this
structure, meaning

00:24:13.547 --> 00:24:15.880 align:middle line:84%
it could have been used as
some type of place of worship

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.740 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:20.272 align:middle line:84%
These amazing structures can
be found all over our planet.

00:24:20.272 --> 00:24:21.730 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of
fact, these builders

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:23.770 align:middle line:84%
even built the
pyramid in Antarctica

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:26.440 align:middle line:84%
which is larger than the
Great Pyramid at Giza.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:29.360 align:middle line:84%
So these ancient structures
are all over our planet.

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And the amazing
thing about them is

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:32.980 align:middle line:84%
you can also find sphinxes
all over the planet

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:36.040 align:middle line:84%
as well, where you see the
lion body, the body of a lion

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.300 align:middle line:90%
and the face of a man.

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:39.430 align:middle line:84%
This is prevalent throughout
the entire planet.

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And what's really amazing
is when you analyze

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.690 align:middle line:84%
the alignments, the
star alignments,

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:45.570 align:middle line:84%
it's aligning with the
constellation of Leo.

00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:46.370 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:48.012 align:middle line:90%
Why the constellation of Leo?

00:24:48.012 --> 00:24:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you look
at the ancient texts,

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.000 align:middle line:84%
you find that there
was an order to build

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.520 align:middle line:84%
this Great Sphinx, for
example, at Giza, to align

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:57.250 align:middle line:84%
with the constellation of Leo
and put the face of Thoth on it

00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:01.060 align:middle line:84%
initially, the Atlantean priest
King who was the son of Enki.

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:03.730 align:middle line:84%
Much later, it was re-carved
to the son of Marduk,

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:05.200 align:middle line:90%
his actual son's face.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:09.305 align:middle line:84%
So the face had changed, which
gave it a very small head.

00:25:09.305 --> 00:25:10.930 align:middle line:84%
What's amazing is
the fact that they've

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:12.388 align:middle line:84%
aligned with the
constellation Leo,

00:25:12.388 --> 00:25:15.490 align:middle line:84%
because they're trying to
give a marker as to the time

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:18.460 align:middle line:84%
period of when the
Giza Plateau was built

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:21.010 align:middle line:84%
and other civilizations on
this planet were developed.

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And when you actually go
back one precessional period,

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:25.060 align:middle line:90%
you come back to the Ice Age.

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:27.130 align:middle line:84%
So we have to go back
to precessional periods

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:30.140 align:middle line:84%
to where we actually end
up around 36,000 years ago

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:32.800 align:middle line:84%
when it's the perfect time
to build the Giza Plateau.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:34.500 align:middle line:90%
Everything is at peace on Earth.

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And Thoth, the Atlantean, or
some may call him an Anunnaki,

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:40.990 align:middle line:84%
he actually claims to have
built the Great Pyramid

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:42.160 align:middle line:90%
in his Emerald Tablets.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.490 align:middle line:84%
His exact words are, "I
builded the Great Pyramid."

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And so he's the one who actually
became the master architect,

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:50.920 align:middle line:84%
and then laid out the
architectural plans

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:54.460 align:middle line:84%
for developing pyramids
all over the planet Earth.

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:58.660 align:middle line:84%
>> The Martian story is only now
becoming known in its entirety.

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:00.340 align:middle line:84%
We're beginning to
realize that there's

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:04.530 align:middle line:84%
much more to the red planet
than previously considered.

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:06.420 align:middle line:84%
With people like
Elon Musk trying

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:10.840 align:middle line:84%
to mount a manned mission to
Mars within the next few years,

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:13.250 align:middle line:84%
perhaps our knowledge
of the past and present

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:16.560 align:middle line:84%
of the fourth planet from the
sun will become known to all.

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:19.110 align:middle line:90%


00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:21.990 align:middle line:84%
In our next episode,
we go back to Earth

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:25.340 align:middle line:84%
to explore the Paul
Bennewitz mystery.

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:28.000 align:middle line:90%
