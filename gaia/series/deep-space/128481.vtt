00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Admiral Richard Byrd appears
to have lost an epic battle

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.350 align:middle line:90%
at the South Pole in 1947.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.200 align:middle line:84%
Stopping in Chile on his way
back to the United States

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.180 align:middle line:84%
from Operation
High Jump, he made

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.790 align:middle line:84%
several startling
statements concerning

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.660 align:middle line:84%
new flying craft that could fly
from pole to pole in moments.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.020 align:middle line:84%
Once the Americans realized
that the Germans had

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.160 align:middle line:84%
a secret base in Antarctica and
they also possessed new flying

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.830 align:middle line:84%
craft and super
weapons, they decided

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.580 align:middle line:84%
to create an alliance
with the Germans.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.000 align:middle line:10%
>> In 1947, Admiral Byrd took
a fleet of Navy ships down

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.730 align:middle line:10%
to Antarctica to investigate
what the Germans were up to.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.390 align:middle line:10%
When he got there, they realized
they were up against something

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.973 align:middle line:10%
much more sinister
than they realized.

00:01:26.973 --> 00:01:29.660 align:middle line:10%


00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.740 align:middle line:10%
>> Reinhard Gehlen was head
of Intelligence Armies East

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.350 align:middle line:10%
for the Nazis.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.050 align:middle line:10%
What he did basically
was go into Russia

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.730 align:middle line:10%
with the combat troops.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And as they took over larger
and larger swaths of Russia,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.750 align:middle line:84%
he picked up the
anti-communist underground

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.030 align:middle line:84%
that was there and
then turned them

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.710 align:middle line:90%
into his Gehlen Organization.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Reinhard Gehlen
was an SS general.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.960 align:middle line:10%
And he was actually head of
the Eastern forces of the SS.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.949 align:middle line:10%
And so he was an intelligence
expert on the Russians

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:13.790 align:middle line:10%
and the Russian military
for the Germans.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.430 align:middle line:10%
At the end of World
War II, Reinhard Gehlen

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.440 align:middle line:10%
was able to surrender to the
British and the Americans, who

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.590 align:middle line:10%
gladly took him in as
an intelligence partner.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.390 align:middle line:84%
Reinhard Gehlen
was certainly one

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.240 align:middle line:84%
of the most knowledgeable
people in the Third

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.750 align:middle line:84%
Reich on intelligence
matters and involving,

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.570 align:middle line:84%
of course, Germany, but
also the Russians as well.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And at the end of the war, he
had whole train loads of files

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.430 align:middle line:84%
and information on
anti-communist activities

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.360 align:middle line:90%
in Russia.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.148 align:middle line:84%
So he came to the Allies,
the Americans particularly,

00:02:50.148 --> 00:02:51.690 align:middle line:84%
and he said, look,
you guys are going

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:52.832 align:middle line:90%
to be facing the Russians.

00:02:52.832 --> 00:02:54.290 align:middle line:84%
You don't know
anything about them.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.780 align:middle line:84%
They've been infiltrating
spies into the United States

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.475 align:middle line:84%
since World War I, and said,
but I have all the information.

00:03:00.475 --> 00:03:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And if you will let me
provide the information,

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.280 align:middle line:84%
I can give you the intelligence
you need to combat the Soviets.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.390 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.550 align:middle line:90%
The deal was cut.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And the United States
government basically took

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.780 align:middle line:84%
Gehlen and made him, really,
an OSS officer, and later,

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.620 align:middle line:90%
as a CIA asset, in a sense.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.780 align:middle line:84%
>> He had two
qualifications at least.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.460 align:middle line:10%
One of them, he
said don't ask me

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.250 align:middle line:10%
to provide the intelligence
that might harm

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.150 align:middle line:10%
my own country, my fatherland.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.950 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.730 align:middle line:10%
Which shows he was an
unreconstructed Nazi.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.700 align:middle line:84%
OK, and two, he said if
there becomes a intelligence

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.790 align:middle line:84%
service in Germany again, I
want to be the head of it.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, he became head
of West German Intelligence.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.415 align:middle line:84%
Now the key to all
this in the meaning

00:03:49.415 --> 00:03:51.710 align:middle line:90%
is, is really pretty incredible.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.210 align:middle line:84%
Because what this means is that
after World War II, immediately

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.130 align:middle line:84%
after World War II and
going into the Cold War,

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.410 align:middle line:84%
the information we were
getting out of Russia

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.750 align:middle line:84%
was coming from an
anti-communist underground,

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.310 align:middle line:84%
filtered through a
Nazi organization.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.280 align:middle line:84%
Now no wonder we
had the Cold War.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.270 align:middle line:10%
No wonder we thought Russia was
trying to take over the world.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:12.770 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.220 align:middle line:84%
>> It was through Reinhard
Gehlen that the Americans were

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.940 align:middle line:84%
able to engineer what was
called Project Paperclip.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.210 align:middle line:10%
And that was to bring all
of these Nazi scientists,

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.710 align:middle line:10%
particularly aerospace
and other technicians,

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.170 align:middle line:10%
rocket scientists and stuff,
and people that had worked

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.840 align:middle line:10%
at PeenemÃ¼nde, including
Wernher von Braun,

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.113 align:middle line:10%
to the United States.

00:04:34.113 --> 00:04:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>> What we know for sure is
at the end of the Second World

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.500 align:middle line:84%
War, that the British,
the Americans,

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.270 align:middle line:84%
and the Russians essentially
grabbed as much material

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.070 align:middle line:90%
as they could.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And also, the
scientists, for example,

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.140 align:middle line:84%
that the US had Operation
Paperclip, which

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.230 align:middle line:84%
was designed to bring as many
Nazi scientists over to the US

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.790 align:middle line:84%
to continue the rocket-based
programs as the White Sands

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.420 align:middle line:84%
Missile Range, as
it's called today.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.070 align:middle line:84%
It used to be called the
White Sands Proving Grounds.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.200 align:middle line:84%
Many of the German
scientists were

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.280 align:middle line:84%
sent there, where they
worked on, essentially,

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.510 align:middle line:90%
the German V2 rocket.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.160 align:middle line:90%
It was just a continuation.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And of course, one of those
was Wernher von Braun,

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.800 align:middle line:84%
who became one of the leading
figures in NASA later on.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.450 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, we've
got this paper trail,

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.750 align:middle line:84%
and people trail as well,
going from Nazi Germany

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.190 align:middle line:84%
through Paperclip right through
NASA through the '60s and '70s,

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.354 align:middle line:90%
and all interconnected.

00:05:30.354 --> 00:05:33.260 align:middle line:90%


00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.380 align:middle line:10%
>> But one thing that
people have to realize, too,

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:41.530 align:middle line:10%
is that as the war was
lost by the Germans,

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.420 align:middle line:10%
the British and the Russians,
because of the vicious fighting

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.990 align:middle line:10%
that they had been in, there
wasn't really a way that

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.710 align:middle line:10%
the British, say, could bring
a bunch of Nazi scientists

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.350 align:middle line:10%
to Britain and have them work
in the British space program.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.490 align:middle line:10%
That just wouldn't have
flown, shall we say.

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:05.350 align:middle line:10%
But with the largesse
of the United States

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.350 align:middle line:10%
and America's friendly
relationships,

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.190 align:middle line:10%
really, with Germans
and other Europeans,

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.050 align:middle line:10%
the United States
was able to bring

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.740 align:middle line:10%
in these scientists,
these Nazi scientists,

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.100 align:middle line:10%
without a lot of
hullabaloo or questioning.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And even within
the military, there

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:28.120 align:middle line:84%
wasn't some big opposition to
bringing these Nazi scientists

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.560 align:middle line:90%
to the US.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.863 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Paperclip
was really all about.

00:06:33.863 --> 00:06:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>> The people who were working
in the US defense community

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.100 align:middle line:84%
thought that they had the
might and willpower to smash

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.090 align:middle line:90%
the Germans.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.700 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, the
opposite took place.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.250 align:middle line:84%
The Germans were more
ruthless and more cunning.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And because all this was done
under the cloak of secrecy,

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.740 align:middle line:84%
they could gain control
under the military industrial

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:51.610 align:middle line:90%
complex.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.892 align:middle line:84%
And nobody out there in the open
would know anything about it.

00:06:55.892 --> 00:06:57.100 align:middle line:90%
>> What are they going to do?

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.090 align:middle line:90%
Complain?

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.790 align:middle line:10%
Oh, yeah, the Germans took
over all the secret stuff

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:02.380 align:middle line:10%
that we never told
you that we had,

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.280 align:middle line:10%
and there's nothing
you could do about it.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.370 align:middle line:10%
The Germans took over, and
it's remained classified up

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.280 align:middle line:10%
until this day.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Most of the Nazi scientists
ended up in aerospace in one

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.590 align:middle line:84%
way or another, even
working for NASA.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And they worked in New Mexico,
at Alamogordo and at Roswell.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:23.140 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, in the
end, Wernher von Braun,

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.620 align:middle line:84%
a Paperclip scientist,
became the head of NASA

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.430 align:middle line:90%
and the director of it.

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And Americans just accepted
that without question, really.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Near Roswell in New
Mexico, where German Paperclip

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:39.280 align:middle line:84%
scientists were working on
top secret military aircraft

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.250 align:middle line:84%
and rockets, an event
occurred on July 8,

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:46.960 align:middle line:84%
1947 that would
change everything.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.590 align:middle line:10%
Rancher Mack Brazel, while
searching for missing cattle,

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:54.850 align:middle line:10%
finds wreckage of a flying
craft strewn over a vast swath

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:56.360 align:middle line:10%
of his property.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.530 align:middle line:10%
He also claimed to have seen
bodies of strange humanoids

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:02.500 align:middle line:10%
that had been hurt in the crash.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:03.865 align:middle line:10%
What really happened at Roswell?

00:08:03.865 --> 00:08:06.450 align:middle line:10%


00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:09.900 align:middle line:10%
>> The question of what happened
at Roswell has been asked of me

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.510 align:middle line:10%
since I became the first
civilian investigator

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:18.170 align:middle line:10%
of the Roswell incident way
back in the '70s, mind you.

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:20.920 align:middle line:90%
And I'm still convinced--

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.570 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot more work
now available than was then--

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:29.700 align:middle line:84%
that an intelligently controlled
extraterrestrial spacecraft

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.470 align:middle line:90%
crashed.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:32.710 align:middle line:90%
I won't say landed.

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:33.630 align:middle line:90%
I say crashed.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.700 align:middle line:84%
It didn't just come down
gently, and let's see

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.919 align:middle line:84%
where we are, folks,
or anything like that.

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:40.150 align:middle line:84%
I believe there was
a midair collision.

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:44.850 align:middle line:84%
In my first conversation
with Major Jesse Marcel,

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:49.650 align:middle line:84%
who was the intelligence officer
at the base, Jesse told me--

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:52.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he's talking about all
this strange wreckage spread

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:57.360 align:middle line:84%
out over this area 3/4 of
a mile long, 1/4 mile wide.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.290 align:middle line:84%
He'd seen crashes in
the war in the Pacific.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:03.140 align:middle line:84%
Usually, there's a
big hole in the ground

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.640 align:middle line:90%
where the airplane blows up.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.970 align:middle line:84%
He said he thought there had to
be a meteor explosion for two

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:10.210 align:middle line:90%
reasons.

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:13.586 align:middle line:84%
The wreckage was spread
over such a large area.

00:09:13.586 --> 00:09:16.530 align:middle line:84%
There, there was
nothing conventional,

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:18.960 align:middle line:90%
no hole in the ground.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And how could it be
dispersed if you had a crash?

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:27.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Many researchers believe
that an alien craft crashed

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.780 align:middle line:90%
at Roswell.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:31.930 align:middle line:84%
But is there
another explanation?

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:36.670 align:middle line:10%
>> When people look at the whole
Roswell crash and everything,

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:40.330 align:middle line:10%
there's some serious problems
about that being some alien

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:41.920 align:middle line:10%
or extraterrestrial craft.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.110 align:middle line:84%
First of all,
Roswell is not just

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:47.410 align:middle line:90%
some ordinary town in America.

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:49.900 align:middle line:90%
Roswell is an Air Force base.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:51.190 align:middle line:90%
It's Alamogordo.

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:53.860 align:middle line:90%
It's the Trinity nuclear site.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:57.910 align:middle line:84%
It was the base of
the only atomic bomb

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:00.730 align:middle line:90%
squadron in the world.

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:03.670 align:middle line:10%
>> Some researchers have
suggested that the Roswell

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:07.180 align:middle line:10%
incident may well have been
connected to some of these

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:09.880 align:middle line:10%
early advanced
terrestrial technologies.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.620 align:middle line:10%
For example, Joseph Farrell--

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.530 align:middle line:10%
I mean, he's looked into
that issue very deeply,

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:16.900 align:middle line:10%
the idea that
perhaps what crashed

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:20.920 align:middle line:10%
was a German device,
not necessarily

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.690 align:middle line:10%
one that we captured.

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And we were sort of
trying to understand it,

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:27.280 align:middle line:84%
but possibly, the
last sort of vestiges,

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:31.210 align:middle line:84%
almost like a final Third
Reich or a Fourth Reich that

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:32.710 align:middle line:90%
was trying to build up.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And we kind of stumbled
onto the existence

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:41.050 align:middle line:84%
of this new order, so to speak,
when the wreckage was found.

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Roswell, it was really the
Area 51 of the '40s and early

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:48.400 align:middle line:90%
'50s.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:53.860 align:middle line:84%
The idea that some craft
is crashing at Roswell--

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:58.210 align:middle line:84%
and this is a town now
crawling with German aerospace

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:02.340 align:middle line:84%
scientists and people who
are working with mercury.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:05.080 align:middle line:84%
There, they were
allegedly developing

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:08.890 align:middle line:84%
flying saucers and the bell
and other things like that

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:11.660 align:middle line:84%
in Germany, at the
end of the war.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:17.350 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea that they're
experimenting themselves

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:21.430 align:middle line:84%
on these craft, it
makes complete sense.

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And that some of their own
experimental craft would fail

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:30.880 align:middle line:84%
and crash, as it happens when
you're experimenting with

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.150 align:middle line:84%
anything, really-- and
aerospace particularly--

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:36.430 align:middle line:84%
not everything is going to
work right the first time.

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:38.080 align:middle line:90%
You're going to have crashes.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.440 align:middle line:10%
>> They all had a philosophical
and a psychological commitment

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.470 align:middle line:10%
to it.

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:47.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you join the SS,
they tattooed your SS number

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:51.040 align:middle line:84%
into your skin because you were
supposed to wear it forever.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:55.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they didn't
stop being Nazis.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:00.700 align:middle line:10%
>> I wrote a book on this
subject myself back in 2005

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.040 align:middle line:10%
called "Body Snatchers
in the Desert,"

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.510 align:middle line:10%
which also looked at the idea of
experiment sites in New Mexico

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:11.470 align:middle line:10%
using human subjects in
high altitude experiments.

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't be
at all surprised,

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:17.290 align:middle line:84%
it wouldn't shock me at
all if Roswell did turn out

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:19.960 align:middle line:84%
to be somebody's dirty
little secret, which,

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:25.060 align:middle line:84%
in many respects, could be far
more dangerous, if you like,

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:28.780 align:middle line:84%
and devastating than the
idea that aliens crashed.

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:31.660 align:middle line:84%
The idea of using
human subjects possibly

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.510 align:middle line:84%
against their will in test
flights of radical aircraft

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:36.730 align:middle line:84%
and things like that, I
think that's something

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:38.980 align:middle line:90%
that really would--

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.810 align:middle line:84%
next to the UFO issue,
that's the one thing

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:42.340 align:middle line:84%
I think, more than
any other, that

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:44.650 align:middle line:90%
would guarantee total silence.

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:47.230 align:middle line:84%
We can never let this
story out because of how it

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:49.120 align:middle line:90%
would make certain people look.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:54.550 align:middle line:84%
Because Paperclip itself
was controversial enough,

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:56.960 align:middle line:84%
doing a deal with
Nazi scientists.

00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.763 align:middle line:84%
But it was kind of like one
of those Faustian pacts,

00:13:00.763 --> 00:13:01.930 align:middle line:90%
doing a deal with the devil.

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Because had we not done it,
had the Brits not done it,

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:07.240 align:middle line:84%
the Russians would
have got all of them.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.800 align:middle line:10%
And they probably would have
got far more ahead of us

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.280 align:middle line:10%
at a greater pace.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And for all we
know, 1953, 1954, we

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.770 align:middle line:84%
could have seen
ourselves nuked and then

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:22.270 align:middle line:84%
Russia running the planet today
or what would be left of it.

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:25.540 align:middle line:90%


00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:29.070 align:middle line:84%
>> You would think, really,
that the Roswell crash--

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:34.750 align:middle line:84%
and almost any UFO crash at that
time or in the United States

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:37.420 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps even in
Mexico or something--

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:41.410 align:middle line:84%
would really be a craft
that was being built perhaps

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:46.780 align:middle line:84%
in Roswell or Alamogordo
or somewhere else.

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.950 align:middle line:84%
>> When it comes to Roswell,
the big stumbling block in terms

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:54.250 align:middle line:84%
of suggesting that it
was a terrestrial craft,

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:58.870 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of people, at least,
is the nature of the bodies.

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:00.730 align:middle line:84%
We know there was a
great deal of testing

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:04.420 align:middle line:84%
of rocketry and strange
aircraft going on in New Mexico

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:07.270 align:middle line:90%
in '45, '46, '47.

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:09.320 align:middle line:84%
If somebody found,
like the rancher Mack

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Brazel on the Foster
ranch in July '47,

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:17.350 align:middle line:84%
if he found unusual wreckage,
then that could go either way.

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:18.150 align:middle line:90%
It could be ours.

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:18.950 align:middle line:90%
It could be theirs.

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:20.680 align:middle line:84%
It could be some
Russian reconnaissance

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:22.190 align:middle line:90%
plane that came down.

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:25.690 align:middle line:84%
But the bodies are the one thing
that really kind of convinced

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:28.420 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people that
what they were saying

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.340 align:middle line:90%
were extraterrestrials.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.350 align:middle line:84%
Because people talked
about these small bodies

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:35.980 align:middle line:84%
with large heads and
wearing sort of almost

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.697 align:middle line:84%
like a flight suit
kind of thing.

00:14:37.697 --> 00:14:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's difficult to suggest
what they might have been,

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:43.900 align:middle line:84%
had they not been so American
pilots or Russian pilots.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.630 align:middle line:10%
>> These people were ideologues
in that they were consumed

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:47.590 align:middle line:10%
by their right--

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:52.090 align:middle line:10%
their Nazi ideology and
their vision of a Fourth

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:57.760 align:middle line:10%
Reich and their commitment
to eugenics and genocide

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.010 align:middle line:10%
and the horrible
things that they did.

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:04.250 align:middle line:84%
There was a guy who wrote
an article once in Sagan

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:05.660 align:middle line:90%
in mid '70s.

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And he had put into the
article a series of icons

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.650 align:middle line:90%
that had been seen on the UFOs.

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:14.180 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
the iconography,

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.460 align:middle line:84%
it's filled with
fascist iconography.

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:22.610 align:middle line:84%
One of them is from a fascist
Italian aircraft squadron.

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:25.560 align:middle line:90%
There's the [NON-ENGLISH].

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:26.650 align:middle line:10%
It's like an F.

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:30.110 align:middle line:10%
There's a symbol from the
British union of fascists.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:32.570 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's just all over it.

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:34.420 align:middle line:10%
We paint icons on
everything, right?

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:37.310 align:middle line:84%
We have to categorize things,
and we put icons on them,

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:39.020 align:middle line:84%
so that we understand
what they were.

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:42.500 align:middle line:10%
And even chevrons, which
you would see on a Luftwaffe

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:46.400 align:middle line:10%
aircraft to denote the rank
of the person flying it,

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.540 align:middle line:10%
it's all there.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:51.500 align:middle line:84%
>> I think when we look
at the entire time frame

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:56.900 align:middle line:84%
of '44, '45, through the late
'40s, early '50s, we can make

00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:02.270 align:middle line:84%
a very plausible case for
the hand of our technology.

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:05.300 align:middle line:10%
And maybe some of the
stories about alien UFOs

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:09.760 align:middle line:10%
were actually spread to
confuse the real story.

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.650 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's chasing aliens,
and the real picture

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:14.780 align:middle line:90%
gets buried even deeper.

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:17.690 align:middle line:10%
One of the things I found
was that the Japanese

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:21.260 align:middle line:10%
had done some sort of very
bizarre experiments, sort

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.540 align:middle line:10%
of biological warfare
and chemical warfare,

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:27.030 align:middle line:10%
not just on prisoners of war,
but on handicapped people,

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:29.120 align:middle line:10%
including dwarves.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.700 align:middle line:10%
And also, the
Nazis, for example--

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:34.910 align:middle line:10%
Josef Mengele, one of the
sort of most craziest Dr.

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.260 align:middle line:10%
Frankenstein types
on the planet,

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:41.210 align:middle line:10%
he had an obsession with
dwarves and dwarfism.

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot
of rumors and stories

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:46.020 align:middle line:84%
about some of these
handicapped people,

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:50.002 align:middle line:84%
including dwarves, being
taken from hospitals, asylums.

00:16:50.002 --> 00:16:51.710 align:middle line:84%
Because back then,
there was a great deal

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:56.120 align:middle line:84%
of stigma concerning
people who, unfortunately,

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.340 align:middle line:90%
had physical handicaps.

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:58.900 align:middle line:90%
It's not like today.

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:00.150 align:middle line:90%
They were sort of locked away.

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:02.540 align:middle line:84%
It was the member of
the family nobody talks

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:03.952 align:middle line:90%
about, that kind of thing.

00:17:03.952 --> 00:17:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot
of rumors and stories

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:08.119 align:middle line:84%
about people being
taken from such places

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:10.250 align:middle line:84%
where they wouldn't be
missed because nobody cares

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:14.510 align:middle line:84%
about them, and using some of
them, physically handicapped

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:16.760 align:middle line:90%
people, including dwarves.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And that you only need one
of these craft to come down

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:22.345 align:middle line:84%
or some sort of high altitude
balloon with a gondola.

00:17:22.345 --> 00:17:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And there's all
this sort of foil

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.430 align:middle line:84%
from the balloon on the ground
and these small bodies strewn

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:27.230 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:31.310 align:middle line:84%
You can quite easily
see how, 30 years later,

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:34.010 align:middle line:84%
when all the guys who are
involved are interviewed,

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:37.100 align:middle line:84%
you can easily see how that
could mutate into a crashed UFO

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.360 align:middle line:90%
legend.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.470 align:middle line:90%
They wouldn't be lying.

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:43.340 align:middle line:84%
A lot of those guys may have
been on guard duty at the site.

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:45.080 align:middle line:84%
They might have
been 30 feet away.

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.650 align:middle line:84%
But they were close
enough to see the wreckage

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:50.780 align:middle line:90%
and the material on the ground.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And they were close enough
to see these small bodies.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:56.940 align:middle line:84%
30 years later, when everybody
is talking about UFOs--

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:58.550 align:middle line:90%
oh, well, that's what they were.

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:00.230 align:middle line:90%
But they may not have been.

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And again, something like that,
taking people from prisons,

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:06.420 align:middle line:84%
from hospitals, that
would be, again,

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:08.480 align:middle line:84%
a major sort of
black mark, if you

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:12.200 align:middle line:84%
like, in the history
of the Cold War,

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.870 align:middle line:84%
and again, another
valid reason to keep it

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:18.260 align:middle line:84%
not just hidden, but bury it
just about as far as you can.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:21.370 align:middle line:90%


00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:24.160 align:middle line:84%
>> It was only once they went
to Antarctica and found what was

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.670 align:middle line:84%
really going on that they
realized that World War II had

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:31.010 align:middle line:84%
not ended, that it's still going
on and that they must prepare

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:31.810 align:middle line:90%
to fight back.

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:34.370 align:middle line:90%


00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:36.650 align:middle line:10%
So what did America do
to start fighting back?

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:38.000 align:middle line:10%
They start building up the OSS.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.850 align:middle line:90%


00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:44.580 align:middle line:10%
And this is where you have the
Office of Strategic Services

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:47.310 align:middle line:10%
that was later transformed
into the CIA, who

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:50.980 align:middle line:10%
have a much better bureaucratic
and secret structure.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:54.660 align:middle line:84%
>> 1947 was a very
interesting year.

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.870 align:middle line:10%
It was the year which gave
birth to the flying saucer, when

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:02.790 align:middle line:10%
Kenneth Arnold had his encounter
with a squadron of flying

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:08.820 align:middle line:10%
saucers, flying disks, over
Mount Rainier on June 24, 1947.

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And the media immediately
latched onto this

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:13.290 align:middle line:90%
all around the world.

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:15.510 align:middle line:84%
Flying disks, as they
were also known back then,

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:18.540 align:middle line:84%
and flying saucers
became big news.

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:19.390 align:middle line:90%
Was it the Russians?

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:20.190 align:middle line:90%
Is it us?

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:21.610 align:middle line:90%
Are the Martians invaded?

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:23.610 align:middle line:84%
These are all this kind
of things that came out.

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And in no time at all, there
were UFO groups set up.

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:31.740 align:middle line:10%
1947, coincidentally
or not, was also

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:34.560 align:middle line:10%
the year we had the passing
of the National Security Act.

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.380 align:middle line:10%
We had the first
Secretary of Defense,

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:39.330 align:middle line:10%
which was James Forrestal.

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:42.720 align:middle line:90%
The CIA was created in 1947.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And weird things are
flying around in the sky

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.040 align:middle line:90%
throughout this entire era.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:51.810 align:middle line:84%
So I have to wonder and
wonder deeply if a lot of this

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:56.250 align:middle line:84%
was in response to the
presence of the UFO phenomenon.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:20:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And there's a reason why I think
that could indeed be the case.

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:06.600 align:middle line:84%
Because if you look at the
history of the phenomenon,

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:10.750 align:middle line:84%
the UFO phenomenon in 1947
basically came out of nowhere.

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:12.390 align:middle line:84%
The governments of
the day, regardless

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:15.600 align:middle line:84%
whether extraterrestrial,
military, test vehicles,

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.780 align:middle line:84%
or a combination of the
two, the governments

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:22.403 align:middle line:84%
seemed totally puzzled
by it and concerned.

00:20:22.403 --> 00:20:23.820 align:middle line:84%
Because something's
flying around,

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:25.200 align:middle line:90%
and we don't know what it is.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.658 align:middle line:84%
And so they'd never experienced
something like this before.

00:20:27.658 --> 00:20:29.610 align:middle line:84%
Because they're not
necessarily attacking us.

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:30.840 align:middle line:90%
They're not helping us.

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.420 align:middle line:84%
They're just skulking around,
and we cannot stop them.

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:34.750 align:middle line:90%
We don't know who they are.

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:37.300 align:middle line:10%
So I can easily see
how somebody said,

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:39.420 align:middle line:10%
we've got to do something
about this quickly.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:41.100 align:middle line:90%
We need to set up programs.

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:45.255 align:middle line:84%
We need to initiate a military
response if anything happens.

00:20:45.255 --> 00:20:49.030 align:middle line:90%


00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:52.120 align:middle line:84%
>> The American commitment to
this new alliance was shaky

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.650 align:middle line:90%
at best.

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:55.690 align:middle line:84%
There were many
insiders who disagreed

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:59.230 align:middle line:84%
with Truman's decision to
bring into the United States

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:01.780 align:middle line:84%
German scientists and
military personnel.

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:05.830 align:middle line:90%


00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:09.880 align:middle line:10%
In the summer of 1952, the
residents of Washington, DC

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:13.150 align:middle line:10%
watched helplessly
as a squadron of UFOs

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:16.420 align:middle line:10%
flew over the most sensitive
areas of US government

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:17.380 align:middle line:10%
facilities.

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:22.490 align:middle line:90%


00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:26.450 align:middle line:84%
>> The great UFO flap of 1952, I
think that was somebody flexing

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:27.320 align:middle line:90%
their muscle.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.930 align:middle line:10%
I think that
somebody had decided

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:33.290 align:middle line:10%
that they needed to show the
US government that we're around

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:35.060 align:middle line:10%
and we're upset.

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:37.610 align:middle line:84%
Or we're around and we
have this capability.

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:39.430 align:middle line:84%
So they sent a
squadron of Haunebu,

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:43.790 align:middle line:84%
maybe, and buzzed
the US capital.

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:47.600 align:middle line:84%
>> We can say that the recent
sightings are in no way

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:51.930 align:middle line:84%
connected with any secret
developments by any agency

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:53.120 align:middle line:90%
of the United States.

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:56.990 align:middle line:84%
>> All of this sudden change
in '47, I think there's a very

00:21:56.990 --> 00:22:00.530 align:middle line:84%
strong current case can be
put forward that it was due

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:03.691 align:middle line:84%
to the sudden presence
of the UFO phenomenon.

00:22:03.691 --> 00:22:06.280 align:middle line:90%


00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>> We can see that when one
investigates the Roswell crash,

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:13.570 align:middle line:84%
we discover a labyrinth
of lies and deception.

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the truth
will never come out.

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:18.340 align:middle line:84%
But what if the Germans
are more involved

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:21.055 align:middle line:84%
in flying saucer stories than
we've been led to believe?

00:22:21.055 --> 00:22:25.480 align:middle line:90%


00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:29.980 align:middle line:84%
In 1961, an interracial
couple, Betty and Barney Hill,

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:32.380 align:middle line:90%
had a strange occurrence.

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:33.910 align:middle line:84%
Driving home late
one night, they

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:36.730 align:middle line:90%
witnessed a UFO following them.

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:40.120 align:middle line:10%
Later, they discovered that they
were missing many hours of time

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:43.310 align:middle line:10%
during this late night drive.

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:46.010 align:middle line:84%
Under hypnosis, the
couple began to recall

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:50.300 align:middle line:84%
that the occupants of the
flying saucer had abducted them.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:54.170 align:middle line:84%
This story has become
legend in UFO circles.

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:58.040 align:middle line:84%
Many researchers believe
aliens had abducted the couple.

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.740 align:middle line:84%
But what if there's another
explanation for the Betty

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:01.970 align:middle line:90%
and Barney Hill incident?

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:04.738 align:middle line:90%


00:23:04.738 --> 00:23:07.280 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's a very interesting
thing about Betty and Barney

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.020 align:middle line:90%
Hill.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:11.238 align:middle line:90%
It's not often discussed.

00:23:11.238 --> 00:23:13.030 align:middle line:84%
In a lot of ways, it's
actually suppressed,

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:14.760 align:middle line:90%
I would suggest to you.

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.310 align:middle line:10%
But if you actually
look at their testimony

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:21.500 align:middle line:10%
and you see what they said
when they were regressed,

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.420 align:middle line:10%
they talk about coming
aboard the ship.

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:26.090 align:middle line:10%
You know, obviously, they
had seen the ship land.

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:27.920 align:middle line:10%
Barney had gotten
out of the car.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:31.220 align:middle line:10%
He drew his 45 military
issue because he

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:32.300 align:middle line:10%
had been in the army.

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.010 align:middle line:90%
He fired at it, right?

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And then somehow
they overwhelmed him.

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And they got him aboard
the craft with his wife.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.130 align:middle line:90%
So they come aboard the ship.

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
the actual testimony,

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:44.660 align:middle line:84%
they were greeted by
a redheaded Irishman.

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And that redheaded Irishman
went around and introduced them

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:51.680 align:middle line:84%
to a bunch of tall people that
they said Barney Hill thought

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.180 align:middle line:90%
were speaking German.

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And he described their uniform
as having silver piping

00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:01.490 align:middle line:84%
and peaked caps, which is
similar to an SS Panzer

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:02.660 align:middle line:90%
uniform.

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:06.740 align:middle line:84%
They had silver piping, and then
they would wear a peaked cap.

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And he said that it
reminded him of Nazis.

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:13.020 align:middle line:84%
There was, like, a
German Shepherd there

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:16.195 align:middle line:84%
that was staying near
the redheaded Irishman.

00:24:16.195 --> 00:24:17.570 align:middle line:84%
Now what's
interesting about that

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:21.770 align:middle line:84%
is that during World War II, the
Irish Republican Army, the IRA,

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:24.890 align:middle line:84%
was actually partially
financed by the Germans.

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:28.500 align:middle line:84%
The Nazis, the enemy of
my enemy is my friend,

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:31.650 align:middle line:84%
so the Nazis and the IRA
both disliked England

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:32.450 align:middle line:90%
with a passion.

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:34.730 align:middle line:84%
So the Nazis had
equipment and training.

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:37.220 align:middle line:90%
And they gave it to the IRA.

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.470 align:middle line:84%
It's also not widely
known, but there

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:44.600 align:middle line:84%
was a legion of Irish soldiers
that fought in the SS.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.840 align:middle line:84%
So there was definitely
communication there.

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And if you're going
to leave town and go

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:54.890 align:middle line:84%
somewhere else, other people
of your interest, right,

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:58.190 align:middle line:84%
people who share your ideology
are going to come with you.

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:01.460 align:middle line:84%
So I would expect that
if the Nazis did indeed

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:02.600 align:middle line:90%
have a saucer program--

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.030 align:middle line:84%
Haunebus are real--
and they left,

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:08.690 align:middle line:84%
you would see Irish people,
you would see Italians,

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:12.380 align:middle line:84%
you would see some Scandinavians
who had collaborated,

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:14.900 align:middle line:90%
some French, the Vichy French.

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:16.203 align:middle line:90%
You would see all these people.

00:25:16.203 --> 00:25:17.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of those
interesting things

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:19.760 align:middle line:84%
that when you come
back away from it,

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.110 align:middle line:90%
you start to see those people.

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:23.820 align:middle line:90%


00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:26.970 align:middle line:84%
>> The Germans and the Americans
succeeded in their efforts

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:30.510 align:middle line:84%
to make flying craft
that could go into space.

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:33.180 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps they also used
aliens as a cover story

00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:34.920 align:middle line:90%
for their research.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:37.950 align:middle line:84%
But did they create a
breakaway civilization

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:39.570 align:middle line:90%
with this advanced technology?

00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:42.330 align:middle line:90%


00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>> So when I think of
this particular group,

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:49.850 align:middle line:84%
this black bunch of group that's
got access to what I believe is

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:54.445 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial technology,
I look at them as a separate

00:25:54.445 --> 00:25:56.570 align:middle line:84%
civilization, one that is
broken away from our own,

00:25:56.570 --> 00:26:00.262 align:middle line:84%
hence the term
breakaway civilization.

00:26:00.262 --> 00:26:02.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Imagine what it would be
like for the Germans to develop

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:03.920 align:middle line:90%
space travel.

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.020 align:middle line:84%
They can take these
Haunebu craft to the moon,

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:07.760 align:middle line:84%
maybe even to Mars,
where there appears

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.370 align:middle line:84%
to be remnants of an
ancient civilization there.

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:12.910 align:middle line:84%
They can then move into
some of these ancient sites,

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:15.860 align:middle line:84%
pressurize them, move and
develop their technology,

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:17.960 align:middle line:90%
free from any concern of attack.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And nobody can get to
them, as long as they

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.050 align:middle line:90%
didn't develop space travel.

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:24.383 align:middle line:90%


00:26:24.383 --> 00:26:26.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say the odds are
excellent that we're expanding

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.110 align:middle line:90%
out into the solar system.

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:32.470 align:middle line:84%
I think they started with
the moon because it's close.

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:34.220 align:middle line:84%
I think after the moon,
they went to Mars.

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:36.430 align:middle line:10%
There is plenty of
evidence of installations

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:37.330 align:middle line:10%
on the moon and Mars.

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:39.340 align:middle line:84%
Once you have the
capability to get to Mars,

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:41.920 align:middle line:84%
you pretty much have the
capability to get to anywhere.

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Even in Antarctica, the
Germans were still vulnerable.

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:46.840 align:middle line:10%
When we went there with
Operation High Jump,

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:50.760 align:middle line:10%
we got pushed back by
their Haunebu craft.

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.700 align:middle line:84%
But the Germans realized that if
we developed our own spacecraft

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:56.910 align:middle line:84%
technology, we could be
still a threat against them.

00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:58.830 align:middle line:84%
So they developed the
technology and decided

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:00.300 align:middle line:84%
to move on to the
moon, maybe even

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.270 align:middle line:84%
Mars, where they'd be
safe from prying eyes

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:07.050 align:middle line:84%
to develop their programs and
projects away from any threat.

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:09.960 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that they
are about to achieve,

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.610 align:middle line:84%
if they had not
already achieved,

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:14.850 align:middle line:84%
significant artificial
intelligence.

00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe that
they are much more

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:21.270 align:middle line:84%
advanced with quantum computing
than we're led to believe.

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:23.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that they
started to expand.

00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:25.980 align:middle line:10%
And I think that we can see
the leftover traces, as humans

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:27.315 align:middle line:10%
were not very clean and subtle.

00:27:27.315 --> 00:27:29.190 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the
moon, you can see tracks

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:31.140 align:middle line:84%
on the moon of
vehicles moving around.

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:33.540 align:middle line:84%
In one case, you can
see the vehicle itself.

00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:35.310 align:middle line:84%
On the moon, you can
find installations

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:36.393 align:middle line:90%
if you know where to look.

00:27:36.393 --> 00:27:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think that they executed
a program to cover it up,

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:42.030 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the notion of
Kubrick faking the moon landing

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:45.990 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's probes crashing
into Mars because we can't

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:47.630 align:middle line:90%
set the altimeter correctly.

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:49.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And so you would
work through--

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:52.490 align:middle line:84%
have organizations like
NASA as your cover.

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And then you would work
through the DOD, which

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:57.810 align:middle line:84%
would also be your
cover for something

00:27:57.810 --> 00:27:58.920 align:middle line:90%
even more clandestine.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is
exactly what has happened.

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:03.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So the Germans had the
advantage of being able

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:06.510 align:middle line:84%
to continue their massive
military expansion far away

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:09.150 align:middle line:84%
from Earth, where they can
develop their projects without

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:10.902 align:middle line:90%
any interruption whatsoever.

00:28:10.902 --> 00:28:13.860 align:middle line:90%


00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:17.190 align:middle line:84%
>> The United States government
and military formed an alliance

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:18.960 align:middle line:90%
with the Germans.

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.360 align:middle line:84%
This gave them a huge
boost to the research

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:25.530 align:middle line:84%
due to the vast resources
of the United States.

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:29.250 align:middle line:84%
Through the 1950s and
1960s, great strides

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:31.410 align:middle line:90%
were taken in this research.

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:34.770 align:middle line:84%
There seemed to be a goal
of getting off the planet.

00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:37.470 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps they feared an
imminent catastrophe,

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:40.140 align:middle line:84%
or maybe they just wanted
to see if they could do it.

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:42.680 align:middle line:90%


00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.510 align:middle line:84%
We'll see in our next
episode that they

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:46.970 align:middle line:84%
did succeed in
getting into space

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:50.570 align:middle line:84%
through their discoveries of
various forms of anti-gravity.

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:53.920 align:middle line:90%
