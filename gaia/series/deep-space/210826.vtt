is that to our naked eye,

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.310 align:middle line:90%

trapezoidal windows.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.610 align:middle line:84%

been very specifically

placed so that you could
watch the Pleiades.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.450 align:middle line:84%

from a great catastrophe that
happened in the Pacific Ocean.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.430 align:middle line:84%

beings were called kachinas,

the Mayan legend

a hollow pathway, almost

like a hollow serpent, our
ancestors came to the Americas.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.070 align:middle line:84%

altar called Choque Chinchay,

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.960 align:middle line:84%

like mirrors reflecting

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.450 align:middle line:10%
One of the really
interesting things

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.790 align:middle line:10%
we find when we look
at these descriptions

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.040 align:middle line:10%

star cluster known as Maia.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at the
connections with the name Maya,

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.340 align:middle line:84%
many researchers believe
that based on the name,

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.160 align:middle line:84%

In East Tennessee, it's the
home of the Cherokee Indians.

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And Cherokee Indian storytellers
were given permission

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.750 align:middle line:84%
to publish Cherokee creation
mythology for the first time.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm paraphrasing, but
essentially, the Cherokee

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.290 align:middle line:84%
believe they were created
by the Pleiadeans, who

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:40.060 align:middle line:84%
were beings of light, who rode
a sound wave through a hole

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.140 align:middle line:84%
in space over East Tennessee
and created the Cherokee

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.500 align:middle line:90%
as guardians of a vortex.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.320 align:middle line:84%

>> Some unknown
thousands of years ago,

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:20.830 align:middle line:10%
a group of extraterrestrials
arrived here,

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:24.310 align:middle line:10%
and that was not a coincidence.

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:27.490 align:middle line:84%
Because, again, long
before, millions of years

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:33.940 align:middle line:84%
ago, they created life simply
by infecting certain region

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.940 align:middle line:90%
of their Milky Way with DNA.

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.740 align:middle line:84%
They knew exactly
that only on planets

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.800 align:middle line:84%
which are similar than
the one they came,

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.050 align:middle line:90%
some life would be evolved.

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:47.260 align:middle line:84%
So they knew in advance that
they would come to Earth,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.150 align:middle line:84%
and they will find
forms of life.

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And one of these forms of
life was our ancestors.

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:58.030 align:middle line:84%
They simply took one example
of it, took one simple cell,

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:01.120 align:middle line:90%
and changed the DNA in the cell.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.180 align:middle line:84%
This cell grows,
multiplies, and then they

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:08.420 align:middle line:84%
put it into the womb of a
female of the same species.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:11.410 align:middle line:84%
This female, after a
certain amount of months,

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:13.360 align:middle line:90%
will give birth to a child.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:18.100 align:middle line:84%
The child has definitely the
evolution of the parents.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:22.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Pleiadeans are playing a
role with humanity in evolution,

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:26.830 align:middle line:10%
partly because they are
genetically related to human

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:28.510 align:middle line:10%
beings.

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:32.140 align:middle line:84%
But that being said, it is
not all genetic material

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.300 align:middle line:90%
from Pleiadean race.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.090 align:middle line:84%
As human beings, there
is approximately 12

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:41.170 align:middle line:84%
different genetics that are
laced throughout humanity.

>> "Keys of Enoch" tell us
that the Pleiades represent

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:54.130 align:middle line:84%
representatives from the various
star kingdoms in the heavens

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.970 align:middle line:84%
that came together
as an association.

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And they were responsible
primarily for the upgrading

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.470 align:middle line:90%
of civilization on this planet.

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:05.560 align:middle line:10%
According to the
"Keys of Enoch,"

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.980 align:middle line:10%
the Pleiades are the cradle,
as well as the throne,

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.110 align:middle line:10%
of human civilization.

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:14.170 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, in
the reconstruction

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:16.660 align:middle line:84%
of the genetic tracts
of where we are,

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.310 align:middle line:84%
the Pleiades represent
the foundation.

>> Pleiadeans exist as both
physical and nonphysical

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:28.310 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:31.700 align:middle line:84%
While some researchers report
that the majority of Pleiadeans

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:35.960 align:middle line:84%
visiting Earth are nonphysical,
some Pleiadeans occasionally

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:40.550 align:middle line:84%
present themselves within our
three-dimensional reality.

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:44.450 align:middle line:84%
What we know about their
civilization and their origins

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:48.530 align:middle line:84%
tends to be learned mostly
from contactees, or those

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:51.170 align:middle line:90%
who channel information.

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:54.140 align:middle line:84%
There are some people who
feel that their DNA has been

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:59.210 align:middle line:84%
activated to have a conscious
memory and association as being

Pleiadean themselves, as

Harder, who relates

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:10.970 align:middle line:84%
to a group from the star Taygeta
called Taygetan Pleiadeans.

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>> The skin color of Taygetan
Pleiadeans is like a white

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:17.510 align:middle line:90%
or Caucasian, a light tan.

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And their eyes can be
blue, or they can be hazel,

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:23.630 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes are brown.

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:28.910 align:middle line:84%
They have brown hair or auburn,
and they also have blonde hair.

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:32.450 align:middle line:84%
The women are very striking,
exceptionally beautiful.

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:34.160 align:middle line:90%
And the men are very striking.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:38.750 align:middle line:84%
They're muscular, tall, very
attractive in that regard.

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:43.370 align:middle line:84%
They typically range anywhere
from 6 and 1/2 to 7 and 1/2,

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:46.960 align:middle line:90%
or even up to 8 feet.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>> The Pleiadeans are tall, and
they have blue or green eyes.

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:55.780 align:middle line:84%
They're pinned up at the
ends, almost catlike.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:58.960 align:middle line:84%
You can still see humans
today with resemblance

00:12:58.960 --> 00:12:59.800 align:middle line:90%
of a Pleiadean.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.690 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of people
born with blonde hair.

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And if you think of
the very early humans,

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:06.700 align:middle line:90%
they did not have blonde hair.

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.490 align:middle line:90%
They had dark skin, dark eyes.

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:12.400 align:middle line:84%
So this is just a
hybridization program

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.000 align:middle line:84%
that has been going
on for a while

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.900 align:middle line:84%
and has created different color
skin, different color eyes.

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the traits
running through our culture.

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>> In ufology, the Nordic
aliens, or the Pleiadeans,

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:27.700 align:middle line:84%
or considered to be
the tall blondes.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Some think they're
7 to 8 feet tall.

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.630 align:middle line:84%
Since the 1950s,
when George Adamski

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:37.510 align:middle line:84%
claimed to have a contact
with these Nordic beings,

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:40.300 align:middle line:84%
the Pleiadeans have
always been presented

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:44.050 align:middle line:84%
as these sort of benevolent
beings, very loving beings,

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:47.590 align:middle line:90%
nurturing towards humanity.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:51.460 align:middle line:84%
The Pleiadeans are always
associated with magical ideas

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:54.040 align:middle line:90%
of love and unity.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:57.130 align:middle line:90%
And that is like their hallmark.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:59.830 align:middle line:84%
We could perhaps extrapolate
from that, that that is what

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:02.365 align:middle line:90%
Pleiadean civilization is like.

00:14:02.365 --> 00:14:04.870 align:middle line:90%


00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Pleiades, they might
not all be tall blondes.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.720 align:middle line:84%
There could be
multitudes of races, even

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:14.200 align:middle line:84%
reptilian beings living in
the Pleiades star system.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.380 align:middle line:84%
But yet, we've tried to
make them all unified,

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.930 align:middle line:84%
that there's only one way that
these beings can be portrayed,

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:24.180 align:middle line:84%
when, in fact, the reality
is completely different.

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:27.180 align:middle line:84%
>> According to Taygetan
Pleiadean Swaruu,

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:31.080 align:middle line:84%
who is said to communicate with
specific humans here on Earth,

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:34.440 align:middle line:84%
there are a variety of species
living throughout the Pleiades

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.540 align:middle line:90%
constellation.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Around the star Taygeta,
we find the Taygetan people.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.490 align:middle line:10%
And these people also
look very similar

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:43.440 align:middle line:10%
to the Scandinavian
people on Earth.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:47.160 align:middle line:10%
They're similar in size of
stature, build, color of hair,

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.990 align:middle line:10%
and even eyes, to Earth humans.

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:51.570 align:middle line:84%
But the Taygetan women
can be distinguished

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:54.330 align:middle line:84%
by their strong cheekbones
and the finely chiseled

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:57.420 align:middle line:90%
physical and facial features.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:00.990 align:middle line:84%
Around the star Alcyone,
we find the Yena people.

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:03.910 align:middle line:84%
They look like Caucasian
Earth humans in size,

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:06.990 align:middle line:84%
stature, build, color
of hair, and eyes.

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:09.810 align:middle line:84%
But yet, some Yena
are light beings

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:14.220 align:middle line:84%
who only take physical
form when they want to.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Around the star Electra,
we find the Engan people.

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:20.460 align:middle line:84%
The Engans look very
similar to the Taygetans,

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:23.040 align:middle line:84%
as both races have
that Scandinavian look

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.280 align:middle line:90%
to themselves.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.960 align:middle line:84%
But the Engan women have
rounder and heavier features

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:31.560 align:middle line:84%
that are less defined
than Taygetan women.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.600 align:middle line:84%
Around the star Maia,
we find the Maia people,

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.650 align:middle line:84%
which might be connected
to the Maya and Hopi people

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:41.400 align:middle line:84%
on Earth because they look
just like human beings,

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.460 align:middle line:84%
but they stand a little bit
bigger and a little bit taller

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:45.720 align:middle line:90%
than Earth humans.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And they do have
that reddish skin

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:51.360 align:middle line:84%
that looks very similar to
the Maya people on Earth.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.370 align:middle line:10%
When we look to
the star Pleione,

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.380 align:middle line:10%
we find the Solatian people.

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:58.740 align:middle line:84%
The Solatian people look also
just like Caucasian Earth

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:01.320 align:middle line:84%
humans, but they're
a bit taller with

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:06.210 align:middle line:84%
well-proportioned features, and
their hair is extremely blonde.

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:08.430 align:middle line:84%
Though the Solatian
people look human,

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:11.010 align:middle line:84%
they do have a bit more
of an alien appearance

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:13.860 align:middle line:90%
with a much whiter skin to them.

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:18.060 align:middle line:10%
As we explore the star Asterope,
we find the Elohi people.

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:21.480 align:middle line:84%
The Elohi are bipedal,
with two arms and two legs,

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.910 align:middle line:84%
just as you expect,
but their skulls

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:27.070 align:middle line:84%
are elongated and
larger than humans.

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:30.090 align:middle line:84%
They have the ability to
transcend their physical form

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:31.830 align:middle line:90%
to become light beings.

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And using the power
of their mind,

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:37.770 align:middle line:84%
they have the ability to
create physical objects.

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:41.850 align:middle line:10%
Around the star Celaeno, we find
the Celestes, or what people

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:43.680 align:middle line:10%
call them, the Blue Pleiadeans.

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.160 align:middle line:84%
The Celeano are a subspecies
of the Andromedans.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.230 align:middle line:84%
This means that
they are humanoid,

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:52.840 align:middle line:84%
but with clear, blue
tint to their skin.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.440 align:middle line:84%
As we get to the star Merope,
we find the Hyadean people,

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.510 align:middle line:90%
which are a feline race.

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:03.070 align:middle line:84%
The Hyadean race of Merope look
just like the bipedal felines

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:05.609 align:middle line:90%
that we know as the Urmah.

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:08.130 align:middle line:84%
They look like lions
or tigers, but they

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:09.900 align:middle line:90%
stand about 9 feet tall.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And because of their way
their bodies are built,

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:16.369 align:middle line:84%
they can be biped or
quadruped as it suits them.

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:20.630 align:middle line:10%
Around the star Atlas, we
find the Atlantis people.

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:22.880 align:middle line:90%
These are humanoid Giants.

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Their skin is copper-colored,
and their eyes

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:29.440 align:middle line:90%
can be blue, green, or brown.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:33.970 align:middle line:10%
Around the star Sterope, we find
the Sau'k, which are a Sauroid

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:35.750 align:middle line:10%
type of people.

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:39.100 align:middle line:84%
These are unlike any other
reptilian-type people

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.620 align:middle line:84%
because they're positive,

or you build ships, it all
contributes to the whole.

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:13.170 align:middle line:90%
There's never any problem.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.990 align:middle line:10%
and kind of guided the rest

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:43.730 align:middle line:10%
to create a confederation.

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:48.710 align:middle line:84%
So they go beyond the
systems, beyond the idea

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:52.880 align:middle line:84%
of having politics,
of having structures

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.750 align:middle line:90%
like pyramids and stuff.

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:58.380 align:middle line:84%
They are trying to work
with the inner systems.

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:01.430 align:middle line:84%
So they work with our
chakras, with our emotions,

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:03.200 align:middle line:90%
with our soul.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.710 align:middle line:84%
Because they are in the
fifth dimension, most of them

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:10.590 align:middle line:84%
just take the shape of what
we expect for them to be.

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:13.400 align:middle line:90%
So they are familiar to us.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:14.570 align:middle line:90%
They don't eat.

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:17.990 align:middle line:84%
They don't have this
relationship with matter

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:19.670 align:middle line:90%
as we do.

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:22.310 align:middle line:84%
That's why they can
transcend the matter,

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:25.310 align:middle line:90%
and they can shape as they wish.

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:28.070 align:middle line:84%
Because basically,
they are using light,

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:32.270 align:middle line:84%
and they can mold the
light by thinking.

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:35.690 align:middle line:84%
That's why they look like
these perfect beings,

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:41.552 align:middle line:84%
but it's because we project
on them this perfection.

Taygetan technology.

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:47.830 align:middle line:84%

how we have the technology,

how we actually build our craft.

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:54.570 align:middle line:84%
As a craft builder, as a
designer and so forth myself.

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:58.380 align:middle line:84%
We work with what's
called polymorphic metals.

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And these metals
are designed such

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:04.800 align:middle line:84%
that they can change shape
under certain influences,

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.160 align:middle line:84%
like magnetic fields
and gravitational fields

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.030 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:12.570 align:middle line:84%
So we will take a design,
or a part of a ship,

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:16.440 align:middle line:84%
or even an entire hull of a
ship, we will take that AI.

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:19.170 align:middle line:84%
We will instruct it-- this
is the shape of the ship

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:20.310 align:middle line:90%
that we want.

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Take the polymorphic
material, put it

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:26.610 align:middle line:84%
into a specific magnetic
field and gravitational field,

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:30.450 align:middle line:84%
and it makes a particular
template of that ship.

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:32.920 align:middle line:84%
So then that hull
becomes a single piece.

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, up to that point
it is transmutable.

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And after we give
the instruction,

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:42.520 align:middle line:84%
then that polymorphic
material retains its shape.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:45.240 align:middle line:90%
Now, the ships are self-healing.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:48.790 align:middle line:84%
That means if it takes a hit
or it's damaged in some form,

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:50.140 align:middle line:90%
it will heal itself.

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:51.240 align:middle line:90%
It has a memory.

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And the AI that
controls the ship,

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:57.430 align:middle line:84%
that AI then instructs the
ship, return to this, do this,

00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:58.240 align:middle line:90%
do that.

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.000 align:middle line:84%
So they can heal
themselves and return

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.500 align:middle line:90%
to normality very quickly.

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:07.080 align:middle line:84%
We use crystal and reactors
to power the engines.

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.210 align:middle line:84%
In the case of the
cruiser, we have

00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:13.710 align:middle line:84%
a minimum of four engines,
four crystal reactors,

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:18.040 align:middle line:84%
and they are producing
enormous amounts of power.

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:22.860 align:middle line:84%
These reactors have a little
device shaped like a merkaba.

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:26.700 align:middle line:84%
This merkaba, and thousands
and thousands of them,

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:31.450 align:middle line:84%
are set inside a gravitational
and electromagnetic field.

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:35.560 align:middle line:84%
So as these toroidal fluids are
moving, all of these merkabas

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:36.360 align:middle line:90%
are traveling.

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Then this thing is
assembled like an onion,

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.890 align:middle line:90%
and it has layers.

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And each layer is
moving as the toroid,

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:46.890 align:middle line:84%
and they're all
reinforcing and re-enacting

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:49.120 align:middle line:90%
the field for each other.

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And then the energy is
extracted from this reactor

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:54.480 align:middle line:90%
as free energy.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:57.360 align:middle line:84%

to do the work.

order to travel through time,

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:08.970 align:middle line:90%
that are becoming aware.

00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:12.870 align:middle line:84%
So they are the main
people that can download

00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:16.050 align:middle line:84%
what is being created
in the sixth dimension

00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:18.150 align:middle line:90%
into the third dimension.

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:20.520 align:middle line:10%
Basically, they
say if all creation

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:23.250 align:middle line:10%
comes from the sixth dimension
to the third dimension, that

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:25.290 align:middle line:10%
means that the third
dimension can also

00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:27.900 align:middle line:10%
be able to modify
the sixth dimension

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:31.050 align:middle line:10%
and to create a new reality.

00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:34.920 align:middle line:10%
Their agenda is to help each
one of these worlds that

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.620 align:middle line:10%
are in process of
evolution to become

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:41.140 align:middle line:10%
the creators of
their own reality.

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:45.690 align:middle line:84%
So the Pleiadeans are the only
ones that can teach us and show

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:50.760 align:middle line:84%
us how to connect with that
inner truth that other species

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.260 align:middle line:90%
cannot.

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:55.680 align:middle line:84%
So listening to them
and connecting to them

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:59.040 align:middle line:84%
would be the best
option for us today.

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>> As we are so close
to the Pleiades,

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:04.470 align:middle line:84%
you could see why a civilization
like that would want to keep

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:05.730 align:middle line:90%
an eye on us.

00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:11.100 align:middle line:10%
Because what we do on our planet
could have dramatic effects

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.530 align:middle line:10%
on their star system.

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:17.400 align:middle line:84%
So they are coming here,
infiltrating, trying to guide.

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.430 align:middle line:84%
Make sure that we don't do
anything stupid, I think,

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:22.530 align:middle line:90%
is their number one imperative.

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:27.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Regarding the Pleiades,
I believe they are 444 light

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:28.960 align:middle line:10%
years away.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:33.340 align:middle line:10%
That's some distance to travel
every day to go to work.

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm not sure
where they're living.

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they have a bungalow out
at Area 51 or some other place.

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:42.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm not joking about that.

00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:47.580 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they have facilities for
these ET races to live here.

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:49.680 align:middle line:84%
They come from another
planet, and they

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.900 align:middle line:90%
might have special needs.

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.900 align:middle line:84%
They might have to breathe
different atmosphere,

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:56.310 align:middle line:90%
eat different foods.

00:27:56.310 --> 00:28:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And so there may be something
that they require to survive,

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:02.980 align:middle line:90%
environmentally speaking.

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And so we might have
to accommodate them

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:06.930 align:middle line:90%
in some special way.

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:10.227 align:middle line:90%

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.330 align:middle line:84%
The Pleiadeans are
very benevolent beings

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:16.970 align:middle line:90%
and always available to help.

00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Any time you need them or
want anything from them,

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:24.680 align:middle line:84%
all you have to do is ask and
they will communicate with you.

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:27.380 align:middle line:84%
When we are at the
point in our evolution

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.960 align:middle line:84%
where extraterrestrials
will walk amongst us,

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:34.030 align:middle line:84%
you will see a
lot of Pleiadeans.

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there's a strong,
ongoing influence that

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:39.310 align:middle line:90%
the Pleiadean culture has here.

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:41.440 align:middle line:90%
And we need it right now.

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:44.440 align:middle line:84%
Because we're in a
stage of humanity

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:49.330 align:middle line:84%
trying to open up to the
diversity of our people,

we're not all one way.

We're not all one race.

We're not all one belief system.

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:01.510 align:middle line:84%
But we are many
different kinds of people

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:03.790 align:middle line:84%
with many different
kinds of origins,

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:05.860 align:middle line:90%
many kinds of cultures.

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And the Pleiadeans teach
us to flow like water.

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:14.020 align:middle line:84%
How can you embrace whatever
container you're in,

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:19.330 align:middle line:84%
how can you accept and absorb
anyone's energy as part of you,

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:22.720 align:middle line:84%
and recognize that
we're part of one living

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:25.110 align:middle line:90%

>> They're very invested in us

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.760 align:middle line:90%
of us because they have a goal.

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.070 align:middle line:10%
And the goal is to
preserve this planet

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:40.590 align:middle line:10%
and to preserve us as an
advanced DNA structure.

00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:46.320 align:middle line:84%
Because very soon, we'll be
working on our DNA as portals.

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And once we grow to the
next level of consciousness

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:52.920 align:middle line:84%
and awareness, we'll
be able to utilize

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.290 align:middle line:84%
that to travel
through multiverses
