00:00:08.982 --> 00:00:30.980 align:middle line:90%


00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.640 align:middle line:84%
>> There have been whispers
since the early 1960s that

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.520 align:middle line:84%
the US government and military
have been involved with

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.310 align:middle line:84%
discovering caverns hidden under
the desert of the southwest.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.830 align:middle line:84%
They've also been active in
creating underground cities

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.300 align:middle line:90%
and bases.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.490 align:middle line:84%
One of the more
dramatic scenarios

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.880 align:middle line:84%
involves an underground base
near the town of Dulce, New

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.020 align:middle line:90%
Mexico.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.910 align:middle line:84%
The first base came
into prominence

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.540 align:middle line:84%
when UFO researcher Paul
Bennewitz accidentally

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.190 align:middle line:90%
discovered it.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.430 align:middle line:90%
But who was Paul Bennewitz?

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.030 align:middle line:10%
>> So Paul Bennewitz was a
US private scientist who had

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.720 align:middle line:10%
a small defense
company of his own.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.400 align:middle line:10%
And he did contract work for
the US military in the 1970s.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Paul Bennewitz
lived right across

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.950 align:middle line:84%
from Kirtland Air Force
Base in New Mexico.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And in the mid to late
1970s, started to detect--

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.620 align:middle line:84%
he had very sophisticated
instrumentation at his home--

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.980 align:middle line:84%
detect what he believed were
UFOs over Kirtland and Manzano

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.080 align:middle line:84%
as well, the weapons
storage area nearby there.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Detect different types
of communications

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.380 align:middle line:84%
signals that he believed
he had translated.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.880 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I have
translations of those.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And so he became
convinced that there

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.210 align:middle line:84%
was serious UFO and basically
extraterrestrial activity

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.850 align:middle line:84%
over Kirtland and Manzano, the
weapons storage facility where

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.490 align:middle line:90%
there was a ton of nukes.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>> And Bennewitz had
an interest in UFOs.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.770 align:middle line:10%
And this was expanded
upon by the fact

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.110 align:middle line:10%
that he started to see in
the skies over Kirtland

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.560 align:middle line:10%
these strange objects performing
all sorts of weird maneuvers.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.550 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, the equipment
at the Thunder company

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.090 align:middle line:84%
was picking up these
unusual, unexplained noises,

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.720 align:middle line:84%
which seemed to be some
sort of coded message.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And Bennewitz came
to believe that what

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.350 align:middle line:84%
he was seeing in the sky
were definitive UFOs,

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.430 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial spacecraft,
and that these coded messages he

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.490 align:middle line:84%
was picking up were
covert messages

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.200 align:middle line:84%
from extraterrestrial craft to
other extraterrestrial craft.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And he began to dig into
this issue very, very deeply.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Paul Bennewitz lived in
Albuquerque next to Kirtland

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.190 align:middle line:84%
Air Force Base, which was and
is a center of a lot of secret

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.970 align:middle line:84%
weapons and weapons systems
and aircraft research.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.938 align:middle line:10%
And so he was
uniquely positioned

00:02:57.938 --> 00:02:59.480 align:middle line:10%
to see what was
going on, on the base

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.950 align:middle line:10%
because he lived on a hill.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.190 align:middle line:10%
His house is still there,
overlooking the entire base.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And he could see things,
especially late at night

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.640 align:middle line:90%
when they were doing testing.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't figure
anybody was up at that hour,

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.330 align:middle line:90%
but Paul Bennewitz was.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.210 align:middle line:84%
He had a degree, I
think a master's,

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.550 align:middle line:90%
in electrical engineering.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And so he began intercepting
radio communications closely

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.310 align:middle line:84%
involving Manzano nuclear
facility there in New Mexico.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And so he was able to get
some of this information

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.580 align:middle line:84%
about UFOs, monitoring this
facility, spying on that.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.610 align:middle line:10%
And he was getting some really
interesting communications

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.520 align:middle line:10%
that he felt were
extraterrestrial in origin.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And he learned a lot of things
about the extraterrestrials

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.080 align:middle line:84%
or whoever it was in the UFOs
that were [INAUDIBLE] in them,

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.900 align:middle line:84%
communicating amongst
themselves and communicating

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.000 align:middle line:90%
with actors on the ground.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So he foolishly and naively
alerted the US government

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.010 align:middle line:90%
to this fact.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.177 align:middle line:10%
In fact, he wrote letters
to President Ronald Reagan

00:03:57.177 --> 00:03:58.010 align:middle line:10%
after 1981.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.090 align:middle line:90%
Several, I think.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.370 align:middle line:90%
Alerted the people of Kirtland.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, he started seeing
and then filming with a 8

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.300 align:middle line:84%
millimeter camera, I believe,
these objects lighting up,

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.780 align:middle line:84%
raising up in the air, going off
behind a mountain and dropping

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:12.920 align:middle line:90%
down behind the mountain.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.670 align:middle line:10%
And he said he thought that
these were some sort of UFOs

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.040 align:middle line:10%
with aliens piloting them.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.772 align:middle line:10%
And he wanted the Air
Force to know this,

00:04:20.772 --> 00:04:23.105 align:middle line:10%
as if somehow they wouldn't
know that this was going on,

00:04:23.105 --> 00:04:24.350 align:middle line:10%
on their own base.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.375 align:middle line:84%
He also said he saw
people walking around them

00:04:26.375 --> 00:04:28.910 align:middle line:84%
with flashlights
before they took off,

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.590 align:middle line:90%
which is another weird thing.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.220 align:middle line:84%
>> He essentially opened his
entire box up to them and said,

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.200 align:middle line:90%
I've been seeing these objects.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.880 align:middle line:90%
I've been filming them.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.970 align:middle line:84%
There are these coded
transmissions coming from them.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And I've recorded them, and
I'm starting to decipher them.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.340 align:middle line:84%
So for people working
at the base who

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.070 align:middle line:84%
were enlisted to take part in
these controversial classified

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.070 align:middle line:84%
programs, Bennewitz
was immediately

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.000 align:middle line:84%
perceived as a potential
threat to national security.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Because he was
digging into something

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.390 align:middle line:84%
that was highly controversial,
but also deeply secret as well.

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.990 align:middle line:84%
So he really tipped the
scales against himself.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the
people at the base

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.010 align:middle line:84%
began saying to him, well,
what is it that you found?

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.990 align:middle line:10%
Maybe we can help
you a little bit.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.540 align:middle line:10%
But this was rarely done
to try and convince him

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.660 align:middle line:10%
to open up and tell
them everything he knew.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.250 align:middle line:10%
That would then
allow them to see

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.150 align:middle line:10%
how much damage had been
done and how much damage

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.300 align:middle line:10%
control they then had
to put into place.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.970 align:middle line:10%
So looking back at
it, we could say

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:39.530 align:middle line:10%
it was almost his own
worst enemy by revealing

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.360 align:middle line:10%
what it was that he'd found.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>> So this was something him
being a loyal American citizen,

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.350 align:middle line:84%
he went to the Air Force Office
of Special Investigations.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And he began working with
one of their intelligence

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.690 align:middle line:90%
officials, Richard Doty.

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And Doty was basically
having Bennewitz debriefed.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.890 align:middle line:10%
And then actually, they came up
with some funding for Bennewitz

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.840 align:middle line:10%
to continue to do this
research because they

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.430 align:middle line:10%
were interested in
finding out what

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.810 align:middle line:10%
it was Bennewitz had learned.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Bennewitz was fully aware
that he was being watched.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.310 align:middle line:10%
But he took it as almost
like a double-edged sword

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.710 align:middle line:10%
that he knew that
he was being watched

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.940 align:middle line:10%
and he wasn't too
happy about that.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.000 align:middle line:84%
But on the other
hand, he realized

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.440 align:middle line:84%
that if he was
being watched, then

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.150 align:middle line:84%
clearly, he was
on the right path.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.780 align:middle line:84%
So he tried to
juggle things where

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.320 align:middle line:84%
he knew some of these people
were somewhat hostile to him,

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.590 align:middle line:84%
but others were actually
trying to help him

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.060 align:middle line:90%
by giving information.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.080 align:middle line:84%
So it was a case of
having to work with one

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.550 align:middle line:84%
and having to put
up with the other.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.240 align:middle line:84%
>> So Air Force Office of
Special Investigations was

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.190 align:middle line:84%
trying to work out
what's going on.

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.160 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, they
were ordered to basically

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.040 align:middle line:90%
take Bennewitz out.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.428 align:middle line:84%
And the way they did it
was to work with the grays,

00:06:53.428 --> 00:06:54.970 align:middle line:84%
because they did
have agreements with

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:56.530 align:middle line:90%
the gray extraterrestrials.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And gray extraterrestrials
began messing with Bennewitz.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And basically, he had
a nervous breakdown.

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's when his
involvement in this whole field

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.190 align:middle line:90%
came to an end.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Paul Bennewitz was led to
believe that there was a secret

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:16.240 align:middle line:84%
underground base located
near Dulce, New Mexico.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.140 align:middle line:84%
He began flying there in his
plane to check out the area.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Eventually, what happened
was they began to mess with him.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And some extraterrestrials, a
group of gray extraterrestrials

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.730 align:middle line:84%
that were working with the
military in the Dulce base.

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Bennewitz's radio
equipment had been

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.040 align:middle line:84%
able to intercept
the communications

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.370 align:middle line:84%
between the extraterrestrials
and the human operators

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.710 align:middle line:84%
in the base, in the
underground base.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.870 align:middle line:84%
So Dulce becomes a point
of focus for Bennewitz.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And he trains his
equipment there.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And he has some high speed
photographic equipment

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.140 align:middle line:90%
there as well.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And he's actually
able to photograph

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.970 align:middle line:84%
some of the ships,
some of the UFOs

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:56.070 align:middle line:84%
going into the mesa,
where you actually

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:59.490 align:middle line:84%
have a kind of vibrational
shift in some of the craft.

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:03.540 align:middle line:10%
>> And the more he dug into
it, he found himself exposed

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.480 align:middle line:10%
to even more
nightmarish stories,

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.310 align:middle line:10%
many of them coming from Dulce.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:10.930 align:middle line:84%
For example, a lot
of these insiders,

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.590 align:middle line:84%
whistleblowers if you
like, claimed to him

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:16.260 align:middle line:84%
that all sorts of
unspeakable experiments

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.710 align:middle line:84%
were being undertaken
in the Dulce base.

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:21.960 align:middle line:84%
People were being
used as guinea pigs,

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:26.100 align:middle line:84%
if you like, in bizarre
genetic experiments,

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:29.610 align:middle line:84%
splicing alien and
human DNA together

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:34.830 align:middle line:84%
and creating strange half
human, half alien creatures.

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And reportedly, there
were hundreds and hundreds

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:41.270 align:middle line:84%
of people kept in the
Dulce base in cages,

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:45.065 align:middle line:84%
the people who go missing
every year, that kind of thing.

00:08:45.065 --> 00:08:47.190 align:middle line:84%
>> So Bennewitz did strongly
believe that there was

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:49.800 align:middle line:84%
an underground base
at Dulce, New Mexico.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.810 align:middle line:84%
I don't think he was
necessarily far off, to be

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.140 align:middle line:90%
perfectly honest with you.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't necessarily discredit
what Bennewitz thinks.

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.770 align:middle line:84%
I think it's entirely possible
that there was and may even

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:02.400 align:middle line:84%
still be some underground
activity near Dulce.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.130 align:middle line:84%
First of all, just
generally speaking,

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:10.560 align:middle line:84%
it is documented and known that
no later than the 1960s did

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:16.590 align:middle line:84%
the United States Navy have
detailed plans to build

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.740 align:middle line:84%
deep underground facilities,
deep underground military bases

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:24.280 align:middle line:84%
down in various parts of the
United States and globally.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And not just under the ground,
but under the ocean floor.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.190 align:middle line:84%
We have illustrations,
drawings of this at the time

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.640 align:middle line:84%
by illustrators who were
hired by the Navy to do this.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.890 align:middle line:84%
Now whether they did it or
not is another question.

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:36.765 align:middle line:84%
But certainly, they were
thinking about this.

00:09:36.765 --> 00:09:39.120 align:middle line:10%
And by the way, the expense,
the money, the technology,

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.930 align:middle line:10%
all of that was totally doable
in the context of 1960s.

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:44.010 align:middle line:90%
So it could be done.

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.140 align:middle line:84%
All you need to do for
an underground ocean base

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.135 align:middle line:84%
is extract oxygen
out of the water.

00:09:48.135 --> 00:09:49.260 align:middle line:90%
And we know how to do that.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.620 align:middle line:90%
We've done that since the '50s.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Have a source of
energy down there,

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.420 align:middle line:84%
and you can play ping pong and
under nice fluorescent lighting

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.850 align:middle line:84%
for days and weeks and
months, no problem.

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:58.470 align:middle line:84%
Underground bases
are not difficult.

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:03.270 align:middle line:84%
Underground bases under
the mountains, ditto.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:07.020 align:middle line:10%
>> In northern New Mexico,
animals are being found drained

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.570 align:middle line:10%
of blood with organs removed.

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Black helicopters were seen
flying around the area,

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:15.150 align:middle line:90%
strange lights, UFOs.

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And it all revolved
around this huge mesa,

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:22.620 align:middle line:84%
which overlooks Dulce,
called the Archuleta mesa.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.320 align:middle line:84%
One of the intriguing
theories is

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:29.100 align:middle line:84%
that there exists within
and below this huge mesa

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:32.640 align:middle line:84%
some sort of fortified
alien installation,

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.190 align:middle line:84%
an extraterrestrial
base if you like.

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And certainly since
the 1970s, right

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:40.740 align:middle line:84%
through to the present
day, a lot of research

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.170 align:middle line:84%
has been done into
the Dulce area

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:45.850 align:middle line:90%
to try and answer that question.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:49.530 align:middle line:84%
Are extraterrestrials
living under New Mexico

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:51.210 align:middle line:90%
in the Dulce area?

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:53.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Back in the
1950s in Farmington,

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:58.230 align:middle line:10%
there was an armada of UFOs seen
going from Farmington eastward

00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:59.570 align:middle line:10%
towards Dulce.

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:01.080 align:middle line:90%
Terrified everybody.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:05.280 align:middle line:84%
Made the newspapers,
and then nothing.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.970 align:middle line:84%
>> In today's world, a lot of
nations do have underground

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:09.770 align:middle line:90%
installations.

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:13.080 align:middle line:10%
It makes a great deal of
sense because if God forbid

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.170 align:middle line:10%
there was ever a
nuclear war, then

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:19.500 align:middle line:10%
if some sort of containment
of our governments

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.900 align:middle line:10%
is going to take place
and continuation,

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:25.240 align:middle line:10%
then the best place to be in a
third world war is underground.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.260 align:middle line:90%
It makes sense.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.140 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of these
installations were

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.510 align:middle line:84%
built during the
height of the Cold War

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:33.300 align:middle line:84%
to protect the governments
while, unfortunately, the rest

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.700 align:middle line:90%
of us are left upstairs to fry.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:40.860 align:middle line:10%
And one of the theories is that
some of these installations

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:45.170 align:middle line:10%
may have been built for
potential in the events

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:46.620 align:middle line:10%
of a third world war.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.860 align:middle line:10%
But over time, they may
have been reorganized

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.890 align:middle line:10%
and transformed
to where you have

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:57.430 align:middle line:10%
these alien-human
interactions going on.

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.940 align:middle line:10%
In other words, very
much like Dulce.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:04.560 align:middle line:84%
>> We had people coming forward,
finally sharing UFO sightings,

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.620 align:middle line:84%
engagements with cryptids,
creatures they could not

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:08.670 align:middle line:90%
explain.

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:12.060 align:middle line:84%
For the first time on
record, multiple families

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:16.360 align:middle line:84%
independent of one another
said they hear traffic

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:21.010 align:middle line:84%
beneath their town, traffic,
traffic like cars and trucks.

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.365 align:middle line:84%
They hear what sounds
like a train system.

00:12:23.365 --> 00:12:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And we all know about
the maglev tunnel

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:26.670 align:middle line:90%
system that supposedly exists.

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:30.480 align:middle line:10%
There, there is one that
exists within the Los Alamos

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.480 align:middle line:10%
infrastructure.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.430 align:middle line:84%
There's an underground
maglev system.

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:37.580 align:middle line:10%
>> What's interesting about
Dulce itself is that back

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:42.740 align:middle line:10%
in 1967, there was a program
called Operation Gasbuggy.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And ostensibly, it was
to detonate atomic bombs

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:53.000 align:middle line:84%
underground in the Dulce area
to try and extract natural gas.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.630 align:middle line:84%
Now some researchers believe
that that was a cover story.

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And the nuclear
blasting was actually

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:03.410 align:middle line:84%
done to expand the
Dulce base or even

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:07.860 align:middle line:84%
to try and wipe out the hostile
aliens that were down there.

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.220 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we
have this situation

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:12.620 align:middle line:84%
where, according
to Phil Schneider,

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:16.730 align:middle line:84%
the Dulce base was
almost like a nightmarish

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:20.520 align:middle line:90%
Frankenstein's type lab.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.250 align:middle line:84%
>> The small town of Dulce
always experienced a lot

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:25.260 align:middle line:90%
of high strangeness.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.680 align:middle line:84%
However, in the mid
1990s, a man came forth

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.860 align:middle line:84%
with a stunning story
about his experiences

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:36.000 align:middle line:84%
in an underground base built
under the Archuleta mesa,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.240 align:middle line:90%
just north of Dulce.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.460 align:middle line:90%
His name was Phil Schneider.

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:45.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Phil Schneider, he started
going public in the mid 1990s.

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And he started attending
some UFO conferences

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.490 align:middle line:84%
and started to reveal his
background as a civil engineer.

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:56.120 align:middle line:84%
He showed his documentation that
he was the son of an Operation

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.180 align:middle line:84%
Paperclip scientist and
that he was recruited

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:00.710 align:middle line:90%
into these covert programs.

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:02.690 align:middle line:84%
That tends to be a kind
of generational thing.

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:05.360 align:middle line:10%
So he just followed
his father's footsteps,

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.000 align:middle line:10%
building these
underground bases that

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.210 align:middle line:10%
would be joint facilities
for extraterrestrials

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:14.270 align:middle line:10%
and elite human units.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:17.030 align:middle line:84%
So he's building these
bases all over the place.

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:19.070 align:middle line:84%
He's part of the team
that kind of like

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:21.500 align:middle line:84%
is looking at
different areas that

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.530 align:middle line:84%
would be suitable for the
construction of a base.

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And he described a number of
incidents, one of the incidents

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:32.630 align:middle line:84%
that happened in 1979,
the famous Dulce battle,

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:35.420 align:middle line:84%
where he says that
they sunk a shaft.

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:39.110 align:middle line:84%
They were basically doing
some mining exploration there

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:42.710 align:middle line:84%
to see where they could build
a facility in that arena.

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And they basically
came into an area

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:48.500 align:middle line:84%
that was a very old
cavern system, where

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.450 align:middle line:84%
gray extraterrestrials
had a base.

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And the story was
that what happened

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:55.700 align:middle line:84%
was that there were elite
military units that went down

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.370 align:middle line:84%
there, Delta forces and
other special forces.

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:00.740 align:middle line:84%
SEALs and so forth
went down there.

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And they basically
encountered these tall, gray

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.130 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrials.

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And so there was a
firefight down there.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And approximately, 60 military
personnel and scientists

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:14.540 align:middle line:90%
were killed.

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And Schneider gets
wounded, but he's alive,

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:19.790 align:middle line:84%
and he gets extracted
out of there.

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:21.740 align:middle line:10%
So that's the
famous Dulce battle,

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:29.120 align:middle line:10%
which was basically where the
US military went into an area

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.160 align:middle line:10%
where they weren't
supposed to be.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:35.500 align:middle line:84%
>> His version of events is that
there was an altercation there.

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.230 align:middle line:84%
He was involved in
the altercation.

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:42.190 align:middle line:84%
He was hit with some sort of a
plasma weapon, which seared off

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:43.510 align:middle line:90%
a portion of his hand.

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And that he had managed
to escape with samples,

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.870 align:middle line:84%
synthetic samples that were
synthesized by the grays that

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:54.730 align:middle line:84%
essentially led
to the development

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:56.010 align:middle line:90%
of our stealth technology.

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:59.770 align:middle line:84%
He was displaying these
at conferences as part

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:01.480 align:middle line:90%
of these preparedness expos.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.000 align:middle line:84%
He had this whole connection
to the aliens, essentially.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And for him, the catalyst
was his time at Dulce.

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And it was this 1979
engagement with the grays.

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:14.912 align:middle line:84%
And that's pretty much
the crux of his story.

00:16:14.912 --> 00:16:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And as you know, he went
on the lecture circuit

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:18.820 align:middle line:90%
and died as a result.

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:21.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Phil Schneider was an
interesting character who is

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:23.020 align:middle line:90%
now deceased.

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:26.500 align:middle line:84%
His father was a man
named Oscar Schneider,

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:31.090 align:middle line:84%
who had a lot of responsibility
during the Second World War.

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:34.000 align:middle line:84%
He was involved in
early atomic bomb tests,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.430 align:middle line:90%
worked on nuclear submarines.

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.590 align:middle line:10%
And according to Phil
Schneider, his father

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:42.190 align:middle line:10%
also worked on the infamous
Philadelphia experiments

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:46.930 align:middle line:10%
in 1943, which was allegedly a
program to try and make a war

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:49.690 align:middle line:10%
ship invisible to the enemy.

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:52.060 align:middle line:84%
But as far as Phil
Schneider is concerned,

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:55.600 align:middle line:84%
he came forward,
many years ago now,

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.390 align:middle line:84%
talking about how he
said he was an engineer

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:01.990 align:middle line:84%
and was working on
a lot of programs

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:06.130 align:middle line:84%
to construct massive
underground installations

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:08.200 align:middle line:90%
all across the United States.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:12.369 align:middle line:84%
And so Schneider
began in the mid 1990s

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:15.660 align:middle line:84%
talking about the Dulce battle,
talking about his involvement

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.339 align:middle line:84%
in building these
underground bases.

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:21.369 align:middle line:84%
He said that there were
just over 100 of them, all

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:23.124 align:middle line:84%
over the United
States, that there

00:17:23.124 --> 00:17:25.690 align:middle line:84%
are some in other places
of the world like Pine

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:27.480 align:middle line:90%
Gap in Australia.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:31.180 align:middle line:84%
He's disclosed the size of the
budget, of the black budget.

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And his estimate
was pretty accurate.

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:35.200 align:middle line:84%
He said back in
that day, he said

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.190 align:middle line:84%
it was around a
trillion dollars.

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:40.850 align:middle line:84%
So he's talking about
the early 1990s.

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And it was funding
all these bases.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.780 align:middle line:10%
And he broke ranks
when he realized

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:51.580 align:middle line:10%
that what was being created
was a new world government,

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:56.050 align:middle line:10%
that he saw a facility that
was being created that would

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:58.780 align:middle line:10%
host the United Nations.

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:01.480 align:middle line:84%
And he said that what
greatly disturbed

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.930 align:middle line:84%
him was that where the United
Nations diplomats would

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:09.340 align:middle line:84%
be meeting and conducting
their business for the planet,

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:13.360 align:middle line:84%
that above them was a
kind of alcove where

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:16.030 align:middle line:84%
the gray extraterrestrials
would be observing.

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And he realized that the new
world order was basically

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:23.440 align:middle line:84%
going to be controlled by these
gray extraterrestrials, who

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:27.830 align:middle line:84%
were working with the German
groups out of Antartica.

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And so this was something
that he decided that he

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:33.040 align:middle line:90%
couldn't go along with this.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.360 align:middle line:90%
He would reveal the truth.

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's what he was doing,
right up until early 1996.

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:43.540 align:middle line:84%
He turns up dead in his
apartment, strangled.

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:46.570 align:middle line:84%
An autopsy isn't
really conducted.

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And people start
disclosing that this

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.588 align:middle line:84%
is exactly what he had
been warning against,

00:18:51.588 --> 00:18:53.380 align:middle line:84%
that he would be
assassinated for revealing

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:54.730 align:middle line:90%
all this information.

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was made to
look like a suicide.

00:18:56.650 --> 00:19:00.790 align:middle line:10%
But the people who knew him and
know about the circumstances,

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:04.750 align:middle line:10%
the lack of a rigorous
autopsy, that Schneider

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:08.230 align:middle line:10%
had been murdered for
revealing too much.

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:12.340 align:middle line:10%
>> The fact of the matter
is, is that he was killed

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:14.490 align:middle line:10%
because of what he was doing.

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's very clear to
researchers who looked into it.

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:21.220 align:middle line:84%
There is an effort
underway right now

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:22.940 align:middle line:90%
to suppress that information.

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:24.580 align:middle line:84%
There are books
that are coming out

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:27.770 align:middle line:84%
that are filled with alternative
realities of what actually

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:28.570 align:middle line:90%
occurred.

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And all of them are part of this
narrative that he was a liar.

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.240 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing in Dulce.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.880 align:middle line:84%
Everybody just please go
away and forget about all

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:40.420 align:middle line:90%
of this nonsense of gray aliens.

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the primary things
that Phil Schneider talked

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:49.060 align:middle line:84%
about at Dulce was this
particular issue of human

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:54.160 align:middle line:84%
beings used against their will
in strange and controversial

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.320 align:middle line:90%
genetic experimentation.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.680 align:middle line:84%
The other angle that Phil
Schneider was also well known

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:03.820 align:middle line:84%
for was pointing out that we,
the human race, the military,

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:08.110 align:middle line:84%
the government had lost
control of the Dulce base.

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:09.743 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we weren't there.

00:20:09.743 --> 00:20:11.410 align:middle line:84%
But most of the people
who were in there

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:13.600 align:middle line:84%
were very fearful
of their lives.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:17.260 align:middle line:10%
And Schneider believed
that, essentially, the base

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:20.530 align:middle line:10%
had become not so much
a no go area for us,

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:23.590 align:middle line:10%
but a highly dangerous
place where the aliens were

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:25.280 align:middle line:10%
calling the shots.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:31.450 align:middle line:84%
What it boils down to is that
the Dulce base was, is totally

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:39.070 align:middle line:84%
under alien control, where you
had the base itself constructed

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:42.220 align:middle line:84%
possibly by the military
and people like Schneider

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:43.990 align:middle line:84%
and the people he
was working with.

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:47.350 align:middle line:84%
But then when the alien
component comes along,

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:49.270 align:middle line:90%
things kind of change.

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:51.470 align:middle line:90%
They start to take control.

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:53.230 align:middle line:90%
The military retreats.

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:54.670 align:middle line:84%
But according to
Schneider, a lot

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:56.920 align:middle line:84%
of the experiments
that were going on

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.350 align:middle line:84%
under Dulce in this
particular base

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:06.130 align:middle line:84%
were sort of horrendous,
people in jails, if you like,

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:10.180 align:middle line:84%
in chains, held
prisoner and used

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:13.690 align:middle line:84%
by these extraterrestrial
entities how and whenever they

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:14.800 align:middle line:90%
wanted to.

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:20.590 align:middle line:84%
This involved bizarre genetic
experiments, gene splicing,

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:23.650 align:middle line:84%
cross breeding
humans and aliens,

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:27.100 align:middle line:84%
and for want of a better
term, everything being done

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:30.400 align:middle line:84%
for the benefit of the
aliens and none of it being

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.710 align:middle line:90%
done for the benefit of us.

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:36.510 align:middle line:84%
There's no doubt that when
it comes to the Dulce story,

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:40.060 align:middle line:84%
that had it not been
for Phil Schneider,

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.790 align:middle line:84%
Dulce certainly would not
be talked about in the way

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:45.430 align:middle line:90%
that it is today.

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:47.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Phil Schneider was one
of the first people to blow

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:52.540 align:middle line:84%
the whistle on the secret
base under Ducle, New Mexico.

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:54.460 align:middle line:90%
But has anyone else talked?

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:57.850 align:middle line:84%
Has anyone else become
a whistleblower?

00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Gabe Valdez was a New
Mexico state police officer.

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:05.170 align:middle line:10%
And he had, I would say,
a very involved connection

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:08.395 align:middle line:10%
with the people of the Dulce
Jicarilla Apache reservation.

00:22:08.395 --> 00:22:10.850 align:middle line:10%
And he was friends
with lots of them.

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And the Jicarilla have
their own police department.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And I know some of the
veteran police officers

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:19.660 align:middle line:84%
from the Jicarilla
Apache reservation.

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And Gabe was
instrumental in helping

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:26.500 align:middle line:84%
to establish that the
cattle mutilations,

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:30.310 align:middle line:84%
the UFO sightings, everything
that was occuring there

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:34.930 align:middle line:84%
in Dulce led to
something even stranger.

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:39.340 align:middle line:84%
He produced photographs
of a hybrid.

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:43.000 align:middle line:84%
This is a calf
with a human head.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And that made its way into the
public by way of Bill Burns,

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:49.690 align:middle line:90%
his television show.

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And then after it
aired on "UFO Hunters,"

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:55.930 align:middle line:84%
Congress immediately
enacted this law

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:58.938 align:middle line:84%
that stated no human
animal hybridization.

00:22:58.938 --> 00:23:00.230 align:middle line:90%
And then the show was canceled.

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:05.700 align:middle line:90%


00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:09.120 align:middle line:84%
I had a source, an
insider introduced me

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.580 align:middle line:84%
to this retired United
States Air Force Colonel.

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:14.400 align:middle line:84%
That's how I got involved
with the whole Dulce story.

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And he had to get
this off his chest.

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:20.830 align:middle line:84%
This is something that before
he went into permanent hiding,

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:22.860 align:middle line:90%
he had to share with somebody.

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:28.300 align:middle line:84%
So I got the break
of the century.

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And he says he was part of this
classified medical detachment

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:34.620 align:middle line:90%
at the McClellan Air Force Base.

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And what they did was is
they studied these events

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:40.560 align:middle line:84%
that were top secret
military projects

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:42.540 align:middle line:84%
that whenever
something went wrong,

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:45.600 align:middle line:84%
it was his team's job to
immediately go wherever

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.090 align:middle line:84%
this was happening, provide
assessments, and make

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:49.350 align:middle line:90%
determinations.

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:54.010 align:middle line:84%
So he says in '79, he
got a call to report to--

00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:58.398 align:middle line:84%
and not with his team, with an
impromptu put together squad.

00:23:58.398 --> 00:23:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And they were all
supposed to meet up

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:01.710 align:middle line:90%
at Edwards Air Force Base.

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Once there, they would get
briefing documentations

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.350 align:middle line:84%
that they were supposed to read
briefing documents on their way

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:11.670 align:middle line:84%
to this undisclosed facility
in Dulce, New Mexico.

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:13.620 align:middle line:84%
When he was reading
the briefing documents,

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:17.250 align:middle line:84%
he thought he was reading
about Native Americans who

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:21.370 align:middle line:84%
lived in the caverns
at this facility.

00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't make
sense to him why

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:27.230 align:middle line:84%
Native would be living inside
of an underground complex,

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:31.710 align:middle line:84%
a complex series of
caverns and whatnot.

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:34.470 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until they
were about to reach

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:38.290 align:middle line:84%
New Mexico that he realized,
oh, these aren't humans.

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:42.230 align:middle line:84%
I am bringing about
something non-human.

00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And he was chosen specifically
with these other individuals

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.200 align:middle line:84%
because whoever it
was that assembled

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:52.140 align:middle line:84%
the team knew that
this team would not

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.730 align:middle line:90%
crack under the pressure.

00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:56.610 align:middle line:84%
When they got to Dulce, they
knew that they would just

00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:58.650 align:middle line:90%
conduct business as usual.

00:24:58.650 --> 00:24:59.910 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:03.750 align:middle line:84%
For him, it turned into
something fruitful.

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:07.170 align:middle line:10%
He ended up working there
for the next several years.

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:11.310 align:middle line:84%
And through working
there, he learned so much

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:14.390 align:middle line:84%
about this exponential
advancements

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:16.260 align:middle line:90%
in our levels of technology.

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:17.940 align:middle line:90%
It all comes from Dulce.

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:19.560 align:middle line:90%
Everything comes from Dulce.

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:21.810 align:middle line:84%
There's a group in Los Alamos
called the Technological

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:26.400 align:middle line:84%
Commercialization Office that
takes technologies and puts

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.070 align:middle line:84%
them out into the
private sector.

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:31.720 align:middle line:10%
And we made a big discovery.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.680 align:middle line:10%
We discovered a company
called Hyperion.

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.600 align:middle line:84%
It was led by Lady
Barbara Judge who

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.460 align:middle line:84%
was knighted by the
Queen of England,

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:42.030 align:middle line:84%
giving her commander of the
British empire, this very

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:44.850 align:middle line:84%
prestigious knighting,
for two reasons--

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:49.480 align:middle line:84%
her work in the nuclear sector
and the international banking

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:50.280 align:middle line:90%
sector.

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.320 align:middle line:84%
Now here's where
it gets strange.

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:56.280 align:middle line:84%
Hyperion, nobody
knew about them.

00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:00.450 align:middle line:84%
My source said you need to
look into this company in Los

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:01.390 align:middle line:90%
Alamos.

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:02.190 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:06.900 align:middle line:84%
Because there's your proof
of reverse engineered

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:10.170 align:middle line:84%
alien technology or
emerging alien technology,

00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:13.410 align:middle line:84%
because most people don't
realize there's two types.

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:17.490 align:middle line:84%
We go to crash retrievals,
and we find downed ET craft

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:19.440 align:middle line:90%
and reverse engineer it.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:23.250 align:middle line:84%
You go to Dulce, where these
gray beings, these GGs,

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:24.900 align:middle line:84%
these creations of
the Anunnaki have

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:26.880 align:middle line:90%
been living for 25,000 years.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:30.300 align:middle line:84%
And they provide us, they
gift to us in exchange

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.070 align:middle line:90%
with technology for resources.

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:34.380 align:middle line:90%
Now back to Hyperion--

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:37.110 align:middle line:90%
strange company.

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:39.250 align:middle line:90%
I looked up their information.

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to find
their documentation.

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:45.120 align:middle line:90%
And they only sold one thing--

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.610 align:middle line:90%
micro nuclear reactors.

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And they only sold
it to a select few--

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:52.800 align:middle line:84%
offshore drilling and mining
operations and foreign

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.120 align:middle line:90%
militaries.

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:56.280 align:middle line:84%
Now here's where
it gets strange.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.740 align:middle line:84%
The colonel told me that the
Dulce facility is actually

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:01.350 align:middle line:84%
powered by micro
nuclear reactors.

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And he went into specific
detail as to how they are.

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:10.230 align:middle line:84%
It was, like, a year and a half
later when Hyperion information

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:11.610 align:middle line:90%
finally emerged.

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And they have four
office locations.

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:15.960 align:middle line:90%
They're in Los Alamos.

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.340 align:middle line:90%
They are in Langley, Virginia.

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:21.300 align:middle line:84%
They're adjacent to Denver
International Airport

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:24.210 align:middle line:84%
and London, the financial
capital of the world.

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:25.680 align:middle line:10%
Denver being because they--

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.230 align:middle line:10%
of course, if this is the
business that they're in,

00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:30.090 align:middle line:10%
they need to be by
the largest continuity

00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:33.180 align:middle line:10%
of government facility,
which is beneath the airport.

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:34.740 align:middle line:90%
Signs are everywhere.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:37.140 align:middle line:84%
Television shows are being
kicked out of the airport.

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:39.340 align:middle line:84%
Everyone knows what's
happening there.

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:40.740 align:middle line:90%
So we dug deep.

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:42.830 align:middle line:90%
We outed them.

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:44.630 align:middle line:84%
They changed the name
of their company.

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:47.360 align:middle line:84%
They removed all documentation
with regards to the product

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:50.240 align:middle line:84%
that they sell-- one thing--
mico nuclear reactors.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And they're now called
Fortune Technologies.

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And you pretty much
don't know what they do,

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:57.750 align:middle line:84%
but they're still
a public company.

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:00.100 align:middle line:84%
>> The stories surrounding
the area around Dulce,

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:04.750 align:middle line:84%
New Mexico are growing and
getting stranger by the day.

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:08.530 align:middle line:84%
Strange creatures,
aliens, UFOs, and more

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:10.700 align:middle line:90%
have been seen by eyewitnesses.

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:15.580 align:middle line:84%
>> But Dulce is much more than
gray aliens and the engagement

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:18.740 align:middle line:84%
with these gray
aliens by the people.

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:22.870 align:middle line:84%
It has a deep, rich history,
which traces all the way back

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:24.970 align:middle line:84%
to the Anunnaki, who
placed them there

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:27.370 align:middle line:90%
25,000 years ago to die off.

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:30.100 align:middle line:84%
They infected them with
some sort of a virus.

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:32.380 align:middle line:90%
They were not meant to survive.

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.690 align:middle line:84%
John Lear calls them
cybernetic organisms.

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:36.400 align:middle line:90%
And he is partly right.

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:40.300 align:middle line:84%
Because in order to sustain
their continued evolution

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:45.020 align:middle line:84%
to maintain being alive,
they have had to adapt.

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:50.170 align:middle line:84%
They have had to adapt by
becoming a hybrid of technology

00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:53.890 align:middle line:84%
and their biological
makeup to continue on.

00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:55.880 align:middle line:90%
And that's why I think--

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:58.660 align:middle line:84%
that's another reason why you're
seeing a lot of advancements

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:01.330 align:middle line:84%
in robotics with
Boston Dynamics,

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:03.970 align:middle line:90%
artificial intelligence.

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:06.340 align:middle line:10%
>> The local Native
American tribes who live

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:09.940 align:middle line:10%
at the Jicarilla reservation
near Dulce have known about

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:13.390 align:middle line:10%
the presence of these alien
groups for a long time.

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:15.220 align:middle line:84%
>> They've had so
many interactions,

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:19.360 align:middle line:84%
but it is not within their
culture to talk about this

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:20.520 align:middle line:90%
openly.

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:22.820 align:middle line:84%
They don't try to
conceal anything.

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:25.240 align:middle line:84%
But in order for you to
get information from them,

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:26.260 align:middle line:90%
you have to ask them.

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:27.950 align:middle line:90%
And nobody talks to them.

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:31.540 align:middle line:84%
So this chief of police that
we interviewed with the Aspen

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:35.230 align:middle line:84%
Organization and Mufon
both being present,

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:39.820 align:middle line:84%
he gave us in detail description
of what he could only

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:45.430 align:middle line:84%
describe as escaped
projects, experiments

00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:47.740 align:middle line:84%
from unknown projects
at the Dulce facility.

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:51.340 align:middle line:84%
Over a span of 20 years,
he had encountered some,

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:56.800 align:middle line:84%
on average, one a year,
some hybrid or cryptid type

00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:01.230 align:middle line:90%
being between Dulce and Taos.

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:04.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the wilderness
is huge up there.

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And some were reports
that, as a police officer,

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:09.430 align:middle line:90%
he was told to go investigate.

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:10.980 align:middle line:90%
Others, just happenstance.

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:13.480 align:middle line:90%
It just-- out of nowhere.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:17.980 align:middle line:84%
Winged creatures,
hybrid human grays

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:24.670 align:middle line:84%
lost in the woods, people
talking with Bigfoot type

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:27.520 align:middle line:84%
creatures, having
intelligent conversations.

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:30.010 align:middle line:10%
Strange things, and he
believes in his heart

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:32.750 align:middle line:10%
that this all came
about from Dulce,

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:34.000 align:middle line:10%
what they're conducting there.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.870 align:middle line:84%
We know that one of the major
mandates of the Dulce facility

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:41.950 align:middle line:84%
was the super
soldier experiments,

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:44.980 align:middle line:84%
hybrid experiments,
hybridization experiments.

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:48.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's not surprising
to me that him

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:51.880 align:middle line:84%
being an official who's
seeking public office

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:54.940 align:middle line:84%
or going to seek
public office, he

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:57.040 align:middle line:84%
needed to get this
off of his chest,

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.780 align:middle line:90%
this monkey off of his back.

00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:02.950 align:middle line:84%
However, he still couldn't
come out public with it.

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:05.380 align:middle line:84%
But he wanted the
public to know.

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.810 align:middle line:90%
This is crazy.

00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:10.180 align:middle line:84%
This is not what
you would expect

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:14.375 align:middle line:84%
from a current chief of
police of a major community

00:31:14.375 --> 00:31:16.660 align:middle line:90%
in the area.

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>> The most common thing that's
reported that's unusual there

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:21.940 align:middle line:84%
are small two-foot
hairy dwarves.

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:26.080 align:middle line:10%
They're seen constantly,
even in town on Main Street.

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.780 align:middle line:84%
I've been chasing this footage
that somebody has there.

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:30.760 align:middle line:90%
And I'm trying to track it down.

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:35.110 align:middle line:84%
The old casino site had a
surveillance camera set up,

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:36.470 align:middle line:90%
inside and out.

00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And one night, these
dwarves started

00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:41.300 align:middle line:84%
jumping from car to car,
putting dents in people's hoods

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:42.100 align:middle line:90%
in the parking lot.

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.900 align:middle line:90%
And they caught them on camera.

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:46.960 align:middle line:84%
Now according to Hoyt Velarde,
who was, for many years, 30,

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:49.810 align:middle line:84%
35 years, was the head of the
Department of Public Safety

00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:52.540 align:middle line:84%
there, the chief law
enforcement officer,

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:54.730 align:middle line:90%
he confirmed this story to me.

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:59.980 align:middle line:84%
I had another current officer
also confirm the story.

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:02.710 align:middle line:84%
The Big Foot there, there is
extra large Big Foot there,

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:05.680 align:middle line:84%
the largest outside of
the Pacific Northwest,

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:08.260 align:middle line:84%
the largest hairy hominids
that I've heard of.

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:10.440 align:middle line:90%
They go 12 feet around Dulce.

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Hoyt Velarde's had one
right on his property.

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:15.190 align:middle line:84%
He got within 100 feet
of one in broad daylight.

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And he was able to step over a
four strand barbed wire fence

00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:19.960 align:middle line:90%
without even slowing down.

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:22.240 align:middle line:84%
>> There are a number of
theories for what's going

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.950 align:middle line:90%
on at Dulce.

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:28.210 align:middle line:10%
You have the idea that it could
be some sort of very, very

00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:32.380 align:middle line:10%
old alien base that
essentially was constructed

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:35.500 align:middle line:10%
by extraterrestrials,
who knows how long ago.

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.560 align:middle line:84%
Another intriguing and
also controversial theory

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:43.090 align:middle line:84%
is the idea that elements of the
US military or the governments

00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:46.630 align:middle line:84%
are working in tandem
with extraterrestrials

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:48.370 align:middle line:90%
within this space.

00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And an even more
controversial theory

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:53.440 align:middle line:84%
suggests that these
extraterrestrials

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:56.330 align:middle line:90%
may be quite dangerous to us.

00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:58.260 align:middle line:90%
And we actually got kicked out.

00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And for the most part, it's
perceived as sort of a no go

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:03.790 align:middle line:90%
area for the government now.

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:08.140 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be a combination of
all these different scenarios

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:09.100 align:middle line:90%
and theories.

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:11.530 align:middle line:84%
But what we do know
for sure is that there

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:15.490 align:middle line:84%
has been an extraordinary
amount of UFO activity

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:19.600 align:middle line:84%
sightings, abductions,
cattle mutilations

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:23.260 align:middle line:84%
all throughout this
particular area.

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:24.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Whatever is
happening at Dulce,

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:29.270 align:middle line:84%
New Mexico will probably remain
a mystery for the near future.

00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:31.930 align:middle line:84%
The isolation and
lack of population

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:34.690 align:middle line:84%
make the American
Southwest a perfect place

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:36.690 align:middle line:90%
to hide something.

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:38.890 align:middle line:84%
In our next episode
of "Deep Space,"

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:41.560 align:middle line:84%
we travel to the past
to explore encounters

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:44.220 align:middle line:90%
with otherworldly visitors.

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:46.000 align:middle line:90%
