compiled for NASA by four

of the top scientists and
astronomers of the time.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.840 align:middle line:10%
The report became known as the
Translunar Phenomena Report.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.440 align:middle line:10%
It was a compilation of reports
of odd and strange lights seen

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.070 align:middle line:10%
on the lunar surface by
astronomers in the past.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.370 align:middle line:84%
These events included the
sightings of moving objects,

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.280 align:middle line:84%
flashes of light, and
many other odd events

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.900 align:middle line:90%

The people reporting
these events

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.970 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of the Moon
were famous astronomers.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.790 align:middle line:84%
In this constellation,
there are many reports

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.330 align:middle line:84%
of odd and strange activity
around the crater called

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.030 align:middle line:90%
Aristarchus.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.050 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1966, Barbara Middlehurst
presented a paper on transient

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.430 align:middle line:90%
lunar phenomena.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.340 align:middle line:10%
It was an exhaustive compilation
of light phenomena appearing

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.190 align:middle line:10%
on the Moon since the
dawn of the telescope.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.140 align:middle line:84%
These transient lunar
phenomena include

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.650 align:middle line:84%
light of different colors,
some solid and flashing,

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.930 align:middle line:84%
some stay still,
and others move.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.060 align:middle line:84%
In some cases you have
groups of phenomena

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.160 align:middle line:84%
that were moving in
different directions

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.780 align:middle line:90%
all at the same time.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.940 align:middle line:10%
What's particular of
interest in this case is

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.580 align:middle line:10%
in many of these
phenomena around 60%

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.370 align:middle line:10%
have been seen all around
the crater Aristarchus.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.340 align:middle line:10%
And when the Clementine space
probe flew over the crater,

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.500 align:middle line:10%
a very obvious blue
dome was visible.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.420 align:middle line:10%


00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.510 align:middle line:10%
Taken together, this study
of transient lunar phenomena

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.990 align:middle line:10%
suggests that there have been
ongoing observations of ET

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.030 align:middle line:10%
piloted vehicles
that have existed

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.500 align:middle line:10%
around the Moon and its surface
since all of recorded history.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.780 align:middle line:84%
This is not something
that's hard to understand.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.820 align:middle line:84%
These sightings were
done independently

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.920 align:middle line:84%
throughout the world,
sometimes professionally,

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.840 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes done by an
amateur telescope operator.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.340 align:middle line:84%
The point is that when you're
faced with the weight of data,

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.510 align:middle line:84%
you are looking at something
that is actually genuine.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.990 align:middle line:10%
This is an ongoing phenomena
that is well documented,

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.610 align:middle line:10%
but once the Apollo missions
start, the blanket of secrecy

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.920 align:middle line:10%
comes down and you never hear
about the transient lunar

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.406 align:middle line:10%
phenomena again.

>> I guess the question then
would be then, well, OK,

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.590 align:middle line:10%
if there were these ancient
astronauts, as they call them,

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.400 align:middle line:10%
in our distant past, did they
all leave or are some of them

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.512 align:middle line:10%
still here?

00:03:07.512 --> 00:03:08.470 align:middle line:90%
How do you answer that?

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.370 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's real simple.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.860 align:middle line:84%
You look at truthfully and
clearly at human history.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.420 align:middle line:84%
If, as we're taught
in school, we

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.560 align:middle line:84%
are the product of just
a slow evolutionary climb

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.380 align:middle line:84%
from cavemen, to
hunter-gatherers,

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.360 align:middle line:84%
to city-states, to nations,
to empires, as we're taught,

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.550 align:middle line:84%
then that should be our
history and there shouldn't

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:31.960 align:middle line:90%
be anything else there.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.370 align:middle line:10%
But if you look
carefully, you'll

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.660 align:middle line:10%
find that from the flying
boats of the ancient Egyptians,

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.840 align:middle line:10%
to the dragons of the Chinese,
to the Dogon tribe in Africa

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.770 align:middle line:10%
that talks about the
people come from Sirius,

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.220 align:middle line:10%
and you talk with the
aborigines in Australia that

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.940 align:middle line:10%
talk about the gods, you talk
about the Aztecs and the Incas

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.480 align:middle line:10%
that talk about the
gods from the sky,

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.130 align:middle line:10%
and then you bring it
right up to the UFO,

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.530 align:middle line:10%
to the cattle mutilations,
to the crop circles,

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.960 align:middle line:10%
to the abductions,
somebody's still here.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.920 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that we have
been observed and monitored

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.100 align:middle line:90%
for a long, long time.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.760 align:middle line:84%
I think what we call the
UFO phenomenon probably goes

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.950 align:middle line:90%
through our entire history.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.570 align:middle line:10%
For me, when I look at ancient
advanced, like ridiculously,

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.519 align:middle line:10%
inexplicably
advanced technology,

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.589 align:middle line:10%
the one thing I
continue to go back to

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:23.660 align:middle line:10%
is the Great Pyramid at Giza.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.780 align:middle line:84%
There is in my view not any
conventional explanation

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.828 align:middle line:90%
for this at all.

00:04:28.828 --> 00:04:31.370 align:middle line:84%
When you start getting into the
mathematics, the engineering,

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.750 align:middle line:84%
the geographic location of it,
among many, many other things,

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.633 align:middle line:84%
this indicates to me that
whoever built that pyramid knew

00:04:38.633 --> 00:04:39.800 align:middle line:90%
that the Earth was a sphere.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.675 align:middle line:10%
They knew exactly where
they were in relation

00:04:41.675 --> 00:04:43.310 align:middle line:10%
to the entire world.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.090 align:middle line:10%
They had engineering and
transport capabilities

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.510 align:middle line:10%
that no one is able to explain.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.250 align:middle line:84%
They completed a task that not
a single human civilization

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.380 align:middle line:84%
could possibly have done until
possibly the last 100 years.

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.810 align:middle line:84%
It's even a stretch to ask
ourselves could we have done;

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.010 align:middle line:90%
duplicated this today?

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.330 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we could.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.750 align:middle line:84%
But could we have even done it
as recently as 100 years ago?

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.720 align:middle line:84%
Could the United States
of say Teddy Roosevelt

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.010 align:middle line:90%
have built the Great Pyramid?

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.670 align:middle line:90%
The answer is no.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.200 align:middle line:90%
No, they couldn't have done it.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.310 align:middle line:84%
They could have done it with the
precision and the exactitude.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.640 align:middle line:84%
So I asked myself, if the
ancient Egyptians were

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.310 align:middle line:84%
more advanced than America
of the early 20th century,

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.560 align:middle line:84%
then there's something wrong
here with this picture.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.792 align:middle line:84%
So there's something in
the mix of our civilization

00:05:31.792 --> 00:05:32.750 align:middle line:90%
that we're not getting.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.320 align:middle line:84%
There is a hole in our ancient
history, and some of that

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.810 align:middle line:84%
includes very
advanced knowledge.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.340 align:middle line:10%
>> Based on my research, I
believe that the beings are

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.222 align:middle line:10%
advanced approximately
close to a million years.

00:05:47.222 --> 00:05:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why I say
that is because if you study

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.770 align:middle line:84%
the ancient tablets,
the Bhagavad-Gita the

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.700 align:middle line:84%
Mahabharata, the Ancient Vedas,
and also the Sumerian Tablets,

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.540 align:middle line:84%
you find that the technology
that they used was so far

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.520 align:middle line:84%
advanced they had
technology that

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.710 align:middle line:90%
can destroy an entire planet.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.550 align:middle line:84%
They had vehicles that can
travel intergalactically.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.705 align:middle line:84%
And you can even see some of
the evolution of in the Sumerian

00:06:10.705 --> 00:06:12.830 align:middle line:84%
Text, you can tell that
they were a little bit less

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.000 align:middle line:84%
advanced some of
the older texts,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.310 align:middle line:84%
because you can see the
evolution of their technology

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.740 align:middle line:84%
where when they first splashed
down 450,000 years ago

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.490 align:middle line:84%
they had a lot of rumblings,
and sounds, and noises,

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.140 align:middle line:84%
when they would
take off and land.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.990 align:middle line:84%
Then, closer to
around 2000 BC, you

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.030 align:middle line:84%
find that they're
hovering silently,

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.140 align:middle line:84%
almost like anti-gravity,
whisper quiet.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.390 align:middle line:84%
So you can even see the
advances in their technology

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:36.800 align:middle line:90%
as the millennia went on.

Armstrong, the question

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.500 align:middle line:84%

suddenly jumps to life

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:19.920 align:middle line:10%
and makes
non-Newtonian movement,

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.500 align:middle line:10%

makes that movement,

some kind of particle
beam shoots up

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:29.610 align:middle line:10%
from the Earth's surface

out there and being

I think they've always
operated by stealth.

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:40.340 align:middle line:84%

likelihood that they themselves

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:52.640 align:middle line:84%

play in the secrecy.

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:18.200 align:middle line:84%
He was extremely,
extremely proficient.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.990 align:middle line:84%
On one occasion he did--
on his own-- he said,

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:23.780 align:middle line:84%
some remote viewing work on
where alien bases were here

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:24.980 align:middle line:90%

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:27.650 align:middle line:10%

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:31.125 align:middle line:10%
was running the program and
said, oh, yes, by the way,

00:13:31.125 --> 00:13:32.750 align:middle line:10%

just on my spare time

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:35.060 align:middle line:10%
look to see where
the alien bases were.

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:38.630 align:middle line:84%
This is true, he said this,
and he identified several.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:40.420 align:middle line:84%
They were all basically
in mountain areas.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.020 align:middle line:90%
One was in the Pyrenees.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:45.310 align:middle line:90%
One was in Mount Hayes Alaska.

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And he said regarding that base,
the Mount Hayes Alaska base,

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:51.790 align:middle line:84%
he said that has political
protection in the United States

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.000 align:middle line:90%
government.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.550 align:middle line:84%
He said, they have their
people in the US government

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:02.050 align:middle line:84%
who are making sure that no
one pries in on that base.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:05.740 align:middle line:10%
That particular base, the
way Pat Price described it,

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.290 align:middle line:10%
was somewhat similar
to how you might

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:11.410 align:middle line:10%
look at the base in the
Hollywood movie "Men in Black",

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:14.740 align:middle line:10%
the huge alien depot where
all the different races go,

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:16.482 align:middle line:10%
and humans as well.

00:14:16.482 --> 00:14:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Not quite-- I don't
think he described it

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:21.130 align:middle line:84%
with quite the humor that
you get in the movie.

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:23.890 align:middle line:84%
But in other words,
a big transit point.

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, what
Pat Price said

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:29.350 align:middle line:84%
to put off about that base is
when he was remote viewing it,

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:34.000 align:middle line:84%
they began remote viewing him
and he pulled away out of fear.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.100 align:middle line:84%
So if that's true,
that would seem

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.800 align:middle line:84%
to indicate to me that there
is some level of collaboration

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.040 align:middle line:84%
and/or control that
is being exercised

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.140 align:middle line:90%
by them within our society.

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:48.180 align:middle line:84%
Pat Price, I think was certainly
murdered in the mid-1970s.

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.942 align:middle line:84%
I think there's no
question about this.

00:14:49.942 --> 00:14:52.150 align:middle line:84%
When people look into the
circumstances of his death,

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:54.850 align:middle line:84%

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.550 align:middle line:10%
the Strategic Defense
Initiative, also known

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:12.930 align:middle line:10%
as Star Wars.

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:15.450 align:middle line:10%
In this letter, Teller
warns that a menace

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:18.750 align:middle line:10%
greater than the nuclear
arms race exists.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:21.840 align:middle line:84%
It does not originate here on
Earth, but comes from space

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:23.250 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:27.060 align:middle line:84%
Was the Star Wars program,
later begun by President Reagan,

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:31.510 align:middle line:90%
created to stop hostile aliens?

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:35.470 align:middle line:10%
>> But what must be recognized
is that our security is based

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:38.950 align:middle line:10%
on being prepared
to meet all threats.

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:41.620 align:middle line:10%
There was a time when we
depended on coastal forts

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:44.680 align:middle line:10%
and artillery batteries because
with the weaponry of that day

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:47.270 align:middle line:10%
any attack would have
had to come by sea.

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:49.720 align:middle line:10%
Well, this is a different
world, and our defenses

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.790 align:middle line:10%
must be based on
recognition and awareness

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:54.670 align:middle line:10%
of the weaponry possessed by
other nations in the Nuclear

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:56.020 align:middle line:10%
Age.

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:59.110 align:middle line:10%
We can't afford to believe that
we will never be threatened.

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:01.900 align:middle line:10%
There have been two world
wars in my lifetime.

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.850 align:middle line:10%
We didn't start
them, and indeed did

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:06.580 align:middle line:10%
everything we could to
avoid being drawn into them,

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:09.280 align:middle line:10%
but we were ill
prepared for both.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.290 align:middle line:10%
Had we been better
prepared, peace

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:12.790 align:middle line:10%
might have been preserved.

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:16.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Teller wrote a letter to
President Reagan warning him

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:19.750 align:middle line:10%
about dangerous aliens, and he
did it because he was probably

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:23.080 align:middle line:10%
blocked from having any
direct communication with

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.760 align:middle line:10%
the president on the issue.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, we know, according
to the Serpo documents,

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:31.660 align:middle line:84%
that Reagan was probably
briefed in 1981 on the aliens.

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:34.122 align:middle line:10%
But what they told him
was kind of a nice story.

00:16:34.122 --> 00:16:36.580 align:middle line:10%
I mean, he was told that four
out of the five alien species

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:38.560 align:middle line:10%
we know about are
friendly, and some of them

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.230 align:middle line:10%
might even help us if the
bad ones went after us,

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:44.500 align:middle line:10%
and it may be that Teller
knew more about how

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.653 align:middle line:10%
many hostile races were
really out there, what

00:16:46.653 --> 00:16:48.070 align:middle line:10%
their real objectives
were, and he

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:51.220 align:middle line:10%
was trying to warn Reagan
not to believe the guys that

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:54.460 align:middle line:10%
were telling him these airy
fairy happy-go-lucky stories

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.720 align:middle line:10%
about the good aliens,
because I don't think anybody

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.250 align:middle line:10%
is going to help us if things
get bad with the aliens,

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:00.050 align:middle line:10%
at all.

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:00.890 align:middle line:90%
We're on our own.

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:03.500 align:middle line:84%
So we got to keep developing
our own technology.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.880 align:middle line:84%
These are stories that
have come to us again

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:07.810 align:middle line:90%
and again and again.

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:10.960 align:middle line:10%
They've come to me
relating about individuals

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.930 align:middle line:10%
who looked just like
you and me, but are not

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.310 align:middle line:10%
just like you and me.

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:18.910 align:middle line:84%
Individuals who are intensely
telepathic, who are associated

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:22.210 align:middle line:90%
with often the UFO phenomenon.

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:24.579 align:middle line:84%
There are certainly stories,
legitimate ones I think,

00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:26.740 align:middle line:84%

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:28.704 align:middle line:84%

saw non-humans, and saw
very human looking people

Even going back to the

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:08.670 align:middle line:84%
of humankind, there seems
to be ET involvement,

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:11.170 align:middle line:84%
because when we look at the
work from the example of Michael

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:14.320 align:middle line:84%
Cremo of "Forbidden Archeology",
we're seeing records

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:18.400 align:middle line:84%
and actual physical artifacts
being dug up all over the Earth

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.770 align:middle line:84%
suggesting intelligent
beings have been visiting us

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:23.890 align:middle line:90%
for millions of years.

alien group and we were here

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.160 align:middle line:84%

in their civilization.

00:18:31.323 --> 00:18:32.740 align:middle line:84%
We have an interest
in monitoring.

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:35.410 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we even have an
interest in managing them,

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:38.518 align:middle line:84%
because we realize that they're
shooting like this in terms

00:18:38.518 --> 00:18:41.060 align:middle line:84%
of their technology and they're
about to leap into our world,

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:42.760 align:middle line:84%
whether we like it
or not, so we might

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:46.420 align:middle line:84%
want to establish a presence
and influence among them.

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:49.150 align:middle line:84%
We might want to have a base
on their world for some reason.

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:51.170 align:middle line:90%
If we did, how would we do that?

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:53.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, we would have to have our
own people look just like them,

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.170 align:middle line:90%
our own fifth column.

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:56.170 align:middle line:90%
Is this really the case?

I don't know that is the case.

00:18:57.490 --> 00:18:59.590 align:middle line:84%

not to consider it

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:01.270 align:middle line:90%
as a reasonable thing.

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:04.180 align:middle line:10%
It actually works very
well with the evidence

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:06.670 align:middle line:10%
that has come to me from a
number of individuals who've

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:10.630 align:middle line:10%
had encounters with very
highly strange individuals who

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:14.850 align:middle line:10%
just don't seem human

for its own benefit.

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:44.090 align:middle line:84%
The negative side appears to
be using Earth as a fear farm.

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:46.520 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they
are siphoning energy

from our fear, depression,
as an energetic substance.

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:52.820 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the positive ETs
seem to be in alignment

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:55.190 align:middle line:84%
with the mystery
schools to be more open,

President Truman in the 1950s
was so worried about the alien

and he was involved in a lot

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:45.260 align:middle line:10%
of different kind of
investigative activities.

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.200 align:middle line:10%
One of the things
that he did was he

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:51.310 align:middle line:10%
had a telephone conversation
with former NSA director Bobby

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:53.860 align:middle line:10%
Rae Inmann, who within
the intelligence community

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:55.270 align:middle line:10%
is something of a legend.

After Inmann left the NSA
and left us formal government

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.850 align:middle line:10%
service, he became
the leading executive

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:19.620 align:middle line:90%
including the UFO reality.

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.750 align:middle line:84%
Oechsler had a conversation
with them on the phone

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:25.990 align:middle line:84%
and would not use the
word extraterrestrial.

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:30.610 align:middle line:84%
Would not use the word
UFO / but in the context

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:32.170 align:middle line:84%
of his conversation
with Inmann made

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:35.900 align:middle line:84%
it very clear that this is
what he was talking about

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:38.890 align:middle line:84%
and asked Inmann about
the reality of this.

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:42.490 align:middle line:10%
This is shortly after
the Majestic 12 documents

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:46.540 align:middle line:10%
became known in the late 1980s.

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:49.000 align:middle line:10%
And it's very evident
from the conversation,

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.870 align:middle line:10%
as reported by Oechsler,
that Inmann acknowledged

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:57.340 align:middle line:10%
the reality of a group like
MJ-12, that is an oversight

00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:00.230 align:middle line:10%
group managing the UFO reality.

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:02.200 align:middle line:10%
So I think that this
actually happened.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.965 align:middle line:10%
I would add that Oechsler's
conversation with Inmann

00:22:04.965 --> 00:22:07.030 align:middle line:10%
is not the only type
of conversation that

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:10.030 align:middle line:10%
confirmed the reality of MJ-12.

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:12.670 align:middle line:10%
I think equally important
was a series of conversations

00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:15.110 align:middle line:10%
held with a scientist
named Eric Walker.

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:17.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, Eric Walker was a
friend of Dwight Eisenhower,

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:20.320 align:middle line:84%
he was former president
of Penn State University,

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.720 align:middle line:84%
and most significantly
was a head

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:26.060 align:middle line:84%
of an organization known as The
Institute For Defense Studies.

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:28.390 align:middle line:84%
This is a powerful
defense think tank.

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:32.680 align:middle line:84%
Researcher Grant Cameron, Scott
Crane, and a few other people

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:35.980 align:middle line:84%
encountered Walker
in the late 80s

few conversations with him

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:47.860 align:middle line:84%
absolutely admitted and
acknowledged the reality

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:49.480 align:middle line:90%
of a group like MJ-12.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.302 align:middle line:10%

the same type of things

even more explicit.

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:05.620 align:middle line:10%
it will give you a paradigm
shift in consciousness.

You won't see the world
the same way anymore.

00:23:07.547 --> 00:23:09.880 align:middle line:84%
You begin to realize that the
controllers of this planet

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.970 align:middle line:84%
have been put in a
position of power by us.

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:16.230 align:middle line:84%
We have kind of really allowed
them to take control of us.

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:17.890 align:middle line:84%
There is a true
reality here where

00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:21.940 align:middle line:84%
we, being the population of the
world, 7.5 billion of us now,

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.490 align:middle line:84%
truly do have the power
to overthrow them.

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:27.160 align:middle line:84%
The reason why they keep
us suppressed and oppressed

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.740 align:middle line:84%
is because the technology
and information

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:33.520 align:middle line:84%
about ancient civilizations
and ETs keeps them in power.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.520 align:middle line:84%
The less we know, the more
power they can hold over us.

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:39.430 align:middle line:84%
This is why they spray
poisons on our food,

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:41.650 align:middle line:84%

depopulation agenda.

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:44.950 align:middle line:84%

dumbed down, and also sick,
and maybe even dying early.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:52.330 align:middle line:84%
The elites that control this
planet have a discrete agenda,

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:54.520 align:middle line:84%
and that agenda is
to maintain control

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.140 align:middle line:90%
of the population of Earth.

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:58.800 align:middle line:10%
This is how come you see us
using century old technology.

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.300 align:middle line:84%
They won't let us advance into
things like zero point energy

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:02.230 align:middle line:90%
devices.

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:04.813 align:middle line:84%
They won't let us use different
types of technologies that can

00:24:04.813 --> 00:24:06.318 align:middle line:90%
make our lives a lot easier.

00:24:06.318 --> 00:24:08.110 align:middle line:84%
They suppress and
oppress that information,

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:10.270 align:middle line:84%
and then create their own
breakaway civilizations

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:12.295 align:middle line:84%
on other planets,
negotiate possibly

00:24:12.295 --> 00:24:15.250 align:middle line:84%
with other civilizations,
keeping everything

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:17.350 align:middle line:90%
totally secret from us.

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:20.710 align:middle line:84%
In this way, they have
maintained a control over us.

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:23.590 align:middle line:84%
But there will come a day
when all 7.5 billion of us

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:26.480 align:middle line:84%
will wake up consciously
to the next level,

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:29.125 align:middle line:84%
and we will find a way to join
together and unite, and take

00:24:29.125 --> 00:24:30.250 align:middle line:90%
back control of our planet.

people who claimed to have had

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:39.460 align:middle line:10%
this abduction experience
or being taken by aliens,

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:42.100 align:middle line:10%
for everyone I talked to
who seemed to think it was

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:43.730 align:middle line:10%
a traumatic event.

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:47.050 align:middle line:10%
In fact, the very term
abduction is negative.

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:49.570 align:middle line:84%
Makes it sound like ads are
a really terrible thing,

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:52.480 align:middle line:84%
and I can understand where
people feel like they've

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:57.430 align:middle line:84%
been taken against her
will, and I can understand

00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:58.900 align:middle line:90%
the negative of that.

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:01.090 align:middle line:84%
But I talked to an equal
number of people who said,

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:03.272 align:middle line:84%
well, i had the same
experience and I thought

00:25:03.272 --> 00:25:04.480 align:middle line:90%
it was a pleasant experience.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.060 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I had
one woman tell me,

00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:09.370 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I was
an honored guest.

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:11.980 align:middle line:84%
So I think the phenomena
is probably not

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:14.600 align:middle line:90%
been presented in its entirety.

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.570 align:middle line:84%
I think that the people
who feel like they've

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:20.740 align:middle line:84%
had a scary or
traumatic event, they

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:23.470 align:middle line:84%
tend to go seek help,
professional help,

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:25.540 align:middle line:84%
or they join these
support groups,

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:27.910 align:middle line:90%
and their story becomes public.

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, we have
this whole popular negative

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.490 align:middle line:90%
connotation of abduction.

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:36.130 align:middle line:84%
But to the best of
my ability, everyone

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:38.560 align:middle line:84%
who says I've been abducted,
at some point they get

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:41.000 align:middle line:90%
brought back, OK?

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And then, like I said,
there's an equal number

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:46.150 align:middle line:84%
of people who say, well,
that was kind of cool.

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:47.340 align:middle line:90%
They gave me a little tour.

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:48.430 align:middle line:90%
Took me to another planet.

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:49.920 align:middle line:90%
Showed me all this stuff.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:53.560 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think that
we yet have actually

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.070 align:middle line:84%
engaged the true extent
of the phenomenon.
