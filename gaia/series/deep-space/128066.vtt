SpaceX and NASA
work side by side

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.250 align:middle line:84%
to successfully launch and
land the first ever privatized

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.050 align:middle line:90%

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.920 align:middle line:90%


00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.450 align:middle line:84%
>> SpaceX is a private rocketry
company based in El Segundo,

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.250 align:middle line:90%
California.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.200 align:middle line:84%
It's owned by Elon Musk,
a billionaire who's

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.880 align:middle line:90%
interested in space exploration.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.580 align:middle line:10%
And they recently had some
great success with a rocket

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.580 align:middle line:10%
that they launched and then
actually guided it back

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.483 align:middle line:10%
and landed it on
a platform at sea,

00:01:37.483 --> 00:01:39.900 align:middle line:10%
which is really an amazing
accomplishment because nobody's

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.060 align:middle line:10%
really ever been able
to do that before.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's really cool
because it allows

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.250 align:middle line:84%
them to reuse the rockets,
which makes the actual launching

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.090 align:middle line:90%
process a lot less expensive.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.335 align:middle line:84%
>> And a successful landing
of the first stage offshore.

00:01:57.335 --> 00:01:59.960 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm convinced that the way to
go for the future of the space

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.170 align:middle line:10%
program is to privatize it.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.640 align:middle line:84%
I worked on the space
program, and everybody

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.140 align:middle line:84%
else who worked
on it in the '60s

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.229 align:middle line:84%
thought we'd have a
base on the moon by now.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.410 align:middle line:90%
Thought we'd have gone to Mars.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.240 align:middle line:90%
And where are we?

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.690 align:middle line:84%
We're still hanging
around Earth.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.030 align:middle line:84%
I saw what the problem was
at the NASA Space Nuclear

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.085 align:middle line:90%
Propulsion Office.

00:02:18.085 --> 00:02:19.460 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know
what they wanted

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.650 align:middle line:84%
to do with the space program,
with the nuclear rocket engine.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Experts suggest that the NASA
we see today might be a front.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.050 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems kind of bizarre
to me that after we put men

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.460 align:middle line:84%
on the moon in 1969 and to 1972
that this is such big news that

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.980 align:middle line:84%
we've got a private
company launching rockets.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.778 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everybody
thought back in that era

00:02:41.778 --> 00:02:43.820 align:middle line:84%
that we were going to be
doing this kind of thing

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.390 align:middle line:84%
all the way through
the '70s and '80s

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.010 align:middle line:84%
and probably figured we'd be on
the moon and be on Mars by now.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.040 align:middle line:84%
But it's just-- it seems as if
there's been something holding

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.790 align:middle line:90%
us back for years and years.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.660 align:middle line:10%
And it's really hard to put your
finger on exactly what that is.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Could it be that
NASA has another agenda?

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.050 align:middle line:10%
>> I feel that NASA is using
private space and private

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.843 align:middle line:10%
industry as a cover-up.

00:03:04.843 --> 00:03:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
is because when

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.350 align:middle line:84%
you take everything out of
governmental into private,

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.380 align:middle line:84%
you can do a lot more
things behind the scenes.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have
to answer to anybody.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel like anytime NASA's
involved, I'm very suspicious.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.920 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't
trust them, based

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.630 align:middle line:84%
on my research and
years of experience

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.100 align:middle line:90%
in dealing with them.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't trust them
on political issues.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And I worry that they're
going to somehow undermine

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.240 align:middle line:84%
the private company
and undermine SpaceX.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:38.873 align:middle line:84%
>> Landing operators moving
to procedure 11.1 [INAUDIBLE]..

00:03:38.873 --> 00:03:40.040 align:middle line:90%
>> You think of it this way.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.070 align:middle line:10%
The United States
a couple of years

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.910 align:middle line:10%
ago made some public
statement that, well, we're

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.780 align:middle line:10%
eliminating the manned
component of our space program.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.640 align:middle line:10%
Not only is it untrue, but
it makes absolutely no sense.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.220 align:middle line:10%
The United States for it to be
the dominant global hegemonic

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.030 align:middle line:10%
power, which it will never
voluntarily cease to be,

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.630 align:middle line:10%
must control space as a
platform of operations.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.540 align:middle line:84%
This means having
classified space programs

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.150 align:middle line:84%
and military base is
an absolute priority.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Experts suggest that not only
might NASA and the government

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.260 align:middle line:84%
have a secret space program,
but they might be investigating

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.490 align:middle line:84%
Earth for ancient connections
to otherworldly beings.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:25.180 align:middle line:84%
>> There are a number of very
compelling stories that I

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.590 align:middle line:84%
believe that have to do
with NASA encounters with

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.157 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrials.

00:04:31.157 --> 00:04:32.740 align:middle line:84%
One of the more
interesting ones to me

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.150 align:middle line:84%
is NASA's look at ancient
advanced technology.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.110 align:middle line:84%
There are massive
rock paintings here

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.200 align:middle line:84%
in the United States at
Sego Canyon and other places

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.510 align:middle line:84%
out in the Midwest
of beings that look--

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.310 align:middle line:90%
what are these?

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.910 align:middle line:84%
Some of them do look very,
very suggestive of non-humans.

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Recent evidence suggests
that NASA has been investigating

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.500 align:middle line:84%
ancient ruins in Chaco
Canyon, New Mexico.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>> It does not make any sense
that NASA would go to a place

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.120 align:middle line:84%
like Chaco Canyon and be doing
research for astronomical

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.920 align:middle line:90%
reasons.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.340 align:middle line:90%
I mean, NASA is all about space.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.140 align:middle line:90%
That's their job.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a space exploration
agency of the US government.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.030 align:middle line:84%
>> But some researchers point
out that something mysterious

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.030 align:middle line:90%
is going on at Chaco Canyon.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Chaco Canyon is one of
the most important sites--

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.430 align:middle line:10%
archaeological sites
in the Southwest.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.470 align:middle line:10%
And it is a mysterious one.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:34.520 align:middle line:10%
It's well built. But it's
not a megalithic site.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.640 align:middle line:10%
There are roads that
radiate from Chaco Canyon

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.330 align:middle line:10%
and go in many
different directions.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.070 align:middle line:10%
And it would seem
that Chaco Canyon

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:49.490 align:middle line:10%
was the central part of some
kind of extensive system,

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.860 align:middle line:10%
trading system.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.720 align:middle line:10%
One of the mysteries
of Chaco Canyon

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:01.600 align:middle line:10%
is that the people just
vanished and left that area

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.430 align:middle line:10%
and abandoned the ruins.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:09.490 align:middle line:84%
But archaeologists were unable
to find any kind of burials

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.640 align:middle line:90%
or any kind of graveyards.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And this was a mystery
to archaeologists.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And then they couldn't
really understand

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.230 align:middle line:84%
how there could be this
important center that

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.270 align:middle line:90%
was Chaco Canyon.

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And it must have had
many people living there.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:33.250 align:middle line:84%
Yet there's no sign of any kind
of funeral kind of arrangements

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.380 align:middle line:90%
or that people died there.

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.200 align:middle line:84%
>> If Chaco Canyon isn't
just a religious site,

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.720 align:middle line:84%
what could it have
been used for?

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.060 align:middle line:84%
Some suggest that
Chaco Canyon has

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.870 align:middle line:84%
an unusual energy that
could be harnessed

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:48.870 align:middle line:90%
if in the right hands.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.490 align:middle line:90%


00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.330 align:middle line:10%
>> And if I remember correctly,
it's that if you use dowsing

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.080 align:middle line:10%
rods, literally the dowsing rods
go in all directions at once,

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.680 align:middle line:10%
showing you that you're in a
center of a lay lined vortex

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.640 align:middle line:10%
or a sacred site that you
have the intersection of many

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.500 align:middle line:10%
magnetic energy fields.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And those make the energy
fields are the things

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.380 align:middle line:84%
that extraterrestrials have
been harnessing for a long time.

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.460 align:middle line:84%
Because instead of using
the kind of fossil fuel,

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.010 align:middle line:84%
they actually were harnessing
the electromagnetic energy

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.720 align:middle line:90%
field of the planet Earth.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.450 align:middle line:84%
When you really start
looking at that whole area,

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:33.080 align:middle line:84%
it appears that they were a vast
civilization at one point that

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.510 align:middle line:90%
was pretty sophisticated.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.540 align:middle line:84%
It's literally like
the Beam Me Up,

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Scotty situation, where
they were there one day

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:42.020 align:middle line:84%
as an entire tribe of
people, and the next day,

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:43.160 align:middle line:90%
they were gone.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Could it be true that NASA
was trying to figure out how

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.810 align:middle line:90%
to harness this energy?

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And if they have, would
this ancient knowledge

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.810 align:middle line:84%
help them get
further into space?

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:56.480 align:middle line:10%
>> To me, if they're
investigating ancient ruins,

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.300 align:middle line:10%
they're doing so because they
think there's some connection

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.090 align:middle line:10%
between those ancient
ruins and space.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:04.072 align:middle line:84%
And that's, to me, the
key thing as to why

00:08:04.072 --> 00:08:05.030 align:middle line:90%
they would be involved.

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:07.400 align:middle line:84%
Their other reasons just
don't make any sense.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that certain
areas are cordoned off now

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:12.920 align:middle line:84%
in the Chaco Canyon ruins is,
to me, a little bit suspicious.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.860 align:middle line:84%
I think that they
found some connection

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.080 align:middle line:90%
that they want to exploit.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's the only
reason government agencies

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:22.910 align:middle line:84%
or the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:23.630 align:middle line:90%
would be interested.

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:25.130 align:middle line:84%
That's the only reason
they'd be interested in doing

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.047 align:middle line:90%
that kind of research.

00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:29.180 align:middle line:90%


00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Research suggests that
ancient sites around the world

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:36.990 align:middle line:84%
have been the key to
secret government programs.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:40.500 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the things that I've
investigated over the years is

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.530 align:middle line:10%
government interest in
ancient mysteries and ancient

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:44.840 align:middle line:10%
artifacts.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And this could actually
explain NASA's interest

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:51.210 align:middle line:84%
in ancient sites and
things like that.

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:53.550 align:middle line:10%
For example, through the
Freedom Information Act,

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:57.810 align:middle line:10%
the CIA has declassified
roughly around 70 pages

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:01.590 align:middle line:10%
of a far longer file,
titled "The Ararat Anomaly."

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:05.130 align:middle line:10%
And as the title suggests, it's
actually a file on Noah's Ark.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:08.610 align:middle line:10%
So you might wonder why on
Earth is the CIA interested

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:09.510 align:middle line:10%
in Noah's Ark.

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:12.360 align:middle line:84%
You'd imagine historians,
archaeologists,

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.660 align:middle line:84%
people in the church would be
interested, but not the CIA.

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.790 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that
they are interested

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:21.030 align:middle line:84%
suggests that somebody
deep within the agency

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:25.200 align:middle line:84%
is taking notes of the
ancient astronaut scenario

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.950 align:middle line:84%
and possibly even interpreting
like it's some space ark.

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:32.730 align:middle line:84%
People in governments or
the intelligence community

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.820 align:middle line:84%
either know or deeply
suspect that there

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:39.360 align:middle line:90%
were ancient alien visitations.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And they're trying to figure
out what the truth is.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think that explains
things that NASA is up to today,

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:52.120 align:middle line:84%
looking at and marking and
targeting ancient sites.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.140 align:middle line:84%
There's a unique
and very alternative

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:57.400 align:middle line:90%
aspect to that scenario.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.450 align:middle line:84%
What if they actually weren't
ancient extraterrestrials,

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:05.070 align:middle line:84%
but ancient humans who developed
highly advanced technology

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:07.350 align:middle line:90%
and may have left the planet?

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:08.820 align:middle line:90%
>> You cannot exclude that.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.450 align:middle line:90%
This is all possible.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:13.860 align:middle line:10%
But if you accept the
higher society in the past,

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.600 align:middle line:10%
you do not exclude
extraterrestrials.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.230 align:middle line:84%
This higher society
can, at the same time,

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:22.350 align:middle line:84%
have had contact with
extraterrestrials.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible that NASA and
other government organizations

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.430 align:middle line:84%
are looking for ancient
evidence of space travel and ET

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:31.120 align:middle line:90%
intervention?

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.353 align:middle line:90%
And if so, why?

00:10:33.353 --> 00:10:34.770 align:middle line:10%
>> If you look at
NASA, basically,

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:38.160 align:middle line:10%
it's infiltrated by three
powerful secret societies--

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.930 align:middle line:10%
the Freemasons,
the Nazis, and what

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:42.840 align:middle line:10%
I call the magicians, who are
basically followers of Aleister

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.160 align:middle line:10%
Crowley out at JPL.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And there is this
real pattern of them

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.590 align:middle line:84%
being interested in stuff
and naming spacecraft, even,

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:51.450 align:middle line:90%
after ancient Egyptian gods.

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:54.750 align:middle line:10%
Like, the Apollo 16 lunar
module was named Orion.

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:57.060 align:middle line:10%
That is actually the
Egyptian god Osiris.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:01.770 align:middle line:10%
And they landed on the moon
on Adolf Hitler's birthday

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:05.100 align:middle line:10%
at the exact time that
Orion's belt was 33 degrees

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.810 align:middle line:10%
above the landing site.

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And all that stuff
is not a coincidence.

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:11.100 align:middle line:84%
NASA definitely plans
this, and it's all

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.470 align:middle line:84%
got to do with some sort
of magical alignments

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:16.916 align:middle line:84%
that they think will make
their missions be successful.

00:11:16.916 --> 00:11:25.490 align:middle line:90%


00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:27.860 align:middle line:84%
NASA could very well be
looking for the predecessors

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:28.810 align:middle line:90%
of the human race.

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:32.593 align:middle line:84%
You know, I mean, I still think
that when Neil Armstrong said,

00:11:32.593 --> 00:11:34.010 align:middle line:84%
when he first
stepped on the moon,

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:37.310 align:middle line:84%
it's one small step for man,
one giant leap for mankind,

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:39.120 align:middle line:90%
that he did not make a mistake.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the conventional
wisdom is he made a mistake,

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.975 align:middle line:84%
and instead, he
should have said,

00:11:42.975 --> 00:11:44.540 align:middle line:90%
it's one small step for a man.

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.120 align:middle line:90%
But he didn't say that.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And what he meant was, that's
one small step for us, for man,

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.140 align:middle line:84%
for this current
version of mankind.

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.580 align:middle line:84%
But it's a giant leap for the
greater, broader human race,

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:57.440 align:middle line:90%
mankind from whence we came.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.380 align:middle line:84%
In other words, our ancestors
that came to Earth before.

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:03.620 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is true, where else
in the world have researchers

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.980 align:middle line:84%
been able to dig up evidence
of ancient space travel from

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:10.040 align:middle line:90%
a possible progenitor race?

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.835 align:middle line:84%
>> There is in Central
America, in Mexico,

00:12:12.835 --> 00:12:15.460 align:middle line:84%
the Maya city with
the name of Palenque.

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And in Palenque is
one pyramid which has

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:21.560 align:middle line:90%
the name Temple of Inscription.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.870 align:middle line:10%
In 1952, Professor Dr. Ruz
was the leading archaeologist

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:26.960 align:middle line:10%
at that time.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:32.000 align:middle line:84%
He found inside the pyramid
a secret stairway going down.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.170 align:middle line:90%
They went down.

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:35.000 align:middle line:90%
The digging took three years.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And they landed
under the pyramid.

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And there they
stand before a stone

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:41.870 align:middle line:90%
in the form of a triangle.

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:47.760 align:middle line:10%
They open the door, and
they were standing on a lid,

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:53.300 align:middle line:10%
on a stone plate, a long, big
stone plate 3.8 meters long,

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:57.380 align:middle line:10%
2.2 meters lateral, a
big block, one monolith.

00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
fantastic engraving.

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:02.140 align:middle line:90%
You see something like a frame.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And inside of the
frame, a man is

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:09.950 align:middle line:84%
sitting, bending forward almost
like a racing motorcyclist.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:13.210 align:middle line:10%
He obviously has some
oxygen mask on his nose.

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:15.140 align:middle line:10%
And you clearly
see his two hands.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.510 align:middle line:90%
He's manipulating some controls.

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:20.060 align:middle line:84%
The heel of his left foot
is on a kind of pedal.

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:21.590 align:middle line:90%
He's sitting on a chair.

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:24.620 align:middle line:10%
And behind him,
outside the frame,

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:27.980 align:middle line:10%
you see something like a
[INAUDIBLE] flame, a fire.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:30.920 align:middle line:10%
So that was absolutely
fascinating.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:34.825 align:middle line:10%
There is a human man
in a technical machine.

00:13:34.825 --> 00:13:38.890 align:middle line:10%
Now of course, I know all the
archaeological interpretations.

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:41.620 align:middle line:10%
Archaeologists say that
this man represents

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:44.140 align:middle line:10%
Pakal, which is correct.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Pakal was the second last ruler
of the Maya city of Palenque.

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And in archaeology,
they suggested

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.800 align:middle line:84%
it has nothing to do with
space travel or with machinery.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.260 align:middle line:84%
Pakal is simply sitting
in the open mouth

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.300 align:middle line:90%
of a mythological monster.

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.720 align:middle line:90%
And he's falling into the Earth.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And out of his chest, you see
the tree of life or something

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.050 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:08.330 align:middle line:84%
That was the archaeological
interpretation

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:09.920 align:middle line:90%
some 40 years ago.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.790 align:middle line:90%


00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:15.540 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, the two
leading archaeologists

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:19.020 align:middle line:84%
Stuart and Stuart, because
he's the father and the son,

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:20.560 align:middle line:84%
in their newest
book about Palenque,

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:24.980 align:middle line:84%
they say, yes, it is Pakal the
second last ruler of Palenque.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.130 align:middle line:84%
But he's not falling
into the mouth

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:28.620 align:middle line:90%
of a mythological monster.

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:32.140 align:middle line:84%
He's leaving the Earth
in a fiery chariot.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.290 align:middle line:84%
Everything which is
on the stone plate

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.830 align:middle line:84%
has something to do with the
universe and with the stars.

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:43.080 align:middle line:84%
>> These are the working sheets
for the dynasty that were done

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:47.070 align:middle line:84%
by Linda and Peter Mathews
and Floyd Lounsbury during

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:48.720 align:middle line:90%
the first [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.360 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is evidence
of ancient space travel,

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:54.240 align:middle line:84%
what other kind of earthly
objects connect our human

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.820 align:middle line:90%
origins to the stars?

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:59.370 align:middle line:84%
>> There are these obelisks,
these Egyptian style obelisks

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:00.537 align:middle line:90%
that are all over the world.

00:15:00.537 --> 00:15:02.310 align:middle line:84%
They seem to be of
great value to people

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:04.820 align:middle line:84%
that have a lot of esoteric
power and knowledge.

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And you see them
all over the world.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:07.950 align:middle line:84%
You can even argue
that Stonehenge

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:11.270 align:middle line:84%
is, in a sense, an
obelisk or a monolith

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:12.960 align:middle line:84%
that's very similar
to the monolith

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.050 align:middle line:84%
that we saw in the film
"2001: A Space Odyssey."

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:18.630 align:middle line:84%
But to me, the most
fascinating connection on that

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:23.340 align:middle line:84%
is there is an object on
Phobos that was made famous.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.280 align:middle line:84%
Because Buzz Aldrin came out in
an interview on C-SPAN in 2009

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.500 align:middle line:84%
and said there is a
monolith on Phobos.

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And the shape and
the design seems

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:33.720 align:middle line:84%
to be to attract energy
from above-- in other words,

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:38.220 align:middle line:84%
to attract all the powers
out there in the stars.

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.980 align:middle line:10%
>> The ancient obelisk in
the city of Heliopolis was

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:44.770 align:middle line:10%
the major spiritual center
in all of ancient Egypt.

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:47.470 align:middle line:10%
Heliopolis, the city of the
sun, and it was actually

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:52.540 align:middle line:10%
called the city Annu, named for
the head of the Annunaki gods.

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:54.310 align:middle line:90%
But Annu meant pillar to heaven.

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And we know that there were 48
huge obelisks at that point.

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:02.170 align:middle line:84%
Because these obelisks had
been moved to major cities

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:05.210 align:middle line:84%
all over the world to
harness that same energy.

00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:07.510 align:middle line:10%
One of those obelisks
is in the center

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:10.300 align:middle line:10%
of St. Peter's Square, which, of
course, is not a square at all.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.480 align:middle line:10%
It's a circle with the
symbol of the Annunaki--

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.800 align:middle line:10%
the cross with the X.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:21.210 align:middle line:84%
The more we go through our
discoveries of modern day

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:24.810 align:middle line:84%
archaeology, the GPS systems,
the satellite systems,

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:27.570 align:middle line:84%
we're discovering hundreds
all over the planet.

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:31.718 align:middle line:90%


00:16:31.718 --> 00:16:33.760 align:middle line:10%
>> As you travel around
the world in the same 30,

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:38.770 align:middle line:10%
30 parallel, you'll find other
monolithic type structures that

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:43.270 align:middle line:10%
appear to have been used not
just for what's there now,

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:46.210 align:middle line:10%
temples, but actually, when
you lift up the temples to look

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:49.130 align:middle line:10%
underneath them, you find
megalithic structures like

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:53.020 align:middle line:10%
Baalbek, the stones of Baalbek
that have been raised up 700

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:54.580 align:middle line:10%
feet and put into place.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.170 align:middle line:84%
According to ancient
text, it appears

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:59.113 align:middle line:84%
that those were actually
landing places for spaceships

00:16:59.113 --> 00:17:00.030 align:middle line:90%
they used to take off.

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:01.405 align:middle line:84%
And if you're in
a spaceship, you

00:17:01.405 --> 00:17:02.740 align:middle line:90%
need something to push off on.

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:04.573 align:middle line:84%
And it appears to be
that those stones could

00:17:04.573 --> 00:17:06.740 align:middle line:90%
have been something for that.

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:11.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Now this is at
least 1,200 tons.

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:16.150 align:middle line:10%
A recent excavation show
that there are possibly

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:20.430 align:middle line:10%
larger ones underneath it.

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:22.440 align:middle line:84%
>> There are monoliths
here on Earth.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.609 align:middle line:84%
There are monoliths in
film and television.

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
monoliths on Mars.

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:29.210 align:middle line:84%
So to me, that's
pretty amazing stuff.

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And there's just this
connection coming

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:35.050 align:middle line:84%
where everything's starting
to pull itself together.

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>> If these structures are
evidence of an ancient human

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:41.650 align:middle line:84%
or ET connection to the stars,
is it possible that some

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:44.650 align:middle line:84%
of the ruins are actually
remnants of an advanced space

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:46.420 align:middle line:90%
program here on Earth?

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:47.960 align:middle line:10%
>> This is a never-ending study.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:51.130 align:middle line:84%
South America, there is
one geographical base

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:53.340 align:middle line:90%
which is called Puma Punku.

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And up there in Puma Punku, you
find gigantic stone platforms,

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:03.610 align:middle line:84%
some of them weighing
800 tons on one block.

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And the locals said it
was the gods who made it.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.760 align:middle line:84%
Which gods were the gods
who descended from the sky.

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And they made it in
one single night.

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:15.070 align:middle line:84%
Later, the so-called
gods disappeared.

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:17.320 align:middle line:84%
They took their equipment
with them, of course.

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:18.720 align:middle line:90%
And now the natives come.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And the natives, they look
at this gigantic stone block.

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:23.500 align:middle line:90%
They touch it with their finger.

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And they say, it's the
gods who made this.

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:30.070 align:middle line:84%
So the place became
holy, a holy place.

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And now the natives
start to construct

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:36.130 align:middle line:84%
the temple, a temple with
possibilities with one stone

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:39.750 align:middle line:90%
next to the other.

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:43.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's good that they
left this stuff in situ.

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Because it lets us
hopefully see what

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:51.850 align:middle line:84%
it looked like at
Puma Punku when

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:56.950 align:middle line:90%
this dramatic event happened.

00:18:56.950 --> 00:19:00.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Through our research, we
found remnants of what we might

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:04.360 align:middle line:84%
assume to be previous space
stations or mission control

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.190 align:middle line:90%
centers on Earth.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:09.730 align:middle line:90%
One of them would be Puma Punku.

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:13.160 align:middle line:84%
It's very clear that that,
obviously, to me, at least,

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.790 align:middle line:84%
and some of the
researchers, appears

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:16.998 align:middle line:84%
to have been some type of
mission control center that

00:19:16.998 --> 00:19:19.640 align:middle line:84%
was built like a fort very
close to the pyramids of Chichen

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:20.440 align:middle line:90%
Itza.

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.630 align:middle line:84%
There's actual
holes in the ground.

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:26.260 align:middle line:84%
They call them wells where they
used to supposedly sacrifice

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.918 align:middle line:90%
women or girls to make it rain.

00:19:28.918 --> 00:19:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Because if the rain
didn't come, they

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:32.500 align:middle line:84%
thought that would
please the gods.

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:35.460 align:middle line:84%
Actually, when you look
at these, they're actual,

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.890 align:middle line:84%
but they appear to be holes
carved out in the ground

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:40.510 align:middle line:90%
from rocket ships.

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:42.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying
that's what they are.

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:45.880 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at the
structure of the geology

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.220 align:middle line:84%
and you look at the way
that they're formed,

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:51.190 align:middle line:84%
they actually appear to be holes
in the ground from a rocket,

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:53.357 align:middle line:90%
like missile silos.

00:19:53.357 --> 00:19:55.190 align:middle line:84%
Whether they were rockets
that went to space

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:57.700 align:middle line:84%
or whether they were missile
silos that launched rockets,

00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:59.020 align:middle line:90%
we're not exactly sure.

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:00.940 align:middle line:84%
But they really
appear to be something

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:02.710 align:middle line:90%
that used to house technology.

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:06.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Pictured here are ruins from
previous NASA space programs.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.490 align:middle line:84%
These structures are
scattered all over the US.

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:12.370 align:middle line:84%
They're almost identical to
ruins of civilization left

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:14.800 align:middle line:90%
behind thousands of years ago.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Could these ancient
ruins be left over

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:20.050 align:middle line:84%
from a space faring race
thousands of years ago?

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:23.170 align:middle line:84%
A recent discovery sheds
light on the possibility

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:27.340 align:middle line:84%
that our ancestors actually
acquired ET technology

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:30.020 align:middle line:90%
and left the planet.

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:34.640 align:middle line:10%
>> On April 27, 2015, this river
of mercury was found under one

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.320 align:middle line:10%
of the pyramids at Teotihuacan.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.450 align:middle line:10%
And the thing about
that is mercury

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:40.638 align:middle line:10%
is not something
that the ancients

00:20:40.638 --> 00:20:41.930 align:middle line:10%
would have used for any reason.

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:45.350 align:middle line:84%
It's something that you use
in electrical components.

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:47.750 align:middle line:84%
It's very important in
materials fabrication

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:50.440 align:middle line:90%
for aerospace applications.

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's not the kind of thing
that you would have used back

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:53.740 align:middle line:90%
in the day.

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:58.220 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't really seem to fit
with that ancient civilization

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:00.590 align:middle line:90%
and its purposes and its plans.

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:02.685 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
technological civilizations

00:21:02.685 --> 00:21:03.485 align:middle line:90%
used.

00:21:03.485 --> 00:21:09.800 align:middle line:90%


00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.650 align:middle line:10%
>> My opinion of Teotihuacan
is a very interesting one

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:15.210 align:middle line:10%
because the mercury that they
found is an amazing discovery,

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:16.010 align:middle line:10%
first of all.

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:17.718 align:middle line:10%
Because if you take
mercury, it has a lot

00:21:17.718 --> 00:21:19.850 align:middle line:10%
of very amazing properties.

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:22.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a ferrofluid, which means
it's like a liquid metal.

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:24.710 align:middle line:84%
If you put it into a
vortex and electrolyze it,

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:26.627 align:middle line:84%
you actually get
anti-gravitational properties

00:21:26.627 --> 00:21:29.000 align:middle line:90%
out of it.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.870 align:middle line:10%
>> And Teotihuacan is really
a mystery to archaeologists.

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:37.870 align:middle line:10%
They don't know who built
Teotihuacan or for what reason.

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:44.360 align:middle line:84%
They date it at around
200 BC or so as beginning.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:49.790 align:middle line:84%
In my mind were ancient sites
that used energy centers,

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:52.010 align:middle line:84%
and it's possible
that both these sites

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:55.910 align:middle line:84%
were some kind of ancient
spaceport of some sort.

00:21:55.910 --> 00:22:02.320 align:middle line:90%


00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.740 align:middle line:84%
>> So I believe that the fact
that we found the mercury

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:10.080 align:middle line:84%
in the Teotihuacan pyramid
complex is an actual amazing

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.260 align:middle line:84%
discovery that proves that
there is an advanced society

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:16.050 align:middle line:84%
in the past that have
gone to a very high level

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:17.370 align:middle line:90%
of civilization.

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:18.900 align:middle line:90%
And then something happened.

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.400 align:middle line:90%
What happened we don't know.

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.170 align:middle line:84%
But it is believed
that there have

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:24.390 align:middle line:84%
been advanced societies
that have actually

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:27.080 align:middle line:84%
built up over time and gone
through what we call the Kali

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:27.880 align:middle line:90%
Yuga.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.820 align:middle line:84%
They have started
at a very low level

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:31.980 align:middle line:84%
and built themselves
to the Golden Age.

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And then a cataclysm
happens, and we

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.190 align:middle line:90%
have to start over again.

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And the fact of that is if there
is a comet strike or a meteor

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.600 align:middle line:84%
strike here on Earth, and
everything is wiped out

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.500 align:middle line:84%
and some of us survive, we all
know how to use a cell phone,

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.300 align:middle line:90%
but we can't make a cell phone.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:46.530 align:middle line:90%
And this is what happens.

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:48.240 align:middle line:90%
It's a process of regeneration.

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Albert Einstein actually said
that there were four poles just

00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:54.067 align:middle line:84%
the crust of the Earth on
this planet in the past

00:22:54.067 --> 00:22:56.400 align:middle line:84%
and that there will be a fifth
one coming in the future.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.150 align:middle line:90%


00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:02.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Could Teotihuacan be the
remnant of an ancient human

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:05.820 align:middle line:10%
space station where some of
the inhabitants escaped during

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:06.690 align:middle line:10%
a cataclysm?

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:10.520 align:middle line:90%


00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.400 align:middle line:10%
>> Based off of research
that I've done in the past,

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:17.660 align:middle line:10%
I found that ancient kings and
queens had access to advanced

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:20.177 align:middle line:10%
technology, flying machines.

00:23:20.177 --> 00:23:21.510 align:middle line:90%
They wouldn't make many of them.

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And when they did
have them, they

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.950 align:middle line:84%
kept them extremely secret
because if their enemies got

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:27.533 align:middle line:84%
their hands on them, obviously,
they would have the upper hand

00:23:27.533 --> 00:23:31.520 align:middle line:84%
to bomb them, to fly over
their high megalithic walls,

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.380 align:middle line:84%
and come into the
cities and invade them.

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:35.690 align:middle line:84%
So they were kept very,
very, very secret.

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Some of this is in
ancient Sumerian texts,

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:42.080 align:middle line:84%
where, according to the text,
when the Great Flood came,

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.060 align:middle line:84%
some of these beings
left this planet

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:47.450 align:middle line:84%
and actually observed
it from above.

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:52.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Is this evidence of an
ancient secret space program?

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:56.870 align:middle line:84%
>> When you're looking at
things like the ancient Vimana.

00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:00.560 align:middle line:10%
Yes, I think that it
would be very likely.

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't know this for sure,
but it will be very likely

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:07.640 align:middle line:84%
that somewhere within the bowels
of the global intelligence

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:11.540 align:middle line:84%
elite community, there's
someone who's thinking,

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:13.340 align:middle line:84%
I want to study these
Vimanae and find out

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:17.110 align:middle line:84%
if there's any clues, or any
of these other ancient texts.

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:19.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Could ancient humans have
escaped major cataclysms

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:21.720 align:middle line:90%
by leaving the planet?

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And if so, is it possible only
a selected few were picked

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:29.950 align:middle line:90%
to extend the human race?

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:31.960 align:middle line:84%
>> I really believe
in the Yugas.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.350 align:middle line:84%
You actually go through
a cycle over 27,000 years

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:37.150 align:middle line:84%
where mankind goes
through the Bronze Age

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:40.300 align:middle line:84%
and kind of gradually moves
back up to the Golden Age again.

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's a process of basically
going back and starting over.

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:49.810 align:middle line:84%
These things happen
in cataclysms.

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:51.670 align:middle line:90%
And everything is cyclical.

00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:53.410 align:middle line:10%
When a cataclysm
happens, no matter

00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:56.740 align:middle line:10%
how far technologically
advanced you are,

00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:58.450 align:middle line:10%
you will get knocked back down.

00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:00.400 align:middle line:10%
I think this is why you
see the big rush now

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.470 align:middle line:10%
to go to Mars by private space.

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:04.600 align:middle line:84%
You see Elon Musk
and SpaceX talking

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:07.750 align:middle line:84%
about taking 80,000 people
to Mars on a one way trip.

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:09.040 align:middle line:90%
They're not coming back.

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>> The space race inspired
a generation of scientists

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:13.210 align:middle line:90%
and innovators.

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:16.150 align:middle line:84%
It's contributed to immeasurable
technological advances that

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:19.240 align:middle line:84%
have improved our health and
well-being, from satellite

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:21.460 align:middle line:84%
navigation to
water purification,

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:25.060 align:middle line:84%
from aerospace manufacturing
to medical imagery.

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>> If these ancient ruins
leave evidence of advanced

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:30.280 align:middle line:84%
civilizations with the
technology to go through

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:33.370 align:middle line:84%
the stars, could NASA and
the government have acquired

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:35.480 align:middle line:90%
the knowledge to join them?

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:38.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Somehow, it is
a desire in us.

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:43.120 align:middle line:84%
We always have to wish, to dream
to go out there in the stars.

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:47.320 align:middle line:84%
It's like we have this
wish in our genes.

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:48.550 align:middle line:90%
We came from there.

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:50.170 align:middle line:90%
We want to go there.

00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:54.730 align:middle line:10%
>> On June 8, 2016, Elon Musk
had a closed door meeting with

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:57.790 align:middle line:10%
Secretary of Defense Ash
Carter at the Pentagon.

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:00.520 align:middle line:84%
Carter states he's been
focused on promoting links

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.370 align:middle line:84%
to his department and
technology companies.

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:05.920 align:middle line:10%
But some suggest this
meeting is more evidence

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.860 align:middle line:10%
that Elon Musk is being
invited into a secret space

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:11.950 align:middle line:10%
program designed by
NASA and the government

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:14.830 align:middle line:10%
from the knowledge they've
gathered and implemented

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:16.210 align:middle line:10%
on other planets.

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:19.030 align:middle line:10%
>> What happens-- what makes a
billionaire want to leave this

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:20.535 align:middle line:10%
planet, OK?

00:26:20.535 --> 00:26:22.160 align:middle line:10%
You have to ask
yourself that question.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:25.030 align:middle line:84%
These people are not going
to go to another planet

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:28.420 align:middle line:84%
and live inside of a spacesuit
in a tent camp until they die.

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:30.213 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be
things there that

00:26:30.213 --> 00:26:32.380 align:middle line:84%
are going to be available
to them, an infrastructure

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:33.755 align:middle line:84%
to take care of
them to make sure

00:26:33.755 --> 00:26:36.880 align:middle line:84%
that they can have
a normal life.

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:37.905 align:middle line:90%
I honestly believe that.

00:26:37.905 --> 00:26:39.280 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
there's breakaway

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:43.240 align:middle line:84%
civilizations on the moon, on
Mars, and other moons of Saturn

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:45.280 align:middle line:90%
and also of Jupiter.

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:49.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Could places like
Chaco Canyon, Puma Punku,

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.770 align:middle line:84%
and Teotihuacan be ancient
road maps to the stars?

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:55.990 align:middle line:84%
Could the government
and NASA be using data

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:59.350 align:middle line:84%
from these ancient ruins to
create their own space faring

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:00.700 align:middle line:90%
race?

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:03.310 align:middle line:90%
If so, why is it kept a secret?

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:06.220 align:middle line:90%
Are we headed for a cataclysm?

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:09.610 align:middle line:84%
Will history repeat itself
and collect only the elite

00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:12.940 align:middle line:90%
to forward the human race?

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:15.940 align:middle line:84%
Up next, if researchers
have found evidence

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:19.810 align:middle line:84%
of an ancient space program
and possibly even space faring

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:23.110 align:middle line:84%
people, could this prove
that a progenitor race

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:25.340 align:middle line:90%
exists within our own universe?

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:27.630 align:middle line:90%
And if so, are they watching us?

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:30.310 align:middle line:90%


00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:34.000 align:middle line:84%
