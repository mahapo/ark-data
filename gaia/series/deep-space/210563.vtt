>> Grey aliens, many originating
from the constellation

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.390 align:middle line:84%
of Orion, are perhaps the
most commonly encountered

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.210 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial
species that we know.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.670 align:middle line:84%
Named for the coloration
of their skin,

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.360 align:middle line:84%
they're often confused with
extraterrestrial biological

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.950 align:middle line:84%
entities, or Ebens, who are
also gray in appearance.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.560 align:middle line:10%
While there are several
species of Greys,

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.270 align:middle line:10%
they're most often described as
having small synthetic bodies,

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.090 align:middle line:10%
hairless heads with
large black eyes,

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.850 align:middle line:10%
and an individual
consciousness within.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.340 align:middle line:84%
These are the small
beings also depicted

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.880 align:middle line:84%
in various historic
artifacts around the world.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.769 align:middle line:84%
To what degree are
the Greys involved

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.460 align:middle line:90%
in the history of humankind?

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And to what extent might they
be influencing our destiny as we

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.750 align:middle line:90%
look to the future?

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.970 align:middle line:10%
>> Based on the Defense
Intelligence Agency

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.490 align:middle line:10%
classifications of
extraterrestrial groups,

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.260 align:middle line:10%
which I had access to
information relating to that,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.110 align:middle line:10%
there are two groups or
two classification degrees.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.990 align:middle line:90%
The first one are the Ebens.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.700 align:middle line:84%
The Ebens came to us here in
1947 when one of their crafts

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.440 align:middle line:84%
crashed in Corona, New
Mexico in Horse Mesa.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.100 align:middle line:84%
We recovered one
live ET, one Eben.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.860 align:middle line:90%
He was in captivity in 1952.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.960 align:middle line:84%
The second classification
of Greys are the Hepaloids.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.480 align:middle line:84%
They look similar to
the Ebens, but they

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.310 align:middle line:90%
come from a different planet.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.870 align:middle line:84%
They look different
in respects to size.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And pop culture or
society, in general,

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.050 align:middle line:84%
that had access to both
the Ebens and Hepaloids

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.820 align:middle line:90%
confuse them.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And they classify them all in
one category, but that's wrong.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.470 align:middle line:10%
>> When we're looking
at Grey species,

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.570 align:middle line:10%
we're dealing with so many
different appearances,

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.600 align:middle line:10%
and yet they've all got the
similar quality which makes

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.160 align:middle line:10%
them a Grey.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.920 align:middle line:84%
So it seems to be,
from my perspective,

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.560 align:middle line:84%
that they've been
hybridized multiple times.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing a lot of
different types of features.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.540 align:middle line:84%
So there's a basic small
2-foot, 3-foot tall Grey

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.420 align:middle line:90%
who's pretty much just a robot.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.340 align:middle line:84%
Then there's the
classic Grey, which

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.820 align:middle line:84%
is the 4-foot tall,
big headed person

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.460 align:middle line:90%
with relatively long limbs.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.130 align:middle line:84%
Very ashen grey, which is
where they get their name,

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.520 align:middle line:84%
and the classic wrap round
eyes which they all have.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we get to
that, we're looking

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.120 align:middle line:84%
at appearance that
is the classic Grey

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.860 align:middle line:84%
appearance and maybe the
kind of root of the Grey.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>> The Hepaloids, their head
was proportionately larger than

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.830 align:middle line:84%
their body, their
face was round,

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.840 align:middle line:84%
the skin tone of the head was
slightly darker than the skin

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.600 align:middle line:84%
tone of the body, and maybe
that was for protection.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.960 align:middle line:90%
They had larger eyes.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.990 align:middle line:84%
The eyes had a couple of
different lenses protecting

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.400 align:middle line:84%
the irises or maybe the
optic nerve from radiation

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.900 align:middle line:90%
or from bright light.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.015 align:middle line:84%
The mouth had just a small
slit, but it could widen.

00:03:37.015 --> 00:03:39.010 align:middle line:90%
They could widen the mouth.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.050 align:middle line:84%
The ear canal was small
exterior, larger interior.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.630 align:middle line:84%
Their hearing, they had a huge
vessel inside their ear canal.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.300 align:middle line:84%
The Hepaloids had
teeth or something

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.830 align:middle line:84%
that we would consider teeth,
a hard palate, so to speak.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.090 align:middle line:84%
The Hepaloids had different
organs, almost similar to ours.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.300 align:middle line:84%
They had a heart, or what
we would consider a heart,

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.050 align:middle line:84%
and they had one big organ
that straddled the heart, which

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.150 align:middle line:90%
we would consider a lung.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.690 align:middle line:84%
They had two different
gullets or stomachs.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.070 align:middle line:84%
I think the description by
one particular physician

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.490 align:middle line:84%
was that the skin
was very fibrous.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.700 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't identify
what that fiber was.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.040 align:middle line:84%
We first thought it
was a protective layer.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.070 align:middle line:84%
The exterior of the
Hepaloids would change

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.960 align:middle line:84%
or it would glow or would darken
somewhat, the fibrous material.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And that was, we think,
some form of protection.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.400 align:middle line:84%
The wrists, I remember,
on the Hepaloids,

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:49.180 align:middle line:84%
were very, very bony compared to
the bone structure on the Eben

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.350 align:middle line:90%
wrist.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And that allowed the
Hepaloids to move their hands

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.490 align:middle line:84%
in very strange ways, nothing
like what a human could move

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.040 align:middle line:90%
their hand, almost 360 degrees.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.410 align:middle line:84%
So their anatomy was
different than the Ebens.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.720 align:middle line:84%
So we classified--
at that point,

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.320 align:middle line:84%
the DIA classified this
particular group of Greys

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.630 align:middle line:90%
as Hepaloids.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.900 align:middle line:84%
>> In a secret access
program located in Germany,

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.750 align:middle line:84%
where they have direct
face-to-face relationship with

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.250 align:middle line:84%
Grey extraterrestrials, Tim,
whose role as a tactical

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.640 align:middle line:84%
advisor working in a
diplomatic capacity,

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.440 align:middle line:84%
had more than 100 encounters
with a small Grey species.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.350 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm not a biologist
here by any means.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.850 align:middle line:84%
But the way I understand
this is that the fiber that

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.050 align:middle line:84%
is being used on the
small Grey puppets

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.170 align:middle line:90%
resists a lot of power forces.

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And it resists certain
atmospherical phenomena

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.800 align:middle line:90%
that could occur.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.510 align:middle line:10%
They also have specific design
on the lenses of their eyes,

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:06.940 align:middle line:10%
which means they are able to
see within that atmosphere

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.200 align:middle line:10%
wherever they are going.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.650 align:middle line:84%
Compared to a planet
that is mostly

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.410 align:middle line:84%
clouds of acid or
something, to be

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.250 align:middle line:84%
able to see through these
different conditions,

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.550 align:middle line:84%
you need differently
printed eyes

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.630 align:middle line:84%
and differently structured
organs, for example.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.880 align:middle line:84%
They have different
classes, and they're

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.300 align:middle line:84%
also constantly
evolving and rearranging

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.790 align:middle line:90%
their genetic profile.

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:40.630 align:middle line:84%
We have different colors like
green, bronze, a type of violet

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.230 align:middle line:90%
purple, and the greyish color.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:48.550 align:middle line:10%
Those different colors define
certain different classes

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.620 align:middle line:10%
within the society of the Grey.

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:55.540 align:middle line:84%
So not all Greys are grey and
not all grey species are Greys.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:01.240 align:middle line:84%
Which might be confusing
for some researchers

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.030 align:middle line:84%
because they hear stories
about greyish beings

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:09.540 align:middle line:84%
which might not even be
part of the Grey community.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Because of the fiber
printed material that Greys use

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:17.730 align:middle line:84%
as bodies for specific missions,
some investigators conclude

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:22.140 align:middle line:84%
that we're dealing with robotic
artificial intelligence.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.680 align:middle line:84%
>> People sometimes think
that the Greys are robots,

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.210 align:middle line:90%
which they are not.

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:32.400 align:middle line:84%
They use a artificial
fiber material in order

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:38.100 align:middle line:84%
to build their puppets,
which they are.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.120 align:middle line:90%
They're using puppets.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.890 align:middle line:90%
But they are not robots.

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:44.580 align:middle line:84%
It's just that they use
a certain genetic profile

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:49.380 align:middle line:84%
and fiber print millions
of those artificial bodies.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.630 align:middle line:84%
We have a very
particular case in which

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:57.750 align:middle line:84%
a species got rid of all
their natural occurring bodies

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:03.060 align:middle line:84%
and replaced it with a vessel
that can be fiber printed.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And might be, in the
design process, something

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:09.870 align:middle line:84%
that is from an
artificial nature.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:13.890 align:middle line:84%
But we are not dealing
with a species that is AI.

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
needs to be clarified

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:18.090 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people
heard about the idea

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:24.330 align:middle line:84%
that the Greys is a complete
AI species, which they're not.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Inside of this
artificial body, we still

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.650 align:middle line:84%
have a consciousness
that has a soul

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:37.710 align:middle line:84%
while a robot does not have
a naturally occurring soul.

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:40.049 align:middle line:84%
They might have
something that comes

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:44.470 align:middle line:84%
close to that on an AI
level later in the process,

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:46.680 align:middle line:90%
but Greys do.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.830 align:middle line:84%
It might be different
in a way that they

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:52.680 align:middle line:84%
come from a different
cultural standpoint,

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:57.840 align:middle line:84%
but it's still a natural soul
inhabiting consciousness that

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.890 align:middle line:90%
is within an artificial body.

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I think over the years, we've
learned that there are a lot

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:09.720 align:middle line:84%
of different biological, and
then androids are robotics,

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.565 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrials.

00:09:11.565 --> 00:09:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't
personally know, and I

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.410 align:middle line:84%
don't know that the agency
that's studying these

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:20.910 align:middle line:84%
know exactly whether
they're connected

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:24.600 align:middle line:84%
to one particular race
or whether they're

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.860 align:middle line:90%
a separate race.

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:28.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's so much
that we don't know,

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.770 align:middle line:84%
and there's so much conflict
in the UFO community

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:35.590 align:middle line:90%
about which entity is here?

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:37.630 align:middle line:90%
Which entity is real?

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.200 align:middle line:84%
Which entity did
a writer make up?

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:45.240 align:middle line:84%
So that's the confusion
that society is stuck with.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Perhaps more than any
other extraterrestrial group,

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:52.230 align:middle line:84%
the Greys, including the grey
extraterrestrial biological

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:56.370 align:middle line:84%
entities, are amongst the best
documented by both intelligence

00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:00.380 align:middle line:84%
agencies and
independent researchers.

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:04.220 align:middle line:84%
While the consensus is that
grey extraterrestrials show up

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:08.150 align:middle line:84%
in a variety of forms with a
limited observable emotional

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:12.530 align:middle line:84%
persona, no one is certain about
their intentions and agendas.

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:17.260 align:middle line:84%
Or their association
with other ET influences.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:21.190 align:middle line:84%
Since the early 1970s,
investigative science reporter

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:23.920 align:middle line:84%
Linda Moulton Howe has
been at the forefront

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.950 align:middle line:90%
of examining these cases.

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:32.050 align:middle line:10%
>> The role that the Greys have
played for the whole century

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:41.380 align:middle line:10%
of the, going from 1947 at
least up into the 21st century,

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.320 align:middle line:10%
you will find documents,
and you will find people

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:47.320 align:middle line:10%
in the abduction syndrome
who will talk about the Greys

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:55.030 align:middle line:10%
as one kind even though they
are referring to maybe a 2-foot

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:58.510 align:middle line:10%
or 3-foot that woke them up in
bed and it was involved with

00:10:58.510 --> 00:10:59.770 align:middle line:10%
an abduction.

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:02.800 align:middle line:84%
Or people out in a
ranch in Colorado

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.520 align:middle line:84%
who were Cowboys and saw
two small Grey beings

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:10.240 align:middle line:84%
literally defy gravity
and rise in the air

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.960 align:middle line:84%
and go over the
fence of a corral.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.770 align:middle line:84%
So going all the way
back to the early '40s

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:20.440 align:middle line:84%
and coming up
through the decades,

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.640 align:middle line:84%
as there were
animal mutilations,

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.800 align:middle line:90%
the small Greys were linked.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.950 align:middle line:84%
As there were human
abductions that most people

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:36.620 align:middle line:84%
were describing at their bed
or at the side, small Greys.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:41.810 align:middle line:84%
In the 1940s, '50s,
'60s, nobody knew that,

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:45.500 align:middle line:84%
why were all of these things
showing up around beds?

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, today, it would
be like we sent out

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.780 align:middle line:84%
some artificial
intelligence to do

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:54.020 align:middle line:90%
some kind of experimental work.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:59.450 align:middle line:84%
So you have an issue of humans
reporting what they see.

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And then trying to extrapolate
back, they're sort of all grey,

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:08.510 align:middle line:84%
they sort of have
black lens eyes,

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:11.780 align:middle line:84%
but what is the
relationship between them,

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:16.520 align:middle line:84%
and what is the relationship
between the Greys and the Ebens

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:20.210 align:middle line:84%
and other biological entities
that we know have played

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:24.410 align:middle line:84%
a crucial role on planet Earth,
and those are called the Tall

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:28.280 align:middle line:90%
Whites or Tall Pales.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:31.280 align:middle line:84%
>> It's important to note that
when Greys are seen aboard

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.700 align:middle line:84%
spacecraft, they're often
alongside other types

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.790 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial
intelligences.

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Contactees report
seeing beings that

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:43.790 align:middle line:84%
resemble praying mantis
types, as well as those who

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:45.890 align:middle line:90%
are Nordic looking humanoids.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:49.760 align:middle line:84%
It is suggested that the Greys
appear as workers on the craft,

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.970 align:middle line:84%
while the other ETs
are the supervisors.

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:56.990 align:middle line:84%
>> The Greys, they use a certain
technology in order to fiber

00:12:56.990 --> 00:13:03.240 align:middle line:84%
print their small bodies, but
they also sell this technology.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:09.290 align:middle line:84%
So in a contactee scenario where
you have one certain species,

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:12.590 align:middle line:84%
like a mantis or
reptile or whatever,

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:16.010 align:middle line:84%
and you have small Greys
performing something,

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:19.820 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't necessarily
mean that the Grey

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.190 align:middle line:90%
tribe is involved.

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:26.150 align:middle line:10%
It just means that somebody
could have bought or get

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:29.630 align:middle line:10%
their hands on the small
greyish bodies in order

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:32.960 align:middle line:10%
for them to perform something.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:38.700 align:middle line:10%
>> I believe our seed form,
our genetic code is very,

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:40.490 align:middle line:10%
very sophisticated.

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:44.420 align:middle line:10%
And so some intelligences,
and some of them are grey

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:47.960 align:middle line:10%
intelligences, some of them
are reptilian intelligences,

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:53.900 align:middle line:10%
want some of our DNA to mix
with theirs for a greater

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:58.130 align:middle line:10%
understanding and a
greater soul intelligence,

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:02.220 align:middle line:10%
because they don't
have that capability.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>> What we know about the
Greys originates from a variety

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:06.230 align:middle line:90%
of disciplines.

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:08.900 align:middle line:84%
Some people have
experienced direct contact.

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.450 align:middle line:84%
Others work in
intelligence agencies.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:16.010 align:middle line:84%
Then there are those who channel
information, like Marina Jacobi

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:18.470 align:middle line:84%
who learned about their
technology in relation

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:22.160 align:middle line:84%
to timelines, where
past, present, and future

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.560 align:middle line:90%
are all interconnected.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.970 align:middle line:10%
>> In order for species that
did not make it in a future

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:34.220 align:middle line:10%
timeline to really start
reconstructing their bodies,

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:38.060 align:middle line:10%
they needed original DNA,
which they had to take from

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:39.810 align:middle line:10%
our timeline.

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:47.300 align:middle line:84%
So they came in with the agenda
to take DNA out of our species

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:50.100 align:middle line:84%
through the permission
of the governments.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is where it became very
messy because different groups

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:56.570 align:middle line:90%
got involved.

00:14:56.570 --> 00:15:00.410 align:middle line:10%
The human race of the government
didn't know too much about it.

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:02.030 align:middle line:10%
They were kept in the dark.

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:09.170 align:middle line:84%
So there was an agenda for
survival from the Greys

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:12.590 align:middle line:90%
because they were dying off.

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.440 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't reprint
the DNA anymore.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.740 align:middle line:84%
The atmosphere now
became very difficult.

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:23.660 align:middle line:84%
They end up using the
technology to enhance their DNA

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:27.710 align:middle line:84%
because the original
human has the DNA that

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:32.550 align:middle line:84%
is the original blueprint
from God consciousness itself.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is why a
lot of species here

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:40.850 align:middle line:84%
from so-called beings on
Earth that completely all

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:42.590 align:middle line:84%
disengage with the
illusion, and they

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:47.660 align:middle line:84%
don't realize that when you
change the DNA of the human,

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:50.960 align:middle line:84%
you do not hold the same
sequences through the chakras

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:54.350 align:middle line:84%
to convert, to open
these portals to expand

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:56.370 align:middle line:90%
into another level of existence.

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And this is why there's
a lot of situations

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:03.510 align:middle line:84%
now here that people
are being manipulated.

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:06.840 align:middle line:84%
>> So if were were talking
about technology of the Greys,

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.000 align:middle line:84%
one of the technologies
for example,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.380 align:middle line:84%
that they use in some
contactee scenarios,

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:16.990 align:middle line:84%
it's either frequency
technology that comes from them,

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:23.280 align:middle line:84%
which is basically altering
and modifying the brainwaves.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And the brainwaves
then determines

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:30.930 align:middle line:84%
what kind of neurons
and neurological stimuli

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:33.570 align:middle line:90%
are being released.

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:35.550 align:middle line:84%
This is one technology
that they use.

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:38.880 align:middle line:84%
The other technology is
the temporal technology,

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:45.240 align:middle line:84%
which basically means that they
create a certain timeline that

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.180 align:middle line:84%
only exists for a
certain amount of time.

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:54.210 align:middle line:84%
In this timeline, they sort
of create a contact scenario

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:58.710 align:middle line:84%
with people, but then
they delete the timeline.

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:02.940 align:middle line:84%
So people wake from that
sequence of their life,

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:08.609 align:middle line:84%
but they don't have the corporal
memory because that timeline

00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:09.910 align:middle line:90%
never existed.

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:14.550 align:middle line:84%
But still because consciousness
is outside of time as well,

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:17.430 align:middle line:84%
all the experiences
and communication

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:19.680 align:middle line:84%
that has been done
outside of time

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:23.790 align:middle line:84%
is still stored in the
consciousness of a person.

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:26.310 align:middle line:84%
So that is, for example,
a temporal technology

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:27.690 align:middle line:90%
the Greys are using.

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Meaning setting up,
opening a timeline,

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:35.730 align:middle line:84%
doing stuff there, and then
deleting that timeline.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:38.910 align:middle line:84%
But all the stuff that had
been communicated in there

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:41.940 align:middle line:84%
are still stored in the
individual consciousness

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:46.830 align:middle line:84%
without the body being
able to memorize things.

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:50.850 align:middle line:84%
>> It is through this telepathic
communication where contactees

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:54.510 align:middle line:84%
have gained insights into the
possible agendas of the Greys.

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:58.170 align:middle line:84%
Including their ability
to affect timelines.

00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:02.910 align:middle line:84%
>> So let us go back
furthermore in Earth history.

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:06.330 align:middle line:84%
We are dealing with a situation
many thousands of years

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:09.270 align:middle line:84%
ago from a temporal
perspective of time,

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:11.160 align:middle line:90%
a linear perspective of time.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.380 align:middle line:84%
What we are dealing
with is a situation

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:17.130 align:middle line:84%
where the very early
humans are developing,

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:20.010 align:middle line:84%
and there is this
temporal dimension

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:23.670 align:middle line:84%
to the Galactic
legislative system, where

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:26.520 align:middle line:84%
whoever comes first
has more rights

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:34.470 align:middle line:84%
on planetary evolvement than
those species who come later.

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:38.850 align:middle line:84%
But if you think about
the Greys as a temporal

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:42.960 align:middle line:84%
or as a time traveling species,
but other ETs are, as well,

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.380 align:middle line:84%
time traveling species,
then temporal dimension

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:51.300 align:middle line:84%
and temporal legislative
rules, they just

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.980 align:middle line:90%
don't make any sense anymore.

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:56.370 align:middle line:84%
Because every time
someone places something

00:18:56.370 --> 00:19:00.720 align:middle line:84%
in the history of something,
then the other fraction

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:04.050 align:middle line:84%
might just go back one day
earlier and place it there.

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:05.610 align:middle line:90%
And then you have always--

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:08.800 align:middle line:84%
you have the same
thing going on forever.

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:13.260 align:middle line:84%
There are other aspects
to legislative rules

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.520 align:middle line:90%
that need to be looked upon.

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.390 align:middle line:10%
And one of them is
genetic profiles.

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:22.980 align:middle line:10%
Which means if you
have a certain amount

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:26.970 align:middle line:10%
of genetic material
on one planet,

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:33.300 align:middle line:10%
then you have a right to
interfere with that planet.

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:37.890 align:middle line:84%
Because on the overall
scale of the universe,

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:41.430 align:middle line:84%
there is one agreement
that you should not

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:44.070 align:middle line:84%
interfere with
planetary evolvement

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:47.740 align:middle line:84%
unless you have
a right to do so.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:52.200 align:middle line:84%
So I'm basically saying that the
Greys, from their perspective,

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.300 align:middle line:84%
think that they are responsible
for the seeding of humanity

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:56.100 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:01.530 align:middle line:84%
But I also say that there
are many more sources saying

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:05.010 align:middle line:84%
that the Greys have done
manipulation of genetics.

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:08.400 align:middle line:90%


00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.620 align:middle line:10%
>> According to what Tim
has learned from the Greys

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:14.010 align:middle line:10%
directly, the Greys are
conscious beings who use

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:17.610 align:middle line:10%
sophisticated artificial
bodies in an effort to optimize

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:20.220 align:middle line:10%
their own evolution
and that of others.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:23.520 align:middle line:10%
Part of their agenda with
us is to correct decisions

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.010 align:middle line:10%
from an earlier
version of themselves

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:28.530 align:middle line:10%
that they have long
since outlived.

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:32.340 align:middle line:10%
>> What they are interested
in is basically two things.

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Different genetic profiles,
and the second thing

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:42.810 align:middle line:84%
is that they are interested in
the experiences that come along

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:44.790 align:middle line:90%
with being human.

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:46.920 align:middle line:84%
>> While there are several
possible theories about

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:50.370 align:middle line:84%
the Greys and their agendas,
perhaps the most important

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:54.360 align:middle line:84%
question to be raised
is, can we trust them?

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:57.720 align:middle line:84%
>> I have talked with one
man who worked in the Defense

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:01.830 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence Agency who
told me, quote, "Linda,

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:05.370 align:middle line:84%
our government has proof
that three competing

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:09.720 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial civilizations
have been mixing and matching

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:13.920 align:middle line:84%
genes to create all kinds
of life forms on this planet

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:17.520 align:middle line:90%
for at least 270 million years.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.510 align:middle line:84%
Before the time
of the dinosaurs."

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And there is something about
that that has always made sense

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:26.300 align:middle line:84%
to me when you match up
what people have said

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:28.760 align:middle line:84%
and the stories
that are in books.

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And it may be that those
are the three civilizations

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:37.580 align:middle line:84%
that the DIA guy meant
when he said there

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:39.380 align:middle line:90%
have been three competing.

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:43.130 align:middle line:84%
Greys, blondes,
and the reptilian.

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:47.420 align:middle line:84%
But he went further and said
the reptilians say and claim

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:50.700 align:middle line:84%
that they have been
on Earth first.

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:53.720 align:middle line:10%
Sort of like the
Garden of Eden story.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And they resent the coming
of the blondes and the Greys.

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And that the three had been
at each other's throats

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:07.850 align:middle line:84%
over this planet because it
is an extraordinary planet.

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:12.420 align:middle line:84%
That it is really more
like a laboratory.

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, if the Greys showed up,
let's say they're third here,

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:19.980 align:middle line:84%
maybe they were
late to this party.

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And they end up somehow
stumbling into this Earth

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:28.200 align:middle line:84%
situation where the reptiles
have already been here,

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:33.370 align:middle line:84%
the blonde Nordics are
newcomers to the planet,

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:36.150 align:middle line:84%
it may make sense
then that when you

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:39.540 align:middle line:84%
get to the 20th and
the 21st centuries,

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:42.270 align:middle line:84%
you do have a lot
of military people

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:45.060 align:middle line:84%
who have had
missions with these.

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:49.890 align:middle line:84%
We say, they think
that the Nordics

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:56.430 align:middle line:84%
want to help us because they
want the reptilians out.

00:22:56.430 --> 00:23:03.180 align:middle line:84%
The Greys, they think, may want
to help us in a friendly way

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:06.900 align:middle line:84%
because they want
to stay on a planet

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:10.650 align:middle line:84%
that they can cohabit
with and survive.

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:13.290 align:middle line:84%
The blondes don't
hate the Greys.

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:15.970 align:middle line:90%
So they would be tolerated.

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:18.690 align:middle line:84%
But the blondes and the
reptilians hate each other

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:20.850 align:middle line:90%
and want to annihilate.

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Leaving the Greys as a kind
of strange neutral ground

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:28.200 align:middle line:90%
between the two.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:33.510 align:middle line:10%
>> And they are evolving and a
learning species just as much

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:36.515 align:middle line:10%
as any other species
in the whole universe.

00:23:36.515 --> 00:23:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And at one point
or another, they

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:43.125 align:middle line:84%
have calculated this
very intellectualized way

00:23:43.125 --> 00:23:47.700 align:middle line:84%
of what is the balance or
the best way, so to speak,

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:51.670 align:middle line:84%
and they came to a
100% success rate.

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:56.850 align:middle line:84%
But that also makes them, in
their eyes, the last species

00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:59.970 align:middle line:84%
of the universe,
and then the species

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:02.880 align:middle line:90%
who turns off the light.

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.480 align:middle line:90%
And then we have a new scenario.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.560 align:middle line:84%
So that is basically
their own approach.

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:10.620 align:middle line:84%
They are pretty harsh
on themselves as well

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:13.470 align:middle line:84%
in a way, which is
kind of interesting.

00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:17.220 align:middle line:84%
So they get rid of all
their genetic precursors

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:21.660 align:middle line:84%
and genetic history
by constantly

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:25.470 align:middle line:84%
evolving and integrating
new experiences

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:28.320 align:middle line:90%
in their own species.

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:31.510 align:middle line:84%
It's a very interesting
approach how

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:34.800 align:middle line:84%
to handle both the universe
and its challenges.

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:37.470 align:middle line:90%


00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>> The Greys can manipulate
DNA to further improve

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:43.080 align:middle line:90%
the potential of a human soul.

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:46.830 align:middle line:84%
More significantly, the
Greys have the ability

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:49.620 align:middle line:84%
to insert souls
into other beings

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:54.330 align:middle line:84%
for enriching both the human
and the Greys' experiences.

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:56.760 align:middle line:84%
To improve their
mutual evolution,

00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:00.120 align:middle line:84%
is it possible that
through closely monitoring

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.610 align:middle line:84%
the human experience,
the Greys can

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:06.870 align:middle line:84%
regain their own spirituality,
as well as enhance

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:08.940 align:middle line:90%
the growth of human souls?

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>> It's an interesting
concept that the Greys,

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:14.400 align:middle line:84%
they see themselves
as gardeners.

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:19.050 align:middle line:84%
So I've spoken to them once,
and they gave me the example

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:23.100 align:middle line:84%
that some people
love their garden

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:29.910 align:middle line:84%
to be wild and let everything
grow however it wants to grow,

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:34.260 align:middle line:84%
and there are some people
that like their garden

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.060 align:middle line:90%
to be neat and tidy.

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way the
Greys see themselves.

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:42.930 align:middle line:84%
They say that they
like their evolution

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:46.110 align:middle line:90%
to be as smooth as possible.

00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:49.710 align:middle line:84%
They think of this as
a process of keeping

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:54.690 align:middle line:84%
tonal dynamics, which means
that everyone who's evolving

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:58.290 align:middle line:84%
and has a certain
idea of creation,

00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:02.100 align:middle line:84%
because that is a very
important part of evolution

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:06.420 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness,
everyone needs to create

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:12.660 align:middle line:84%
their own concept of
creation so that everyone

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:14.100 align:middle line:90%
can have their own home.

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:17.580 align:middle line:84%
This is something the universe
relies upon because it

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:19.410 align:middle line:90%
needs this kind of diversity.

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And the Greys,
they see themselves

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:26.390 align:middle line:84%
as protectors of
that natural process.

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:30.850 align:middle line:90%


00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:33.640 align:middle line:10%
>> If you think about gardeners
of humanity and the possibility

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:36.250 align:middle line:10%
that they are being our
custodians and they've evolved

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:40.570 align:middle line:10%
us, there's a possibility that
the Greys are actually trying

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:43.090 align:middle line:10%
to engineer something that's
gone wrong in the future.

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:46.540 align:middle line:10%
And they're trying to
intervene at the very beginning

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:49.040 align:middle line:10%
when these changes
are occurring.

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's possible
that they have got

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:55.750 align:middle line:84%
a benevolent view of being
able to repair the past

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:57.560 align:middle line:90%
or fix the past.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, as humans, we can only
think of fixing events.

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:05.110 align:middle line:84%
So many people would wish that
they could change an event.

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:07.390 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, we know it
cascades into the future

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:10.360 align:middle line:84%
and changes so
many other aspects.

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:13.240 align:middle line:84%
If they are trying to
fix a future crisis,

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:16.090 align:middle line:84%
then they have a benevolent
reason to be here.

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:18.070 align:middle line:84%
But they can't
tell us or disclose

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:19.910 align:middle line:90%
because it would be a disaster.

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:25.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's possible that there's a
fundamental change coming that

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:28.390 align:middle line:90%
disturbs our entire genome.

00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:31.930 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps they have done
something in our future

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:34.220 align:middle line:84%
that makes them
what they are now,

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:35.900 align:middle line:90%
which is incapable of breeding.

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Which to us, as human
beings, infertility.

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:43.450 align:middle line:84%
So you imagine an entire
species, which may be us,

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:48.250 align:middle line:84%
have an infertility, which means
annihilation and/or snuffing

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:51.760 align:middle line:84%
out of our entire race,
that would be reason

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:55.240 align:middle line:90%
enough to do this.

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>> The Greys have this one
goal and one goal only approach

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:06.040 align:middle line:84%
to the universe, where they
want to achieve a connection

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:12.160 align:middle line:84%
throughout every possible
race and individual and every

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:15.540 align:middle line:90%
particle that there is.

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:21.690 align:middle line:84%
So if you're asking if the
Greys are us from the future,

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:27.270 align:middle line:84%
I would say that they
are a possibility for us

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:28.320 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:32.250 align:middle line:84%
From where we stand now,
it's still something

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:35.340 align:middle line:84%
that everyone needs
to decide upon just

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:38.160 align:middle line:90%
the way the universe works.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:41.910 align:middle line:84%
But also we are dealing
with a species that,

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:45.810 align:middle line:84%
in the last cycle of
beings on this planet,

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:49.440 align:middle line:84%
was involved with the
evolution of humanity.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
ancient humans that

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:57.180 align:middle line:84%
were inhabiting this planet
have been collected from them

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:59.760 align:middle line:84%
and integrated into
their system, as well

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:02.820 align:middle line:84%
as their genetic
profiles have been

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:06.570 align:middle line:84%
integrated in the human
species and their genomes.

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:11.130 align:middle line:84%
So I would say there's
a strong relationship.

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:14.310 align:middle line:84%
I also talked about
the Greys saying

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:19.290 align:middle line:84%
that they consider themselves
the fathers of humanity.

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:23.520 align:middle line:84%
But the outcome
that comes from that

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.740 align:middle line:84%
is still something
that the universe

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:27.100 align:middle line:90%
is developing right now.

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:28.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.860 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:33.680 align:middle line:10%
>> While the Greys have their
own agenda to spread across

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.710 align:middle line:10%
the universe and fulfill
their own concept of order

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:41.810 align:middle line:10%
