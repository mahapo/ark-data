00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Ancient cultures around the
world had a ruling class that

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.340 align:middle line:84%
practiced intentional
cranial modification,

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.820 align:middle line:84%
a procedure to deliberately
reshape the skull to express

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.170 align:middle line:90%
status, wealth, and nobility.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.210 align:middle line:84%
Some of the oldest
examples of this

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.930 align:middle line:84%
were dated as far back as
five to 12,000 years ago

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.040 align:middle line:84%
in China and spans
continents around the world.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.040 align:middle line:84%
Was this an attempt to
imitate an advanced race

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.560 align:middle line:90%
of beings with elongated heads?

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.080 align:middle line:84%
If so, might they be
extraterrestrials,

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.240 align:middle line:84%
and what evidence suggests
that they actually existed?

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.230 align:middle line:10%
>> In my opinion, there was an
advanced civilization on this

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.010 align:middle line:10%
planet at one point who
were our progenitors.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.740 align:middle line:10%
I very much believe they
had elongated skulls

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.250 align:middle line:10%
from what we can see in
all our ancient iconography

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.690 align:middle line:10%
and mythologies.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And subsequently, all the other
civilizations that followed

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.570 align:middle line:90%
attempted to mimic them.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.140 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes that included
cranial deformation.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.980 align:middle line:84%
At other times, that included
different hats and symbolism.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.320 align:middle line:84%
But we know that
they existed, and we

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.990 align:middle line:90%
know that they came before us.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Why should humans make
elongated head, and how?

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.980 align:middle line:10%
We know it from Central
and South America.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.890 align:middle line:10%
When the Spanish conqueror
arrived, for example,

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.010 align:middle line:10%
in today's Peru, they saw
some of the young priest

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.470 align:middle line:10%
boys which had long heads.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And they asked them, how do
these long heads come from?

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.060 align:middle line:90%
They brought them at home.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And at home, they show
the Spanish conqueror.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.380 align:middle line:90%
They show the babies.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.240 align:middle line:10%
The babies who were just born--

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.610 align:middle line:10%
they just left the
mother's womb--

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.820 align:middle line:10%
and because the head,
the bones are soft,

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.620 align:middle line:10%
they pressed the
bones of the boys

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.770 align:middle line:10%
so that the bones became
longer and longer.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.640 align:middle line:84%
>> The reason that this
mimicry, or cranial deformation,

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.000 align:middle line:84%
took place is because these
rulers with the elongated

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.790 align:middle line:84%
skulls were venerated
in the ancient world.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.410 align:middle line:90%
Who were they trying to mimic?

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.780 align:middle line:90%
Who were they trying to uphold?

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.770 align:middle line:84%
Again, we have this
very ancient connection

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.210 align:middle line:84%
to these rulers with
elongated skulls.

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.990 align:middle line:84%
>> While elongated skulls
are a worldwide phenomena,

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.780 align:middle line:84%
some of the best examples
to have been scientifically

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.300 align:middle line:90%
examined come from Peru.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.770 align:middle line:84%
Four hours South of Lima is
the Paracas Peninsula of Peru,

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.760 align:middle line:84%
an area surrounded by rich
agricultural landscapes

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.190 align:middle line:84%
and a civilization
that can be traced back

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.800 align:middle line:90%
to at least 5,000 years.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.390 align:middle line:10%
It is here, in 1928, that
archaeologist Julio Tello

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.480 align:middle line:10%
discovered a collection of
enormously elongated skulls.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.820 align:middle line:10%
Canadian scientist
Brien Foerster

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.670 align:middle line:10%
has lived in Peru for
the past 10 years,

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:25.380 align:middle line:10%
dedicating his entire focus
to studying these specimens.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.500 align:middle line:10%
>> And it wasn't until
about 12 years ago,

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.300 align:middle line:10%
when I entered this museum here
owned, by SeÃ±or Juan Navarro,

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.960 align:middle line:10%
who was a local
amateur archaeologist,

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.750 align:middle line:10%
that I saw my first
elongated skull.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it's
a mummified one.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And coming from a biological
premed background,

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.610 align:middle line:84%
I was astonished at seeing this
because I couldn't understand

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:50.480 align:middle line:90%
what it was.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.340 align:middle line:90%
We have examples of skulls--

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.900 align:middle line:84%
the oldest ones, which appear
to be natural elongated skulls.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And then, later on, when
you have the Nazca culture

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.360 align:middle line:84%
interacting with
the Paracas, that's

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.160 align:middle line:90%
when the head binding began.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.950 align:middle line:84%
Standard academia
states that the Paracas

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.530 align:middle line:84%
arrived on the coast of
Peru, or evolved as a group,

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.760 align:middle line:84%
as a cohesive group, probably
around 800 BC or 600 BC.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.750 align:middle line:84%
But that's not based on any
radiocarbon analysis at all.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.390 align:middle line:90%
It's a supposition.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.940 align:middle line:84%
So we're the only ones who
have been able to actually do

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.710 align:middle line:90%
radiocarbon testing.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And the results that we
have been able to get

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.450 align:middle line:90%
do fit into that timeline.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.410 align:middle line:84%
The oldest one that we've
been able to radiocarbon test

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.340 align:middle line:90%
is around 2,400 years old.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.990 align:middle line:84%
So that's near the beginning of
the so-called Paracas period.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.530 align:middle line:84%
Again, among the original
elongated skulls,

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.160 align:middle line:84%
which we believe were born
with elongated skulls,

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.120 align:middle line:84%
they have eye sockets which are
probably 50% larger than normal

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.300 align:middle line:84%
and are more
vertically elongated.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.800 align:middle line:90%
Also, the jaw, the lower jaw--

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.340 align:middle line:84%
the mandible-- is much
larger than normal.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And then, there are
also these two holes

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.350 align:middle line:84%
in the back of the
skull here, which

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.300 align:middle line:90%
are a genetic characteristic.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.640 align:middle line:10%
And what they
probably indicate is

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.710 align:middle line:10%
that was for blood
and nerve flow

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.260 align:middle line:10%
in order to properly
feed and nourish

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.290 align:middle line:10%
the vertically elongated head.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:29.360 align:middle line:10%
>> In every single case, these
elongated skulls are different

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.160 align:middle line:10%
from normal human beings.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.110 align:middle line:90%
For so long, the experts--

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.530 align:middle line:84%
the archaeologists,
the anthropologists--

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:43.070 align:middle line:84%
have told us that these skulls
were created by human beings

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.780 align:middle line:84%
by pushing the brain when
the person was a child

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.260 align:middle line:84%
and deforming the
skull-- the head.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.090 align:middle line:84%
But now we know,
through analysis of DNA,

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:01.160 align:middle line:90%
they are not similar to us.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Radiocarbon testing has
dated the oldest elongated skull

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.350 align:middle line:84%
to approximately
2,400 years old.

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:14.300 align:middle line:84%
That's the beginning of the
so-called Paracas period.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.900 align:middle line:84%
>> The intriguing thing about
the fact that the earliest

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:18.920 align:middle line:90%
elongated skulls--

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.860 align:middle line:90%
almost if not 100% of them--

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.280 align:middle line:84%
they show that they had,
while they were alive,

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.820 align:middle line:90%
a very rich, dark reddish hair.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And that is not a Native
American characteristic.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.690 align:middle line:84%
That's another suggestion of
migration from somewhere else.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.520 align:middle line:84%
Most people think
of red hair as being

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.950 align:middle line:84%
the characteristic
of Scandinavians

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.500 align:middle line:84%
or Irish people or
Scottish people.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.260 align:middle line:84%
But, in fact, it goes
back to the Middle East.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's somewhat
in the area where

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:54.680 align:middle line:84%
we're starting to see a genetic
DNA relationship, as well.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.380 align:middle line:84%
Two major hair experts
studying hundreds

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.950 align:middle line:84%
of samples of
Paracas red hair have

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.970 align:middle line:84%
stated that black hair
always remains black.

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:07.580 align:middle line:84%
Red hair, of course,
over the course of time,

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.280 align:middle line:90%
can lighten to blondish.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.890 align:middle line:84%
That is a genetic
characteristic that

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:17.150 align:middle line:84%
doesn't fit in with
standard history

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.540 align:middle line:84%
of Native American people
of the coast of Peru.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
is none of the skulls

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.010 align:middle line:84%
that we've examined
show canine teeth.

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:33.770 align:middle line:84%
So they don't have the canine,
predatory, meat-eating tooth

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:34.580 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.910 align:middle line:84%
They're all quite normal,
or regular looking.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:40.220 align:middle line:10%
And that's an anomaly.

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, the basic
characteristics that

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.560 align:middle line:84%
distinguish cranial deformation
from a natural skull

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.930 align:middle line:90%
is the lack of the suture line.

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:50.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking
about a partial lack.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.590 align:middle line:90%
It's non-existent.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:58.230 align:middle line:84%
>> In a normal human
skull, the sagittal suture,

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:01.880 align:middle line:84%
which is a connective tissue
joint between the two parietal

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.290 align:middle line:84%
bones of the skull, appears from
the frontal plate and continues

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:10.190 align:middle line:84%
over the dome of the skull,
connecting with the occipital

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.230 align:middle line:90%
plate in the rear.

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:14.690 align:middle line:84%
Many of the skulls
discovered in Paracas,

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:19.520 align:middle line:84%
however, are completely
devoid of a sagittal suture.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.060 align:middle line:84%
Might this be a genetic
anomaly of a human being

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:27.170 align:middle line:84%
or point to other possibilities
worth considering?

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:32.450 align:middle line:10%
>> We performed analysis
on the skull volume--

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:33.650 align:middle line:10%
the size of the skulls--

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:37.580 align:middle line:10%
as compared to humans.

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:42.409 align:middle line:84%
The skulls had a larger
volume than human skulls--

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:44.640 align:middle line:90%
slightly larger volume.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.770 align:middle line:84%
The morphology of
the skull plates--

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:55.460 align:middle line:84%
so there's sutures that are
very well evident on a cranium--

00:08:55.460 --> 00:09:00.800 align:middle line:84%
the sutures where the two
plates of the cranial skull

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:06.110 align:middle line:84%
come together were different
in the elongated skulls.

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:11.390 align:middle line:10%
So we were able to document all
these morphological differences

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:15.110 align:middle line:10%
with the skulls
and then, as well,

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:21.440 align:middle line:10%
able to perform a DNA
extraction of tissue samples

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.370 align:middle line:10%
from both of the skulls.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.790 align:middle line:10%
>> While intentional cranial
modification changes the shape

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:31.160 align:middle line:10%
of the skull, the
question remains--

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.050 align:middle line:10%
would it alter
other features that

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:36.650 align:middle line:10%
are characteristic of
a regular human skull?

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:40.100 align:middle line:84%
>> It's mainly in the skull
characteristics that we find

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.040 align:middle line:84%
these massive anomalies,
including what's called

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.330 align:middle line:90%
the foramen magnum.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And that is where your
spinal column enters

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.230 align:middle line:90%
the bottom of your skull.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:51.230 align:middle line:84%
In the original elongated
skulls of this area,

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.540 align:middle line:84%
the foramen magnum
is a full 1 inch

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.760 align:middle line:84%
back from where
it's supposed to be.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.940 align:middle line:84%
Because with us, of course,
it's at the balance point,

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.590 align:middle line:90%
so it's almost in the center.

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:05.030 align:middle line:84%
But the original Paracas, it's
basically 1 inch backwards.

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And that matches with the
vertical elongated skull

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.550 align:middle line:90%
characteristic.

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>> They are human mutations
because we have a fetus with

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:16.280 align:middle line:90%
an elongated skull.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:21.680 align:middle line:84%
We have the hole that joins
the heads to the spine

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:28.850 align:middle line:84%
is moved backwards more
than one centimeter.

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:29.930 align:middle line:90%
That is not possible.

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:33.350 align:middle line:84%
If you do that with a
human being, you kill it.

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:36.620 align:middle line:90%
The foramen hole is moved.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And that proves that this is not
the same kind of human beings.

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:44.420 align:middle line:84%
>> When intentional cranial
modification is carried out

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:48.560 align:middle line:84%
on a baby, the head binding
usually begins a month after

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.410 align:middle line:84%
birth, when the head
is most pliable,

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:55.070 align:middle line:84%
and continues for
six months or longer.

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:58.100 align:middle line:84%
Previous discoveries
of fetuses and newborns

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.780 align:middle line:84%
with an elongated
head suggests that

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:05.010 align:middle line:84%
intentional cranial modification
could not have taken place,

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:07.680 align:middle line:84%
since it takes at least
six months to modify

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:12.370 align:middle line:84%
the shape of its head to
produce the desired results.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:16.230 align:middle line:10%
>> So if you deform the head,
you can get it to be more

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:21.990 align:middle line:10%
conic, but you won't be able
to get it to change its volume.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:27.870 align:middle line:84%
>> We've had many doctors,
many nurses, many dentists,

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:32.340 align:middle line:84%
and even brain specialists and
brain surgeons and people like

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:36.120 align:middle line:84%
that, physically come
and look at the skulls.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:40.050 align:middle line:10%
And again, what
most of them say is,

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:41.760 align:middle line:10%
that's not something
that I studied

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.800 align:middle line:10%
in medical school,
especially the lack

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:48.690 align:middle line:10%
of the sagittal suture, the
fact that the eye sockets are

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:51.930 align:middle line:10%
at least 50% larger
than normal, the two

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:54.360 align:middle line:10%
holes in the back of
the skull, and the fact

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.090 align:middle line:10%
that the foramen magnum
is a full 1 inch back.

00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:00.850 align:middle line:10%
That can't be explained through
head binding or anything

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:01.650 align:middle line:10%
like that.

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:03.210 align:middle line:90%
That has to be genetic.

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:07.980 align:middle line:84%
That's proof positive, according
to medical experts that I've

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:10.830 align:middle line:84%
shown that discovery
to, that these were not

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:12.480 align:middle line:90%
Homo sapiens sapiens.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:19.260 align:middle line:84%
At minimum, they were a
subspecies of Homo sapiens.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of these skulls
are very well preserved.

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:25.950 align:middle line:84%
There's hairs, and there's skin,
and there's tissue in them.

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And so they're
fairly easy to test.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And so the age of
the remains was given

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:38.100 align:middle line:90%
but not the DNA analysis.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And so I was
fortunate enough to be

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:45.360 align:middle line:84%
able to get samples
and send them

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.780 align:middle line:90%
to universities to do analysis.

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Tissue samples taken from
two of the Paracas skulls

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:57.490 align:middle line:84%
by geneticist William Brown and
scientist Nassim Haramein were

00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:02.860 align:middle line:84%
given to the UCLA Center for
Genomic and Bioinformatics lab.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:06.280 align:middle line:84%
Ancient DNA extraction
was performed.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:13.210 align:middle line:10%
And by early 2019, they started
analyzing the whole genome.

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>> We have preliminary results
from the testing we've done,

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:22.810 align:middle line:84%
and it appears to have anomalies
that are very interesting.

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:26.890 align:middle line:10%
Some of the anomalies that
we're finding in the testing

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:30.610 align:middle line:10%
is making us think
that they could be--

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:36.970 align:middle line:10%
a significant possibility
that these are--

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:43.930 align:middle line:10%
the result of some kind of
different species, at least,

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:46.985 align:middle line:10%
than the Homo sapiens sapiens.

00:13:46.985 --> 00:13:49.750 align:middle line:10%


00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:53.920 align:middle line:10%
>> The 1000 Genomes Project
is the largest public catalog

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.830 align:middle line:10%
of human variation
and genotype data.

00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:00.040 align:middle line:84%
Initial genetic test results
of the Paracas skulls

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:04.390 align:middle line:84%
relative to this genome
catalog reveals a large degree

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:06.460 align:middle line:90%
of gene variation.

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:11.290 align:middle line:84%
What this indicates is either
non-random changes in the DNA

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:16.540 align:middle line:84%
or a high degree of genetic
divergence from Homo sapiens.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.300 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps even more
fascinating is the analysis

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:24.280 align:middle line:84%
done with a John Hopkins Deep
Sequencing Genomics Core.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:28.180 align:middle line:10%
No alignment or match to
the human reference genome

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.380 align:middle line:10%
was found.

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:33.460 align:middle line:84%
Could these DNA samples from
the Paracas elongated skulls

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:36.145 align:middle line:84%
possibly come from an
extinct race of people?

00:14:36.145 --> 00:14:38.930 align:middle line:90%


00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:42.670 align:middle line:10%
>> Mostly, we've done the
analysis on the mitochondrial

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:50.500 align:middle line:10%
DNA, which shows some
significant variations that may

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:54.280 align:middle line:10%
suggest that, at least
on the mother's side,

00:14:54.280 --> 00:15:00.400 align:middle line:10%
there was some alteration of the
genome structure that makes us

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:07.990 align:middle line:10%
think that it might have been
a sister species from the Homo

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:09.670 align:middle line:10%
sapiens sapiens--

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:13.090 align:middle line:10%
something similar but
not quite the same.

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know where those
genes would have come from.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.880 align:middle line:10%
>> The standard story, again,
from academics is that all

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.990 align:middle line:10%
of the people of this area were
descended from people whose

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:28.240 align:middle line:10%
ancestors crossed the
Bering Land Bridge.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.930 align:middle line:10%
And if that was the case,
then the maternal haplogroup,

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:36.520 align:middle line:10%
which is the mother's DNA,
would be haplogroup B.

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:40.600 align:middle line:10%
Because only four bloodlines, or
haplogroups, crossed the Bering

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:44.440 align:middle line:10%
Land Bridge, as far as we know,
to get to this general area.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:49.060 align:middle line:10%
And those are haplogroups
A, B, C, and D,

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:54.430 align:middle line:10%
with B being the far
most prominent one.

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:58.570 align:middle line:10%
>> A haplogroup is a genetic
population group of people who

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:03.100 align:middle line:10%
share a common ancestor on the
paternal or maternal lineage.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.650 align:middle line:10%
Haplogroups are assigned
letters of the alphabet,

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:09.160 align:middle line:10%
and refinements consist of
additional number and letter

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.470 align:middle line:10%
combinations.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:15.670 align:middle line:10%
>> So we did that analysis,
and we traced the mitochondrial

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:22.600 align:middle line:10%
genome of these two elongated
skulls to the haplogroup that

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:27.730 align:middle line:10%
most closely compares to the
mitochondrial DNA of the two

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:33.580 align:middle line:10%
elongated skulls is in the Black
Sea region of Central Asia.

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:41.680 align:middle line:84%
So this particular haplogroup
is most strongly represented

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.230 align:middle line:84%
in this region
around the Black Sea.

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's very interesting
because, in that region,

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:51.800 align:middle line:90%
you find elongated skulls.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:55.010 align:middle line:84%
>> You don't have genetic
adaptation in 2,000 or 3,000

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:57.170 align:middle line:90%
or even 10,000 years.

00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:00.270 align:middle line:84%
You're talking probably
hundreds of thousands of years.

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:04.339 align:middle line:84%
So you have this sudden
rise of similar culture,

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:12.500 align:middle line:84%
or "similar-looking" people,
quote unquote, in very distant,

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:13.940 align:middle line:90%
separate lands.

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:18.950 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't fit in with
evolution as we know it--

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:22.550 align:middle line:84%
a sudden appearance and
then a rapid disappearance

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:24.510 align:middle line:90%
of these people.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:30.090 align:middle line:10%
>> It's very unusual
because in South America,

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:34.920 align:middle line:10%
you very rarely or never find
that particular mitochondrial

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.390 align:middle line:10%
haplotype.

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:42.120 align:middle line:84%
But these elongated skulls,
that's where they mapped to.

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And so what that would suggest
is that the maternal lineage--

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:51.600 align:middle line:84%
the mother's side--
came, in whatever way,

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.090 align:middle line:90%
from that geographic region.

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:59.460 align:middle line:84%
These skulls, the
mitochondrial genome from them,

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:05.610 align:middle line:84%
had upwards of 50 single
nucleotide variants,

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:09.060 align:middle line:84%
so more than double
the amount you normally

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:14.160 align:middle line:84%
see in the human
population anywhere.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:19.680 align:middle line:84%
For comparison, a Neanderthal
mitochondrial genome,

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:22.350 align:middle line:84%
compared to humans,
has about 150

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:28.590 align:middle line:84%
or more single nucleotide
variants, the Denisovan lineage

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:31.200 align:middle line:90%
230 or more.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And so the mother might be
a sister species to human.

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:45.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, at what point do you call
something a separate species?

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:49.500 align:middle line:84%
But the mitochondrial
DNA on the mother's side

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:53.970 align:middle line:84%
is not closely related to
any extant human populations,

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:55.710 align:middle line:90%
either.

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:59.760 align:middle line:10%
>> If DNA sequencing derived
from these elongated skulls

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:03.210 align:middle line:10%
reveal anomalies relating
to the maternal lineage,

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:07.110 align:middle line:10%
then what was uncovered
from the paternal lineage?

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:13.050 align:middle line:84%
>> What you have is a Y
chromosome that is not matching

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:14.940 align:middle line:90%
to the human reference genome.

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:21.265 align:middle line:84%
Y chromosome, suggesting
that the father was not Homo

00:19:21.265 --> 00:19:22.065 align:middle line:90%
sapiens.

00:19:22.065 --> 00:19:24.620 align:middle line:90%


00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And if that was the case,
it would go a long way

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:34.430 align:middle line:84%
in explaining why we detected
such a high degree of variation

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:36.740 align:middle line:90%
in the rest of the genome.

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:44.585 align:middle line:10%
Because this variation is
coming from a not entirely Homo

00:19:44.585 --> 00:19:47.130 align:middle line:10%
sapiens father.

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:48.830 align:middle line:90%
>> This is very unusual.

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:52.610 align:middle line:84%
It's very unclear
where and what.

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:55.730 align:middle line:84%
If there was a cross
between different species

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:59.750 align:middle line:84%
that produced this
elongated skull feature,

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:02.040 align:middle line:90%
what was the other species?

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we get a
better understanding

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:11.330 align:middle line:84%
of the nuclear DNA of the
father's side of the equation,

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:14.820 align:middle line:84%
we might get a little
more of these answers.

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:21.200 align:middle line:10%
But preliminary results
show that the father's side,

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:27.080 align:middle line:10%
the nuclear DNA, is
less related to human

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:33.000 align:middle line:10%
than a banana, which
a banana is about 40%

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.080 align:middle line:10%
the same sequencing as humans.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.790 align:middle line:90%
What it's looking like--

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:41.780 align:middle line:84%
very preliminary-- it
doesn't even have 40%

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:44.420 align:middle line:84%
match to the Homo
sapiens sapiens.

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:47.210 align:middle line:90%


00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:50.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Might the anomalous test
results reveal from the DNA

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:54.440 align:middle line:84%
of the Paracas elongated skulls
be evidence of another species

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.850 align:middle line:90%
of humans?

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:59.300 align:middle line:84%
Or is it possible that some
kind of genetic tampering

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.670 align:middle line:90%
has taken place?

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:09.350 align:middle line:10%
>> If it's a kind of mutation
that you don't naturally see,

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:14.630 align:middle line:10%
that means that it's suggestive
that the changes were directed

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:17.630 align:middle line:10%
by an intelligent agent.

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:23.900 align:middle line:84%
So I could produce that
kind of ratio of changes

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:28.820 align:middle line:84%
by directly engineering
or influencing

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:32.900 align:middle line:90%
the genome of an organism.

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.840 align:middle line:84%
>> These highly strange
anomalies are not unique

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:39.230 align:middle line:90%
to the Paracas elongated skulls.

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:43.040 align:middle line:84%
In the Nazca region of
Peru, Gaia investigators

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:46.070 align:middle line:84%
uncovered a female,
mummified humanoid

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:48.080 align:middle line:90%
that the team named Maria.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:53.390 align:middle line:84%
She also had an elongated
skull with mysterious DNA.

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:59.450 align:middle line:10%
>> It is interesting because
the DNA analysis for Maria had

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:07.100 align:middle line:10%
a 20% matching homology to
the human reference genome.

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:10.580 align:middle line:84%
That's what we saw
with the Y chromosome

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:13.400 align:middle line:90%
for the elongated skulls.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.470 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:19.790 align:middle line:84%
I could offer some
speculation on that.

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:24.590 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the father
looked more like Maria,

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:28.880 align:middle line:90%
by that kind of hominid form.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:35.060 align:middle line:84%
That would be in agreement with
the similarity between only 20%

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:37.160 align:middle line:84%
matches up with the
human reference genome,

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:40.370 align:middle line:84%
just like what was
seen with Maria.

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:43.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Other medical
specialists examined Maria.

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:45.260 align:middle line:84%
What they observed
were anomalies

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:48.320 align:middle line:84%
similar to those from
the Paracas region.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:52.550 align:middle line:10%
Dr. MK Jesse, a
musculoskeletal radiologist

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:55.790 align:middle line:10%
at the University of
Colorado Hospital in Denver,

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:57.920 align:middle line:10%
looked at the scans.

00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>> The shape of the
skull is interesting.

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:06.500 align:middle line:84%
It's very elongated, an atypical
appearance of a human skull

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:08.270 align:middle line:90%
like you and I know.

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:13.340 align:middle line:84%
The skull, I don't
see any suture lines.

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.920 align:middle line:84%
There's no bones that are
separate in the skull.

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.540 align:middle line:90%
They all appear fused.

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:22.370 align:middle line:84%
So this appears to
be a solid structure.

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:26.690 align:middle line:10%
>> If the CAT scans and X-rays
proved it was organic bone

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:29.240 align:middle line:10%
and the bones didn't
seem to be altered,

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:32.420 align:middle line:10%
could this be evidence
of a new species?

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:36.260 align:middle line:84%
Angel Romero, a genomic
specialist from Mexico,

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:40.220 align:middle line:90%
seems to think that may be so.

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:43.400 align:middle line:84%
>> I have to say that this
sample contains DNA that we

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.180 align:middle line:90%
currently don't know.

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:48.440 align:middle line:84%
It could be from an organism
that has not been studied.

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps there was some
microbiological contamination

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:53.090 align:middle line:90%
of the samples.

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:56.960 align:middle line:10%
But it could also be original
DNA from these bodies.

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.450 align:middle line:84%
That means that these bodies
could belong to a previously

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:01.490 align:middle line:90%
unknown species.

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:05.720 align:middle line:84%
>> What the DNA results reveal
from the Nazca mummy, Maria,

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.900 align:middle line:84%
are striking anomalies similar
to those from the Paracas

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.060 align:middle line:90%
samples.

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:19.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Of the DNA that was isolated,
only 25% of the total matched

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:23.610 align:middle line:10%
any known human gene.

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:28.640 align:middle line:84%
So that means that
75% of this DNA

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:34.240 align:middle line:84%
is not matching any known
human reference sequence.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is pretty rigorous
because there's the 1000 Human

00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:45.710 align:middle line:84%
Genome Project, where they
have done whole genome

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:48.920 align:middle line:84%
sequencing of over
2,000 individuals

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:52.910 align:middle line:84%
from every continent
on Earth and compiled

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:57.240 align:middle line:84%
kind of like a average
human reference genome.

00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And so you take these sequences
isolated from the sample

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:05.720 align:middle line:84%
with this being, and you
go and you compare them

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:12.660 align:middle line:84%
to that human reference genome
data, and only 25% match up.

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:14.370 align:middle line:90%
75% don't.

[WHOOSH]

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:19.860 align:middle line:10%
>> The initial question we asked
of gene sequencing laboratories

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:23.370 align:middle line:10%
in Canada, Mexico,
and Russia was,

00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:28.500 align:middle line:10%
does this DNA match any
modern human DNA or any DNA

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.300 align:middle line:10%
in their data banks?

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:33.990 align:middle line:84%
The answer from all
three labs was, no.

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>> We know about the carbon-14
analysis that Maria is 1,700

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:40.020 align:middle line:90%
years old.

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:43.110 align:middle line:84%
We know that the
structure of the body

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:45.070 align:middle line:90%
is not similar to human beings.

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:49.860 align:middle line:10%
We know that the
head is elongated,

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:52.410 align:middle line:10%
that the eyes were
bigger than Os.

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:55.980 align:middle line:84%
That's more or less
what we know of Maria.

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.920 align:middle line:84%
>> While remarkably similar
anomalies are found in both

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:06.090 align:middle line:84%
Nazca and Paracas, the question
remains, what might these be?

00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:08.520 align:middle line:84%
>> When we examine
these larger, natural,

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:12.120 align:middle line:84%
genetic specimens of elongated
skulls we find in Paracas

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.940 align:middle line:84%
of Peru, we have
to ask ourselves,

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:19.710 align:middle line:84%
could this larger brain capacity
be the product of beings that

00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:21.420 align:middle line:90%
never evolved here?

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:24.540 align:middle line:10%
I tend to think that's the
case, especially when we look

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:28.050 align:middle line:10%
at the differences
between the Paracas skulls

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:31.140 align:middle line:10%
and even the Incan
royalty, who exhibited

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:34.290 align:middle line:10%
various genetic abnormalities.

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:39.420 align:middle line:84%

extraterrestrials had sex with

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:40.260 align:middle line:90%
humans--

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:41.370 align:middle line:90%
definitely.

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:42.750 align:middle line:90%
Just read the Bible.

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:45.030 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, when
the sons of the gods

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:47.730 align:middle line:84%
saw that the daughters
of man were beauty,

00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:49.450 align:middle line:90%
they took them to wife.

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:50.970 align:middle line:90%
Which sons of the gods?

00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:52.620 align:middle line:10%
There are no sons of the gods.

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:54.030 align:middle line:10%
God has no sons.

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:55.620 align:middle line:10%
It was the extraterrestrials.

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:57.240 align:middle line:10%
Read the Book of Enoch.

00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:02.010 align:middle line:84%
The Book of Enoch gives the name
of the guardians of the sky.

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And 36 of them went
down to the planet Earth

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:09.420 align:middle line:84%
and they had, definitely,
sex with humans, which is

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:11.430 align:middle line:90%
written in the Book of Enoch.

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:13.830 align:middle line:90%
And the result were Giants.

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:17.040 align:middle line:10%
And the Giants had
elongated heads.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.095 align:middle line:10%
That's why the
humans adored them.

00:27:19.095 --> 00:27:21.300 align:middle line:10%
The humans were afraid of them.

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:23.220 align:middle line:10%
Later, the humans copied it.

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.350 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to look like them.

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:28.500 align:middle line:84%
There was definitely
a sexual contact

traditional academia

the elongated heads and what it

much smaller stature--

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:51.400 align:middle line:84%
that this change
happened as a result

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:53.620 align:middle line:84%

we know for sure

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:42.570 align:middle line:90%
star system?

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:45.750 align:middle line:84%
My mind and my heart
and my body and spirit

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:48.000 align:middle line:90%
are open to those possibilities.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.480 align:middle line:84%
Because they are
such an anomaly.

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:53.760 align:middle line:10%
Were their ancestors alien?

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.050 align:middle line:10%
It's possible.

00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:57.660 align:middle line:10%
Were they, to some
degree, alien?

00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:59.100 align:middle line:10%
That's possible.

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:04.380 align:middle line:10%
Were they a hybrid of human
and some closely related life

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:07.260 align:middle line:10%
form from this planet or beyond?

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:08.980 align:middle line:90%
That we don't know.

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:12.600 align:middle line:84%
But what we do know
definitively is they were not

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:15.400 align:middle line:90%
Homo sapiens sapiens.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's entirely
possible that this progenitor

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:22.800 align:middle line:84%
group with elongated skulls
had bred and intermingled with

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:25.290 align:middle line:84%
various groups of
ancient peoples.

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And as time went on and this
lineage started to dissipate,

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.140 align:middle line:90%
it was mimicked.

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:34.770 align:middle line:84%
It was copied with the
artificial deformation.

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And this group may
have disappeared

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:38.160 align:middle line:90%
into the background.

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:41.130 align:middle line:84%
They may have gone home to
whatever planet they came from.

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:44.010 align:middle line:84%
But one thing is for
certain, that they were here

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:44.880 align:middle line:90%
on our planet.

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:49.860 align:middle line:84%
They influenced our cultures,
our religions, our art.

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:53.670 align:middle line:90%
And they made a gigantic impact.

00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:56.760 align:middle line:84%
>> It is without doubt that
humans around the world

00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:00.540 align:middle line:84%
practiced intentional cranial
modification to venerate

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:03.180 align:middle line:84%
ancient beings of
advanced culture.

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:05.220 align:middle line:90%
But who were they venerating?

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:07.440 align:middle line:10%
Could the people of
Europe or the Middle East

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:11.220 align:middle line:10%
have migrated to the Americas
long before it's conventionally

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:13.080 align:middle line:10%
believed?

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:16.470 align:middle line:84%
Is it not as likely that
the unusual characteristics

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:19.260 align:middle line:84%
of the Paracas skulls
may possibly be

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:22.140 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial in origin?

00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:26.310 align:middle line:84%
When DNA testing reveals
characteristics that cannot be

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:28.740 align:middle line:84%
identified in a
worldwide database,

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:31.560 align:middle line:90%
does this prove the case?

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:36.030 align:middle line:84%
As ongoing efforts to examine
the elongated skulls continue,

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:39.390 align:middle line:84%
perhaps one day we may
trace our human origins

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:41.010 align:middle line:90%
to our cosmic family.
