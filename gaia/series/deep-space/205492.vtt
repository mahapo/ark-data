>> We live in a fantastic
world where curiosity

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.710 align:middle line:84%
and perseverance are rewarded
with knowledge and wisdom.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And for millennia,
humanity has attempted

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.380 align:middle line:84%
to correctly
identify and describe

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.050 align:middle line:90%
the true nature of reality.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.770 align:middle line:84%
One theory currently competing
for preeminence in this quest

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.860 align:middle line:90%
is the plasma universe model.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Plasma universe theory is
an alternative cosmology

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.790 align:middle line:84%
which posits that the
dynamics of plasmas

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.280 align:middle line:84%
play an important,
if not dominant, role

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.340 align:middle line:84%
in the fundamental physics
of the universe, which

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.600 align:middle line:84%
may be eternal and infinite,
directly contradicting the Big

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.940 align:middle line:90%
Bang model.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.370 align:middle line:84%
Does plasma play a
more significant role

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.170 align:middle line:90%
than is generally accepted?

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.890 align:middle line:84%
And if so, will that lead
to a unique understanding

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.420 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves and our
place in the universe?

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.820 align:middle line:90%
>> We're aware of solid matter.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.980 align:middle line:90%
We're aware of liquids.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.080 align:middle line:90%
We're aware of gases.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.080 align:middle line:90%
But plasma is beyond that.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.740 align:middle line:84%
Plasma is the fourth
state of matter.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.590 align:middle line:10%
And essentially what it
is is if you take a gas

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.210 align:middle line:10%
and fracture it through
heat, it breaks up

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.550 align:middle line:10%
the atoms that form the gas.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And when this happens,
the electrons break free.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And when they break
free, they start getting

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.610 align:middle line:90%
excited and they emit photons.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.220 align:middle line:84%
These are small
particles of light

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.280 align:middle line:90%
which illuminate everything.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And as this happens,
more and more electrons

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.340 align:middle line:84%
break free of the atoms,
bump into each other,

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.870 align:middle line:84%
create almost like
a chain reaction.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And as this occurs, they produce
their own magnetic fields.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.380 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, they're
getting bigger and bigger,

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.780 align:middle line:84%
these seas of electrons, until
eventually you can actually see

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.000 align:middle line:90%
plasma as like a bowl of light.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.030 align:middle line:90%


00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.970 align:middle line:10%
>> The Northern Lights are a
really good example of this

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.000 align:middle line:10%
solar energy, this energy
coming in from our sun,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.630 align:middle line:10%
which comes as these
bursts of plasma energy.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.420 align:middle line:10%
And as that energy
from our sun comes in,

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.540 align:middle line:10%
and it hits the magnetic
field of the earth,

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.420 align:middle line:10%
it spirals it down through
those magnetic lines.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And it shows up as these
beautiful lights and colors

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.590 align:middle line:84%
as different photons come
off from that spiraling

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.200 align:middle line:84%
motion of that plasma coming
in around the magnetic field

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.000 align:middle line:90%
lines.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.180 align:middle line:90%


00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>> In the plasma universe, deep
space is permeated with giant

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.140 align:middle line:90%
filaments of electrons and ions.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.840 align:middle line:84%
These filaments twist
together in space

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.300 align:middle line:90%
due to electromagnetic forces.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And some of their vast energy
is then converted into matter.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And new galaxies are
the eventual result.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.440 align:middle line:84%
The intricate spiral
arms of galaxies

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.890 align:middle line:84%
are said to reveal further
interactions of the plasma

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.940 align:middle line:90%
filaments.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.710 align:middle line:84%
>> The universe,
we could say, is,

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.310 align:middle line:84%
for all intents and
purposes, plasma.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:50.040 align:middle line:10%
So plasma is a very
interesting state of matter.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.280 align:middle line:84%
So basically we first realized
matter clearly can be solid

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.240 align:middle line:90%
and then clearly can be liquid.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.160 align:middle line:84%
These are two different
phases of matter.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.350 align:middle line:90%
And then it can be a gas.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Later we discovered,
OK, it can be a gas.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And then those are
third state of matter.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually,
we realize when

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.790 align:middle line:84%
there's enough
energy in a gas, it

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.490 align:middle line:84%
becomes a different
state of matter

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:19.850 align:middle line:84%
that we call plasma,
which is a gas that

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.160 align:middle line:90%
has a lot of electrons in it.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.870 align:middle line:90%
And that's very energized.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And when it's in that
state, it behaves

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.390 align:middle line:84%
a little bit like a gas,
a little bit like a fluid,

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.640 align:middle line:90%
and a little bit like a solid.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.710 align:middle line:84%
It has all these
different elements in it.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.470 align:middle line:90%
So it's its own state.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:42.470 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, the universe is
made out of 99.999% plasma.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And the rest, that's
not plasma, is basically

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.450 align:middle line:90%
plasma that's cooled off.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's made things
that are more like what we

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.290 align:middle line:90%
call solids, fluids, and gases.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:01.950 align:middle line:84%
What we're discovering is
that plasma has all kinds

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.190 align:middle line:90%
of self-organizing behaviors.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:12.090 align:middle line:84%
It suggests that there is
a information flow that's

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.260 align:middle line:84%
going through the system
so that the system will

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.650 align:middle line:84%
tend to certain
organizing principle.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.960 align:middle line:84%
For instance, we're discovering
that vortices in the plasma

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.850 align:middle line:84%
can organize to make very
specific crystalline geometry.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And so that plasma can
self-organize and create

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.100 align:middle line:90%
very specific dynamics.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Self-organization is
an example of the concept

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.420 align:middle line:84%
of emergence, which occurs when
an entity is observed to have

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.050 align:middle line:84%
properties its parts do
not have on their own,

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.650 align:middle line:84%
properties or behaviors which
emerge only when the parts

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.150 align:middle line:90%
interact.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:06:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Self-organization occurs in many
physical, chemical, biological,

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.540 align:middle line:90%
robotic, and cognitive systems.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.320 align:middle line:84%
It is often triggered by
seemingly random fluctuations

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.280 align:middle line:84%
which can be conceptualized
as islands of predictability

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.900 align:middle line:84%
in a sea of chaotic
unpredictability.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.160 align:middle line:84%
>> I love these images from the
Hubble telescope that show us

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.440 align:middle line:84%
how there's all this plasma
and energy connecting from

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.210 align:middle line:84%
different nebulae to galaxies
and super clusters of galaxies.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And as you scan back and see
the whole infrastructure,

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.910 align:middle line:84%
that whole network, it
is like an organism.

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's all connected
throughout the universe.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And the more we look at
those images from Hubble,

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.580 align:middle line:84%
it shows us how
the similar images

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.490 align:middle line:84%
that we see of
that infrastructure

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.980 align:middle line:84%
resembles the
neurons in our brain.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.690 align:middle line:84%
It resembles the circulatory
system and the blood flow

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.520 align:middle line:90%
system, and all of this.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And the plasma that
flows through our veins,

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.510 align:middle line:84%
there's plasma flowing
through the universe.

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.780 align:middle line:84%
So it is, again, we
are the reflection

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.180 align:middle line:90%
of the whole macrocosm in us.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it's the
other way around.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the macrocosm is a
reflection of our form.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.270 align:middle line:84%
>> This state of energy, you got
to ask where is it coming from?

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:25.540 align:middle line:84%
It's one thing to say, oh, it
all came out of a Big Bang.

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.910 align:middle line:84%
Well the Big Bang
was in a little point

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:31.400 align:middle line:90%
of the Planck scale, right?

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.640 align:middle line:84%
You got to ask,
well, is there more

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.370 align:middle line:84%
of this energy in the
Planck scale everywhere?

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we're discovering

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:44.420 align:middle line:84%
is that actually the plasma
we see in the universe

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:50.240 align:middle line:84%
is actually coming from
a deeper level or a finer

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:55.220 align:middle line:84%
level of plasma that we could
call the Planck plasma, which

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:59.960 align:middle line:84%
is Planck particles
oscillating like a plasma

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.610 align:middle line:84%
but billions of times
smaller than the atom.

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:09.380 align:middle line:10%
Meaning that that grain
resolution of the plasma,

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:13.940 align:middle line:10%
the grain frequency of
the plasma, is so small

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:18.470 align:middle line:10%
and the frequency so high
we can't tell it's there.

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.350 align:middle line:10%
We're discovering it now.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's really a Planck
plasma at the base

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:32.179 align:middle line:84%
of the structure of space from
which the more gross plasma,

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:35.419 align:middle line:84%
the more larger
grained plasma that

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:38.330 align:middle line:84%
are made of protons, and
electrons, and all this,

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:43.340 align:middle line:84%
emerged from to
produce our universe.

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:46.850 align:middle line:10%
>> While debate on the validity
and significance of the plasma

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:51.080 align:middle line:10%
universe theory continues, some
scientists like physicists Wal

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.410 align:middle line:10%
Thornhill have developed
distinct but complementary

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:57.650 align:middle line:10%
theories which share some
similarities with plasma

00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:59.420 align:middle line:10%
universe concepts.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.330 align:middle line:84%
Based on observation
and experiment,

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.970 align:middle line:84%
the electric universe
model unifies

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:08.930 align:middle line:84%
the nuclear forces,
magnetism and gravity,

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:11.435 align:middle line:84%
as manifestations of
an electric force.

00:09:11.435 --> 00:09:15.270 align:middle line:90%


00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:18.180 align:middle line:10%
>> The standard model of
cosmology is based on the idea

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:23.070 align:middle line:10%
that gravity is the controlling
force in the universe.

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:26.220 align:middle line:10%
The electric universe
takes a different view.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And that is it is the electric
force and the electric force

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:34.320 align:middle line:84%
alone which governs not only the
universe, but also everything

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.030 align:middle line:90%
within it, including us.

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:38.580 align:middle line:84%
The electric universe
has a different picture

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.080 align:middle line:84%
of the connection
between all things,

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.560 align:middle line:84%
both at the biological
level right down

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.850 align:middle line:84%
to the subatomic,
which is not recognized

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:53.870 align:middle line:90%
by present-day science.

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>> So the electric
universe theory,

00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:02.960 align:middle line:84%
take for account the electric
nature of plasma interaction

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.430 align:middle line:90%
in our universe.

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:06.560 align:middle line:10%
For instance, we
know that there is

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:10.610 align:middle line:10%
very strong electric
filaments that

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.580 align:middle line:10%
connect the earth and the
sun that are constantly

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:20.630 align:middle line:10%
transferring gigawatts of power
in between planets and stars.

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And this electrical nature
of the plasma dynamics

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:31.730 align:middle line:84%
and the plasma interaction
between systems in our universe

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:35.210 align:middle line:84%
is typically ignored
by current cosmology.

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:39.530 align:middle line:84%
So the electric
universe cosmology

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:44.540 align:middle line:84%
brings this forward as something
fundamental and important

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:49.970 align:middle line:84%
in understanding the dynamics
of our universe and our world.

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:56.060 align:middle line:84%
In itself as well have
the possibility to birth

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.520 align:middle line:84%
a whole new level
of technology where

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:02.510 align:middle line:84%
we're extracting energy
or electricity literally

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:03.870 align:middle line:90%
from our universe.

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And so it has very important
consequences for humanity.

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:14.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Most people think of
electricity as flowing through

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:19.280 align:middle line:84%
wires into appliances
and powering motors,

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.080 align:middle line:90%
lighting the home.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:27.480 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's used for almost
everything in our daily lives.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:33.380 align:middle line:84%
But lightning is also a form
of electric current in plasma.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And that type of behavior, of
lightning, is the kind of thing

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:41.220 align:middle line:90%
that we see in space.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:48.580 align:middle line:84%
That is a form of plasma which
occurs in a more dense medium.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:51.910 align:middle line:84%
What happens is that the
energy in that lightning bolt

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:56.510 align:middle line:84%
is sufficient to strip the
electrons off neutral atoms

00:11:56.510 --> 00:12:00.880 align:middle line:84%
so that they separate
positive and negative charge.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.060 align:middle line:84%
Once you do that,
you have a plasma.

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.630 align:middle line:84%
In space when the
space age began

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:11.080 align:middle line:84%
it was discovered that
space is full of plasma.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.940 align:middle line:84%
Somehow or another,
the universe is

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.700 align:middle line:84%
full of particles
which have been

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.040 align:middle line:90%
separated from their partners.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.500 align:middle line:84%
The electrons and the
protons have separated.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:24.160 align:middle line:84%
Those particles are
now being charged

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.390 align:middle line:84%
subject to the action
of magnetic fields.

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And that means
that their behavior

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.000 align:middle line:84%
is quite different to
that flowing in a wire.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.910 align:middle line:90%


00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:39.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Lightning is one of the
most dramatic manifestations

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:41.320 align:middle line:90%
of plasma.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.630 align:middle line:84%
Due to its free
electrons, plasma

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:46.570 align:middle line:84%
is a good conductor of
electricity, much better

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:49.930 align:middle line:90%
than copper, silver, or gold.

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:52.840 align:middle line:84%
As a thunderstorm
develops, negative charges

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:56.890 align:middle line:84%
accumulate along the cloud
base causing positive charges

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:59.740 align:middle line:90%
to build up on the ground below.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:03.850 align:middle line:10%
The resulting electrical field
between the two concentrations

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:08.230 align:middle line:10%
becomes so strong that
it ionizers the air.

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:12.160 align:middle line:10%
This creates a conducting path
of free electrons and ions,

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.420 align:middle line:10%
a plasma through which
the lightning discharges.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.900 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately for human beings
and other living things,

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.120 align:middle line:84%
plasmas are not
routinely encountered

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.200 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of the earth.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.410 align:middle line:84%
However, we do see
natural plasmas

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:28.900 align:middle line:84%
in the form of
lightning, and auroras,

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.540 align:middle line:84%
and man-made ones most
commonly in the form

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:34.420 align:middle line:90%
of fluorescent light bulbs.

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.570 align:middle line:84%
Farther from the surface,
the earth's magnetosphere

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:40.720 align:middle line:84%
contains plasma, which
is populated by particles

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:44.440 align:middle line:84%
of the solar wind interacting
with ones from the earth's

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.720 align:middle line:90%
upper atmosphere.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.840 align:middle line:84%
If we look at these
systems on a smaller scale,

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:53.470 align:middle line:84%
does plasma manifest in
other forms, perhaps even

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:59.480 align:middle line:84%
as sentient life and impact
our reality in other ways?

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:03.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Some people have had these
encounters with these beings

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.960 align:middle line:84%
who maybe they look like-- some
people describe it as a light

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:07.760 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they think,
oh, it's an angel.

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:13.610 align:middle line:84%
Some people think, oh no, this
is an extraterrestrial, right?

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:17.660 align:middle line:84%
There's these beings who can
manifest and materialize to us.

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And they will work with
these higher frequency

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:25.160 align:middle line:84%
forms of matter, whether it's
light or plasma or just air

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.210 align:middle line:90%
molecules.

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And through their
consciousness, they

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:35.390 align:middle line:84%
will form and shape these
interfaces to this density

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:37.910 align:middle line:84%
so that we can
perceive them in a way

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:41.080 align:middle line:90%
that our senses can detect.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:45.820 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that all of this
is a product of the communion,

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:49.450 align:middle line:84%
the relationship, between
us and this phenomena.

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:53.590 align:middle line:84%
But it's not simply some
kind of slave-like reaction

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:55.690 align:middle line:90%
to our thoughts.

00:14:55.690 --> 00:15:00.100 align:middle line:84%
I think that the intelligences
deliberately choose the form

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.470 align:middle line:90%
that they want us to see them.

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's reflective
upon our beliefs.

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:08.500 align:middle line:10%
It's reflective upon
our religious ideas,

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.920 align:middle line:10%
our cultural beliefs,
and whatever is going on

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.900 align:middle line:10%
at that exact moment.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean if we're in
great fear, the chances

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:20.180 align:middle line:84%
are we would see a
demon or a devil.

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And in the past,
this is exactly what

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:27.160 align:middle line:84%
happened because people would
see these lights in the past

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.680 align:middle line:84%
and they would suddenly
find themselves encountering

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:34.030 align:middle line:84%
fairies, and goblins, and
devils, and things like this.

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:36.610 align:middle line:84%
Clearly we've
updated this today.

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:39.520 align:middle line:84%
We expect to see
extraterrestrials.

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.470 align:middle line:90%
We expect to see aliens.

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And in many cases,
that's what we get.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:48.790 align:middle line:84%
So does that mean that there
are no aliens out there?

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:50.480 align:middle line:90%
Of course not.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:56.020 align:middle line:84%
We know that there are countless
billions of stars out there

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:58.780 align:middle line:90%
and many of those have life.

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And some of that life may
be incredibly intelligent,

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.210 align:middle line:84%
developed
civilizations and could

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:06.700 align:middle line:84%
be millions, if not
billions of years

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:11.050 align:middle line:90%
older than that of our own.

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:13.750 align:middle line:10%
>> I think it is totally
possible that there are

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:17.770 align:middle line:10%
intelligent entities that
are comprised of plasma.

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:20.230 align:middle line:10%
But the reason why
that would be the case

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:24.197 align:middle line:10%
is because they are somehow
super advanced holograms.

00:16:24.197 --> 00:16:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying that that
means that they're not real

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:29.650 align:middle line:84%
or just man-made
or something, I'm

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:32.500 align:middle line:84%
just saying that like if
they are made of plasma,

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.270 align:middle line:84%
it's almost definitely
because they're

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:36.400 align:middle line:84%
part of some sort
of projection rather

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:40.360 align:middle line:84%
than it's some sort of physical
biological substrate of theirs.

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.910 align:middle line:90%


00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:50.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible that sentient
life can exist within plasma?

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:56.700 align:middle line:84%
Plasma itself is simply
a state of matter.

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:59.460 align:middle line:84%
On its own, it's
not intelligent.

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:02.880 align:middle line:84%
However, various
scientific papers

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:07.440 align:middle line:84%
have been written to
suggest that it exists

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:13.349 align:middle line:84%
within a four-dimensional state
or perhaps even higher, five,

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:14.880 align:middle line:90%
11, 22.

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:18.480 align:middle line:84%
Who knows how many
dimensions might be involved?

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:23.910 align:middle line:84%
But because it is
multidimensional in nature,

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:27.569 align:middle line:84%
it allows consciousness
that exists

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:32.880 align:middle line:84%
on a multidimensional level to
enter inside and animate it.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.060 align:middle line:84%
It can almost be
described as like a glove

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:39.060 align:middle line:84%
you would wear on your
hand, for instance.

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:41.520 align:middle line:10%
Before you put it
on, it is simply

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.160 align:middle line:10%
a piece of linen,
or perhaps leather,

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:49.140 align:middle line:10%
or some other material
that is laying on a table.

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:52.140 align:middle line:84%
But when you put
your hand inside it

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:55.990 align:middle line:84%
and start moving it around,
it animates the glove.

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:58.920 align:middle line:84%
It's as if the glove
has come alive.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:03.300 align:middle line:10%
>> In 1923, a young engineer
named Irving Langmuir,

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:06.630 align:middle line:10%
who would go on to win the
Nobel Prize in chemistry,

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:09.060 align:middle line:10%
gave plasma its name.

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:12.000 align:middle line:84%
He borrowed the term
plasma from medicine,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.900 align:middle line:84%
because it exhibited the same
unstable, almost lifelike

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:21.890 align:middle line:84%
behavior of the ionized material
with which he experimented.

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:29.630 align:middle line:10%
>> As far back as the 1960s, the
quantum physicist, David Bohm--

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:34.970 align:middle line:10%
who was working with plasma,
he was observing it and trying

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:38.330 align:middle line:10%
to understand its process--

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:43.970 align:middle line:10%
began to realize that the way
that it moved, the way that it

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:47.000 align:middle line:10%
acted, was very
similar to the way

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.220 align:middle line:10%
that the cells in a biological
system actually worked.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And he began to conceive
of the possibility

00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:00.740 align:middle line:90%
that it might actually be alive.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And the plasma itself
is simply electrons.

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:08.600 align:middle line:90%
So that's not the life itself.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:12.140 align:middle line:84%
But what he came
to the conclusion

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:16.820 align:middle line:84%
was that once I see
if plasma existed,

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:22.010 align:middle line:84%
that it formed a
multidimensional doorway

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:26.030 align:middle line:84%
into a deeper
level of existence.

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And that this
allowed intelligences

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:34.470 align:middle line:84%
that existed within
this realm to manifest

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:38.250 align:middle line:90%
into our own physical world.

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And if this is the
case, then what

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:47.490 align:middle line:84%
is the relationship between
us as biological life

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:50.610 align:middle line:90%
and these plasma intelligences?

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:55.080 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
we also are animated

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:58.530 align:middle line:84%
by some kind of
primary source that

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:03.600 align:middle line:84%
coexists with our bodily
structure, with our blood,

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.750 align:middle line:90%
with our flesh and animates us?

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And the key is entanglement,
quantum entanglement.

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:16.830 align:middle line:84%
The psychic connection between
us and the phenomenon itself.

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And is it possible
that this consciousness

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:26.310 align:middle line:84%
is the root behind the
concept of the soul or spirit?

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:29.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Entanglement is the
idea that particles,

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.410 align:middle line:84%
when they're
created, have twins.

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And that these twins,
no matter how far away

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:37.860 align:middle line:84%
they get from each other, have
an instantaneous connection

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:40.830 align:middle line:90%
that is retained forever.

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:42.420 align:middle line:84%
>> If you can
imagine, therefore,

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:47.370 align:middle line:84%
every particle has its twin
and this dual relationship

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:55.200 align:middle line:84%
instantaneously, then it becomes
a likely theory for everything

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:59.490 align:middle line:84%
from telepathy to mind over
matter and even precognition,

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:04.240 align:middle line:84%
because quantum entanglement
exists outside of normal

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.110 align:middle line:90%
space-time.

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:09.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just happening
in the here and the now,

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:13.150 align:middle line:84%
it can happen within the past,
the present, and the future

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:14.990 align:middle line:90%
all at once.

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:17.320 align:middle line:84%
>> When we interact
with this phenomena,

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:21.130 align:middle line:84%
is it possible that some of the
particles within these plasma

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:25.030 align:middle line:84%
intelligences are resonating
with their own twin particles

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:27.210 align:middle line:90%
within us?

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>> This resonance, this harmony,
this communication between us

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:37.150 align:middle line:84%
and the phenomenon itself,
it's a psychic experience.

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:38.940 align:middle line:90%
It's one that we share with it.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:41.800 align:middle line:90%
It's a communion, if you like.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And through this, knowledge
and information can be passed.

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And it is my sense
that this is something

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:54.180 align:middle line:84%
that's been going on for
not just thousands of years

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:56.520 align:middle line:84%
but arguably for
millions of years.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:01.150 align:middle line:84%
Since humanity first
entered onto this planet,

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:05.520 align:middle line:84%
we've had a relationship with
these plasma intelligences.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And it could well
be that they have

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.990 align:middle line:90%
been guiding evolution itself.

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And if we now switch
to the idea of UFOs

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:20.640 align:middle line:84%
and the observation
of mysterious lights,

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:26.280 align:middle line:84%
very often they are said
to be sentient in nature,

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:29.680 align:middle line:90%
that they appear to be alive.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:33.910 align:middle line:84%
>> In May 2006, the UK
Ministry of Defence released

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:38.140 align:middle line:84%
a previously classified,
top secret report code-named

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:40.330 align:middle line:90%
the Condign Project.

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:43.930 align:middle line:84%
The 465-page report
was a compilation

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:50.950 align:middle line:84%
of UAP investigations conducted
from 1997 through 2000.

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:54.340 align:middle line:84%
The document concludes that
the most compelling UAP

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:57.640 align:middle line:90%
reports were caused by plasmas.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:00.100 align:middle line:10%
The report states,
"The phenomena

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:03.550 align:middle line:10%
can create radiation
burn marks on witnesses

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:06.940 align:middle line:10%
who get too close to the
strong electromagnetic fields

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:10.750 align:middle line:10%
associated with the plasmas,
cause ground traces,

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:13.840 align:middle line:10%
and produce a myriad of
other strange effects."

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.480 align:middle line:84%
The report goes on
to say that plasmas

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.120 align:middle line:90%
can take the shape of saucers.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:23.110 align:middle line:84%
They can have what appear to be
searchlights beamed from them.

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:25.930 align:middle line:84%
They're able to move
at astonishing speeds

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:29.020 align:middle line:90%
and can interact with observers.

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:34.930 align:middle line:10%
>> Are UFOs plasma
intelligences, plasma beings?

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:39.910 align:middle line:10%
And the answer to that, I
believe, is absolutely yes.

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:41.590 align:middle line:90%
Why do I believe this?

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Because many years ago, I came
into the field of UFO research

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:52.000 align:middle line:84%
believing that flying
saucers, UFOs, were

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.090 align:middle line:90%
nuts and bolts spacecraft.

00:23:55.090 --> 00:24:00.460 align:middle line:84%
But what I found is that
many of the sincere witnesses

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:04.660 align:middle line:84%
were also having psychic
experiences in connection

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:07.780 align:middle line:84%
with their sightings
and encounters.

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And I wondered how
this was possible.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:15.310 align:middle line:10%
Because if you see an aircraft
going over in the sky,

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:18.890 align:middle line:10%
you don't have any psychic
connection with it.

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:21.790 align:middle line:84%
So why would you have
a psychic connection

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:27.400 align:middle line:84%
with a nuts and bolts spacecraft
going through the heavens?

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is,
of course, you're

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:33.260 align:middle line:84%
not dealing with nuts
and bolts, in my opinion.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:38.410 align:middle line:84%
I think that many UFOs, not
necessarily all of them,

00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:42.550 align:middle line:84%
are actually
manifestations of plasma.

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And plasma can come in
various different ways.

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:54.470 align:middle line:84%
It is not simply a small ball
of light, but it can be huge.

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:59.350 align:middle line:84%
It can be tens of feet across,
perhaps even larger than that.

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:01.940 align:middle line:90%
It can be solid.

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:04.520 align:middle line:90%
It can be cold to the touch.

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.770 align:middle line:90%
It can be hot to the touch.

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:12.010 align:middle line:84%
It can come in the form
of strange mists and fogs

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:15.220 align:middle line:90%
that appear to be on fire.

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Just because it doesn't have
a carbon-based form of body

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:22.030 align:middle line:84%
like we do doesn't mean that
it's not just as intelligent

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:25.490 align:middle line:84%
and just as evolved or on a
process of evolution like we

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:26.290 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:28.990 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, some of them may
be even more evolved and more

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:31.060 align:middle line:90%
intelligent than we are.

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:33.220 align:middle line:84%
But I don't want to
diminish human either.

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:37.630 align:middle line:10%
But to me, a human is not
this body and this DNA form,

00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:40.330 align:middle line:10%
to me, human is our spirit.

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:42.010 align:middle line:10%
It is our eternal being.

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:44.140 align:middle line:10%
And it comes from
so much farther

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:47.860 align:middle line:10%
than what we experience here
in our physical reality.

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:51.130 align:middle line:84%
But as we start to, again,
broaden our definition

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:54.670 align:middle line:84%
of what is life, what is
sentient, what is conscious,

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:57.490 align:middle line:84%
what is evolved, we
can start getting

00:25:57.490 --> 00:26:02.440 align:middle line:84%
beyond our very limited box
of human social thinking

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.990 align:middle line:84%
and start really
perceiving the bigger

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:09.230 align:middle line:90%
universe that is incredible.

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>> If plasma does play
a fundamental role

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:14.650 align:middle line:84%
in the structure and
function of our universe,

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:17.800 align:middle line:84%
as well as our interaction
and engagement with it,

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:21.760 align:middle line:84%
what might the implications
be for humanity if we accept

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.170 align:middle line:90%
and integrate these concepts?

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:26.020 align:middle line:90%


00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:31.330 align:middle line:10%
>> For the plasma universe
theory to have a deep meaning

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:33.890 align:middle line:10%
in the evolution
of our world today,

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:37.720 align:middle line:10%
it needs to be formalized
in a deeper level.

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:40.840 align:middle line:84%
It needs to be
formalized in parallel

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:44.620 align:middle line:90%
with a unified view of physics.

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:47.320 align:middle line:84%
>> If the plasma
theory was accurate,

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.050 align:middle line:84%
what it would mean is that
we would have to throw away

00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:52.750 align:middle line:90%
general relativity completely.

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:55.630 align:middle line:10%
And we would certainly
have to start

00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:59.200 align:middle line:10%
thinking more about this
specific phase of matter

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:02.710 align:middle line:10%
and why it's so fundamental
about the universe compared

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:04.900 align:middle line:10%
to the other states.

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:08.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Science is not separate
from the arts and our culture.

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:09.680 align:middle line:10%
It is a part of it.

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:13.520 align:middle line:10%
And therefore to form
a real cosmology,

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:16.220 align:middle line:10%
it must include everything.

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:18.380 align:middle line:90%
And that means all of us.

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:21.460 align:middle line:84%
We must understand
ourselves before we

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:23.540 align:middle line:90%
can understand the universe.

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And at present, we've
got it all backwards.

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:32.270 align:middle line:84%
So the future of both
mankind and to return science

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:36.620 align:middle line:84%
to its origins, that is the
classical approach where

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:41.900 align:middle line:84%
all subjects were opened for
discussion for all people

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:45.300 align:middle line:90%
is the way ahead.

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:51.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So what does the acceptance
of the plasma universe idea

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:55.320 align:middle line:90%
mean for the future of humanity?

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.950 align:middle line:84%
I think the answer to
that comes from the fact

00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:04.490 align:middle line:84%
that if plasma is a conduit
that allows intelligences

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:09.680 align:middle line:84%
from a deeper level of
existence to coexist with us,

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:14.240 align:middle line:84%
then communication should be
our priority, because it will

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:17.210 align:middle line:90%
move us forward in technology.

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:19.730 align:middle line:84%
It will move us forward
in our understanding

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:22.460 align:middle line:90%
of our place in the cosmos.

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:28.010 align:middle line:84%
It will lead us forward in the
development of our own bodily

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:30.200 align:middle line:90%
systems in medicine.

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And it could even help us
eventually get off this planet

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:38.510 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps even become
intelligent beings

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:40.000 align:middle line:90%
without bodies ourselves.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.070 align:middle line:90%


00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:48.620 align:middle line:84%
>> When science can really come
to accept this plasma universe

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:52.220 align:middle line:84%
theory and work with
it, well, number one,

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:54.830 align:middle line:84%
I think that we're going to
really shift our paradigm

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:59.360 align:middle line:84%
to realizing that we are not
this isolated little planet

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:01.670 align:middle line:84%
in this isolated
little solar system.

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:03.320 align:middle line:84%
We are going to
recognize that we

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:07.310 align:middle line:84%
are part of a universal
web, a universal organism,

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:09.130 align:middle line:90%
that we are connected to.

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:12.230 align:middle line:84%
We're just a cell in the
body of that universe.

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And yet through
the plasma fields,

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.070 align:middle line:90%
we are connected to the whole.

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:17.460 align:middle line:90%
And we're a part of it.

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And so we can start to
coordinate and reach

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:25.430 align:middle line:84%
much further than what we're
currently reaching in terms

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:28.940 align:middle line:84%
of our energy production, in
terms of our communication,

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:31.100 align:middle line:90%
in terms of our space travel.

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:33.560 align:middle line:84%
When we can learn to surf
those waves of the plasma

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:36.710 align:middle line:84%
field and that network,
we have huge possibilities

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:41.690 align:middle line:84%
that start opening up to us
and in so many ways with space

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:45.800 align:middle line:84%
travel, with energy
generation for our planet,

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:49.770 align:middle line:84%
and with communication to
distant galaxies, and so forth.

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:54.000 align:middle line:90%
So it's a big paradigm shifter.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible that some of
the light phenomena people see

00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:00.870 align:middle line:84%
in the skies are conscious
life forms manifesting through

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:02.940 align:middle line:90%
the medium of plasma?

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:06.090 align:middle line:84%
If so, might they be
expressing their sentience

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:09.000 align:middle line:84%
through electromagnetic
fields that transition

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.180 align:middle line:84%
between the different phases
of matter in ways we do

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:14.700 align:middle line:90%
not yet understand?

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:17.220 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps like sea
creatures moving

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:20.460 align:middle line:84%
through the ocean of
space, they use plasma

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:24.250 align:middle line:84%
as a way to communicate
with us in our own density.

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:27.660 align:middle line:84%
If the concepts promoted
by plasma universe theory

00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:31.200 align:middle line:84%
do indeed paint a different
picture of our existence,

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:34.890 align:middle line:84%
perhaps this reimagining will
help springboard humanity

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:39.000 align:middle line:84%
into the next phase of our
evolution and, quite possibly,

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.760 align:middle line:84%
facilitate contact
with intelligences

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:42.690 align:middle line:90%
throughout the cosmos.

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:47.470 align:middle line:90%


00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:49.480 align:middle line:84%
On the next episode
of "Deep Space,"

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:52.150 align:middle line:84%
we'll investigate the
phenomenon of portals.

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:54.900 align:middle line:90%
