00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.900 align:middle line:10%
NASA's Dawn spacecraft
is now flying

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.440 align:middle line:10%
alongside a massive
asteroid named Vesta

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.290 align:middle line:10%
and has sent back data that
led to this simulation of what

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.990 align:middle line:10%
it looks like on this
giant rock that started out

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.550 align:middle line:10%
as a small planet.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.100 align:middle line:84%
Vesta is roughly
the size of Arizona.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.030 align:middle line:84%
It's located in the asteroid
belt between Mars and Jupiter.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.400 align:middle line:90%
>> May 10, 2012.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.720 align:middle line:84%
NASA releases data from the Dawn
spacecraft on the asteroid belt

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.150 align:middle line:90%
between Mars and Jupiter.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.390 align:middle line:84%
The interesting discoveries
found prompt researchers

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.370 align:middle line:84%
to dive deeper into an old
theory of the universe.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.260 align:middle line:10%
>> In the 1860s, there was
a belief in something called

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.060 align:middle line:10%
Bode's Law.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it was
the Titius-Bode Law.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.400 align:middle line:10%
But basically, what it
said is every planet

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.820 align:middle line:10%
is about twice as far from the
sun as the previous planet.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.130 align:middle line:10%
And it actually works really,
really well for, like,

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.840 align:middle line:10%
eight out of the nine-- or
seven out of the nine planets

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.640 align:middle line:10%
that we have.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.170 align:middle line:10%
But at the time,
there were only six

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.180 align:middle line:10%
known planets that were
visible to the naked eye,

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.847 align:middle line:10%
or even some of the
primitive telescopes

00:01:51.847 --> 00:01:53.120 align:middle line:10%
they had at the time.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.300 align:middle line:10%
And they noticed that
there was this gap

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.850 align:middle line:10%
between Mars and Jupiter right
where a planet should be.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Now in that gap is
the asteroid belt.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.880 align:middle line:84%
It implies that the
asteroid belt is actually

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.970 align:middle line:84%
the wreckage of a planet
that used to exist there.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.250 align:middle line:84%
>> If the asteroid belt
is really the remnant

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.610 align:middle line:84%
of an ancient planet
between Jupiter and Mars,

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.760 align:middle line:84%
is it possible a species
inhabited this missing planet

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.030 align:middle line:84%
thousands or even
millions of years ago?

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.260 align:middle line:84%
If that's true, could it be they
escaped before its destruction,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.610 align:middle line:84%
only to land and
inhabit our Earth?

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.860 align:middle line:90%
>> There is an alien presence.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.900 align:middle line:10%
It's been here for
a very long time.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.100 align:middle line:84%
It has reached Earth
because of war.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.030 align:middle line:10%
John Brandenburg's work
opens the question,

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.630 align:middle line:10%
what happened 300,000 or a
million years ago on Mars,

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.610 align:middle line:10%
that he claims the evidence
is hard that there were

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.440 align:middle line:10%
two hydrogen bomb explosions?

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.240 align:middle line:10%
>> Here is Mars Xenon
versus Earth Xenon.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.590 align:middle line:10%
Earth is in blue.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:07.150 align:middle line:10%
You can see they overlay very
well for the isotopes 132, 134,

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.830 align:middle line:10%
et cetera.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.970 align:middle line:10%
But at 129, Mars
has 2 and 1/2 times

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.950 align:middle line:10%
more xenon 129 than
the Earth does.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And by the way,
it has this-- you

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.000 align:middle line:84%
could put any other
planet up there,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.620 align:middle line:90%
and it would look the same.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Mars is different from
every other planet.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.920 align:middle line:84%
It has this big
load of xenon 129.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And sadly, this is
weapon signature.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>> One man who retired from
the Defense Intelligence Agency

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.800 align:middle line:90%
in 1999 sought me out.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And we met with a man from
the World Bank in Baltimore

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.410 align:middle line:90%
at the harbor.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And for seven
hours, this man was

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.960 align:middle line:84%
provoked by a section
of my book having

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.830 align:middle line:90%
to do with cloning technology.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.040 align:middle line:10%
But he explained that his job
for 23 years in the Defense

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.450 align:middle line:10%
Intelligence Agency was
to analyze and monitor

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.290 align:middle line:10%
the geopolitical territorial
conflict of three

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.760 align:middle line:10%
different extraterrestrial
groups inhabiting this world.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And he said they are
inside of mountains.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.290 align:middle line:84%
They have huge
caverns, the basins

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.170 align:middle line:84%
in the bottoms underneath
oceans and seas,

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:29.090 align:middle line:84%
between land bases, water
bases, and in mountains.

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.140 align:middle line:84%
They have a control
on this planet.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:39.500 align:middle line:10%
And it may be linked
directly to Mars, to Sirius,

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.580 align:middle line:10%
and to Zeta Reticuli 1 and 2.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Could some of these beings
from another planet not only be

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.680 align:middle line:84%
considered alien,
but also human?

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.318 align:middle line:84%
If they were human, did
they help seed the planet?

00:04:52.318 --> 00:04:54.860 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the more interesting
fears when it comes to ancient

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.030 align:middle line:10%
astronaut is sort of the idea
like a progenitor civilization.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.650 align:middle line:84%
That's to say something along
the lines of a very ancient,

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.270 align:middle line:84%
highly advanced
culture that sort

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.390 align:middle line:84%
of seeded the universe,
for want of a better term.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at a
lot of the entities that

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.220 align:middle line:84%
are reported in UFO encounters,
going back to, say, the '40s

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:21.032 align:middle line:84%
and '50s, we have the very
human looking space brothers

00:05:21.032 --> 00:05:22.740 align:middle line:84%
with the long hair,
which a lot of people

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.370 align:middle line:84%
dismiss, but I don't write
off a lot of those stories,

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.270 align:middle line:90%
personally.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.610 align:middle line:90%
Even the grays.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.850 align:middle line:84%
Now they don't
exactly look like us,

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.730 align:middle line:84%
but the head, the two eyes,
fake news, fake mouth,

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.030 align:middle line:90%
and two arms and two legs.

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.360 align:middle line:84%
So they are, in that
sense, quite close to us.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.940 align:middle line:84%
But what I find
interesting is that when

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.240 align:middle line:84%
you're dealing with
abductions, they very often

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.110 align:middle line:84%
take genetic material
from the abductees.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.590 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about eggs,
sperm, DNA, skin samples.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.620 align:middle line:84%
If we were dealing
with races of entities

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.710 align:middle line:84%
that were totally separate,
I find it very difficult

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.510 align:middle line:84%
to think that our DNA and the
raw materials they need from us

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.150 align:middle line:84%
would be totally
compatible with them.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.930 align:middle line:84%
That, to me, is too
much of a coincidence.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.910 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's why we can
make a case of an ancient race

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.100 align:middle line:84%
seed in the universe
which depended

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.840 align:middle line:84%
on the atmosphere
and the gravity

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.300 align:middle line:84%
and the food and everything
else of the relevant planet

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.800 align:middle line:90%
over millions of years.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.310 align:middle line:84%
The grays may have developed
in a different physical fashion

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.360 align:middle line:90%
to what we have.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.443 align:middle line:84%
We're totally different,
really, in many respects,

00:06:25.443 --> 00:06:27.440 align:middle line:84%
to Cro-Magnon Man
or Neanderthal Man.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.970 align:middle line:90%
But they were still humans.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.040 align:middle line:90%
But they were different builds.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.990 align:middle line:90%
Their brain size were different.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.730 align:middle line:84%
So I think we could be dealing
with something like that

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.250 align:middle line:90%
that's a civilization.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:38.750 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it doesn't
even exist anymore.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.760 align:middle line:10%
But it was the original seeding
of the universe or the galaxy.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Someday,
extraterrestrials arrived.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.700 align:middle line:84%
They realized which form of
animal is the most advanced.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.710 align:middle line:10%
It was our ape family.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.550 align:middle line:10%
They simply took one or two
examples out of the ape family.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.390 align:middle line:84%
They changed their
genetical code.

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.040 align:middle line:84%
Every genetics know
how to do this.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.090 align:middle line:90%
You change the DNA base.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:08.780 align:middle line:84%
You change it, and you put this
back into the womb of a female.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.490 align:middle line:84%
The female will give
birth to a child.

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.770 align:middle line:84%
The child has, of
course, the evolution,

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.440 align:middle line:84%
has the skeleton, the
teeth, and everything.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.900 align:middle line:84%
But because of this
artificial mutation,

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.850 align:middle line:84%
the child has
something and plus,

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:23.280 align:middle line:84%
which the rest of the
family tree has not--

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.580 align:middle line:84%
culture, language, the
possibility to speak,

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.510 align:middle line:84%
change out information,
and all that.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.080 align:middle line:84%
So we are a product
of evolution,

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:36.090 align:middle line:84%
but not only, we are also part
of an artificial mutation.

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:40.350 align:middle line:84%
So and this is handed down in
the Bible and in other stories.

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:44.220 align:middle line:10%
>> A lot of the intergalactic
species are kind of broken down

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.340 align:middle line:10%
into three major strata.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.460 align:middle line:10%
You have sort of your
young infantile baby races

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:54.690 align:middle line:10%
and were juvenile, right on the
edge of trying to be adults.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:08:00.210 align:middle line:84%
You have sort of mature species,
spacefaring species, which

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:03.300 align:middle line:84%
can kind of occupy
a pretty gap of age,

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.010 align:middle line:84%
pretty solid gap
of age of hundreds,

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:08.790 align:middle line:84%
thousands, tens of thousands
of years of being spacefaring.

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And then you have a few
of the ancient races,

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:15.120 align:middle line:84%
which have been spacefaring
for millions of years.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:19.110 align:middle line:10%
And there is this
real difference in who

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:20.800 align:middle line:10%
and what they are and they do.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're kind
of in the middle strata,

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.690 align:middle line:84%
the attitude about
those in the upper,

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:29.340 align:middle line:84%
the ancient strata
is, it's not up to us

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:30.799 align:middle line:84%
to decide what
their business is.

00:08:30.799 --> 00:08:32.799 align:middle line:84%
They obviously do what
they want, how they want.

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:36.780 align:middle line:84%
But their reputation is that
they're just going around,

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:37.890 align:middle line:90%
tinkering with DNA.

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:40.364 align:middle line:84%
They're still working on these
long term upgrading plans.

00:08:40.364 --> 00:08:43.000 align:middle line:90%


00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.700 align:middle line:10%
>> If there really was a
progenitor race that helped

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:49.510 align:middle line:10%
seed the planet, is it possible
that their existence is also

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.570 align:middle line:10%
shown in other stories
that aren't religious?

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:54.070 align:middle line:90%
And if so, why?

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:57.200 align:middle line:90%


00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.260 align:middle line:10%
>> Gene Roddenberry was the
writer and producer of "Star

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:01.700 align:middle line:10%
Trek," the first series.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.760 align:middle line:10%
I think he wrote the very
first show in the "Star Trek"

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.640 align:middle line:10%
series, which was incredibly
interesting about how

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.480 align:middle line:10%
the enterprise goes on and finds
evidence of a progenitor race

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.480 align:middle line:10%
all throughout the solar
system and the galaxy.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.670 align:middle line:10%
>> Gene Roddenberry was
interested in the idea

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:19.490 align:middle line:10%
of a progenitor race because he
was involved with people like

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:22.790 align:middle line:10%
a group called the Nine in
the 1960s who were actually

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:26.000 align:middle line:10%
channeling, supposedly,
extraterrestrial entities who

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.070 align:middle line:10%
told him about this idea
that the human race was not

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:29.870 align:middle line:10%
national.

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:31.212 align:middle line:90%
It was not from the Earth.

00:09:31.212 --> 00:09:32.420 align:middle line:90%
It was actually brought here.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:34.350 align:middle line:10%
And then I believe and
suspect, and people

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:35.850 align:middle line:10%
have suspected this
for a long time,

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:38.120 align:middle line:10%
and implied that,
basically, he was

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.960 align:middle line:10%
asked to put this stuff into the
"Star Trek" mythology as part

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.590 align:middle line:10%
of the Brookings report kind of
educational process of getting

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:49.010 align:middle line:10%
everybody in the world to
get used to these ideas

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:52.280 align:middle line:10%
that there have been aliens
here for a long time.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Could it be that the
government is trying to educate

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:59.330 align:middle line:84%
us on the fact that there might
be a progenitor race out there?

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.940 align:middle line:84%
If this is true, is
there physical evidence

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:07.060 align:middle line:84%
in the universe that supports
their existence among us?

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:11.530 align:middle line:84%
Researchers point out that a
very odd moon orbits Saturn.

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:15.310 align:middle line:84%
Some believe this moon could
be an artificial planet.

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:17.915 align:middle line:10%
>> Iapetus is very different
because unlike most

00:10:17.915 --> 00:10:20.290 align:middle line:10%
of the moons of Saturn, which
are in its kind of ecliptic

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:22.750 align:middle line:10%
plane, it's off at
about a 60 degree angle.

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:25.540 align:middle line:10%
When pictures of the
horizon came back

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:27.540 align:middle line:10%
that were showing the
surface of Iapetus,

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.100 align:middle line:10%
not only was there
this bizarre rim

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.510 align:middle line:10%
around the middle
of the object, there

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:37.730 align:middle line:10%
was this edge, edge, edge,
straight line, straight line,

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:38.630 align:middle line:10%
straight line.

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:43.160 align:middle line:84%
It was not a rounded
spherical horizon.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.573 align:middle line:84%
And actually, if you
do the calculations

00:10:45.573 --> 00:10:47.990 align:middle line:84%
and you see how long these
straight lines are and put them

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:50.720 align:middle line:84%
together, it comes out
in the shape of something

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.530 align:middle line:90%
called a dodecahedron.

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:55.710 align:middle line:84%
Iapetus appears to be
an artificial satellite.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:57.710 align:middle line:84%
It could very well have
been the base from which

00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:59.870 align:middle line:84%
the progenitors-- call
them the preservers,

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:01.670 align:middle line:84%
call them whatever you
want to call them--

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:02.470 align:middle line:90%
operated.

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:04.640 align:middle line:84%
They actually operated
on this moon of Saturn

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.560 align:middle line:84%
and did different things
to different planets

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.380 align:middle line:90%
in the solar system.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:13.690 align:middle line:10%
>> It seems that since 2014,
in my work at earthfiles.com

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:18.190 align:middle line:10%
and investigating various
kinds of phenomena for radio

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:21.880 align:middle line:10%
and television and the web,
that I have been getting a lot

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.660 align:middle line:10%
of whistleblowers that have
been saying, basically, look,

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:29.590 align:middle line:10%
you need to look at what's
going on with Saturn research.

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And one of those emails came
after the very first closeup

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:38.320 align:middle line:84%
photo that NASA released of
this strange moon around Saturn

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.040 align:middle line:90%
called Iapetus.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And here is this wall
going around Iapetus.

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And then you read
what they release

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:52.550 align:middle line:84%
as the height of
the wall is 6 miles.

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:55.150 align:middle line:84%
That's from the surface
going up vertically--

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.070 align:middle line:90%
6 miles.

00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And it goes all of the
way around Iapetus.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.740 align:middle line:84%
Everybody was saying,
how is this possible?

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:07.600 align:middle line:90%
What could be the reason?

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, a lot of
people have been speculating,

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:17.750 align:middle line:84%
could this be one of
the first, in your face,

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:19.690 align:middle line:84%
we'll call it
ancient archaeology,

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:23.150 align:middle line:84%
by extraterrestrials
in the solar system?

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:26.290 align:middle line:84%
>> If Iapetus and our own
moon are considered artificial

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:28.960 align:middle line:84%
satellites built by
a progenitor race,

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.780 align:middle line:84%
are they still
monitoring us from afar?

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.880 align:middle line:84%
If so, could it be
they're monitoring

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.440 align:middle line:84%
the possible destruction
of our planet?

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.220 align:middle line:84%
>> The ancients tell us that
there are something called

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:45.310 align:middle line:84%
a great galactic year or-- and
this is a 25,920-year cycle.

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:48.790 align:middle line:84%
Each one of these
great years is actually

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:52.480 align:middle line:84%
divided into four sections--
a Golden, a Silver, a Bronze,

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.663 align:middle line:90%
and an Iron Age.

00:12:53.663 --> 00:12:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And we're not talking
about metals here.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.130 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
consciousness.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:59.940 align:middle line:10%
And the Golden Age is actually
said that vibrationally, we

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:02.890 align:middle line:10%
are 3/4 spirit and 1/4 matter.

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:07.330 align:middle line:10%
In the Silver Age,
we're like 2/3 and 1/3.

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:09.640 align:middle line:84%
In the Bronze Age,
we're half and half.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And in the Kali
Yuga, the Iron Age,

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.660 align:middle line:84%
which is what we've
been in now, we're

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.910 align:middle line:90%
3/4 matter and 1/4 spirit.

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:19.250 align:middle line:84%
So people are walking around,
asking whether God even exists.

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:21.100 align:middle line:84%
So at the end of
each of these ages,

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.490 align:middle line:84%
there are cycles within
cycles within cycles.

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:28.030 align:middle line:84%
So halfway through
that 24,920-year age,

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:32.620 align:middle line:84%
what happens is our solar
system drops beneath the plane,

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:35.360 align:middle line:84%
the equatorial
plane of the galaxy.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's what happened
when Atlantis fell.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And it was sort of like
the end of an entire age.

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And we reverted back to
having to try to survive.

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And since many animals didn't
survive, crops, plants,

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.430 align:middle line:84%
of course, there was a lot of
starvation for a long time.

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:53.410 align:middle line:84%
But many of the gods
remained in order

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:56.440 align:middle line:84%
to try to put the world back
together and to bring food.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.290 align:middle line:84%
This is who Osiris was,
the great green god who

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:02.320 align:middle line:84%
traveled around and brought food
to people and taught planting.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is why he was
so beloved by the people.

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:08.503 align:middle line:84%
And then, eventually, we move
up, century after century

00:14:08.503 --> 00:14:09.670 align:middle line:90%
after century after century.

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:13.600 align:middle line:84%
So here we are at the end of
another 12,000-year cycle,

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:17.030 align:middle line:90%
about half of that 25,920 years.

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:20.380 align:middle line:84%
And we're beginning to pass
through the equatorial plane

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:24.160 align:middle line:84%
of the equator, the
galactic equator

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.210 align:middle line:84%
once again, which takes
between 1,000 and 1,500 years.

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:31.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Could a progenitor race
be trying to connect with us?

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:33.670 align:middle line:90%
And if so, why?

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:37.330 align:middle line:10%
>> I am absolutely convinced
this planet is under

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.340 align:middle line:10%
observation again.

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.710 align:middle line:90%
Somebody is watching us.

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:45.040 align:middle line:84%
Somebody is studying
us, our languages.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.760 align:middle line:90%
They want to speak with us.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>> We know that there's probably
going to be a pole shift

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:50.830 align:middle line:90%
in our lifetime.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:55.360 align:middle line:10%
And nobody, not only those of
us who live on this planet,

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.030 align:middle line:10%
but those who have been
rooting for the consciousness

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:00.820 align:middle line:10%
of this planet from the
Galactic Federation,

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:02.890 align:middle line:10%
want to see us
have to start over.

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:04.570 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
see us crash and burn

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:08.110 align:middle line:84%
and have to go back to caveman
days and make our way back up

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:09.310 align:middle line:90%
the evolutionary ladder.

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:10.845 align:middle line:90%
We've come too far.

00:15:10.845 --> 00:15:12.220 align:middle line:10%
And so this is
one of the reasons

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:15.700 align:middle line:10%
that the Galactic Federation
is so involved in trying

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:19.570 align:middle line:10%
to help to buffer the very
powerful waves that are coming

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:21.940 align:middle line:10%
out of the sun, so
that we can make

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:26.460 align:middle line:10%
a slow incremental
adjustment up and to change

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:30.370 align:middle line:10%
in our consciousness from
a duality-ridden conflict,

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:33.220 align:middle line:10%
oriented consciousness,
to one where

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:36.310 align:middle line:10%
we're able to live in
some kind of peace.

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Some believe that an
otherworldly source has already

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:42.640 align:middle line:84%
been in contact with certain
human beings to change

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.650 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness
of this planet.

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:47.880 align:middle line:10%
>> I had no idea
what I was seeing.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:51.360 align:middle line:10%
It resembled nothing that
I had ever heard described.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.800 align:middle line:90%
It resembled plasmic energy.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.480 align:middle line:90%
It had colors.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.050 align:middle line:90%
It moved fast.

00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:00.250 align:middle line:90%
It collected and then dispersed.

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>> In February of
1974, Philip K. Dick,

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:07.690 align:middle line:84%
a famous science fiction writer,
had a contact experience that

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:12.140 align:middle line:84%
not only changed his life, but
also, the message of his work.

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:16.430 align:middle line:10%
>> One day, he had a revelation.

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:19.820 align:middle line:84%
He was just sitting there in
his apartment in Orange County.

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
he began realizing

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:28.220 align:middle line:84%
that there was an alien
presence that was talking to him

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:30.380 align:middle line:84%
and giving him valid
information, which

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.420 align:middle line:90%
he could confirm or deny.

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:36.800 align:middle line:84%
He called this thing
VALIS, or for a Vast Active

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.860 align:middle line:90%
Living Intelligent System.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And he believed that VALIS
was controlling the human race

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:45.540 align:middle line:84%
and doing things
to us, sometimes

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:49.700 align:middle line:84%
in a trickster manner, sometimes
in an enlightened manner.

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.920 align:middle line:84%
And he believed that he
was the vehicle of VALIS.

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:55.880 align:middle line:84%
The next four books, which
were concerned with VALIS,

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.250 align:middle line:84%
were some of the most
amazing books ever written.

00:16:58.250 --> 00:16:59.810 align:middle line:10%
He believed that
he was connected

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:03.350 align:middle line:10%
to some intelligence that was
off planet that was feeding him

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:05.480 align:middle line:10%
information.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Philip K. Dick was one of
the foremost and most important

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:12.300 align:middle line:10%
and visionary science
fiction writers ever.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.869 align:middle line:10%
For example, one
of his books was

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:18.740 align:middle line:10%
turned into "Blade Runner," the
hit movie with Harrison Ford.

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:22.339 align:middle line:84%
Also "The Adjustment
Bureau," with Matt Damon,

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:25.010 align:middle line:84%
was based on a short
story that he wrote.

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:28.190 align:middle line:84%
And also "Minority
Report" with Tom Cruise.

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:29.930 align:middle line:84%
But what's particularly
interesting

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:32.150 align:middle line:84%
is that there's sort of a
crossover with Philip K.

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:34.400 align:middle line:84%
Dick between the world
of science fiction

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.610 align:middle line:84%
and what could be some sort of
aspect of the UFO phenomenon.

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:40.910 align:middle line:10%
And this very much revolves
around his book "VALIS"

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:43.820 align:middle line:10%
and the idea that
he was essentially

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.550 align:middle line:10%
sort of like main
lined information

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:48.620 align:middle line:10%
from extraterrestrials.

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.830 align:middle line:10%
And he talked about this
on a number of occasions,

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:55.310 align:middle line:10%
where he felt this sort of
putting concepts and ideas out

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:58.850 align:middle line:10%
there that may not actually
have all been coming from him.

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:01.550 align:middle line:84%
Essentially have been
downloading unknowingly

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:04.370 align:middle line:84%
information and
concepts and ideas

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:07.070 align:middle line:84%
that some other
intelligence may have wanted

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:09.320 align:middle line:84%
to get into the
public domain for us

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:12.200 align:middle line:84%
to think about, to
see and ponder upon.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>> If Philip K. Dick did have
a contact experience with

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:19.130 align:middle line:84%
an otherworldly presence, what
were they trying to convey,

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:20.140 align:middle line:90%
and why?

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:24.500 align:middle line:84%
>> What Philip K. Dick tapped
into was an ancient theology

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:26.180 align:middle line:90%
known as gnosticism.

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And what the
gnostics believed was

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.870 align:middle line:84%
that we are living
in a fake world ruled

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:37.910 align:middle line:84%
by a fake god, who is using
us for some mysterious reason.

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:40.070 align:middle line:84%
But everything
around us is fake.

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And that was the revelation
that Dick had with VALIS,

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.190 align:middle line:84%
that we were living in
a phony, fake reality.

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:48.960 align:middle line:84%
Just like the gnostics, and that
we were ruled by the demiurge,

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.080 align:middle line:90%
or this false god.

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.730 align:middle line:84%
When he came out
with this stuff,

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:55.730 align:middle line:84%
he actually caused a
resurgence of interest

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:58.870 align:middle line:90%
in gnosticism in the late '90s.

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:02.210 align:middle line:10%
Two movies actually came out
which were heavily influenced

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:05.060 align:middle line:10%
both by Dick and by gnosticism.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:09.800 align:middle line:84%
The first one came out in
'98, which is "Dark City."

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.960 align:middle line:10%
And then a year
later, another movie

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.360 align:middle line:10%
came out called
"The Matrix," which

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.250 align:middle line:10%
was even more mindblowing
than "Dark City"

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:21.670 align:middle line:10%
because it went into the whole
idea of a robot intelligence

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:24.920 align:middle line:10%
kind of controlling
us, an AI that controls

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.680 align:middle line:10%
machines that come after us.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.410 align:middle line:10%
And that there's agents
who could leap into bodies

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:34.190 align:middle line:10%
and leap out of bodies, which
is a very gnostic concept.

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:38.180 align:middle line:10%
This kind of resurgence in
gnostic attitudes began.

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:41.210 align:middle line:10%
And it's now really
reaching full force.

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Gnosticism is one of the
most influential theologies

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:50.120 align:middle line:84%
right now in movies and in
books and all over the place.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.910 align:middle line:10%
>> Researchers report that
Philip was no longer just

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:55.850 align:middle line:10%
writing about government
conspiracies and alternative

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:56.780 align:middle line:10%
realities.

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:58.220 align:middle line:90%
He was living it.

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:00.590 align:middle line:84%
He became extremely
worried after his home

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:04.580 align:middle line:84%
was broken into several
times and his phone tapped.

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:07.940 align:middle line:10%
After his mysterious
death in 1982,

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.730 align:middle line:10%
experts thought it might be
possible the government became

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:14.750 align:middle line:10%
aware of his involvement with
an extraterrestrial source.

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:21.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Philip K. Dick was referenced
by a ring laser physicist to me

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:23.530 align:middle line:84%
who was working at
Wright Patterson.

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:26.250 align:middle line:90%
And this was in 1982.

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm working on a film about
astronaut training in Colorado

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.840 align:middle line:90%
at Lockheed Martin.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:38.090 align:middle line:84%
I am looking for a laboratory,
and I'm at Ball Aerospace.

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:40.190 align:middle line:90%
That's how innocent this is.

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:44.580 align:middle line:84%
With me were three or four other
people who were there for work.

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:46.160 align:middle line:90%
And one of them was a man.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.770 align:middle line:84%
It said Wright
Patterson Ring Laser.

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:52.190 align:middle line:84%
It had the laboratory
name on his name tag.

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:55.400 align:middle line:84%
So when we had a
break, I just said,

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.730 align:middle line:84%
I see that you're
from Wright Patterson.

00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:00.530 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if I could
ask you a question.

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.390 align:middle line:90%
You're working at Ring Lasers.

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever dealt with
any kind of an assignment

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.010 align:middle line:90%
about UFOs and ETs?

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:14.320 align:middle line:84%
He said, we are in a universe
that is teeming with life.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And there are technologies that
can bend space and time, point

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.190 align:middle line:90%
to point.

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And there is a writer
named Philip K. Dick, who

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:30.100 align:middle line:84%
wrote in one of his books an
absolutely accurate description

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:33.930 align:middle line:84%
of what I know to
be true out there.

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:39.030 align:middle line:84%
If you can control
gravity, space, and time,

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:41.825 align:middle line:90%
you can be at this point.

00:21:41.825 --> 00:21:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And you want to
go to this point.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:48.360 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if it's a
billion light years, 10 billion

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:53.820 align:middle line:84%
light years, you just make
the technology take the point

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:57.480 align:middle line:84%
where you are to the point where
you want to go in the universe,

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.690 align:middle line:90%
and you close it.

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And you can build a
doorway on the planet

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.270 align:middle line:90%
that you're beginning on.

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And on the other side
of the door step,

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:14.190 align:middle line:84%
you can be in another
planet light years away.

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:17.380 align:middle line:90%


00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:21.900 align:middle line:84%
He said this is happening
in our universe now.

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:29.580 align:middle line:84%
There are beings that can
step without using time

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:32.190 align:middle line:84%
from one end of the
universe to the other.

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:35.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible the government
was tracking Philip K.

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Dick after his
contact experience?

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And could this be a
link to his death?

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:43.080 align:middle line:84%
One expert in the Marine
Corps Special Section

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.450 align:middle line:84%
suggests that after the
government became aware

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:47.910 align:middle line:84%
of Philip K. Dick's
experience, they

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:51.690 align:middle line:84%
suspected he had been in
contact with an alien satellite,

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:56.220 align:middle line:84%
referred to by the special
section as the Black Knight.

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:59.682 align:middle line:84%
>> So I went ahead and looked
up the USMCSS files on the Black

00:22:59.682 --> 00:23:01.890 align:middle line:84%
Knight because there seemed
to be a connection there.

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:04.920 align:middle line:84%
Philip K. Dick was,
in fact, beamed

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:08.183 align:middle line:84%
by the Black Knight, which
is this alien satellite,

00:23:08.183 --> 00:23:09.600 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial
satellite, that's

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.210 align:middle line:84%
been floating around the
planet in a polar orbit.

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:13.990 align:middle line:10%
It's in a very odd pattern.

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:18.150 align:middle line:10%
So it's hard to follow,
hard to predict exactly.

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:20.550 align:middle line:90%
And it's fairly small.

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:25.140 align:middle line:84%
Astronaut Gordon Cooper did
get to fly by it in his journey

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.720 align:middle line:90%
around the orbit of the planet.

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:30.960 align:middle line:84%
He said that it was
black and green,

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:33.870 align:middle line:84%
kind of was blackish, had
a greenish light to it.

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And but otherwise, and seemed
to be kind of glowing or pulsing

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:39.510 align:middle line:84%
and seemed to have
a presence to it.

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:41.990 align:middle line:84%
But that was about
all he noticed.

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:43.290 align:middle line:90%
>> And there it goes.

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:45.480 align:middle line:84%
>> But what we have
determined over time,

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:49.050 align:middle line:84%
by having our own specialists
kind of try and look at it,

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:51.900 align:middle line:84%
communicate with
it, what we know is,

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:55.500 align:middle line:84%
it is a satellite of
much, much ancient origin.

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:58.130 align:middle line:84%
Some people have
said 13,000 years.

00:23:58.130 --> 00:23:58.930 align:middle line:90%
We don't think so.

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:00.990 align:middle line:90%
We think over 100,000 years.

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:03.660 align:middle line:84%
It does seem to have an
operational or artificial

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:06.090 align:middle line:84%
intelligence onboard, which
has been recording data

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:10.200 align:middle line:84%
and information on planet Earth
for a long time, for as long

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.550 align:middle line:90%
as it's been here.

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:16.470 align:middle line:84%
It does not seem to be sending
a signal out into space anymore,

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:19.920 align:middle line:84%
nor does there seem to be any
signal coming from space to it

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:20.720 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.700 align:middle line:84%
So we believe that
whatever communication

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:27.840 align:middle line:84%
that it was having with its
home source has stopped.

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:30.340 align:middle line:84%
We also suspect because
of the nature of that,

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:34.020 align:middle line:84%
that the civilized
source has stopped.

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:36.720 align:middle line:90%
So it's just floating around.

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.160 align:middle line:90%
It's failing, right?

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.470 align:middle line:10%
It's an artificial
intelligence, a computer system,

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:42.150 align:middle line:10%
an electronic
mechanical system that's

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:44.440 align:middle line:10%
failing because it's really old.

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.990 align:middle line:90%
So it's sputtering information.

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:50.973 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know why
it's talking to people.

00:24:50.973 --> 00:24:53.640 align:middle line:84%
It's going to start reaching out
to whoever's close to the start

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:54.660 align:middle line:90%
talking to them.

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:58.560 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it really doesn't
understand our language,

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:01.530 align:middle line:84%
so communicating in memories
and images and things

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:04.440 align:middle line:84%
that it's recorded may be
all it knows how to do.

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.720 align:middle line:84%
Philip K. Dick, it beamed
information to him.

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.468 align:middle line:84%
They definitely
communicated with him.

00:25:08.468 --> 00:25:10.260 align:middle line:10%
All the books and stuff
that he was writing

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:14.640 align:middle line:10%
was just all this weird sort
of stream of consciousness

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.350 align:middle line:10%
download that was a
combination of what

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:17.725 align:middle line:10%
was coming into
his brain and how

00:25:17.725 --> 00:25:19.590 align:middle line:10%
his own creative process
was dealing with it

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:21.390 align:middle line:10%
and how he was
interacting with it.

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:23.015 align:middle line:84%
And it's just going
to keep doing that.

00:25:23.015 --> 00:25:25.680 align:middle line:84%
It's just going to keep
talking to people and beaming

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.320 align:middle line:84%
things into people's
brains until it shuts off,

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.010 align:middle line:90%
or we do something about it.

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:33.280 align:middle line:10%
>> There are people who are
meant to get messages out.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, writers,
producers of Hollywood films

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:38.940 align:middle line:84%
and TV shows, these
are the kind of people

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:41.310 align:middle line:84%
that can get information
out through the mass media

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:43.840 align:middle line:84%
and through, supposedly,
fictional stories.

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.750 align:middle line:10%
So they would
naturally be the people

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:48.060 align:middle line:10%
who would be approached
by higher powers who

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:50.800 align:middle line:10%
are trying to get their
message out to others.

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And then you have scientists
and physicists and engineers who

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:56.490 align:middle line:84%
have been contacted over the
years, people whose opinions

00:25:56.490 --> 00:26:00.090 align:middle line:84%
are sought on these large
issues of, are we alone,

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:03.300 align:middle line:84%
and are there
aliens, and is there

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.310 align:middle line:90%
life out there in the universe.

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>> If certain influential
people are in contact with an AI

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:12.870 align:middle line:84%
satellite, is it possible that
the government is keeping tabs

00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:15.960 align:middle line:84%
on who they are and
what they're receiving?

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.780 align:middle line:84%
>> People like Carl Sagan was
probably the most powerful

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:22.180 align:middle line:84%
spokesman for the so-called
scientific materialist angle

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:22.980 align:middle line:90%
on things.

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:26.730 align:middle line:84%
But for many, many years, before
he became the patron saint

00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:30.060 align:middle line:84%
of debunkery, he was actually
very interested in aliens

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:30.940 align:middle line:90%
and alien life.

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:32.880 align:middle line:90%
He was very public about it.

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.460 align:middle line:84%
But his mentor at
Harvard was a guy

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:37.830 align:middle line:84%
named Dr. Donald
Menzel, who was also

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:40.470 align:middle line:84%
an astrophysicist
like Carl Sagan.

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And he was supposedly part of
an organization called MJ-12,

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.650 align:middle line:84%
Majestic-12, which
was supposedly

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:49.680 align:middle line:84%
existed from the 1940s on from
the Roswell crash forward.

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And his job was to
be the public face

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:57.015 align:middle line:84%
to debunk flying saucer
sightings, aliens, and UFOs.

00:26:57.015 --> 00:26:57.890 align:middle line:90%
And it's interesting.

00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:59.880 align:middle line:90%
He passed away in 1972.

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:02.910 align:middle line:10%
And 1972 is the
year that Carl Sagan

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:05.790 align:middle line:10%
went from being interested
in aliens and UFOs

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:09.660 align:middle line:10%
to being a public skeptic, the
public debunker of all things

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:11.430 align:middle line:10%
having to do with alien life.

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:13.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there many different
kinds of beings trying

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:15.870 align:middle line:90%
to contact us?

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:18.990 align:middle line:84%
Experts point to a secret
society in post-World War

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:22.980 align:middle line:84%
I in Germany who channeled
alien beings from a distant star

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:24.270 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:26.890 align:middle line:84%
It's suggested that this
experience brought forth

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:30.250 align:middle line:84%
knowledge that affects the
world we live in today.

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:33.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Philip K. Dick thought
that he was being influenced

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:36.550 align:middle line:10%
by an outside
alien intelligence.

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:38.800 align:middle line:84%
So that sort of
created this idea

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:42.102 align:middle line:84%
that it's possible
for that to happen.

00:27:42.102 --> 00:27:43.810 align:middle line:84%
So then we start
looking back in history.

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:45.520 align:middle line:90%
Has this happened before?

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.870 align:middle line:10%
And we realize, actually,
it's happened quite a bit.

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:52.990 align:middle line:84%
But the most interesting kind
of alien channeling, I think,

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:54.940 align:middle line:90%
is the story of Maria Orsitsch.

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:58.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Experts suggest that
Maria Orsitsch was not only

00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:01.250 align:middle line:84%
a professional channeler
for a secret society,

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:05.410 align:middle line:84%
but also part of a mysterious
Germanic culture of mysticism.

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:08.560 align:middle line:84%
>> There's actually this history
of an area of Germany called

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:11.050 align:middle line:84%
Prussia, which was actually
a nation of its own back

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:16.258 align:middle line:84%
in the 1800s, where there are
a group of industrialists with

00:28:16.258 --> 00:28:18.550 align:middle line:84%
a lot of money who were
fascinated in all these ancient

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:22.360 align:middle line:84%
mysteries, who looked at the
ancient texts through physicist

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:26.260 align:middle line:84%
eyes and had ideas about how to
create airships and spacecraft

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:28.270 align:middle line:90%
and how to define gravity.

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:31.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Researchers have tied Maria
Orsitsch to a secret society

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:33.340 align:middle line:90%
called the Vril.

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:37.060 align:middle line:84%
This society performed exercises
to awaken what the ancients

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:39.520 align:middle line:90%
referred to as chi.

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:42.430 align:middle line:84%
The legend of Maria
suggests that one night, she

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:44.650 align:middle line:84%
was channeling for a
group of social elite,

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:47.900 align:middle line:84%
when an otherworldly being
came through and claimed

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:50.920 align:middle line:84%
he was from the star
system Aldebaran.

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:52.330 align:middle line:90%
He had a message.

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:54.790 align:middle line:84%
Maria, still in a
trance, began writing

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:57.010 align:middle line:84%
in a mysterious
language and drawing

00:28:57.010 --> 00:28:59.750 align:middle line:90%
sketches for a spacecraft.

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:02.300 align:middle line:10%
Experts were brought in
to decipher the language

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:03.980 align:middle line:10%
and the sketches.

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:07.700 align:middle line:84%
These experts suggested that
the language was in Sumerian

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.650 align:middle line:84%
and the drawings
resembled a device

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:12.830 align:middle line:84%
a man named Viktor
Schauberger created.

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:15.470 align:middle line:84%
During the early
1920s, Schauberger

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:18.800 align:middle line:84%
had invented something
called the repulsine, which

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:22.520 align:middle line:84%
was a disk-shaped object that
used various air vortexes that

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:25.040 align:middle line:90%
defied the laws of physics.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:28.550 align:middle line:10%
Maria not only drew almost
his exact invention,

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:31.010 align:middle line:10%
but gave instructions
on how it would work,

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:34.860 align:middle line:10%
written in a Sumerian language.

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:36.640 align:middle line:10%
>> Maria Orsitsch made sketches.

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:39.250 align:middle line:10%
And they were kind of very
technical in nature, something

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:42.340 align:middle line:10%
that a woman of her background
would probably not really

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:43.990 align:middle line:10%
have a great knowledge of.

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:45.430 align:middle line:10%
And actually, from
those sketches,

00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:48.550 align:middle line:10%
the Vril society have actually
made different prototype

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:50.890 align:middle line:10%
devices, craft--

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:53.530 align:middle line:10%
one of them was
called the RFZ2--

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:55.240 align:middle line:10%
that actually flew.

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:58.090 align:middle line:10%
>> The legend continues
that Maria gave the drawings

00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:01.150 align:middle line:10%
and Sumerian texts, acquired
from her channeling,

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:05.410 align:middle line:10%
to Rudolf Hess, hoping
to continue the funding.

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:08.890 align:middle line:10%
But experts suggest that Hess
used this as an opportunity

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:12.160 align:middle line:10%
to advance his career
with the Nazi Party.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:15.400 align:middle line:10%
>> Rudolf Hess was a deputy
to Hitler and had been one

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:19.120 align:middle line:10%
of the mainstays of
the rising Nazi Party.

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:23.140 align:middle line:10%
By the time the war started,
Hess, who, by the way,

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:25.600 align:middle line:10%
was very steeped
in occultism, he

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.030 align:middle line:10%
was into big for the
spiritualism and everything

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:28.870 align:middle line:10%
else.

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:32.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Experts suggest that Maria's
contact experience could have

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.450 align:middle line:90%
united a world in peace.

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:37.180 align:middle line:84%
And that was the purpose of
the beings from Aldebaran

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:38.770 align:middle line:90%
reaching out to Maria.

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:41.437 align:middle line:84%
>> They had everything that they
needed to actually build flying

00:30:41.437 --> 00:30:42.237 align:middle line:90%
saucers.

00:30:42.237 --> 00:30:45.040 align:middle line:84%
They had the reactor that would
create the anti-gravity effect.

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:47.650 align:middle line:84%
They had the repulsine,
which was also German,

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:50.530 align:middle line:84%
that enabled them to actually
control where this thing goes

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:51.640 align:middle line:90%
and how it maneuvers.

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And they had this back
in the 1930s and '40s.

00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:57.820 align:middle line:10%
It's amazing how all these
different areas of research

00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:58.750 align:middle line:10%
are all German.

00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:00.040 align:middle line:10%
They put them all together.

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:01.870 align:middle line:10%
And what you get
when you put them

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:04.270 align:middle line:10%
all together is a flying saucer.

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Could Maria Orsitsch's
encounter with beings from

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:11.982 align:middle line:84%
Aldebaran have given the Nazis
the most superior technology?

00:31:11.982 --> 00:31:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>> If there's one thing we can
say for sure about the Nazis

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:17.200 align:middle line:84%
during the Second World War,
it's that their technology was

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.420 align:middle line:84%
highly advanced--
in many respects,

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:21.880 align:middle line:84%
far more advanced
than the Allies'.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.950 align:middle line:84%
Their scientists, for
example, in the fields

00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:28.280 align:middle line:84%
of rocketry, biological
warfare, chemical warfare,

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:31.060 align:middle line:84%
they were years ahead
of everybody else.

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:34.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Could influential people on
the planet be receiving contact

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:38.050 align:middle line:84%
from other worldly sources
to continue their agenda here

00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:39.130 align:middle line:90%
on Earth?

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:42.040 align:middle line:84%
If so, could Philip K.
Dick have given us art

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.710 align:middle line:90%
that portrays our true reality?

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:47.110 align:middle line:10%
Did Maria Orsitsch give
the world technology

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:49.330 align:middle line:10%
to travel to space?

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Researchers have long suggested
that there is no doubt

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:56.590 align:middle line:84%
that the technology developed by
the Germans during World War II

00:31:56.590 --> 00:32:00.070 align:middle line:84%
has affected the world
we live in today.

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:02.770 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible these
technological advancements

00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:06.300 align:middle line:84%
were given to us by
a progenitor race?
