00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Years ago, the great
screen actor, Jimmy Cagney,

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.490 align:middle line:10%
was working with a young actress
that was about to be fired.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.123 align:middle line:10%
He went to the director and
said let me talk to her.

00:00:51.123 --> 00:00:52.540 align:middle line:10%
And he walked over
to the actress.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.440 align:middle line:10%
And he said, look, it's simple.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.850 align:middle line:10%
You walk in the room, you plant
your feet, look me in the eye,

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:01.650 align:middle line:10%
and tell the truth.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.690 align:middle line:90%


00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.140 align:middle line:10%
The logo of the "X-Files"
is the truth is out there.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.040 align:middle line:10%
The truth is out there.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.180 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to paraphrase.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.470 align:middle line:10%
The truth is in here.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.380 align:middle line:84%
>> For decades, the demand
for disclosure has become one

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.650 align:middle line:84%
of the most highly debated
subjects around the world.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.790 align:middle line:84%
Eyewitness accounts of
UFOs from the average Joe

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.130 align:middle line:84%
to former presidents
have been documented.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.560 align:middle line:10%
>> I and about 25 others saw
something in the air that

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.770 align:middle line:10%
changed colors and was round.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.570 align:middle line:10%
It came.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.870 align:middle line:10%
>> But still, no confirmation
from an official source that

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.300 align:middle line:10%
we're not alone.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.580 align:middle line:84%
>> It comes to Area 51
and whether or not the US

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.000 align:middle line:84%
government knows of aliens,
should Secretary Clinton be

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.800 align:middle line:90%
elected president.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, what I've talked to
the secretary about and what she

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.330 align:middle line:10%
said now in public is that if
she's elected president and she

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.190 align:middle line:10%
gets into office, she'll ask for
as many records as the United

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.040 align:middle line:10%
States federal government
has to be declassified.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a commitment
that she intends to keep.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>> But some researchers believe
that the government and elite

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.360 align:middle line:84%
have been disclosing
information for years.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.880 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't believe in
government disclosure.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.980 align:middle line:10%
When I think of official
government disclosure,

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.070 align:middle line:10%
I think of the president
sitting in the Oval

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.570 align:middle line:10%
Office with the paned windows
and the pictures of his family

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.260 align:middle line:10%
over his shoulder, telling
us that aliens have been here

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.660 align:middle line:10%
for a long time, maybe
millions of years.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And they've manipulated
our genetics.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And we've been lying to you
about it for at least 70 years.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.300 align:middle line:84%
I am skeptical that that's
actually going to happen.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.220 align:middle line:10%
Because I don't see
any political advantage

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.540 align:middle line:10%
in the people who are
in power for telling us

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.340 align:middle line:10%
that information.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.600 align:middle line:10%
All it will do is destabilize.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you introduce
a destabilizing element

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.820 align:middle line:84%
into the body politic, the
only thing it can happen

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.800 align:middle line:84%
is the guys at the
top can go down.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.960 align:middle line:10%
Having said that,
there appears to be

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.747 align:middle line:10%
a pattern of
unofficial disclosure

00:02:53.747 --> 00:02:55.205 align:middle line:10%
that's going on
through our movies,

00:02:55.205 --> 00:02:57.410 align:middle line:10%
through our television
shows where they're

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.900 align:middle line:10%
getting the information
out, letting it leak

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.840 align:middle line:10%
bit by bit-- a document here,
a document there, a sighting

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.580 align:middle line:10%
here, a sighting there.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.580 align:middle line:84%
>> While I have a great deal
of respect for the people

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.760 align:middle line:84%
in the disclosure movement,
I think they're looking

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.200 align:middle line:90%
in the wrong direction.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, the other
side of the coin is

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.910 align:middle line:84%
whether there are people on the
inside who want to disclose.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.640 align:middle line:10%
And the evidence that
I found is that there's

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.370 align:middle line:10%
almost like a
silent battle or war

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.880 align:middle line:10%
going on, where some of the
people want to disclose.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.670 align:middle line:10%
>> Material there that
certainly makes me think twice.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Other people don't
want to disclose.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.150 align:middle line:10%
And those who don't want
to disclose, I think,

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.030 align:middle line:10%
are the ones who
have the upper hand.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.730 align:middle line:10%
They're the ones sitting on
the technology and the bodies.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.910 align:middle line:10%
The ones who do want to
disclose are the ones

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.500 align:middle line:10%
who found out about
this and think

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.170 align:middle line:10%
the world should know about it.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.630 align:middle line:10%
>> I think in that theory,
you can ultimately put

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.350 align:middle line:10%
in the writers and the Hollywood
producers that have a genuine

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.520 align:middle line:10%
interest in this.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.530 align:middle line:10%
I think it's safe to
say that maybe they

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.900 align:middle line:10%
want to have the public
a little bit more

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.240 align:middle line:10%
prepared for these
types of ideas,

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.570 align:middle line:10%
that it ultimately may
be them that's leading us

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.540 align:middle line:10%
to disclosure, so to speak.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.080 align:middle line:84%
>> If disclosure is indeed
leaking slowly into the general

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.920 align:middle line:84%
public by way of producers,
writers, and artists,

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.010 align:middle line:84%
how long have we been under the
influence of their information?

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.000 align:middle line:10%
>> If we think back to the time
of the Elizabethan era when you

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.020 align:middle line:10%
had a lot of playwrights like
George Herbert, Ben Jonson,

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.060 align:middle line:10%
John Donne, they were writing
plays along with Shakespeare,

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.543 align:middle line:10%
of course, in that period
when alchemy was the rage.

00:04:32.543 --> 00:04:34.460 align:middle line:84%
So they would actually
write alchemical themes

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:35.690 align:middle line:90%
into a lot of their plays.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.860 align:middle line:10%
I think John Donne even has a
piece called "Love's Alchemy."

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.600 align:middle line:84%
Some of these guys
actually were spies.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.110 align:middle line:84%
One of whom would be, of course,
John Dee, the original "007,"

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.740 align:middle line:84%
who was the court magis and
spy for Queen Elizabeth.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.010 align:middle line:84%
So all the way back to that
period, British Renaissance,

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.040 align:middle line:84%
we can see the
use of the theater

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.770 align:middle line:84%
as a means of
propaganda that tied

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.890 align:middle line:84%
into the crown, the use
of spies who were also

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.540 align:middle line:90%
sometimes playwrights.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And they were very
much into the esoteric,

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.530 align:middle line:84%
into alchemy in these
hermetic traditions.

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.280 align:middle line:10%
The British have done
that for a long time

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.680 align:middle line:10%
where they transmitted messages
through cryptograms and things

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.540 align:middle line:10%
like that, that would be in
fringe or odd publications.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.570 align:middle line:84%
The Globe Theatre--
the world is a globe.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:20.960 align:middle line:90%
It's a [INAUDIBLE] as well.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.680 align:middle line:84%
You start realizing that
film uses a lot of symbology.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>> There are those who believe
the playwrights of today

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.290 align:middle line:84%
aren't educating us
about alchemy, per se,

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.867 align:middle line:84%
but projecting other kinds of
imagery into our subconscious.

00:05:33.867 --> 00:05:36.200 align:middle line:84%
>> There are a variety of
Hollywood films that have been

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.310 align:middle line:84%
coming out pretty much since
the dawn of the space program.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And they've been pushing
out various aspects

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.410 align:middle line:90%
of what's going on.

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.250 align:middle line:10%
For example, the TV shows "The
Outer Limits" and "The Twilight

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.010 align:middle line:10%
Zone" were used to push
out a lot of disclosure.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.530 align:middle line:10%
There was also a TV show
named "The Time Tunnel"

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.170 align:middle line:10%
that described portal
research being done.

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.020 align:middle line:10%
>> The movies were the ones,
especially in the '70s, that

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.630 align:middle line:10%
were starting to
get out of hand,

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.740 align:middle line:10%
a little too much
reality coming out.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And they had to curtail it with
these big blockbusters, which

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.940 align:middle line:84%
started with "Jaws"
and then just continued

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.280 align:middle line:84%
and still continuing
to this day.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.180 align:middle line:10%
I personally think
that around 1982, '83,

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.110 align:middle line:10%
the CIA purposefully took over
the entertainment business.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:20.040 align:middle line:10%
It would make logical sense
for people in the intelligence

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.510 align:middle line:10%
service--

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:26.010 align:middle line:10%
CIA, NSA-- to have
ways of monitoring

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:31.920 align:middle line:10%
how we react to certain kinds
of news stories and stimuli.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Researchers have suggested
that film-making after the late

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.360 align:middle line:84%
'70s became a control medium
to disclose certain information

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.160 align:middle line:90%
at the right time.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to talk to you
tonight from my heart.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.550 align:middle line:84%
>> No longer were the
ideas simply presented.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.620 align:middle line:84%
They became a part of
a system of knowledge.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Project Serpo or serpo.org
appeared in about 2005 just

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.030 align:middle line:90%
on the internet.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.700 align:middle line:10%
And it was supposedly
a bunch of information

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.770 align:middle line:10%
that had come from
inside government sources

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.630 align:middle line:10%
that they wanted to
get out to people,

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:08.820 align:middle line:10%
telling them about a human alien
exchange program in the 1960s

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:12.420 align:middle line:10%
and '70s, where we actually
sent 12 human beings

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.340 align:middle line:10%
to another world, which
was code named Serpo.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.120 align:middle line:10%
One of the most interesting
aspects of Project Serpo

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.650 align:middle line:10%
was that at one
point, they uploaded

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.650 align:middle line:10%
what was the transcript
of a briefing that

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:27.200 align:middle line:10%
was given to President
Reagan in 1981 about aliens.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.160 align:middle line:10%
There is the director
of CIA, William Casey.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.660 align:middle line:10%
There's President Reagan.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.640 align:middle line:10%
There's a very,
very mysterious guy

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.710 align:middle line:10%
called the caretaker
who supposedly

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.890 align:middle line:10%
is the caretaker of all
this secret information

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.530 align:middle line:10%
about our interactions
with aliens.

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:42.480 align:middle line:84%
So what they told
President Reagan

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.030 align:middle line:84%
was that the human race had
been visited for a long time

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:46.740 align:middle line:90%
by extraterrestrials.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.440 align:middle line:84%
They knew of five
extraterrestrial races,

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.410 align:middle line:84%
four of which they
considered to be friendly.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:55.200 align:middle line:84%
>> It is possible this secret
meeting was an in-depth

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.380 align:middle line:84%
collaboration between
the CIA, the government,

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.422 align:middle line:84%
and Hollywood on
mass programming.

00:08:00.422 --> 00:08:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>> As you look at films like
"Close Encounters of the Third

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.640 align:middle line:84%
Kind," which came out in
the late '70s, it had a very

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.050 align:middle line:90%
friendly view of ETs.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's fascinating
that a couple

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.940 align:middle line:84%
of years after this
briefing, Reagan

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.190 align:middle line:84%
invited Steven Spielberg
to the White House

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:17.610 align:middle line:84%
for a screening of "Close
Encounters of the Third Kind."

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:20.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Right before Reagan
was elected in 1978,

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.470 align:middle line:10%
Spielberg came out with
"Close Encounters,"

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:27.180 align:middle line:10%
which I find to be
an odd film to me.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:30.420 align:middle line:84%
"Close Encounters" is a film
where, again, the aliens are

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:34.140 align:middle line:90%
kidnapping children and people.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's all done in
this terrifying way.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:42.690 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of the
movie, these kidnappers

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:44.730 align:middle line:84%
release all the
kidnapped people.

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:45.900 align:middle line:90%
And we're all cheering.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.840 align:middle line:10%
And I'm like, why are we
cheering these aliens who

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.950 align:middle line:10%
are kidnapping people?

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:51.840 align:middle line:10%
And then the hero,
Richard Dreyfuss,

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.340 align:middle line:10%
he goes away with the aliens.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.720 align:middle line:10%
I'm like, wait a minute here.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.090 align:middle line:10%
Do you know enough about
these creatures to just jump

00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:59.490 align:middle line:10%
on a ship and go with them?

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:03.090 align:middle line:84%
I have a big problem with
Spielberg's portrayal of aliens

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.910 align:middle line:84%
in that I think that there's
a lot of mind control going

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.170 align:middle line:90%
on there.

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:11.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if he's connected
to this cabal that runs

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.450 align:middle line:90%
Hollywood, but I suspect he is.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I
suspect he is, is

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:18.750 align:middle line:84%
because the guy who started
the blockbusters that

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.660 align:middle line:84%
ended the '70s was
none other than Steven

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.340 align:middle line:90%
Spielberg with "Jaws."

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:26.370 align:middle line:84%
>> It's fascinating that a
couple of years after this

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:30.360 align:middle line:84%
briefing, Reagan invited Steven
Spielberg to the White House

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.010 align:middle line:84%
for a screening of "Close
Encounters of the Third Kind."

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:35.970 align:middle line:84%
You have the fact that there's
this guy from Hollywood

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:38.880 align:middle line:84%
with a long history in
Hollywood who becomes

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.560 align:middle line:90%
President of the United States.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Reagan, of course, is the
president who in open public

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:48.630 align:middle line:84%
seems to talk more about ETs
than any other president.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:52.980 align:middle line:10%
>> Perhaps we need some outside
universal threat to make us

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.830 align:middle line:10%
recognize this common bond.

00:09:55.830 --> 00:10:00.930 align:middle line:10%
I occasionally think how quickly
our differences worldwide

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:04.740 align:middle line:10%
would vanish if we were
facing an alien threat

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.650 align:middle line:10%
from outside this world.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And then he made these odd
statements all the time about

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:11.370 align:middle line:90%
"E.T."

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And again in his diary, he's
got these odd references

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:17.370 align:middle line:90%
to a secret space program.

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:19.920 align:middle line:10%
>> It's almost as if the
government is building

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.250 align:middle line:10%
a cushion against the
possibility that the aliens

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:25.202 align:middle line:10%
decide to just say screw this.

00:10:25.202 --> 00:10:26.160 align:middle line:90%
We're going to show up.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.077 align:middle line:84%
We're just gonna land
on the White House lawn.

00:10:28.077 --> 00:10:29.970 align:middle line:84%
We're going to appear
over your cities.

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:32.050 align:middle line:90%
And what do we do at that time?

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:33.700 align:middle line:10%
So in order to
avoid a mass panic,

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.900 align:middle line:10%
they're trying to educate
as many people as possible

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.760 align:middle line:10%
as to what's really out there.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:42.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Some believe that Project
Serpo is just an example of why

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:45.960 align:middle line:84%
the elite might use predictive
programming to disclose

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.070 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>> The best way to describe what
predictive programming would

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.130 align:middle line:84%
be, would be to look at
analogies in the realm

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:55.280 align:middle line:84%
of psychological warfare
covert operations.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:58.170 align:middle line:84%
You can actually condition
people to be acclimatized

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:00.340 align:middle line:90%
when the actual events occur.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:03.193 align:middle line:10%
So that's what I think
the most basic use

00:11:03.193 --> 00:11:05.610 align:middle line:10%
predictive programming is, is
showing things ahead of time

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:07.490 align:middle line:10%
so that people are
climatized to it.

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:11.360 align:middle line:84%
It's altering people's
consciousness at an archetypal

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.200 align:middle line:90%
or subconscious level.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.900 align:middle line:10%
So we've already
been shown something

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:18.230 align:middle line:10%
that's going to happen, maybe
in the background of a film,

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:19.490 align:middle line:10%
maybe through a novel, even.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And we might not remember
that in our conscious mind,

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:24.380 align:middle line:84%
but it's been placed
into our subconscious.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.342 align:middle line:84%
And because the mind is
basically a big supercomputer,

00:11:27.342 --> 00:11:29.300 align:middle line:84%
it's always there, even
if we don't consciously

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.970 align:middle line:84%
think of it throughout the
day, a year later, whatever.

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most obvious
examples of predictive

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:37.190 align:middle line:84%
programming might be in
the narration of our worst

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:38.825 align:middle line:90%
terrorist attacks.

00:11:38.825 --> 00:11:41.345 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:41.345 --> 00:11:47.660 align:middle line:90%


00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:52.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Chris Carter is perhaps the
most intriguing person working

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:55.310 align:middle line:10%
in Hollywood, I think, today.

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And what he did was he
created an amazing predictive

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:04.160 align:middle line:84%
programming show in April of
2001 called "The Lone Gunmen,"

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.630 align:middle line:84%
which was a spin-off
from the "X-Files."

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:09.950 align:middle line:10%
The first program, which
was written by Chris Carter,

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:14.530 align:middle line:10%
has the lone gunmen hacking
into the Pentagon computer

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:18.770 align:middle line:10%
and finding out that a
plane is going to blow up.

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:22.550 align:middle line:84%
A plane that's taking off from
Atlanta is going to blow up--

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:23.750 align:middle line:90%
they think.

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:26.780 align:middle line:84%
So one of the lone gunmen buys
a ticket for that airplane.

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.190 align:middle line:90%
And he's on the airplane.

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And he's searching for
the bomb on the plane,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.330 align:middle line:90%
but he can't find it.

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.270 align:middle line:90%
And the climax of the film--

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:37.820 align:middle line:90%
he goes, oh, my goodness.

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.620 align:middle line:90%
There is no bomb on the plane.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:40.490 align:middle line:90%
>> There is no bomb.

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:42.890 align:middle line:90%
>> The plane is the bomb.

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And he runs up and he
opens up the pilot door

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:47.390 align:middle line:84%
to tell them that the
plane is the bomb.

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And the pilot goes, somebody is
taking control of my airplane.

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:56.437 align:middle line:84%
And somebody has taken
remote control of this 747.

00:12:56.437 --> 00:12:57.770 align:middle line:90%
And you look through the window.

00:12:57.770 --> 00:13:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And there is the twin
towers coming at them.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And they're heading right
towards the twin towers

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:04.100 align:middle line:90%
in this airplane.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.370 align:middle line:90%
And the lone gunman--

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:08.600 align:middle line:84%
he somehow communicates
with his two buddies.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.370 align:middle line:84%
They hack into the
Pentagon computer.

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:13.430 align:middle line:84%
They find the remote control
program for the airplane.

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And they disable it
right at the last second.

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:18.560 align:middle line:84%
It just barely misses
the World Trade Center.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- came out
five months before 9/11.

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:25.660 align:middle line:84%
The really unnerving part about
that is nobody talks about it.

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.440 align:middle line:90%
You don't see anybody anywhere.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.300 align:middle line:10%
Nobody asked Chris
Carter about it.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:33.080 align:middle line:10%
Everybody is quiet
about this episode,

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.800 align:middle line:10%
this unbelievable television
show that predicted 9/11,

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.260 align:middle line:10%
down to unbelievably
precise details.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.040 align:middle line:10%
>> And Chris Carter is a great
example of somebody who would

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.520 align:middle line:10%
be used by the government to
get information out in a slow,

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:50.720 align:middle line:10%
steady, drip, drip drip
timed release, aspirin way.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:54.110 align:middle line:10%
That's the way that the
Brookings report recommended

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:55.730 align:middle line:10%
the information be put out--

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:58.670 align:middle line:10%
little by little, by little,
one piece at a time, one

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:01.580 align:middle line:10%
step at a time over a
very long period of time.

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is true, where
else can we find examples

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:08.045 align:middle line:84%
of predictive programming in
our current entertainment?

00:14:08.045 --> 00:14:11.510 align:middle line:90%


00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:13.910 align:middle line:84%
>> To my understanding, many
sci-fi films on TV have been

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:15.950 align:middle line:90%
used to reveal the truth.

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:18.650 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of
fact, many TV shows

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:22.220 align:middle line:84%
have been very remarkable in how
much they have disclosed to us.

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:24.980 align:middle line:10%
"Stargate SG-1" is a
great example of this.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.180 align:middle line:10%
Almost every season of
the show is giving you

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:29.780 align:middle line:10%
very intense disclosure
about a US team

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:32.540 align:middle line:10%
within the military that
is using portal technology

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.733 align:middle line:10%
and traveling to other
worlds to meet other people

00:14:34.733 --> 00:14:35.650 align:middle line:10%
throughout the galaxy.

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:38.355 align:middle line:10%


00:14:38.355 --> 00:14:40.730 align:middle line:10%
>> So can you just talk a bit
about the inception of this

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:43.022 align:middle line:10%
whole series, and where you
guys came up with the idea,

00:14:43.022 --> 00:14:45.530 align:middle line:10%
and just continuing
this whole franchise?

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:46.770 align:middle line:10%
>> It was Robert's idea.

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:51.510 align:middle line:90%


00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:53.940 align:middle line:10%
>> We originally,
actually pitched a movie,

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.040 align:middle line:10%
which we've done a lot of times.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:59.690 align:middle line:10%
And maybe we're just not
that good at pitching movies.

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.070 align:middle line:10%
Because somehow it evolved
into a TV show again.

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:03.600 align:middle line:10%
And both the studio
and the network

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.760 align:middle line:10%
wanted "Stargate" on the air.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.730 align:middle line:10%
And I think it was just--

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:12.130 align:middle line:10%
the challenge was to find
a way to shake things up.

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>> The "Stargate
Universe" opened in 2009.

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:18.210 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning,
a nerd is trying

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:20.928 align:middle line:90%
to solve a video game puzzle.

00:15:20.928 --> 00:15:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And he's on the
phone with his buddy.

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:23.838 align:middle line:90%
He says, I think I solved it.

00:15:23.838 --> 00:15:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And the guy is like,
nobody can solve that.

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:27.110 align:middle line:90%
He goes, no, I think I got it.

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:28.680 align:middle line:90%
And then he hits the button.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.780 align:middle line:10%
And the whole computer
just goes black.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:33.240 align:middle line:10%
And he's like, wait,
what's going on?

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.180 align:middle line:10%
I solved the puzzle, and
it just went black on me.

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:39.150 align:middle line:10%
And then almost immediately,
the doorbell rings.

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:40.140 align:middle line:10%
And he goes downstairs.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.015 align:middle line:10%
He opens up the door.

00:15:41.015 --> 00:15:44.910 align:middle line:10%
And there is a professorial
looking guy and a military guy.

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:48.840 align:middle line:10%
And they're saying, you need
to come to the spaceship that's

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.040 align:middle line:10%
orbiting Earth right now.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.850 align:middle line:10%
And the guy goes,
yeah, right, dude.

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:52.650 align:middle line:10%
Whatever.

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:53.733 align:middle line:10%
He slams the door on them.

00:15:53.733 --> 00:15:55.740 align:middle line:10%
And he starts walking
up the stairs.

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:59.280 align:middle line:10%
And he disappears and he
reappears in this spaceship

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.600 align:middle line:10%
that's orbiting the Earth.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.760 align:middle line:90%
Clearly, a secret space program.

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.570 align:middle line:84%
There is just no doubt
about it, using portals

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:08.790 align:middle line:84%
to get around, all
through the universe.

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And they use the
video game puzzle

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:18.670 align:middle line:84%
to find out who was smart
enough to be in the secret space

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:19.470 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
absolutely using video games

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:25.140 align:middle line:90%
to find out who is--

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:28.380 align:middle line:84%
again, who is perceptive,
who is knowledgeable,

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:30.750 align:middle line:90%
who can handle this, even.

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:34.810 align:middle line:10%
>> It seems to be people
with super high intellect.

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:36.720 align:middle line:10%
And I've written about
a series of physicists

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:39.120 align:middle line:10%
that have disappeared
and haven't been found.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.310 align:middle line:84%
There's also a series
of college-age men

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:43.650 align:middle line:84%
that have disappeared
and haven't been found.

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to be the cream of
the crop at that higher level,

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:53.580 align:middle line:84%
seem to disappear at a higher
frequency than should be.

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.710 align:middle line:10%
>> When you look at shows
like "Stargate Universe,"

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:58.050 align:middle line:10%
and "Ender's Game," and even
the "South Park" episode,

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:00.010 align:middle line:10%
they're actually
recruiting tools,

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:01.510 align:middle line:10%
telling kids that
if you get really,

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:04.829 align:middle line:10%
really good at these games,
you'll be very useful to us

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:05.680 align:middle line:10%
in the future.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.230 align:middle line:90%
And I think that that's--

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:09.970 align:middle line:84%
the actual purpose of it is to
get the word out that playing

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:12.420 align:middle line:84%
games like this--
it's not really

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:14.010 align:middle line:90%
just a recreational thing.

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:15.510 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a
skill set that we're

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:18.750 align:middle line:84%
going to need as we move
forward into the next century.

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:22.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Expert witnesses like
Randy Cramer have experienced

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:26.040 align:middle line:10%
firsthand video mind control
while training at Dugway

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.109 align:middle line:10%
Proving Grounds in Utah.

00:17:28.109 --> 00:17:32.410 align:middle line:10%
>> Dugway is the center
for chemical, biological,

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:35.650 align:middle line:10%
radiological training
and prevention.

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:37.800 align:middle line:10%
So they train HAZMAT teams.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.690 align:middle line:10%
And we used to train people
for the zombie virus.

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:42.990 align:middle line:10%
Our oil to that
water of that mix,

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:46.290 align:middle line:10%
when all this zombie apocalypse
propaganda, scary zombie

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:54.210 align:middle line:10%
movies come out, was to push the
notion of zombie video games.

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:56.730 align:middle line:84%
Because a zombie movie is
designed to scare you and make

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:57.630 align:middle line:90%
you go, ah.

00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:00.660 align:middle line:84%
A zombie video game is designed
to make you conquer your fear,

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:04.110 align:middle line:84%
find a shotgun, and shoot
that zombie in the face.

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:06.630 align:middle line:84%
Basically, by creating
zombie video games,

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:11.220 align:middle line:84%
we took the fear away and
created a subculture of 18

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:14.580 align:middle line:84%
to 22-year-olds, that if
there was a zombie apocalypse,

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:16.920 align:middle line:84%
they'd be getting in a pickup
truck with their buddies

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.680 align:middle line:84%
and go around with ammo
and beer, shooting zombies.

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.777 align:middle line:90%
>> Get in.

00:18:20.777 --> 00:18:22.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been to the zombie
land training facility.

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:23.370 align:middle line:90%
I've been there.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:24.170 align:middle line:90%
It's wild.

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:25.710 align:middle line:90%
It's just absolutely wild.

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:27.390 align:middle line:90%
They call it Zombieland.

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:28.680 align:middle line:10%
Anyone who's seen the movie--

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:33.180 align:middle line:10%
I'm just telling you, whoever
wrote the script, got a manual,

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:36.982 align:middle line:10%
got a survival manual
for Zombieland at Dugway

00:18:36.982 --> 00:18:38.440 align:middle line:10%
and looked through
it and was like,

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.590 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to make a
movie script out of this.

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:43.950 align:middle line:84%
>> If these are examples of how
Hollywood is creating agendas

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:47.670 align:middle line:84%
based on predictive programming,
is it also possible that

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:51.060 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, the
government is falsely disclosing

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:54.480 align:middle line:84%
information so that the general
public will never be able

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.000 align:middle line:84%
to connect the
dots to the truth?

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.790 align:middle line:10%
>> Gary McKinnon was someone
who became not just famous,

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:03.030 align:middle line:10%
but infamous when you followed
and also within the mainstream

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:07.380 align:middle line:10%
media in the early 2000s, just
up to a couple of years ago,

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:11.760 align:middle line:10%
chiefly because he hacked NASA
and various other departments

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:16.620 align:middle line:10%
and agencies, looking for
classified material on UFOs.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.230 align:middle line:84%
He came across this
list of what looked

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:22.412 align:middle line:84%
like a fleet of
military personnel,

00:19:22.412 --> 00:19:24.120 align:middle line:84%
but they were described
under the heading

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.220 align:middle line:90%
of non-terrestrial officers.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:29.550 align:middle line:84%
But with McKinnon, it was
very quickly washed away.

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:31.200 align:middle line:90%
It was swept under the table.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:36.290 align:middle line:84%
I do sometimes wonder if
there was a reason beyond just

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:38.023 align:middle line:90%
humanitarian rights.

00:19:38.023 --> 00:19:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think the reason
could have been--

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:43.530 align:middle line:84%
if we look at the parallels
with Edward Snowden,

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:46.790 align:middle line:84%
he blew the whistle
on this massive NSA

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:48.410 align:middle line:90%
program of data mining.

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:51.755 align:middle line:84%
And yet, even today, a few
years later, what we've got

00:19:51.755 --> 00:19:54.380 align:middle line:84%
are people just still
baying for his blood.

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:55.490 align:middle line:90%
They want him jailed.

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:58.100 align:middle line:84%
Some people want him
executed as a traitor.

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:01.220 align:middle line:84%
It's possible that a
secret space program, which

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:03.140 align:middle line:90%
it seems like McKinnon found--

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:04.610 align:middle line:84%
all of this could
potentially come

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:06.620 align:middle line:90%
tumbling out in the court case.

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:09.500 align:middle line:84%
I do sometimes wonder
if possibly McKinnon

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.800 align:middle line:84%
was too much of a hot
potato to deal with,

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.900 align:middle line:90%
so they just said let him go.

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.670 align:middle line:90%
It's going to die away.

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:19.430 align:middle line:84%
And everyone will
forget about it.

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:21.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Not to sound like
a conspiracy theorist,

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:23.460 align:middle line:10%
but think that the
government is involved,

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:25.700 align:middle line:10%
especially with someone
like Edward Snowden,

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:28.430 align:middle line:10%
that they actually put him up
to release that information.

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And although it sounds
like a crazy idea,

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:33.500 align:middle line:84%
I think that ultimately,
we didn't learn anything

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:34.623 align:middle line:90%
from Edward Snowden.

00:20:34.623 --> 00:20:36.290 align:middle line:84%
The problem is you
have a lot of stories

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:38.600 align:middle line:84%
that get connected to
WikiLeaks or get connected

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.480 align:middle line:84%
to Edward Snowden
that says WikiLeaks

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.400 align:middle line:84%
released UFO documents that
prove extraterrestrials

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.200 align:middle line:90%
are here.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.810 align:middle line:84%
Or Edward Snowden
releases a UFO photograph

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:51.660 align:middle line:84%
that proves extraterrestrial
technology exists.

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:54.623 align:middle line:84%
The problem with it, though, is
when you actually research it,

00:20:54.623 --> 00:20:56.540 align:middle line:84%
neither of those stories
actually connect back

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.730 align:middle line:90%
to WikiLeaks or Edward Snowden.

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And so you've got a
lot of false stories

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:03.470 align:middle line:84%
that start to come
out and surface,

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:07.690 align:middle line:84%
that I think it does
more harm than good.

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:10.600 align:middle line:10%
>> If the government is
providing fake disclosure,

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:13.060 align:middle line:10%
so we aren't able to
get the real answers,

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:17.110 align:middle line:10%
why would Hollywood be
disclosing certain information?

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:20.170 align:middle line:10%
Some believe that the government
and Hollywood are actually

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:23.230 align:middle line:10%
working together to
tap into our fears,

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:27.430 align:middle line:10%
wants, and needs by
using the internet.

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:28.913 align:middle line:10%
>> Patricia Jenkins has a book--

00:21:28.913 --> 00:21:29.830 align:middle line:10%
Hollywood and the CIA.

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:31.288 align:middle line:10%
And she mentions
a lot of directors

00:21:31.288 --> 00:21:33.640 align:middle line:10%
who have actually
collaborated with the CIA.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.550 align:middle line:84%
I definitely think that for
a lot of people, if they're

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:39.340 align:middle line:84%
interested in
cabalism or gematria,

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:41.170 align:middle line:84%
they're interested
in numerology.

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And so they're playing
with 9s and 11s.

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:45.970 align:middle line:10%
And they're playing with
the timing and the dates

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:47.202 align:middle line:10%
of when you release things.

00:21:47.202 --> 00:21:49.660 align:middle line:10%
Or when you put things out is
very important in numerology.

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.120 align:middle line:10%
So again, depending
on who's doing it

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.730 align:middle line:10%
and what their views are,
you might have a certain time

00:21:54.730 --> 00:22:00.610 align:middle line:10%
of year where releasing a
certain symbolism or imagery

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:03.640 align:middle line:10%
is believed to have a
certain charged effect

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:04.690 align:middle line:10%
in a magic sense.

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:06.190 align:middle line:90%
But numerology is interesting.

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Because ultimately,
everything that we experience

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:13.060 align:middle line:84%
is delineated-- or I don't
want to say determined

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:14.200 align:middle line:90%
in a predetermined sense.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.500 align:middle line:84%
But everything can be
conceptualized or imaged

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.060 align:middle line:90%
in a mathematical way, right?

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:23.000 align:middle line:10%
So this is how the NSA does its
real world tracking of events,

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.480 align:middle line:10%
is that it translates everything
into an algorithm, which

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:27.400 align:middle line:10%
is then stored on a computer.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:30.237 align:middle line:10%
And William Benny and his
revelations about the NSA--

00:22:30.237 --> 00:22:31.820 align:middle line:10%
he said, I worked
on these algorithms,

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:33.860 align:middle line:10%
that I could actually
track your whole life.

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And it would be stored
in a single profile.

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And we know everything
about the details of what

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:39.460 align:middle line:90%
you did at certain points.

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:42.700 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is true, is it
possible that disclosure

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.520 align:middle line:90%
literally is in our hands?

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:49.060 align:middle line:84%
One man stumbled upon this
truth while developing a product

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:51.730 align:middle line:90%
to monitor stock market trends.

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:55.930 align:middle line:10%
>> I am back with someone you
might know and appreciate named

00:22:55.930 --> 00:23:00.100 align:middle line:10%
Clif High, owner/creator
of the Web Bot report.

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:04.570 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1997, Clif High discovered
that his simple invention,

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:08.590 align:middle line:84%
the Web Bot, was picking up
more than stock market trends.

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:13.000 align:middle line:84%
It was compiling complicated
human emotional algorithms.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.900 align:middle line:84%
By monitoring news articles,
blogs, social media,

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.540 align:middle line:84%
and other forms of
chatter, Clif High

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:23.260 align:middle line:84%
believes that he was able to
predict 9/11 and the stock

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:26.050 align:middle line:90%
market crash of 2008.

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Experts suggest his system
is similar to how the NSA

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:34.150 align:middle line:84%
or CIA had been monitoring
the emotional tensions created

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:37.360 align:middle line:84%
by each individual
user on the internet.

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Could it be possible
that the Web Bot is proof

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:43.560 align:middle line:84%
that we are driving
the disclosure?

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:47.650 align:middle line:84%
If we are driving disclosure,
how are we connected?

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:51.220 align:middle line:84%
Experts point to his
holiness Maharishi Mahesh,

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:53.590 align:middle line:84%
who has been teaching
his students for years

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:55.780 align:middle line:90%
about human connection.

00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:59.870 align:middle line:10%
>> This is what happens in
transcendental meditation.

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:03.020 align:middle line:10%
The surface activity
of the conscious mind

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:07.520 align:middle line:10%
deepens and incorporates
within its fold the depth

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:12.980 align:middle line:10%
of the subconscious and
practice, nothing remains

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:15.410 align:middle line:10%
subconscious.

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:19.550 align:middle line:10%
The whole subconscious
becomes conscious.

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:24.350 align:middle line:10%
And a man starts using
full potential of the mind.

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:29.780 align:middle line:10%
>> In Washington, DC on
June 7 and July 30, 1993,

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:32.480 align:middle line:10%
a carefully controlled
scientific study,

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.700 align:middle line:10%
later named the
Maharishi Effect,

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:38.090 align:middle line:10%
monitored a group of 4,000
transcendental meditation

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:43.280 align:middle line:10%
practitioners over the course
of two months in the DC area.

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:46.460 align:middle line:84%
The goal of this study
was to prove or disprove

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:48.830 align:middle line:84%
that a collective
consciousness of peace

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:52.040 align:middle line:84%
could reduce the
crime rate in DC.

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.470 align:middle line:10%
During this time in
history, violent crimes

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:57.680 align:middle line:10%
had been steadily increasing,
especially the last five

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.030 align:middle line:10%
months.

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:02.060 align:middle line:10%
Many in the police force
were skeptical of this study

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:03.320 align:middle line:10%
and its effects.

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.900 align:middle line:10%
However, within the
first week of the study,

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:09.320 align:middle line:10%
violent crimes began
decreasing and continued

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:14.720 align:middle line:10%
to drop with the maximum
decrease at 23.3%.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:19.010 align:middle line:84%
Once the group disbanded,
the crime rate went back up.

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Is this more proof
that we're literally

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:24.020 align:middle line:84%
controlling not only
disclosure, but our connection

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:27.230 align:middle line:84%
to other humans and
to the universe?

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Scientists have started to
embrace a possible new theory

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:33.200 align:middle line:90%
on how we are connected.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.360 align:middle line:84%
The Electric Universe
theory states

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:38.390 align:middle line:84%
that the formation and
existence of the universe

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:41.570 align:middle line:84%
can be better explained by
electricity and magnetism

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:43.730 align:middle line:90%
than by gravity alone.

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:47.300 align:middle line:84%
It recognizes connections
between diverse disciplines

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:50.690 align:middle line:84%
and the basic electrical nature
of atoms and their interactions

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:52.130 align:middle line:90%
with each other.

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:54.470 align:middle line:10%
>> The Electric Universe
is a cultural as well

00:25:54.470 --> 00:26:00.160 align:middle line:10%
as a scientific revolution that
has been millennia in coming.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.350 align:middle line:10%
It allows us to understand,
for the first time,

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:04.870 align:middle line:10%
the obsessive fear
of the planetary gods

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:08.500 align:middle line:10%
and their doomsday weapon,
the mighty thunderbolt.

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.720 align:middle line:84%
The phenomenal thunderbolt
of the planetary gods

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:13.630 align:middle line:84%
is the link between
our human story

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:17.470 align:middle line:84%
and the science of
the Electric Universe.

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:19.720 align:middle line:84%
Paradigm shifts come
from individuals

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:23.920 align:middle line:84%
and are resisted
vigorously by authorities.

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible that this
theory helps us understand

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:30.730 align:middle line:84%
our connection and our ability
to influence the future?

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:33.970 align:middle line:84%
>> We have liftoff
with Apollo 14.

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>> On February 5, 1971, Edgar
Mitchell was the sixth man

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:41.860 align:middle line:84%
to walk on the moon and also
the only man to do a series

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:46.510 align:middle line:84%
of private ESP experiments
that were approved by NASA.

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:48.490 align:middle line:84%
These experiments
were designed to see

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:51.130 align:middle line:84%
how humans could be
connected, even if they

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:53.410 align:middle line:90%
weren't on the same planet.

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:56.740 align:middle line:84%
The results started a debate
on the quantum hologram

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:59.200 align:middle line:84%
and how it's connected
to the brain.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Intuition-- we call
it our sixth sense.

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.400 align:middle line:10%
It should be called
our first sense,

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.900 align:middle line:10%
because it was around long
before our solar system

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:07.210 align:middle line:10%
when we were around.

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:09.490 align:middle line:10%
It is a basic
informational structure

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:12.070 align:middle line:10%
in nature associated
with perception.

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:15.490 align:middle line:10%
>> His experiment became his
life's purpose to prove that

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:17.800 align:middle line:10%
the universe is a
conscious hologram,

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:22.390 align:middle line:10%
and reality is a projected
illusion within that hologram.

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:24.850 align:middle line:84%
This hologram is
composed of grids

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:27.460 align:middle line:84%
created by a source
consciousness, brought

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:30.400 align:middle line:84%
into awareness by
electromagnetic energy

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:33.640 align:middle line:90%
at a physical level.

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:35.950 align:middle line:10%
Researchers suggest
that these discovered

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:40.090 align:middle line:10%
connections are making it harder
for the government and elitists

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:42.070 align:middle line:10%
to keep disclosure from us.

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:44.500 align:middle line:84%
Because the pressure from
the collective consciousness

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:48.370 align:middle line:84%
on Earth is pushing the
truth to the surface.

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:51.670 align:middle line:10%
If we are Indeed connected
in an electric universe,

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:53.740 align:middle line:10%
is the propaganda
and the entertainment

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:57.900 align:middle line:10%
we see a reflection of
our own consciousness?

00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:00.870 align:middle line:10%
If so, does that also
suggest that we are not

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:03.450 align:middle line:10%
slaves to a system
on this planet

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:06.840 align:middle line:10%
and that disclosure is
driven by our understanding

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.630 align:middle line:10%
of our place in the stars?

00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:11.550 align:middle line:10%
The big question remains--

00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:14.910 align:middle line:10%
are we ready to go
deeper into space?

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:16.950 align:middle line:84%
Could this be the
beginning of a disclosure

00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:18.780 align:middle line:90%
we haven't yet fathomed?

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And how will that
knowledge further humanity?

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:26.260 align:middle line:90%


00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:29.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Now, that's a
proper introduction.

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:32.240 align:middle line:84%
>> In the next realm of the
investigation of the secret

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:37.400 align:middle line:84%
space program, we will analyze
new data that brings us closer

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.200 align:middle line:90%
to the final frontier.

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.000 align:middle line:90%
