>> Hitler developed the Nazi
bell or the "die Glock."

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.063 align:middle line:10%
And what he did was he sent his
soldiers all around the world,

00:00:44.063 --> 00:00:46.610 align:middle line:10%
including as far as Tibet,
to get ancient records

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.990 align:middle line:10%
and information
on how to develop

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.520 align:middle line:10%
this ancient technology.

He even utilized
Maria Orsitsch, who

00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:52.760 align:middle line:10%
was a member of
the Vril Society,

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.618 align:middle line:10%
to channel information
on how to develop

00:00:54.618 --> 00:00:56.660 align:middle line:10%
this technology under the
Order of the Black Sun.

>> When Rudolf Hess witnessed
Maria Orsitsch as she channeled

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.120 align:middle line:84%
his deceased friend,
Dietrich Eckart,

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.630 align:middle line:84%
he became convinced that
she was the real deal.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.170 align:middle line:10%
Rudolf Hess had served time
in prison with Adolf Hitler,

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.150 align:middle line:10%
and they knew each other well.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.770 align:middle line:84%
It's presumed that
it was Hess who

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.980 align:middle line:84%
told Hitler about
Maria Orsitsch,

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.350 align:middle line:84%
her channeling sessions with
the light beings of Aldebaran

Famed scientist
Winfried Schumann

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.250 align:middle line:10%
recognized that the flying
saucer plans channeled by Maria

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.010 align:middle line:10%
closely resembled the
work of Austrian scientist

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.660 align:middle line:10%
Viktor Schauberger.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.020 align:middle line:84%
It was just after Hess revealed
what Maria Orsitsch was really

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.630 align:middle line:84%
up to that the Germans
essentially kidnapped

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.740 align:middle line:84%
Schauberger and put him to work
on the German flying saucers.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.670 align:middle line:84%
But who was Viktor Schauberger,
and what did he discover?

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.220 align:middle line:10%
>> Viktor Schauberger was an
Austrian inventor who worked

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.360 align:middle line:10%
actually during World War
II with the Third Reich.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.550 align:middle line:10%
And he's well-known for
his vortex mechanics.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.640 align:middle line:10%
And he worked a lot
with water vortexes.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.240 align:middle line:84%
He was early on very
interested in the way water

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.260 align:middle line:84%
purified itself in streams
through natural swirling

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.930 align:middle line:90%
and whirlpools and things.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And so the whole idea of what
we would call vortex technology

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.560 align:middle line:84%
and in a sense using water
in this case was really

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.680 align:middle line:90%
pioneered by Viktor Schauberger.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Viktor Schauberger created
an amazing vortex technology.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.460 align:middle line:84%
He actually analyzed and
studied fish in a stream.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.620 align:middle line:10%
He noticed that trout
were able to stand still

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.530 align:middle line:10%
in a moving stream because
of the vortex of the water

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:43.970 align:middle line:10%
flow over their body.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.920 align:middle line:10%
He analyzed the same
exact thing in salmon

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.690 align:middle line:10%
who were swimming upstream.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.150 align:middle line:10%
This vortex flow of water
over the fish's body

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.950 align:middle line:10%
gave him the concept
and idea to create

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.400 align:middle line:10%
a vortex-based technology that
was fundamentally based off

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.860 align:middle line:10%
of pulling instead of pushing.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.420 align:middle line:84%
So his actual
technology would allow

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.370 align:middle line:84%
you to be pulled
through space instead

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.380 align:middle line:90%
of pushing against space.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.650 align:middle line:84%
Viktor Schauberger's
egg-shaped, vortex-based engine

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.420 align:middle line:90%
became critically acclaimed.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.040 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, a
corporate conglomerate

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.470 align:middle line:84%
kidnapped him, brought
him to another country,

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.720 align:middle line:84%
forced him to sign over
the rights to his invention

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.520 align:middle line:84%
in order for him to
get back to his family.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.480 align:middle line:84%
When they did release
him back to his family,

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.930 align:middle line:84%
he was found dead
five days later.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Viktor Schauberger's a
physicist who created a device

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.590 align:middle line:10%
called a repulsine, which used
vortex generation to actually

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.420 align:middle line:10%
create lift and maneuverability
of disc-shaped objects.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.170 align:middle line:10%
The interesting thing
about his techniques

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.253 align:middle line:10%
is that Schauberger actually
believed that we were

00:03:35.253 --> 00:03:37.010 align:middle line:10%
doing things wrong in physics.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.760 align:middle line:90%
He said that birds did not fly.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.560 align:middle line:90%
They were flown.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.760 align:middle line:90%
And fish did not swim.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.110 align:middle line:90%
They were swum.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.660 align:middle line:84%
So all you really had to do
was tap into the forces that

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.020 align:middle line:84%
existed in the ether around
us, and you could actually

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.510 align:middle line:84%
generate movement and
theoretical performance

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.390 align:middle line:90%
like a flying saucer.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:04:00.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Schauberger invented a number
of unusual items and devices,

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.970 align:middle line:84%
including a flying saucer
kind of device that worked

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:11.120 align:middle line:84%
as a vortex, sort of flying
tornado vortex similar

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.190 align:middle line:90%
to a gyro also.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.620 align:middle line:84%
It's curious with
Schauberger's devices

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.279 align:middle line:84%
in that it's quite possible
that an aircraft, particularly

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.050 align:middle line:84%
a flying saucer
kind of aircraft,

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:25.810 align:middle line:84%
could actually be powered
by water as the vortex.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.180 align:middle line:10%
>> The issue regarding the
Nazis and their flying saucer

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.660 align:middle line:10%
research is there is a
basis, in fact, here.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.270 align:middle line:10%
You know, we all
know now that there

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.300 align:middle line:10%
were certain German scientists
during World War II--

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.910 align:middle line:10%
I think most prominently
Viktor Schauberger--

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.430 align:middle line:10%
who were doing
very interesting--

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.810 align:middle line:10%
let's say brilliant-- let's
say even genius-level work

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.060 align:middle line:10%
on disc-shaped airframes.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.090 align:middle line:10%
Schauberger was a
self-taught genius

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.980 align:middle line:10%
who was then
commandeered by the SS

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.330 align:middle line:10%
to work for them during the war.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.620 align:middle line:90%
He did create disc-shaped craft.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.970 align:middle line:90%
They were tested.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.960 align:middle line:10%
>> The question is, were aliens
helping the Germans develop

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.310 align:middle line:10%
technology?

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is the Germans
are very bright guys, you know?

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.280 align:middle line:84%
There's the old joke that heaven
is where the mechanics are

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.080 align:middle line:90%
German, you know?

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.580 align:middle line:84%
Hell is where the
police are German.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.440 align:middle line:90%
The Germans were brilliant.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.257 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely brilliant engineers.

00:05:20.257 --> 00:05:22.340 align:middle line:10%
And it looks like there's
a trace all the way back

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.770 align:middle line:10%
to 18th century
Prussia where they

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.860 align:middle line:10%
were working on and interested
in developing technologies,

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.330 align:middle line:10%
airship technologies and
anti-gravity technologies.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.700 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think that the aliens
are required for the Germans

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.700 align:middle line:84%
to have achieved the things that
they achieved technologically.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:38.833 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't hurt.

00:05:38.833 --> 00:05:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And there's also
the fact that you

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:41.870 align:middle line:84%
have people like
Hermann Oberth, who

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.740 align:middle line:84%
was actually the mentor
of Dr. Wernher von Braun.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.680 align:middle line:84%
The physicist behind
von Braun's engineering

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.300 align:middle line:84%
said, we had help from
people from other worlds.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.900 align:middle line:84%
>> In my mind, you have a
similar thing with Viktor

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:02.950 align:middle line:84%
Schauberger as with the ancient
Hindu texts on vimanas which

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:08.740 align:middle line:84%
talk about mercury being part
of the power system of these

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.360 align:middle line:90%
ancient craft.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And supposedly, using
mercury would be also

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.870 align:middle line:84%
in kind of a
Schauberger-type vortex.

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.730 align:middle line:84%
But you'd be using
mercury instead of water.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And mercury has many
unusual qualities.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.130 align:middle line:90%
It's an element.

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.250 align:middle line:90%
It's a metal.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.260 align:middle line:90%
It's a liquid.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.300 align:middle line:90%
It's a conductor.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.300 align:middle line:84%
You can do things with
mercury that you can't really

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:40.420 align:middle line:84%
do with any other metal or
liquid, or element really.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.815 align:middle line:84%
And that would be creating
things like mercury gyros.

00:06:44.815 --> 00:06:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And a mercury gyro would
then be a sealed gyro

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:54.760 align:middle line:84%
with mercury inside it,
moving as a liquid in a vortex

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.540 align:middle line:90%
or a gyroscopic kind of action.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And then if you were to
introduce electricity

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:08.380 align:middle line:84%
into that gyro of mercury, you
would electrify that mercury,

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:13.090 align:middle line:84%
and it would become a plasma,
an electrified gas that's

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:19.810 align:middle line:84%
spinning in a toroidal or
gyroscopic-type movement.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.470 align:middle line:10%
And scientists have used
gyroscopes for years

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:28.450 align:middle line:10%
as an example of artificial
gravity and anti-gravity.

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:33.190 align:middle line:10%
So in a sense of a craft that's
using this kind of vortex

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.520 align:middle line:10%
technology, especially
one with mercury,

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:42.430 align:middle line:10%
is a very viable kind of
flying saucer-type craft.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And the other interesting thing
about such a craft like that

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.610 align:middle line:84%
is that once you've introduced
electricity to the mercury

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:51.340 align:middle line:84%
vortex, it's going
to light it up,

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.010 align:middle line:84%
and the thing will
be extremely bright.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.860 align:middle line:10%
So if you were to see
this thing flying,

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:01.930 align:middle line:10%
it would be much as many UFOs
are described where there

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:06.400 align:middle line:10%
is this spinning top
kind of gyro thing

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.440 align:middle line:10%
that's also very brightly lit,
sometimes with even lights that

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.910 align:middle line:10%
are flashing or
flickering or spinning

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:18.250 align:middle line:10%
along the edge of the craft.

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is exactly how a
mercury gyro would really

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.748 align:middle line:90%
look like and act like.

00:08:24.748 --> 00:08:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the Germans were
mounting expeditions all over

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.560 align:middle line:84%
the world in the 1930s, because
they were looking primarily

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.990 align:middle line:90%
for mystical devices, you know?

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.299 align:middle line:84%
Their technology was
very, very advanced.

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:36.640 align:middle line:84%
Their aviation technology
was way beyond anything

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:37.990 align:middle line:90%
the United States developed.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:40.809 align:middle line:84%
>> The ancients were fascinated
with mercury all over

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:42.190 align:middle line:90%
the world.

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:45.950 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese and the ancient
Mexicans and Mayans.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And mercury is usually an
offshoot of gold production,

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:50.960 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:51.760 align:middle line:90%
But yeah.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.720 align:middle line:10%
When you have the ancient
texts like the vimana text,

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:59.110 align:middle line:10%
mercury is clearly
talked about there.

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:02.830 align:middle line:10%
So mercury was a very important
thing for ancient people.

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:05.200 align:middle line:90%
But mercury is a deadly poison.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.450 align:middle line:84%
Working with mercury,
you shouldn't do that.

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:10.630 align:middle line:84%
Mercury gas is
completely deadly.

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:12.820 align:middle line:84%
Mercury needs to be handled
very, very carefully

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.310 align:middle line:90%
and in a closed environment.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:18.930 align:middle line:84%
So exactly what ancient
people were doing with mercury

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:23.620 align:middle line:84%
is kind of a mystery, although
spacecraft and stuff is really

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.580 align:middle line:84%
the obvious thing to do with it,
and other mining technologies.

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:31.390 align:middle line:84%
Mercury really comes from
the mineral called cinnabar.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:33.820 align:middle line:90%
And cinnabar is a Sanskrit word.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:38.470 align:middle line:84%
So even geologically
and mineralogically,

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:41.650 align:middle line:84%
words for mercury and
cinnabar come really

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:43.570 align:middle line:90%
from ancient Sanskrit.

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:46.390 align:middle line:84%
Mercury too in
Western tradition,

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:50.920 align:middle line:84%
Mercury was the Greek
god of communication.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.133 align:middle line:90%
He flew through the air.

00:09:53.133 --> 00:09:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And so with the
ancient people, it

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:58.120 align:middle line:84%
would seem that mercury and
flight are very carefully

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.850 align:middle line:90%
associated with each other.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:03.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Using Schauberger's
vortex technology,

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:07.210 align:middle line:84%
the Germans perfected the
device they called the bell.

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:08.890 align:middle line:10%
What other research
were the Germans

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:12.280 align:middle line:10%
doing during this
period of time?

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.600 align:middle line:10%
>> I like to put it this way.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:19.570 align:middle line:10%
If you stop and think of the
modern American or Western

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:22.810 align:middle line:10%
military arsenal,
stealth aircraft,

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:25.420 align:middle line:10%
guided missiles, you know,
heat-seeking guided missiles,

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:28.630 align:middle line:10%
acoustic homing
missiles, lasers,

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:31.980 align:middle line:10%
fiber optic
communication, telephony

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:37.480 align:middle line:10%
by optical communication
rather than radio waves,

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.662 align:middle line:10%
fuel air bombs, thermobaric
bombs, particle beams,

00:10:41.662 --> 00:10:43.120 align:middle line:10%
you know, directed
energy weapons--

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.280 align:middle line:10%
we can go on and on and on.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, the bottom line is that
if you look at the Nazi arsenal

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:54.970 align:middle line:84%
as it stood at the conclusion
of World War II in Europe,

00:10:54.970 --> 00:11:00.550 align:middle line:84%
what you have is basically
an inventory or a catalog,

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:06.250 align:middle line:84%
if you will, of all
of the weapons systems

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:10.180 align:middle line:84%
that we now take for granted
in their generation one

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:11.922 align:middle line:90%
prototypical form.

00:11:11.922 --> 00:11:14.380 align:middle line:10%
>> If there's one thing we can
say for sure about the Nazis

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:17.110 align:middle line:10%
during the Second World War,
it's that their technology was

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:18.190 align:middle line:10%
highly advanced.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:21.820 align:middle line:10%
In many respects, far more
advanced than the Allies,

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:25.230 align:middle line:10%
even though that ultimately,
thank goodness, we won the war.

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:28.560 align:middle line:84%
Their scientists, for example,
in the field of rocketry

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.100 align:middle line:84%
and biological warfare,
chemical warfare,

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.250 align:middle line:84%
they were years ahead
of everybody else.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:36.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's really only due
to the fact that Hitler sort

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:39.608 align:middle line:84%
of took on the entire planet,
but eventually got overwhelmed.

00:11:39.608 --> 00:11:41.650 align:middle line:84%
You know, he had the Allies
coming from one side,

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:43.460 align:middle line:90%
the Russians from the other.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
Japan fell when

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:47.720 align:middle line:84%
we developed the atomic bomb,
and that brought the war

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.640 align:middle line:90%
to an end.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.340 align:middle line:10%
But had all of
that not happened,

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:54.310 align:middle line:10%
the chances are that the
Germans probably would have won,

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.710 align:middle line:10%
if Hitler had sort of taken
on one place at a time

00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:59.710 align:middle line:10%
and then another and another.

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>> The Germans primarily
did their saucer research

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.532 align:middle line:84%
in an area of what is now
Poland, called Silesia.

00:12:05.532 --> 00:12:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
interesting, because this

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:12.520 align:middle line:84%
is the area where the original
Prussian researchers were

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.940 align:middle line:84%
situated back in the 1800s that
sent people to America to do

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:16.960 align:middle line:90%
airship research.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.580 align:middle line:90%
In my opinion, anyway.

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.110 align:middle line:10%
And it was also the
area that Hitler

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:23.080 align:middle line:10%
protected to the
very, very last moment

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.250 align:middle line:10%
at the end of World War II.

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:27.040 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the pattern
of the Third Army of General

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.900 align:middle line:90%
Patton, they crossed the Rhine.

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:31.225 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment, the big
political prize is Berlin.

00:12:31.225 --> 00:12:33.100 align:middle line:84%
We all wanted to beat
the Russians to Berlin,

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.580 align:middle line:84%
because to possess Berlin meant
that we possessed Germany.

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:40.270 align:middle line:10%
Instead, Patton is diverted
directly to Silesia,

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:41.860 align:middle line:10%
because that was
the area where they

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.780 align:middle line:10%
had the Nazi bell,
other technologies they

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.010 align:middle line:10%
were developing.

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:47.050 align:middle line:10%
Super weapons that Hitler
talked about and that

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:48.590 align:middle line:10%
had to be protected
at all costs.

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:50.560 align:middle line:84%
So that must have
really galled Patton

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.050 align:middle line:84%
that he couldn't go get the
prize, which was Berlin.

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And instead, he had
to go to Silesia

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:59.240 align:middle line:84%
and capture these German
technology factories.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.750 align:middle line:10%
The Nazis got very far in
their technological research.

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.100 align:middle line:84%
Hitler kept telling
everybody that there

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:04.810 align:middle line:84%
were going to be super
weapons, wonder weapons that

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:06.518 align:middle line:84%
were going to come
out of there that were

00:13:06.518 --> 00:13:08.410 align:middle line:90%
going to save Nazi Germany.

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:11.080 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they developed
the jet fighters, the Me 262,

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.060 align:middle line:84%
the fastest, most
amazing jet aircraft

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.380 align:middle line:90%
in the world at the time.

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:17.200 align:middle line:84%
They developed the Horten Ho
229, which I happen to think

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.000 align:middle line:84%
is what Kenneth
Arnold saw in 1947.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.350 align:middle line:10%
A Squadron of Ho 229s operating
out of McChord Air Force base

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:24.190 align:middle line:10%
near Mount Rainier.

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:26.960 align:middle line:10%


00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Through the FBI, I actually
got probably about seven

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:33.920 align:middle line:10%
or eight really
interesting documents.

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.570 align:middle line:10%
Essentially,
interviews that the FBI

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:37.700 align:middle line:10%
had done at the end of
the Second World War

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:42.260 align:middle line:10%
with Luftwaffe pilots and
German military personnel who

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.510 align:middle line:10%
claimed to have seen
saucer-like craft

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:48.080 align:middle line:10%
bend test flown at military
bases in both Germany

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.380 align:middle line:10%
and Austria.

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And they were sort of
anywhere from 30 feet

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:53.120 align:middle line:90%
to 60 feet in diameter.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And for want of a better
term, flying saucers.

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And these interviews were
taken very seriously,

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.515 align:middle line:84%
and the FBI has now
actually loaded them

00:14:00.515 --> 00:14:03.620 align:middle line:84%
onto their website, The Vault,
so you can read them there.

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:07.100 align:middle line:84%
And for that reason,
I do think there's

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:09.710 align:middle line:84%
good evidence that
the Nazis were working

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:12.930 align:middle line:84%
on circular aircraft,
which, you know,

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:15.050 align:middle line:84%
potentially could
have not just worked

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:19.070 align:middle line:84%
in the Earth's atmosphere,
but outside of the atmosphere.

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:21.860 align:middle line:10%
>> After the war, it's generally
believed that the Germans took

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.250 align:middle line:10%
their research from
Nazi Germany to Norway,

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:27.380 align:middle line:10%
and eventually from
Norway to Argentina,

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:30.590 align:middle line:10%
and eventually from Argentina
to Antarctica where they had

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:34.220 align:middle line:10%
secret bases in
Neu-Schwabenland.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.650 align:middle line:84%
The Germans had the
technology, but they

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:38.382 align:middle line:90%
didn't have the resources.

00:14:38.382 --> 00:14:39.590 align:middle line:90%
And that was the big problem.

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:41.762 align:middle line:90%
They ultimately lacked oil.

00:14:41.762 --> 00:14:43.220 align:middle line:84%
Germany does not
have a lot of oil.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:44.020 align:middle line:90%
They needed oil.

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:46.115 align:middle line:90%
They needed electricity.

00:14:46.115 --> 00:14:47.690 align:middle line:90%
They needed generating plants.

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:50.210 align:middle line:84%
They needed to have the
facilities to manufacture

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:51.170 align:middle line:90%
the weapons.

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:53.087 align:middle line:84%
So even though they were
very much ahead of us

00:14:53.087 --> 00:14:55.010 align:middle line:84%
in terms of
theoretical research,

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:57.170 align:middle line:84%
they were only at the
very end of the war

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:59.660 align:middle line:84%
beginning to take some of
these theoretical super weapons

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:04.220 align:middle line:84%
and actually mechanize them,
engineer them into reality.

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Had the war gone on another
year, we would have lost it.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.980 align:middle line:84%
The Haunebu saucers
should have been

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:11.420 align:middle line:84%
capable of going
almost anywhere.

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the fact
is that the bell

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:17.150 align:middle line:84%
would generate not only
a lifting capability

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:18.380 align:middle line:90%
and an anti-gravity effect.

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:21.002 align:middle line:10%
It would also tend to generate
a protective field, almost

00:15:21.002 --> 00:15:22.460 align:middle line:10%
a force field around
the craft that

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.920 align:middle line:10%
would make it impervious
to conventional weapons,

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.480 align:middle line:10%
and would also enable
you to fly in space

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:31.010 align:middle line:10%
and not have to worry about
things like radiation and all

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:31.970 align:middle line:10%
the different hazards.

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:33.720 align:middle line:84%
Meteors would bounce
right off the shield.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.480 align:middle line:84%
So it makes a lot
of sense that they

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.938 align:middle line:84%
would have been able to actually
go to the moon as far back

00:15:37.938 --> 00:15:39.885 align:middle line:84%
as the 1940s with
this technology.

00:15:39.885 --> 00:15:41.510 align:middle line:84%
All you'd do is you
just keep going up.

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:43.093 align:middle line:84%
You just keep moving
in one direction.

00:15:43.093 --> 00:15:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon,
you're in space.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And then you just point
at the moon and go there.

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:52.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Supposedly, World War II
ended with the Allies really

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:56.240 align:middle line:90%
entering Berlin, 1945.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:00.180 align:middle line:10%
But really, World War
II didn't end there.

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And what apparently happened was
the Germans of the Third Reich

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:11.120 align:middle line:84%
had created a number of
isolated and forward bases

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.210 align:middle line:84%
around the world
using particularly

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:19.010 align:middle line:84%
their U-boat fleet, but also
with other commercial ships

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:21.370 align:middle line:90%
and aircraft as well.

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:23.780 align:middle line:10%
And they'd already,
towards the end of the war,

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:29.690 align:middle line:10%
apparently had begun building
flying saucer-type craft.

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And there's also the
famous foo fighters

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:36.520 align:middle line:84%
that were seen at the end
of the war over Germany.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And while some researchers seem
to think that foo fighters were

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:45.850 align:middle line:84%
some kind of extraterrestrial
observation craft

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:49.120 align:middle line:84%
just watching the end of
World War II or something,

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:52.270 align:middle line:84%
other researchers believe
that the Germans had really

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:55.860 align:middle line:84%
created the foo fighters,
and that they were really

00:16:55.860 --> 00:17:00.060 align:middle line:84%
sort of a high-tech, last
ditch effort by the Germans

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:03.480 align:middle line:90%
to stop the bombing raids.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.839 align:middle line:84%
And that this really
was the carpet

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:09.829 align:middle line:84%
bombing of the industrial
cities in Germany.

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:11.730 align:middle line:84%
>> With the end of
the World War II,

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:16.849 align:middle line:84%
the Germans were really escaping
with their vast U-boat fleet

00:17:16.849 --> 00:17:20.970 align:middle line:84%
to places in Greenland
and the Canary Islands,

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:22.589 align:middle line:90%
to South America.

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:26.010 align:middle line:10%
Also going to
Indonesia and Japan,

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:32.070 align:middle line:10%
and incredibly to Antarctica
where the Germans had started

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:36.120 align:middle line:10%
to create certain bases,
underground, undersea U-boat

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:40.080 align:middle line:10%
bases in an area that they
called Neu-Schwabenland,

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.383 align:middle line:10%
and which we today
call Queen Maud Land.

00:17:42.383 --> 00:17:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
part of Antarctica

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:48.570 align:middle line:84%
that's pretty much opposite
of South Africa, really.

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And South Africa too,
actually, was a government

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:55.470 align:middle line:84%
at the time that wanted
to side with the Germans

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:57.240 align:middle line:90%
during World War II.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And the Afrikaners
of South Africa did.

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:04.620 align:middle line:10%
And the British actually
put many of the politicians

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:07.540 align:middle line:10%
in South Africa in prison
during the entire war,

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:10.680 align:middle line:10%
because they were on
the side of the Germans.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:14.555 align:middle line:84%
So really, World War II
apparently continued.

00:18:14.555 --> 00:18:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, of course, since that's
a real hidden part of history,

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:20.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't think anybody knows
for sure what happened

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:21.630 align:middle line:90%
to the German soldiers.

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:23.130 align:middle line:84%
What we know for
absolute positive

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:24.460 align:middle line:90%
is that they had the plans.

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:26.670 align:middle line:10%
The drawings were on
the drawing board, OK?

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:29.630 align:middle line:10%
The only argument is, did
they actually ever fly any?

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:31.350 align:middle line:84%
The Philadelphia
Experiment, I think,

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:33.000 align:middle line:90%
was a legitimate experiment.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.970 align:middle line:84%
I think they were experimenting
with energy manipulation.

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:39.930 align:middle line:84%
It was very similar to what the
Nazis were doing with the bell.

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:42.930 align:middle line:84%
The entire universe basically
is a huge energy field,

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:44.983 align:middle line:90%
and we're all part of it, OK?

00:18:44.983 --> 00:18:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And so when you start
messing with that,

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:49.240 align:middle line:84%
you really just don't know
what's going to happen.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.570 align:middle line:84%
>> What the Allies seemed
to finally realize,

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:54.960 align:middle line:84%
particularly after two U-boats
surrendered after the war

00:18:54.960 --> 00:19:01.140 align:middle line:84%
in Argentina, they realized
that the Germans had had a fleet

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:05.640 align:middle line:84%
of black U-boats, and that there
was a large number of U-boats

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:09.360 align:middle line:84%
that were completely unaccounted
for at the end of the war.

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And two surrendered in Argentina
some months after the war.

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And both the British and
American military forces,

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:26.520 align:middle line:84%
they took the captains and the
crew of these U-boats prisoners

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:30.150 align:middle line:84%
and interrogated them for
months of where they had been

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:31.950 align:middle line:90%
all this time after the war.

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:34.990 align:middle line:84%
What kind of passengers and
cargo they had been carrying.

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, some
of these U-boats

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:41.890 align:middle line:84%
were apparently carrying
huge cargoes of mercury,

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:43.140 align:middle line:90%
which is a very strange thing.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:47.940 align:middle line:10%
And looking into
all that over time,

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:49.620 align:middle line:10%
I've found that there
was a U-boat that

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:54.060 align:middle line:10%
had been wrecked in
Indonesia during the war,

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.600 align:middle line:10%
and its cargo was mercury.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And then only a few years ago,
it was in Norwegian papers

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:08.640 align:middle line:84%
that a U-boat had been found
as sunken in a fjord in Norway,

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:13.470 align:middle line:84%
and it had been sunk
in 1944 or 1945.

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:15.990 align:middle line:10%
And the interesting
part of that story

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:18.090 align:middle line:10%
was that the
Norwegian authorities

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:21.600 align:middle line:10%
were worried that this
sunken U-boat would fracture

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:25.410 align:middle line:10%
and crack, and that
its cargo of mercury

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:29.340 align:middle line:10%
would leak into this
fjord and poison it.

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:33.330 align:middle line:10%
So here again, you have one of
these strange missing U-boats

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:35.090 align:middle line:10%
but with the cargo of mercury.

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:37.590 align:middle line:84%
Then the Allies realized that
there was something more going

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:42.150 align:middle line:84%
on, that parts of the Third
Reich were still active,

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:44.970 align:middle line:84%
and that they were active
particularly in South America

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:46.710 align:middle line:90%
and Antarctica.

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:50.010 align:middle line:84%
>> So the rat lines were
through Switzerland,

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:53.640 align:middle line:84%
through [? Marco, ?] Spain,
and through the Vatican.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's where all
the SS officers kind of

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:59.640 align:middle line:84%
went and were allowed
to change their identity

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:03.780 align:middle line:84%
and then take on other
lives in other places.

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:06.240 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, there
were a lot of people

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.610 align:middle line:84%
that came to the United
States and Canada, Operation

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:09.570 align:middle line:90%
Paperclip.

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And then even some
went to Russia.

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:16.420 align:middle line:84%
A lot were allowed to stay in
Germany and actually carry on.

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:19.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though the
Allies won World War II,

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:22.840 align:middle line:84%
there were nagging suspicions
that something was wrong.

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.180 align:middle line:84%
Under intense questioning
by the Allies,

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:27.310 align:middle line:84%
it became apparent that
the Germans had built

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:30.130 align:middle line:90%
a secret base in Antarctica.

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Rumors were spreading
that the Germans had

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.120 align:middle line:84%
developed special
weapons which were

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.790 align:middle line:90%
being kept near the South Pole.

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:38.620 align:middle line:84%
Admiral Richard
Byrd was assigned

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:42.130 align:middle line:84%
the task of finding
out what was going on.

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Some strange things happened
during operation Highjump.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:51.670 align:middle line:10%
And allegedly, craft flew out
from the aircraft carriers

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:53.290 align:middle line:10%
over Antarctica.

00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And they were involved in
some kind of aerial combat

00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:00.070 align:middle line:90%
with flying saucers.

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:03.730 align:middle line:10%
And the flying saucer
defeated the American navy.

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And they left
after three months.

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:09.070 align:middle line:84%
Operation Highjump
came to an end,

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:12.220 align:middle line:84%
and the Americans
left Antarctica.

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:16.900 align:middle line:10%
>> But I think the crux came
in early 1947 with Operation

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:20.710 align:middle line:10%
Highjump where Admiral Byrd, a
whole military expedition goes

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:24.100 align:middle line:10%
down to Antarctica where the
Nazis had made it very plain

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.710 align:middle line:10%
that they had built a
huge base down there,

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:28.900 align:middle line:10%
sometimes referred
to as Agartha.

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And that they had
located underground lakes

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.670 align:middle line:84%
of warm water, and that
they had these cameras

00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:35.260 align:middle line:90%
they were operating out of.

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we don't know for
certain if any of that's true.

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:40.630 align:middle line:84%
What we know for
certain is Admiral Byrd,

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:42.190 align:middle line:90%
Operation Highjump goes down.

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:45.380 align:middle line:84%
They're all equipped
with troops, airplanes.

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:48.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was a
military expedition.

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And they were set to
operate for nine months.

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, after about
three months, they

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:54.550 align:middle line:84%
came back with their
tail between their legs

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:56.290 align:middle line:84%
after having
suffered casualties,

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:57.928 align:middle line:90%
all kind of problems.

00:22:57.928 --> 00:22:59.470 align:middle line:84%
>> They sent this
massive task force,

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:01.600 align:middle line:84%
including an aircraft
carrier, tons of aircraft,

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.210 align:middle line:84%
a couple of destroyers
to Antarctica.

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:04.010 align:middle line:90%
They set up a base.

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:06.135 align:middle line:84%
And then basically, what
they did if you look at it

00:23:06.135 --> 00:23:09.340 align:middle line:84%
is their exploration pattern
was from the base, which

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:12.850 align:middle line:84%
is at one end of Antarctica
around to Neu-Schwabenland

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:14.920 align:middle line:84%
where the rumors are
that there actually

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:18.760 align:middle line:84%
was a confrontation with Nazi
flying saucers who devastated

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.110 align:middle line:90%
the American army.

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:23.380 align:middle line:84%
They pack the whole thing up
and ran back to United States.

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And later on, Admiral Byrd
was quoted as saying basically

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.590 align:middle line:84%
that there are spacecraft
or aircraft that

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:32.055 align:middle line:84%
are so fast and so
maneuverable and so powerful

00:23:32.055 --> 00:23:33.430 align:middle line:84%
that they are
going to come at us

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:35.848 align:middle line:84%
from all different
directions from the poles,

00:23:35.848 --> 00:23:38.140 align:middle line:84%
and we are not going to be
able to defend against that.

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:40.060 align:middle line:84%
So clearly, Byrd is
talking about what

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:44.800 align:middle line:84%
he saw in Antarctica in the
battle that took place there

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.220 align:middle line:90%
in 1946.

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And Admiral Byrd then
stopped in Santiago, Chile,

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:52.930 align:middle line:84%
on his way back to
the United States.

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:55.510 align:middle line:10%
And he had a press
conference in Santiago

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:59.140 align:middle line:10%
where he said a bunch
of bizarre comments

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:03.760 align:middle line:10%
and talking about a whole new
enemy, a whole new technology,

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.160 align:middle line:10%
and that they were
capable of flying.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.920 align:middle line:84%
That these craft "could
fly from pole to pole"

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:11.730 align:middle line:90%
is what Byrd said.

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:14.940 align:middle line:10%
And this is where some of the
stories of the hollow Earth

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:20.040 align:middle line:10%
started to come out, and strange
stories that were promoted

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:25.470 align:middle line:10%
in magazines in
the 1950s of UFOs

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:28.400 align:middle line:10%
and Antarctica,
holes in the poles,

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:32.160 align:middle line:10%
and that Antarctica was
some very special place

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.170 align:middle line:10%
within the UFO scene.

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:38.100 align:middle line:10%
>> They actually brought a
whole army there to snuff out

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:39.810 align:middle line:10%
whatever was left over.

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:42.420 align:middle line:10%
And they got their asses
kicked, and they came home.

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think Admiral
Byrd was very upset.

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:50.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't think-- maybe he thought
he wasn't adequately prepared,

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:53.370 align:middle line:84%
and I think they killed him
just because he was raising hell

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:54.390 align:middle line:90%
about that.

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And Admiral Byrd in the South
American newspapers was quoted

00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:01.260 align:middle line:84%
as saying, "In the next war,
we'll be facing craft that can

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:04.140 align:middle line:84%
fly from pole to pole
in a matter of minutes."

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:07.650 align:middle line:84%
I think they encountered
the Nazi UFOs.

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:10.650 align:middle line:10%
>> Between Operation Highjump,
which supposedly encountered

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:14.010 align:middle line:10%
Nazi UFOs, and the crash at
Roswell which possibly could

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:16.710 align:middle line:10%
have been alien, between
those two events,

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:19.410 align:middle line:10%
they seemed to really
fire things up and begin

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:22.020 align:middle line:10%
the creation of what we now call
the national security state.

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:25.950 align:middle line:10%
The CIA was formed
actually in 1947.

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:29.070 align:middle line:10%
The NSA was formed
in the early 1950s.

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:31.260 align:middle line:84%
All of these events
seem to be connected.

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:34.290 align:middle line:84%
The biggest event was the 1952
buzzing of Washington, DC.

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And after that is when all
of these agencies like DARPA

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:41.700 align:middle line:84%
came into existence, the Defense
Advanced Resources Projects

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.110 align:middle line:90%
Agency.

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:45.960 align:middle line:84%
All of these different
organizations came into being

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.850 align:middle line:84%
and started to work
together and started

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:53.220 align:middle line:84%
to deal with this question
of, what were these flying

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:55.380 align:middle line:84%
saucer-like objects that
were actually swarming all

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:57.040 align:middle line:90%
over the country at the time?

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.790 align:middle line:84%
So I think there was
a definite connection

00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:01.410 align:middle line:84%
between that military
catastrophe in Antarctica,

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:04.920 align:middle line:84%
Kenneth Arnold citing the
Roswell crash, the 1952

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.130 align:middle line:90%
buzzing of Washington.

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:09.038 align:middle line:84%
I think it created panic at the
highest levels of government,

00:26:09.038 --> 00:26:10.830 align:middle line:84%
and that's when the
whole national security

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:13.050 align:middle line:90%
state came into existence.

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>> In our next episode
of "Deep Space,"

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.700 align:middle line:84%
we'll continue to explore
the relationship between

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:22.100 align:middle line:84%
the Germans and the
Americans in dark alliance.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:30.000 align:middle line:90%
