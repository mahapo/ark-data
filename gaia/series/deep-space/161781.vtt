we've seen that there are many

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.400 align:middle line:84%
interesting people involved
in the genesis of our space

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.790 align:middle line:84%
programs, both
acknowledged and secret.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.650 align:middle line:84%
In this episode,
we'll be looking

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.665 align:middle line:84%
at one of the most enigmatic
characters in this saga,

00:00:44.665 --> 00:00:47.470 align:middle line:90%
a young man named Jack Parsons.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.220 align:middle line:10%
>> Jack Parsons was a brilliant
chemist and scientist who was

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.535 align:middle line:10%
obsessed with space and getting
the human race into space.

00:00:54.535 --> 00:00:55.660 align:middle line:90%
He wanted to build rockets.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.580 align:middle line:90%


00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.300 align:middle line:84%
He was associated with
people like Robert Goddard.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.840 align:middle line:84%
He did some of
the first research

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.920 align:middle line:84%
and very successful designs
of solid rocket motors.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.620 align:middle line:84%
Back in the 1930s, before
there was the formation

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.350 align:middle line:84%
of anything like JPL or any
of the other organizations

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.023 align:middle line:84%
that eventually
worked on rockets,

00:01:14.023 --> 00:01:15.440 align:middle line:84%
there was a big
debate whether you

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.150 align:middle line:84%
would go with a
liquid-fueled rocket

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.990 align:middle line:90%
or a solid-fueled rocket.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, solid-fueled rockets
had a lot of issues.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.570 align:middle line:84%
Jack Parsons is the
guy who figured out

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.790 align:middle line:84%
how to make solid
rocket motors work.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.480 align:middle line:10%
>> Jack Parsons was a rocket
propulsion genius who was

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.120 align:middle line:10%
instrumental, along with
Theodore Karman and a few other

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.450 align:middle line:10%
people in founding the Jet
Propulsion Lab in Pasadena.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Jack Parsons was
the inventor of JATO.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's the jet-assisted
lifting engine

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.980 align:middle line:84%
that we use on the
military airplanes.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And from there, he actually
formed and founded JPL.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.640 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of his inventions
are responsible for the Apollo

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.220 align:middle line:10%
mission's success in the 1950s.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.610 align:middle line:84%
>> He mixed together the
solid rocket fuel with asphalt

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.460 align:middle line:84%
and created the current
cylinder-burning,

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.620 align:middle line:84%
solid rocket motors
that we have today.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.390 align:middle line:84%
>> And he helped his colleagues,
known as the Suicide Squad.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Because they're always
blowing stuff up.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.850 align:middle line:10%
He helps his colleagues
form Aerojet Corporation.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.840 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this guy was absolutely
brilliant and considered

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.240 align:middle line:10%
the most brilliant
of all the rocketeers

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.860 align:middle line:10%
by his mentor,
Theodore von Karman.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.500 align:middle line:10%
Theodore von Karman
was the first guy

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.660 align:middle line:10%
to win the National
Science Award awarded

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.980 align:middle line:10%
by President Kennedy.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.090 align:middle line:84%
Karman was a very influential
person in American science

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.790 align:middle line:84%
in general, but
specifically in aviation

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.640 align:middle line:84%
technology, in
rocketry and missiles,

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.790 align:middle line:84%
and all that sort of stuff and
was also consulted frequently

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.790 align:middle line:84%
by the Air Force on
the subject of UFOs.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And Von Karman
believed that he was

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.850 align:middle line:84%
a descendant of Rabbi Loew
of Prague, the guy who

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.210 align:middle line:84%
created the Golem, the very
first sort of Frankenstein's

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.350 align:middle line:90%
monster.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.750 align:middle line:84%
So we have this
strange constellation

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.860 align:middle line:84%
of very eccentric people
who are also very brilliant.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, the dark side of
Jack Parsons that most people

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.510 align:middle line:84%
don't know about is that
he was also an occultist.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.130 align:middle line:84%
He was very, very
closely associated

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.510 align:middle line:90%
with Aleister Crowley.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.150 align:middle line:10%
In fact, at one time, he
was the number two man

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.550 align:middle line:10%
in the Ordo Templi
Orientis, which

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.880 align:middle line:10%
was Crowley's organization
here in the United States.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.670 align:middle line:10%
>> One of Parsons' buddies
was a fellow by the name of L.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Ron Hubbard who accompanied
Parsons during some of these

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.730 align:middle line:84%
rituals that Parsons
said were a success.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.130 align:middle line:90%
And Hubbard was there.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.180 align:middle line:84%
Hubbard, a few years later,
supposedly on a $5 bar bet,

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.660 align:middle line:84%
creates the religion
of Scientology.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, we have a lot
of eccentric people here,

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.920 align:middle line:84%
conducting magical
rituals one day,

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.650 align:middle line:84%
hobnobbing with science
fiction writers another day,

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.420 align:middle line:84%
and going back to work
for the space program.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.040 align:middle line:10%
>> The Scientologists, for
their part in it, say that L.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.380 align:middle line:10%
Ron Hubbard was actually
working for the Office of Naval

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.680 align:middle line:10%
Intelligence, that he went
to the mansion in Pasadena

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.480 align:middle line:10%
to infiltrate this cult
of black magic worshipers,

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.800 align:middle line:10%
and that his purpose was to
create chaos, disruption,

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.600 align:middle line:10%
and break it up.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've been to
the site offices

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.260 align:middle line:90%
of the Church of Scientology.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.370 align:middle line:90%
I've been shown documents.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.200 align:middle line:84%
I've been given
these documents that

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.650 align:middle line:84%
indicate that I think it's very
likely that Hubbard was still

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.170 align:middle line:84%
attached to the Office
of Naval Intelligence

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.723 align:middle line:84%
when he was operating at
Jack Parsons' mansion.

00:04:15.723 --> 00:04:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think when you
look at it, there's

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.550 align:middle line:84%
absolutely no question
about the fact

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.260 align:middle line:84%
that he did disrupt
the operations.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.770 align:middle line:84%
He did expose a lot of these
scientists as occultists.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, he blew
the whole thing up,

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.720 align:middle line:84%
because the OTO fell apart
after Hubbard and Parsons had

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.520 align:middle line:90%
their feud.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.730 align:middle line:84%
So if he was, in fact, working
for the Office of Naval

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence, he certainly
accomplished his task.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And there are various
different documents

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.510 align:middle line:84%
that show at the time, he was
actually at Parsons' mansion.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.220 align:middle line:84%
According to the
official documents,

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.050 align:middle line:84%
he was in a hospital
in San Francisco

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.410 align:middle line:90%
where he actually never was.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.890 align:middle line:10%
>> While Jack Parsons' genius
was undeniably valued in his

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.640 align:middle line:10%
professional life, it was his
eccentric and turbid personal

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.460 align:middle line:10%
life that, in the
end, proved fatal.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.020 align:middle line:84%
>> He lost his
security clearances,

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.240 align:middle line:84%
because of all the weird
stuff he was involved in.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.830 align:middle line:84%
Basically, the US
government decided

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.747 align:middle line:84%
that even though he was
a brilliant scientist,

00:05:10.747 --> 00:05:12.250 align:middle line:90%
he was an unreliable character.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And they kicked him out of
high-level rocketry research.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.930 align:middle line:84%
So what he began to
do is began to work

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.138 align:middle line:84%
for other countries and
other governments that wanted

00:05:19.138 --> 00:05:20.710 align:middle line:90%
to develop rocket capabilities.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.040 align:middle line:10%
>> And Parsons has already
gotten a job offer from

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.660 align:middle line:10%
the Israeli government.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.020 align:middle line:84%
The Israelis want him to develop
rocket technology for them.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, Israel was not an
enemy of the United States,

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.340 align:middle line:90%
so it wasn't a treasonous thing.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.090 align:middle line:84%
But they came up
with some charge.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.820 align:middle line:84%
They dropped the
charges against him,

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.730 align:middle line:84%
but they still took his
security clearance away.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.750 align:middle line:10%
That arrangement with Israel was
started by Theodore von Karman.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Once again, our very
helpful, annoyingly helpful.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.530 align:middle line:84%
Theodore von Karman is the
guy who puts Parsons together

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.480 align:middle line:90%
with the Israelis.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.040 align:middle line:84%
He goes into his lab, which was
his house there in Pasadena.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And according to the
story, he dropped

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.460 align:middle line:84%
a vial of fulminate of mercury,
which is extremely volatile.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.530 align:middle line:90%
He drops it and boom.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.210 align:middle line:90%
The whole place goes up.

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And there's more
explosives in the lab.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.530 align:middle line:84%
The thing becomes a
fireball and the end

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.662 align:middle line:84%
of Jack Parsons who actually
survived it for a few minutes,

00:06:14.662 --> 00:06:16.120 align:middle line:84%
but didn't make it
to the hospital.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.180 align:middle line:90%


00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>> I mean, they blew him up.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.238 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can't
write this stuff.

00:06:23.238 --> 00:06:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>> There are a couple
of possibilities with

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:25.830 align:middle line:90%
Parsons' death.

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.102 align:middle line:84%
Some people say that
he was assassinated.

00:06:28.102 --> 00:06:29.560 align:middle line:84%
Because they say
it's very unlikely

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.870 align:middle line:84%
he would have been careless
with a beaker of fuel

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.000 align:middle line:90%
and set himself on fire.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, he'd
been doing experiments

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.117 align:middle line:84%
at that point for
more than 20 years.

00:06:37.117 --> 00:06:38.950 align:middle line:84%
He'd never had any kind
of a major accident.

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:41.470 align:middle line:84%
So it's very unlikely
that he made a mistake

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:42.980 align:middle line:90%
and burned himself to death.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.830 align:middle line:84%
So the alternative
is that they didn't

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.298 align:middle line:84%
want him working
with the Israelis,

00:06:46.298 --> 00:06:48.340 align:middle line:84%
or that somebody in the
high levels of government

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.770 align:middle line:84%
thought he was a threat
to US national security

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.248 align:middle line:90%
and wanted to wipe them out.

00:06:52.248 --> 00:06:53.290 align:middle line:90%
So they started the fire.

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:56.500 align:middle line:84%
It killed him, along with the
garage and all the material

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.430 align:middle line:90%
he had there.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.860 align:middle line:84%
But the other possibility
that's been raised

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.630 align:middle line:84%
is that his death
was actually faked.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.513 align:middle line:84%
Because nobody really
knows where his body is.

00:07:04.513 --> 00:07:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Nobody is really sure
where he's buried.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Nobody has ever done
a post-mortem on him

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.920 align:middle line:84%
to determine that this is, in
fact, the body of Jack Parsons.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.890 align:middle line:84%
In fact, as far as I know,
there was no identification

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.890 align:middle line:84%
of the body, other than, well,
who else would be in here

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:21.790 align:middle line:84%
and burn to death in
Jack Parsons' laboratory?

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>> It's quite possible that
Jack Parsons was assassinated.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.140 align:middle line:84%
Because it's really
hard to believe

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.300 align:middle line:84%
that a man of his
intelligence who had already

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.633 align:middle line:84%
been very familiar with the
different types of chemicals

00:07:30.633 --> 00:07:32.890 align:middle line:84%
and experiments can
be in his own garage,

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:35.858 align:middle line:84%
working on a hobby and then
all of a sudden, explode.

00:07:35.858 --> 00:07:37.150 align:middle line:90%
It just doesn't make any sense.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.670 align:middle line:90%


00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Another option could be that
he actually faked his death.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the guy was
very, very brilliant.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.420 align:middle line:90%
So there is another possibility.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.087 align:middle line:84%
A question mark you
always have to think

00:07:48.087 --> 00:07:50.830 align:middle line:84%
about was, did he fake his death
and was taken into the space

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:54.520 align:middle line:84%
program, where he can actually
help the Secret Space Program

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.140 align:middle line:84%
progress with
further technologies

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.380 align:middle line:84%
that he was working on,
maybe in black operations?

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Nobody wanted Jack Parsons
who had genius stuff going

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:05.290 align:middle line:84%
on in his brain, who knew how
to build rockets better than

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:06.740 align:middle line:90%
anybody else in the world.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.870 align:middle line:84%
Nobody wanted him to
leave the country.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:11.530 align:middle line:90%
He was a walking security risk.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:12.850 align:middle line:90%
He just knew too much.

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:15.820 align:middle line:84%
So it's possible that he
was eliminated right then

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.270 align:middle line:90%
and there.

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:19.605 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think there was
definitely an intelligence game

00:08:19.605 --> 00:08:20.980 align:middle line:84%
that was being
played on Parsons.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And they were trying to find
out not just about Parsons,

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.770 align:middle line:84%
but who else was
involved at JPL and who

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:29.110 align:middle line:84%
else was involved at various
defense contractors that

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:32.155 align:middle line:84%
were working on classified
programs that may have

00:08:32.155 --> 00:08:33.280 align:middle line:90%
been involved in this cult?

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.409 align:middle line:84%
Because, remember,
at that time we

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:38.289 align:middle line:84%
were just coming off
of the UFO sightings.

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:39.340 align:middle line:90%
We had the Roswell crash.

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.002 align:middle line:84%
We had the Kenneth
Arnold incident.

00:08:41.002 --> 00:08:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And then there was
the whole period

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.560 align:middle line:84%
where we got buzzed
in the capital

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.290 align:middle line:84%
by either the
Germans or the ETs.

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:49.280 align:middle line:90%
Nobody really knows for sure.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And they were
beginning to develop

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.150 align:middle line:90%
this anti-gravity technology.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's logical that the
same brilliant minds that

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:56.680 align:middle line:84%
worked on the
chemical rockets would

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.620 align:middle line:84%
work on the next step in the
technological chain, which

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:02.440 align:middle line:84%
would be an anti-gravity device,
so an anti-gravity flying

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.350 align:middle line:84%
saucer, maybe something based
along the German Haunebu

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:07.570 align:middle line:84%
or something that was
developed completely different,

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:10.480 align:middle line:84%
having to do with reverse
engineered ET technology

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.360 align:middle line:84%
or based on some of T.
Townsend Brown designs.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.730 align:middle line:84%
So when I look at
this pattern, I

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:17.230 align:middle line:84%
see that they
would have probably

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:20.500 align:middle line:84%
tried to weed out the bad
apples before they cleared them

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.900 align:middle line:84%
to work on these super
secret, super highly

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:23.860 align:middle line:90%
advanced technologies.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.540 align:middle line:84%
Because chemical
rockets are one thing.

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.540 align:middle line:84%
But if you have
flying saucers that

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.730 align:middle line:84%
are based on
anti-gravity effects,

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:34.390 align:middle line:84%
have force field capabilities,
inertial dampening fields

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:37.960 align:middle line:84%
and probably don't operate
on gasoline or oil,

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.570 align:middle line:84%
that's world-changing
technology.

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And you can't have
that kind of stuff

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.050 align:middle line:90%
getting into the wrong hands.

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:46.600 align:middle line:84%
You have capabilities
there of creating weapons

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.800 align:middle line:90%
that could destroy worlds.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:53.380 align:middle line:90%


00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:57.160 align:middle line:84%
>> This is going on under the
ages of the military-industrial

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.250 align:middle line:90%
complex.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.730 align:middle line:84%
These are all programs
that were approved and paid

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:07.030 align:middle line:84%
for by our government, by
the military, until finally,

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:10.030 align:middle line:84%
at least the '50s, we're talking
about Von Karman and Parsons,

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:11.410 align:middle line:90%
and all those people.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:13.630 align:middle line:10%
Parsons loses his
security clearance.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:15.130 align:middle line:84%
Another member of
the Suicide Squad,

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:18.670 align:middle line:84%
Frank Malina, his close friend,
loses his security clearance.

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:22.990 align:middle line:84%
Their co-worker, HS Tien, the
brilliant Chinese engineer,

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:25.690 align:middle line:84%
accused completely unfairly
of being a communist,

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:27.580 align:middle line:90%
loses his security clearance.

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Everybody who helped develop our
space program from California,

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:34.420 align:middle line:84%
the people who invented the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:37.840 align:middle line:84%
founded it, all lost
their security clearances,

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.610 align:middle line:90%
never worked again.

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:44.020 align:middle line:84%
But they were replaced by
the Paperclip scientists.

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.480 align:middle line:10%
So now, we're bringing
in Wernher von Braun.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.570 align:middle line:84%
We're bringing in Hermann
Oberth, on and on and on.

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:51.880 align:middle line:84%
We're bringing in all
these Nazi scientists,

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.610 align:middle line:84%
people who were
our enemies, people

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:57.640 align:middle line:84%
that we know should never have
a security clearance, people who

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:00.070 align:middle line:84%
fought against us
in World War II,

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:04.240 align:middle line:84%
developed the weapons of mass
destruction that Hitler used.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.880 align:middle line:84%
We got those guys and brought
them to the United States.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.520 align:middle line:10%
And we fired the guys who
helped our space program,

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.710 align:middle line:10%
claiming they were lefty.

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:12.510 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:13.343 align:middle line:90%
They're out of here.

00:11:13.343 --> 00:11:16.470 align:middle line:90%
They're just too eccentric.

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Not only did NASA have
some early pioneers who were

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.830 align:middle line:84%
interested in the occult, but
we've also seen that the very

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:27.150 align:middle line:84%
origins of NASA itself have
a large German component via

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:29.860 align:middle line:90%
Operation Paperclip.

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:33.170 align:middle line:84%
That leaves this question
begging for an answer.

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:35.110 align:middle line:90%
What is NASA?

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:39.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, personally, I think
NASA was a front that was

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:46.270 align:middle line:10%
created to basically sideline
many scientists, engineers,

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:49.710 align:middle line:10%
the general public from the
possibilities of anti-gravity.

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:54.220 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the 1950s, which
is the critical phase in terms

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.142 align:middle line:84%
of the study of
anti-gravity, you

00:11:56.142 --> 00:11:57.850 align:middle line:84%
see that there were
a number of journals,

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:01.450 align:middle line:84%
especially in Britain, that
released peer-reviewed papers.

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:05.020 align:middle line:84%
Anti-gravity was being
studied in aviation journals.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:06.350 align:middle line:90%
You had a number of companies.

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:08.200 align:middle line:84%
We know the Douglas
Aircraft Company

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.230 align:middle line:84%
was doing extensive
studies on anti-gravity.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:13.247 align:middle line:84%
And these were showing
that it was feasible,

00:12:13.247 --> 00:12:14.830 align:middle line:84%
and that this was
something that could

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:19.000 align:middle line:84%
be used for generating aerospace
vehicles, flying saucers.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.550 align:middle line:84%
So then what happens
is you have NASA

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:24.730 align:middle line:84%
being formed at the end of
the Eisenhower administration.

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And NASA basically is
focused on space exploration

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.450 align:middle line:84%
using conventional
rocket propulsion.

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
chief NASA scientists

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.570 align:middle line:84%
leading these projects were
Project Paperclip personnel.

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:40.570 align:middle line:84%
These were former Nazis, like,
for example, Wernher von Braun.

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:43.700 align:middle line:84%
He was the head of the Redstone
Army Arsenal of a missile

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:44.500 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.010 align:middle line:10%
And when NASA was formed, he
was instantly transferred over

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:51.100 align:middle line:10%
to being the director of the
Marshall Space Flight Center

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:52.810 align:middle line:10%
out of Huntsville, Alabama.

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:56.680 align:middle line:10%
You had Kurt Debus, another
Nazi scientist, the former SS

00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:01.090 align:middle line:10%
officer being the head of the
space program out of NASA,

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:02.680 align:middle line:10%
Florida's center there--

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:03.850 align:middle line:10%
Kennedy Space Center.

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:06.160 align:middle line:10%
The whole NASA program
was a misdirection

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.140 align:middle line:10%
from the feasibility
of anti-gravity,

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:11.290 align:middle line:10%
which was being secretly
studied in black projects

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:13.780 align:middle line:10%
by companies such as
Douglas, and Northrop

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.570 align:middle line:10%
Grumman, and Lockheed, and
others for the military,

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:19.330 align:middle line:10%
for the Army, US Air
Force, for the US Navy,

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.760 align:middle line:10%
that were all trying to get
these companies to build

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.807 align:middle line:10%
anti-gravity vehicles
for them, but were not

00:13:23.807 --> 00:13:26.140 align:middle line:10%
going to be released to the
public for national security

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:28.470 align:middle line:10%
reasons and because of the
power of the oil lobby.

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:31.450 align:middle line:90%


00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:37.210 align:middle line:84%
>> In January 27, 1967, NASA
astronauts Virgil Grissom,

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:41.590 align:middle line:84%
Edward White, and Roger Chaffee
were performing a launch

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:45.130 align:middle line:84%
simulation when a fire
broke out in their module.

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:48.190 align:middle line:84%
This incident and the
ensuing investigation

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:50.020 align:middle line:84%
would be one of
the many, proving

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:53.440 align:middle line:84%
the space agency deserved
its frequently used moniker

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.240 align:middle line:90%
in the truth community--

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.360 align:middle line:90%
Never A Straight Answer.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:00.220 align:middle line:84%
>> In Apollo 1, Gus
Grissom, Ed White,

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.730 align:middle line:84%
and Roger Chaffee were actually
going to do a full-on test

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:05.740 align:middle line:90%
of the Apollo 1 capsule.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.990 align:middle line:84%
They actually went
up into the capsule.

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And while they were in there,
they were locked and sealed in.

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:12.930 align:middle line:84%
Within a few minutes,
all of a sudden,

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:14.560 align:middle line:84%
unexpectedly, they
lost communication

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.660 align:middle line:90%
with the command center.

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:17.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is very
bizarre, because there's

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:18.670 align:middle line:90%
three forms of communication.

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:21.440 align:middle line:90%
And all three went out.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.075 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine
the horror probably

00:14:23.075 --> 00:14:25.450 align:middle line:84%
on these guys' faces when they
realized they couldn't get

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:26.720 align:middle line:90%
any communication whatsoever.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And they were locked
in the capsule.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.170 align:middle line:90%


00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:33.540 align:middle line:84%
>> The Apollo on fire is
still a mystery to this day.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.130 align:middle line:90%


00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:37.840 align:middle line:10%
There were issues with
the Apollo design.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.480 align:middle line:84%
The astronauts had complained
about a lot of stuff.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.330 align:middle line:84%
They complained that they were
testing in a 100% pure oxygen

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:46.870 align:middle line:84%
environment, which is
very, very flammable.

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:50.200 align:middle line:84%
There was way too much Velcro
on items on the spacecraft that

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.225 align:middle line:90%
could have burned.

00:14:51.225 --> 00:14:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, when
they did this high pressure

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:56.650 align:middle line:84%
test on Apollo 1, there was
some sort of spark which

00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:59.770 align:middle line:84%
to this day, nobody
really knows what sparked,

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:01.967 align:middle line:84%
which caused a fire that
burned very, very quickly

00:15:01.967 --> 00:15:03.550 align:middle line:84%
and killed the
astronauts, burned them

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:05.988 align:middle line:84%
to death, suffocated
them in the smoke

00:15:05.988 --> 00:15:07.780 align:middle line:84%
and in just minutes,
before they could even

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:09.580 align:middle line:90%
get the hatch back open.

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, before that happened,
Gus Grissom was noted as saying

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.020 align:middle line:90%
that someone is going to die.

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And he was being very critical
of the NASA space program.

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:22.420 align:middle line:84%
>> But what's interesting about
the Apollo on fire is that it

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:24.855 align:middle line:84%
happened at a time when there's
certain stellar alignments

00:15:24.855 --> 00:15:26.980 align:middle line:84%
right above the landing
site, which have been shown

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:30.760 align:middle line:84%
repeatedly to be an homage to
the ancient Egyptian gods like

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:31.660 align:middle line:90%
Isis and Osiris.

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.550 align:middle line:84%
In this case, it
was Orion's Belt,

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:36.940 align:middle line:84%
33 degrees above the
launch pad at the time.

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:38.917 align:middle line:90%
And on board was Gus Grissom.

00:15:38.917 --> 00:15:40.750 align:middle line:84%
Gus Grissom was supposed
to be the first man

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:42.910 align:middle line:84%
to walk on the moon,
not Neil Armstrong.

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:45.250 align:middle line:10%
He was one of the original
Mercury 7 astronauts.

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And he had made a lot of
complaints about the fact

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:50.740 align:middle line:84%
that as far as he
was concerned, he

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:53.800 align:middle line:84%
was just Spam in a can in
his crappy Apollo program.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.290 align:middle line:84%
And he knew very well
that we had already

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:57.770 align:middle line:90%
been to the moon and Mars.

00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And he told people this, that we
have much more highly advanced

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:04.030 align:middle line:84%
spacecraft that have traveled to
the moon and traveled to Mars.

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:07.908 align:middle line:84%
And we're just basically
crash test dummies.

00:16:07.908 --> 00:16:08.950 align:middle line:90%
And he had lamented that.

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:10.570 align:middle line:90%
He criticized NASA.

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to be a
convenient coincidence

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:17.530 align:middle line:84%
that a guy that had a
reputation as a maverick,

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:20.410 align:middle line:84%
as a free thinker, as a guy who
would say what was on his mind

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:23.230 align:middle line:84%
and didn't have a great filter
was one of the three men

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:24.390 align:middle line:90%
who was killed that day.

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:25.768 align:middle line:90%
And in fact, it got so bad.

00:16:25.768 --> 00:16:27.310 align:middle line:84%
He was complaining
so much about what

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:29.227 align:middle line:84%
was wrong with the
spacecraft that he actually

00:16:29.227 --> 00:16:32.860 align:middle line:84%
hung a lemon on the Apollo
and capsule at one point.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:36.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Thomas Baron was a
safety inspector in NASA.

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:39.310 align:middle line:84%
He was only there for
about 16 months total.

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And he's viewed as one of
the early whistleblower-type

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:44.010 align:middle line:90%
of people.

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:46.610 align:middle line:84%
He was extremely
compulsive, I think

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:52.480 align:middle line:84%
is a safe word, about reporting
every single detail of anything

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:56.470 align:middle line:84%
that was wrong inside NASA with
regard to safety, with regard

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:59.880 align:middle line:84%
to attitudes, with regard
to employment policies.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:03.460 align:middle line:84%
He wrote this big 50-page
report about this.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And he sent the
report in officially.

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:08.200 align:middle line:90%
And it was suppressed.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.099 align:middle line:84%
And he got really
upset about this.

00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And so he leaked a
copy of this report

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:19.510 align:middle line:84%
to a journalist who
then publicized it.

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:23.230 align:middle line:10%
And because of the reaction
on the part of NASA

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:26.710 align:middle line:10%
turning in this ad hominem
attack against him,

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:30.100 align:middle line:10%
criticizing him, and trying
to counter the arguments

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:33.190 align:middle line:10%
he was making, many
of which were valid,

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:36.430 align:middle line:10%
what made this so important
is that his report preceded

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:38.470 align:middle line:10%
this terrible, tragic fire.

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And so people began to
put the two together

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.670 align:middle line:84%
that maybe if
people had listened

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:45.520 align:middle line:84%
to all of his complaints,
this terrible tragedy wouldn't

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:46.720 align:middle line:90%
have happened.

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.930 align:middle line:84%
>> That there were many, many
inefficiencies in the design

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:52.868 align:middle line:84%
and the manufacture
of the Apollo 1 craft,

00:17:52.868 --> 00:17:54.910 align:middle line:84%
that there were many
mistakes that had been made.

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:56.380 align:middle line:84%
There were all kinds
of problems with it

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:57.760 align:middle line:90%
that weren't being addressed.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And then when people went
up the chain of command

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:01.368 align:middle line:84%
and said, hey, this thing
is not going to work,

00:18:01.368 --> 00:18:03.400 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to fly,
it's got major issues,

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.400 align:middle line:84%
they were told basically to
shut up and do their job.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.920 align:middle line:10%
Just a day or two after he
testified before Congress

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.780 align:middle line:10%
and gave this very,
very critical testimony,

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:14.350 align:middle line:10%
it turns out he gets killed,
along with his entire family

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:17.350 align:middle line:10%
in a train collision
with his car.

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:21.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe he got hit, driving
across a train crossing and was

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:22.780 align:middle line:90%
hit by the train.

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:24.790 align:middle line:84%
I've never been asked
to investigate it.

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:28.150 align:middle line:84%
I've never been brought in with
any of my team to look at that.

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:31.510 align:middle line:84%
We have capacities to do
investigations like that.

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:32.980 align:middle line:84%
>> It just seems
really convenient.

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:37.120 align:middle line:84%
Because that line of criticism
basically was quashed from that

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:37.920 align:middle line:90%
point forward.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.378 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though he had already
went on several space flights

00:18:40.378 --> 00:18:41.500 align:middle line:90%
and was a national hero.

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.240 align:middle line:84%
So there's definitely
something going on there

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.040 align:middle line:90%
behind the scenes.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.780 align:middle line:84%
Because even Gus Grissom's
family, for many, many years

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.360 align:middle line:84%
after, had contacted
NASA and really wanted

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.520 align:middle line:84%
to get answers as to
exactly what happened.

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:52.320 align:middle line:90%
And they never did.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.760 align:middle line:84%
They never got clarification,
never got closure.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And the actual capsule
itself is still

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.290 align:middle line:84%
sitting in a military
bunker somewhere sealed off.

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:02.530 align:middle line:90%
And nobody can get access to it.

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:05.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Why were so many red flags
in this mission ignored?

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And is it possible
that this was much more

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:10.090 align:middle line:90%
than a simple accident?

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:13.060 align:middle line:90%
What was NASA trying to hide?

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:16.390 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, when people ask about
this agency or that agency

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:20.500 align:middle line:10%
suppressing information, the
first thing to talk about is

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:24.670 align:middle line:10%
to understand that NASA in the
rank and file isn't suppressing

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:27.850 align:middle line:10%
anything, nor is,
for that matter,

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:29.572 align:middle line:10%
the Department of Defense.

00:19:29.572 --> 00:19:31.780 align:middle line:10%
But you have to begin to
ask the question-- are there

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:35.740 align:middle line:10%
compartmented operations within
various agencies, some of which

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:38.650 align:middle line:10%
work together and some
don't, that have information

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:39.550 align:middle line:10%
they're suppressing?

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:41.020 align:middle line:90%
The answer to that is yes.

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:42.950 align:middle line:90%
No question about it.

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:45.430 align:middle line:90%
And NASA has had--

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:47.110 align:middle line:90%
we landed on the moon.

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:51.610 align:middle line:84%
There was footage filmed of
what Neil Armstrong and Buzz

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:53.050 align:middle line:90%
Aldrin saw.

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:54.220 align:middle line:90%
And I know this for a fact.

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:56.830 align:middle line:84%
I know members of their
family personally who

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:59.050 align:middle line:84%
they said have related
this, that there

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:03.290 align:middle line:84%
were UFOs on the crater all
around where we set down,

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:06.160 align:middle line:84%
which is why some of the
film footage that people saw

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.660 align:middle line:90%
was actually fake.

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.460 align:middle line:90%
I deal with facts, not opinions.

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:12.096 align:middle line:84%
The nature of compartmented
intelligence--

00:20:12.096 --> 00:20:14.920 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't matter what
agency you're talking about--

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:20.170 align:middle line:84%
is that people make these
sweeping generalizations.

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:23.470 align:middle line:84%
The government is hiding
information about UFOs.

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:25.660 align:middle line:10%
Well, I can tell
you from briefings

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:30.850 align:middle line:10%
I've had with senators, and
generals, and senior officials

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:34.600 align:middle line:10%
in every administration
since 1993,

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.820 align:middle line:10%
that most people
in the government

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.310 align:middle line:10%
don't know anything
about this subject.

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's so highly
compartmented.

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.850 align:middle line:84%
I saw a chart not long ago that
had the President in the United

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:49.330 align:middle line:90%
States at about level 21.

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:56.020 align:middle line:10%
And this issue is around 38 to
40, dealing with the UFO issue.

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:59.410 align:middle line:10%
In other words, beyond what
the president would normally

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:00.850 align:middle line:10%
be read in on.

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And there are
highly compartmented

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:05.680 align:middle line:84%
and illegal projects
going on that

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:09.880 align:middle line:84%
are not being overseen
constitutionally and legally,

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.490 align:middle line:84%
and that this is a threat
to the national security

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:14.140 align:middle line:90%
and to world security.

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And so at NASA, certainly
there are some people--

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.250 align:middle line:90%
read into this.

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'll give you
a good example.

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:24.910 align:middle line:84%
Back in the late '90s,
there was a woman

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:29.740 align:middle line:84%
who was one of the five
directors of NASA in divisions.

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And hers was the mission
to "planet Earth" doing

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.540 align:middle line:84%
satellite imaging of
the climate change

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:35.870 align:middle line:90%
and all this sort of thing.

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:38.162 align:middle line:84%
And she was very interested
in what we were working on.

00:21:38.162 --> 00:21:41.590 align:middle line:10%
Because I had connected
the dot between UFO secrecy

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:44.080 align:middle line:10%
and the suppression of
the energy technologies

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.960 align:middle line:10%
that would get us off fossil
fuels and nuclear power,

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.040 align:middle line:10%
et cetera.

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.800 align:middle line:84%
So she actually
brought this issue up

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.650 align:middle line:84%
to Dan Goldin, the
director of NASA.

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:57.340 align:middle line:10%
But he had been on the
board of and director

00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:59.170 align:middle line:10%
of Science Applications
International

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:03.010 align:middle line:10%
Corporation, which is one of
the crown jewels of contracting

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:05.950 align:middle line:10%
for the secret government
programs dealing with UFOs.

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:10.210 align:middle line:84%
They were flying on the private
jet of the director of NASA.

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And Dan Goldin looked at her,
was looking down at the city

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:17.860 align:middle line:84%
below and said the
masses are asses.

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:19.150 align:middle line:90%
They don't know anything.

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And they don't need
to know anything,

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.190 align:middle line:84%
clearly indicating he did
and shut her down, wouldn't

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:25.340 align:middle line:90%
talk about it.

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And so I give this just
as one example of here

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:32.710 align:middle line:84%
is someone, an incredibly
highly ranking person in NASA,

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:35.440 align:middle line:84%
open minded and interested
in the subject, who could

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.390 align:middle line:90%
find nothing through channels.

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:39.610 align:middle line:90%
We did the briefing for her.

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And then she asked
the director of NASA.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And he just basically says no
one needs to know about this.

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:46.240 align:middle line:90%
Be quiet.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And so people have
to understand that.

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:54.610 align:middle line:84%
That is how the system
is set up and many times

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:57.280 align:middle line:84%
being run completely
illegally, where

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.110 align:middle line:84%
the oversight committees
in the Congress

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:01.277 align:middle line:84%
or the president-- and this
is true in Great Britain

00:23:01.277 --> 00:23:03.400 align:middle line:84%
and Australia as
well and Canada.

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.730 align:middle line:84%
They'll make a directed
inquiry into this subject

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:09.610 align:middle line:84%
and will be told nothing or
will be told, we won't tell you.

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:12.730 align:middle line:90%


00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:14.790 align:middle line:90%
>> I follow NASA very closely.

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:17.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting their
feeds in various ways.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:21.210 align:middle line:84%
NASA tells you things
without telling you things.

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:23.070 align:middle line:84%
If you don't pay
attention to NASA,

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:25.767 align:middle line:84%
you're going to think
that NASA is hiding a lot,

00:23:25.767 --> 00:23:26.850 align:middle line:90%
but they're not, actually.

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:28.593 align:middle line:90%
They're talking about it.

00:23:28.593 --> 00:23:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And these days, they're
bringing their cameras

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:33.277 align:middle line:84%
in all over the place into
the desert installations

00:23:33.277 --> 00:23:34.110 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:36.510 align:middle line:10%
They're openly
discussing things,

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:39.060 align:middle line:10%
discussing aircraft they
developed 20, 30 years ago

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:42.600 align:middle line:10%
that are still operational,
discussing weird cameras

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:47.170 align:middle line:10%
they invented, which from
space can identify something

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:49.370 align:middle line:10%
as small as a foot long.

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And they've had
this for a while.

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:54.300 align:middle line:84%
We think in terms of
this as modern stuff.

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:55.647 align:middle line:90%
They've had this for decades.

00:23:55.647 --> 00:23:56.730 align:middle line:90%
They're bragging about it.

00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:58.080 align:middle line:90%
They're boasting of it.

00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.280 align:middle line:90%
So can we trust NASA?

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if trust
is the right word.

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:02.730 align:middle line:90%
We have to keep an eye on them.

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:04.720 align:middle line:84%
They haven't seemed
to be hiding anything,

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.307 align:middle line:84%
but that may be we're not
asking the right questions.

00:24:07.307 --> 00:24:09.390 align:middle line:10%
There was a point when we
were having a discussion

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:12.420 align:middle line:10%
with somebody high up
in the US government,

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:15.210 align:middle line:10%
who said part of the
problem with disclosure

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:16.980 align:middle line:10%
and the whole
hullabaloo around it

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:19.255 align:middle line:10%
is that people are not
asking the right questions.

00:24:19.255 --> 00:24:20.880 align:middle line:84%
They're not asking
the right questions,

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.370 align:middle line:84%
because they kind of think
they already know the answers.

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And that is causing a
problem, because they

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.240 align:middle line:90%
can't answer those questions.

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.120 align:middle line:84%
But if you learn to ask
the right questions,

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.500 align:middle line:84%
you might get answers
that will surprise you.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think we have to
take a different approach

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:37.830 align:middle line:84%
to NASA and to the
military-industrial complex.

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And that is to take a less
adversarial position regarding

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:42.670 align:middle line:90%
the government.

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:45.480 align:middle line:84%
We have an adversarial
position, and I understand why.

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.490 align:middle line:84%
Especially the UFO
community really

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:49.530 align:middle line:84%
understands why they
should be adversarial.

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:52.440 align:middle line:10%
There's been a lot of nonsense
and a lot of deliberate

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:56.250 align:middle line:10%
lying by the government
and disinformation agents.

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:59.670 align:middle line:84%
The DOD Bennewitz case
is famous for this.

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's the ultimate example
of people screwing with you

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:03.980 align:middle line:90%
from the government.

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:04.780 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:07.170 align:middle line:84%
There's no reason
that we can see why

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:08.490 align:middle line:90%
they would go to that extent.

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:09.573 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to tell us?

00:25:09.573 --> 00:25:10.697 align:middle line:90%
Don't tell us.

00:25:10.697 --> 00:25:12.030 align:middle line:90%
You want to say it's classified?

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:12.840 align:middle line:90%
It's classified.

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.382 align:middle line:84%
You want to say, I
don't have a clue?

00:25:14.382 --> 00:25:16.860 align:middle line:84%
Say, I don't have a clue,
but don't screw with us.

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:19.740 align:middle line:84%
Don't say, we're going to show
you maybe something that you

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:21.330 align:middle line:90%
should-- no, maybe not.

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:22.920 align:middle line:90%
Now, we have a video.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:23.930 align:middle line:90%
Maybe not.

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:24.930 align:middle line:90%
We have these documents.

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:27.480 align:middle line:84%
You can look at them now,
but you can't see them later.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:28.680 align:middle line:90%
This kind of stuff--

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:29.850 align:middle line:90%
what does it accomplish?

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:30.650 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:33.330 align:middle line:84%
So we know they've screwed
with us, but a lot of that

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:36.497 align:middle line:84%
was Cold War era
doing, not all of it.

00:25:36.497 --> 00:25:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And they had a lot
of nuclear weapons.

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.140 align:middle line:84%
So I can understand the
nervousness and maybe

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:41.760 align:middle line:84%
the disinformation
from the government

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.090 align:middle line:90%
where this is concerned.

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:44.910 align:middle line:84%
We have to believe
that they have our best

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:48.270 align:middle line:84%
interests at heart at least
in terms of physical security.

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:49.775 align:middle line:90%
Mental security-- not so much.

00:25:49.775 --> 00:25:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of very
decent, very hardworking,

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:55.350 align:middle line:84%
very well-intentioned people
working in the military

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:57.450 align:middle line:84%
and in intelligence
agencies, obviously.

00:25:57.450 --> 00:26:01.140 align:middle line:84%
So that aside, we're now
living in a different era.

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.445 align:middle line:90%
This is no longer the Cold War.

00:26:02.445 --> 00:26:03.570 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we still have enemies.

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:05.310 align:middle line:84%
Yes, Russia may
still be a problem.

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:07.630 align:middle line:84%
China may be a problem,
and so on, and so forth.

00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:09.930 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes
to the phenomenon,

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:10.920 align:middle line:90%
stop screwing with us.

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.680 align:middle line:84%
We have to take a less
adversarial relationship,

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.800 align:middle line:84%
because we've not been getting
any flies with vinegar.

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:19.470 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's a honey
approach we can use.

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:21.190 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk to them nicely.

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:21.990 align:middle line:90%
What about this?

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:23.460 align:middle line:90%
Ask about something specific.

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Ask the right questions, see
what kind of an answer you get.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.190 align:middle line:84%
Find the right people
to ask as well.

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:32.490 align:middle line:84%
Don't think that there's one
big box of UFO secrets buried

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:34.710 align:middle line:84%
somewhere, and there's 10
guys standing around it

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:37.290 align:middle line:84%
with their arms closed, and
that they have the secrets.

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:38.880 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes if it's
compartmented, it

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:41.850 align:middle line:84%
could be scattered throughout
the entire military-industrial

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:42.940 align:middle line:90%
complex.

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:45.465 align:middle line:84%
So there could be a
situation where people

00:26:45.465 --> 00:26:46.590 align:middle line:90%
have a piece of the puzzle.

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:49.140 align:middle line:84%
They don't have all of it,
because it's on need to know.

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Don't talk to them
about aliens up front.

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:53.290 align:middle line:90%
Be careful about that.

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:55.082 align:middle line:84%
But talk to them about
what really happened

00:26:55.082 --> 00:26:56.730 align:middle line:90%
with this crash or that crash.

00:26:56.730 --> 00:27:00.330 align:middle line:84%
Work your way into it, do it
gently, and see what you get.

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:02.100 align:middle line:90%
Because we've been surprised.

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:06.240 align:middle line:84%
I've been surprised at
sometimes the responses you get

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:09.570 align:middle line:84%
and the guidance and, well,
did you think about this?

00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And then they walk away without
actually saying anything.

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:15.570 align:middle line:84%
But it gets you
going in a direction.

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you uncover things
that you didn't expect to find.

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
adversarial position

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:24.660 align:middle line:84%
we've taken all this time hasn't
really resulted in very much.

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:28.370 align:middle line:84%
So like I always say to them,
how's that working out for you?

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:29.170 align:middle line:90%
It's not working.

00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:32.010 align:middle line:90%
So let's try a different way.

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:35.370 align:middle line:84%
>> In December 1960, a NASA
commissioned report was

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:38.280 align:middle line:84%
released to the public
called the Brookings Report,

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:40.800 align:middle line:84%
because it was researched
and authored by the Brookings

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.150 align:middle line:90%
Institution.

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:44.580 align:middle line:10%
The Brookings Report
asked the big question--

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:48.210 align:middle line:10%
what would happen to our
planet, our beliefs, and our way

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:52.230 align:middle line:10%
of life if NASA discovered
extraterrestrial life or even

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:54.900 align:middle line:10%
just extraterrestrial artifacts?

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:57.260 align:middle line:90%
Their answer may surprise you.

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:59.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Brookings Report was
right next door to our office

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.250 align:middle line:10%
at the Jesuit national
headquarters in Washington, DC,

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:07.740 align:middle line:10%
that in 1960, they were asked
to do a confidential report

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:12.190 align:middle line:10%
to determine what effect the
discovery of extraterrestrial

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:14.440 align:middle line:10%
intelligence, highly
technologically developed

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:18.220 align:middle line:10%
intelligence would have on
the American people in global

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:20.140 align:middle line:10%
politics and the
economy, et cetera.

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And the Brookings Institution,
just barely left of center,

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:26.470 align:middle line:84%
liberal organization
actually came up

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:29.110 align:middle line:84%
with the fundamental
conclusion that it

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:34.370 align:middle line:84%
would be probably
better to keep it secret

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:37.370 align:middle line:84%
if we were to discover that
there was such a civilization.

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Because it would be too
disruptive to the United

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:43.180 align:middle line:84%
States, and that it would
disequilibrium in the economy.

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:45.550 align:middle line:84%
It would destabilize
the political order.

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:47.378 align:middle line:84%
And they went on
and on about that.

00:28:47.378 --> 00:28:49.670 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most important
things about the Brookings

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:52.970 align:middle line:84%
Report written in the 1960s
is the section that says

00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:56.420 align:middle line:84%
the implications of the
existence of extraterrestrial

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:57.500 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.780 align:middle line:10%
And in this particular
part of the report,

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.970 align:middle line:10%
it states that if the
general population were

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:04.970 align:middle line:10%
to actually find out about
extraterrestrial life,

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:07.010 align:middle line:10%
it could break down the economy.

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:08.720 align:middle line:84%
It could put people
into a panic.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And it could destroy
the control system

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:12.680 align:middle line:84%
that's already been in
place by many governments

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:14.150 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:17.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, the Brookings
Report was something that was

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:21.620 align:middle line:10%
commissioned with the Brookings
Institute playing this role

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:25.670 align:middle line:10%
of generating the report and
then releasing it to NASA

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:28.850 align:middle line:10%
and to the US Congress.

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And so the Brookings
Report really

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:34.610 align:middle line:84%
identified a number
of things that

00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:37.100 align:middle line:84%
were critical in
terms of understanding

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:41.540 align:middle line:84%
the impact of any discovery
of extraterrestrial life.

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:45.500 align:middle line:84%
There were some scenarios that
suggested that while this could

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:49.040 align:middle line:84%
be a repeat of what
happened with the conquest

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:53.480 align:middle line:84%
of the Americas, where you could
understand the impact of a more

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:55.730 align:middle line:84%
technologically
developed society

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:59.000 align:middle line:84%
upon a less technologically
developed society, culminated

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.260 align:middle line:84%
in the disintegration of
many American societies

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:05.300 align:middle line:90%
during the Spanish conquest.

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:10.190 align:middle line:10%
So it was hypothesized that the
extraterrestrials could view us

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:12.230 align:middle line:10%
similarly as a less
technologically

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:15.980 align:middle line:10%
developed society and
basically come in and impose

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:17.630 align:middle line:10%
their own value systems.

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And that would be
a direct threat

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:23.500 align:middle line:84%
to the sovereignty
of the United States.

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.690 align:middle line:90%
So that was a major concern.

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:28.030 align:middle line:84%
They identified a
number of things

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:31.600 align:middle line:84%
that would be important in
this kind of announcement.

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.970 align:middle line:10%
And the one that I found
most intriguing was

00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:38.890 align:middle line:10%
that of the groups that would
be most likely to be severely

00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:42.670 align:middle line:10%
impacted by disclosure
of the existence

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:45.730 align:middle line:10%
of extraterrestrial life was
the scientific community.

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Because many of these
scientists really

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:51.610 align:middle line:84%
embrace a number
of scientific laws

00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:55.390 align:middle line:84%
as being foundational for
life not only on Earth,

00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:57.820 align:middle line:84%
but possible life throughout
the universe, and that

00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:59.770 align:middle line:90%
these were universal laws.

00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:03.400 align:middle line:10%
And to have
extraterrestrials sharing

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:07.305 align:middle line:10%
more advanced principles
of physics, life sciences,

00:31:07.305 --> 00:31:08.680 align:middle line:10%
that this would
be something that

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:11.980 align:middle line:10%
would be tremendously
damaging to the morale

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:13.630 align:middle line:10%
of many scientists.

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:16.300 align:middle line:10%
And so that was the community
that the Brookings Report

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:21.730 align:middle line:10%
identified as most likely to
suffer the most severe impact

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:23.650 align:middle line:10%
of this kind of announcement.

00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And so you have the scenario
of many scientists entering

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:29.422 align:middle line:84%
into some kind of
mental depression.

00:31:29.422 --> 00:31:30.880 align:middle line:84%
Because all of a
sudden, I find out

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:33.010 align:middle line:84%
that the cherished
laws of physics

00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:38.555 align:middle line:84%
are not inviolable as they
had thought previously.

00:31:38.555 --> 00:31:43.040 align:middle line:10%
>> There's no doubt that NASA is
going to be subject to the same

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:46.100 align:middle line:10%
type of military
secrecy that obtains--

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:48.960 align:middle line:10%
in all other programs the
United States government has.

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And there are numerous incidents
of video cameras in NASA

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:56.750 align:middle line:84%
missions picking
up visual evidence

00:31:56.750 --> 00:32:00.230 align:middle line:84%
of potential other
beings and craft around.

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:02.880 align:middle line:10%
For example, "UFOs and the
National Security State,"

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:06.170 align:middle line:10%
that Richard Dolan has
shown the documented

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:09.020 align:middle line:10%
evidence that the United
States military was

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:12.710 align:middle line:10%
under clear instructions
to suppress and conceal

00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:14.630 align:middle line:10%
any information
that would indicate

00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:17.120 align:middle line:10%
that there was an
extraterrestrial civilization.

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And so that type of secrecy
would spill over into NASA.

00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And there's no doubt,
therefore, that they

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:26.090 align:middle line:84%
have concealed any
data of that kind

00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:28.737 align:middle line:84%
they would have come
into contact with.

00:32:28.737 --> 00:32:31.833 align:middle line:90%
>> 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

00:32:31.833 --> 00:32:32.633 align:middle line:90%
Take-off!

00:32:32.633 --> 00:32:36.530 align:middle line:90%


00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>> NASA can be trusted to do
what it was created to do.

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:45.500 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the problem with the
lack of trust and the part

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:47.480 align:middle line:84%
of the American
people in NASA is

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:53.940 align:middle line:84%
that NASA was sold as this very
romantic space exploration--

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:54.740 align:middle line:90%
"Star Trek."

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:57.260 align:middle line:84%
You reach out where no
man has gone before,

00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:03.290 align:middle line:84%
and explore space, and engaged
a very real level of enthusiasm

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:04.910 align:middle line:84%
on the part of the
American people.

00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:07.220 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, behind
the scenes, it

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:11.060 align:middle line:84%
was really designed to be
a military program that

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:12.770 align:middle line:84%
was established to
try to establish

00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:16.070 align:middle line:84%
US military hegemony
in the high frontier

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:20.750 align:middle line:84%
to take control of a high space,
and get our satellites up,

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:24.470 align:middle line:84%
and be able to engage in a
special additional dimension

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:25.280 align:middle line:90%
of warfare.

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:27.290 align:middle line:10%
Now, fortunately,
they've refrained

00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:31.070 align:middle line:10%
from laying claim to the moon
or trying to lay claim to Mars.

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:34.910 align:middle line:10%
Fortunately, the
romantic aspect of NASA

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:40.250 align:middle line:10%
has had a tempering effect
upon the military objectives

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:41.090 align:middle line:10%
that it's had.

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And so there's this existential
process that is going on,

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:46.790 align:middle line:84%
of trying to determine
which of these elements

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:51.500 align:middle line:84%
is going to ultimately lay
claim to NASA in the future.

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping and I
always have hoped ever

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:56.450 align:middle line:84%
since I wanted to be an
astronaut when I was back

00:33:56.450 --> 00:34:00.920 align:middle line:84%
in high school, that the
more romantic and peaceful

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:04.280 align:middle line:84%
objectives of NASA can
rise to the ascendancy.

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:07.920 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm hoping, that I
can play some role in helping

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.070 align:middle line:90%
that happen.

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:13.780 align:middle line:90%


00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:16.840 align:middle line:84%
>> As we have seen, many of
NASA's official narratives were

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.159 align:middle line:90%
quite dubious.

00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's not surprising
that the space agency

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:23.589 align:middle line:84%
is subject to such intense
scrutiny from the UFO

00:34:23.589 --> 00:34:24.489 align:middle line:90%
community.

00:34:24.489 --> 00:34:27.839 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:34:27.839 --> 00:34:32.000 align:middle line:90%
