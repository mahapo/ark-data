00:00:05.928 --> 00:00:08.892 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.892 --> 00:00:22.230 align:middle line:90%


00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Heil Hitler!

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Many researchers into the
activity of the Germans during

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.580 align:middle line:84%
and after World War II
have begun to realize that

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.510 align:middle line:84%
the Germans were not just
fascinated by UFOs and aliens

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.270 align:middle line:84%
but they were also interested
in developing advanced

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.220 align:middle line:90%
technologies.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.800 align:middle line:90%


00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Nazi Germany
really, during the war,

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.350 align:middle line:90%
had two space programs.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.310 align:middle line:10%
One was under the
control of the SS.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.680 align:middle line:10%
Heinrich Himmler
and Hans Kammler,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.875 align:middle line:10%
they would developing flying
saucer technology using

00:00:56.875 --> 00:00:58.720 align:middle line:10%
anti--gravity, using
torsion-field physics

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.100 align:middle line:10%
principles that Nazi scientists
had realized were feasible.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.230 align:middle line:84%
But their specific goal
was to weaponize these.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.840 align:middle line:84%
Because the Nazis were
interested in global conquest.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously, they
wanted to win the war

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.960 align:middle line:90%
with these super weapons.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Immediately
after World War II,

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.470 align:middle line:84%
also there was the many stories
of the Foo Fighters over

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.040 align:middle line:84%
Germany at the time, and even
also flying saucers and other

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.808 align:middle line:84%
craft that were flying around
Germany and other areas right

00:01:26.808 --> 00:01:29.100 align:middle line:84%
at the end of World War II,
and immediately afterwards.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.370 align:middle line:10%
And of course, that's also
when the whole flying saucer

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.490 align:middle line:10%
madness occurred.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And people typically around
the southern United States,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.880 align:middle line:84%
around Los Angeles,
I mean, they were

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.995 align:middle line:84%
seeing fleets of flying
saucers flying around.

00:01:39.995 --> 00:01:41.370 align:middle line:84%
You had the Lubbock
Lights, which

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.400 align:middle line:84%
were flying saucers
flying in V formations,

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.030 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.750 align:middle line:10%
So the whole saucer madness as
of the early '50s, in my mind,

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.472 align:middle line:10%
must be linked to some
of the things that

00:01:54.472 --> 00:01:55.680 align:middle line:10%
happened during World War II.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.640 align:middle line:10%


00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.720 align:middle line:10%
>> People who fought against
us in World War II developed

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.050 align:middle line:10%
the weapons of mass
destruction that Hitler used.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.750 align:middle line:10%
He rained rockets
down on England, on--

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.660 align:middle line:10%
during the blitz, all
of this horrible stuff.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.300 align:middle line:10%
We got those guys and brought
them to the United States.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.150 align:middle line:10%
And we fired the guys who
helped our space program.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.280 align:middle line:90%
So we brought these guys in.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.680 align:middle line:84%
But the connective tissue is
that they all believed in UFOs.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.920 align:middle line:84%
Hermann Oberth was very open
about believing in UFOs.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Not only did he believe in the
existence of the flying disks,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.890 align:middle line:84%
he firmly believed they were
extraterrestrial in origin.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.140 align:middle line:90%
He went on the record with it.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.330 align:middle line:90%
He's made statements about it.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.820 align:middle line:84%
Wernher von Braun kind of
tried to dodge the question

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.100 align:middle line:84%
a few times but
eventually also conceded

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.760 align:middle line:90%
there was something to it.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.340 align:middle line:10%
So what does this mean, right?

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.220 align:middle line:10%
We had the Americans
who believed in it.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.170 align:middle line:10%
Now we have the Nazis
we've brought over.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.915 align:middle line:10%
Everybody's on board with it.

00:02:52.915 --> 00:02:53.790 align:middle line:10%
Everybody's on board.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.498 align:middle line:10%
That's the one thing
they have in common.

00:02:55.498 --> 00:02:57.620 align:middle line:10%
They're politics,
diametrically opposed.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.890 align:middle line:84%
But their interest
in science, the same.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And their belief in this
phenomenon also the same.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.860 align:middle line:84%
There's a strong belief on
both sides that this was real.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And as I say, it's
kind of a coincidence

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.290 align:middle line:84%
that Dornberger is sent to
Reich Field the same month

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.910 align:middle line:84%
they're bringing in
the Roswell debris.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.960 align:middle line:84%
Did they think Roswell
was a German craft?

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.420 align:middle line:84%
Did the think it was one of
the Horton brother's disks?

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.220 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure they didn't
know at that moment

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.430 align:middle line:90%
that this is extraterrestrial.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.888 align:middle line:84%
They would not have
gone there yet.

00:03:24.888 --> 00:03:26.513 align:middle line:84%
They would have wanted
to know exactly,

00:03:26.513 --> 00:03:27.780 align:middle line:90%
was it a Soviet secret weapon?

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.310 align:middle line:90%
Was it-- what was it?

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And who better to know
than Walter Dornberger, who

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.650 align:middle line:84%
ran Peenemunde for
crying out loud,

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.080 align:middle line:84%
would have known about
all of the black ops

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.650 align:middle line:84%
that they were undertaking,
all of the secret programs.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.480 align:middle line:84%
He would have known
about all of that.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.590 align:middle line:90%
That was his job.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.520 align:middle line:84%
So he was the perfect person
to put in Reich Field.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>> These flying saucer
technologies with things that

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.140 align:middle line:84%
they attempted to
weaponize to win the war.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.850 align:middle line:90%
But ultimately, they failed.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Because they were trying to
use incompatible physics.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.360 align:middle line:84%
So they were trying to use
anti-gravity and torsion-field

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.820 align:middle line:84%
physics, which
was the propulsion

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.820 align:middle line:84%
system of these
flying-saucer craft,

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.370 align:middle line:84%
and combine that with
Newtonian physics

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.120 align:middle line:84%
behind kind of
cannons and artillery.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And trying to attach a cannon
to a flying saucer just

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:16.630 align:middle line:90%
didn't work.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.680 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know, the
repulsive force of a cannon

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.380 align:middle line:84%
would basically
really do great damage

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.140 align:middle line:84%
to the propulsion and the
navigation system of the flying

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.130 align:middle line:90%
saucer.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.610 align:middle line:84%
So it was only after
directed energy weapons were

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.540 align:middle line:84%
developed that these Nazi flying
saucers could be weaponized.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And they actually were working
on directed energy weapons

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.860 align:middle line:90%
during the Second World War.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.950 align:middle line:84%
IG Farben, really
the biggest operation

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.560 align:middle line:84%
in Nazi Germany
during the war, they

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.170 align:middle line:84%
were working on
directed-energy weapons.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.060 align:middle line:90%
We know this from documentation.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.600 align:middle line:84%
But the Nazis'
effort to weaponize

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.970 align:middle line:84%
flying saucers
for the war effort

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.870 align:middle line:90%
basically ran out of time.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>> So in my mind, though we have
mad scientists still out there

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.620 align:middle line:84%
like John Hutchinson or
somebody doing cool experiments

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.550 align:middle line:84%
in their labs and things, but
the military is just light

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.170 align:middle line:90%
years ahead of them.

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:16.700 align:middle line:84%
They've had so much money,
and technological research,

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.000 align:middle line:84%
and even captured
documents and other things

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.070 align:middle line:84%
like that from the
Germans and others,

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:28.220 align:middle line:84%
that they have a giant secret
that they keep under their hat.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And one day, I think, you know,
slowly, it's going to come out.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.780 align:middle line:84%
But until the time it's ready,
the military will, I believe,

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.580 align:middle line:84%
keep developing
these craft in secret

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.990 align:middle line:84%
and, kind of like a magician,
making us look over there when

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.710 align:middle line:90%
we should be looking over here.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.290 align:middle line:84%
>> But the Nazis
had another program.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.830 align:middle line:84%
But this program was
being run in Antartica

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.830 align:middle line:90%
by German secret societies.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And the secret societies,
like the Thule Society,

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.550 align:middle line:84%
the Black Sun
Society, Vril Society,

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.180 align:middle line:84%
these were groups that
Hitler never controlled.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.010 align:middle line:10%
In fact, the Thule
Society-- and this

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.350 align:middle line:10%
is well documented--
actually were responsible

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.420 align:middle line:10%
for the creation of
the National Socialist

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.070 align:middle line:10%
German Workers Party,
the Nazi Party.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.330 align:middle line:84%
That it was the Thule Society,
the occultists, metaphysicians,

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.140 align:middle line:84%
the German aristocratic
elite that basically

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.400 align:middle line:84%
put Hitler in that position
of leading the German Worker's

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Party because they
believed they needed

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.460 align:middle line:84%
a charismatic, nationalist
orator to basically get

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:36.160 align:middle line:84%
German workers to not follow
the communist ideology.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And so Hitler was promoted
by these German elite,

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:40.990 align:middle line:90%
these secret societies.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.050 align:middle line:10%
And so when Hitler came
to power, basically,

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.120 align:middle line:10%
Hitler said, well, how
can I thank you guys

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.590 align:middle line:10%
for everything you've done.

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:48.790 align:middle line:90%
We need resources.

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.150 align:middle line:84%
We need people to help
us build a space program.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Our goal is to
develop flying saucers

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.560 align:middle line:84%
to be able to
travel to the stars.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And Hitler was very
comfortable with that.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And this began in
earnest in 1938, 1939,

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.400 align:middle line:84%
with the first German Nazi
expedition to Antarctica.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And German submarine
fleets basically

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.480 align:middle line:84%
transported, throughout the
entire Second World War,

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.860 align:middle line:84%
enormous amounts of equipment,
and resources, people,

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:21.160 align:middle line:84%
to Antarctica to basically
establish a secret space

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.710 align:middle line:84%
program in Antarctica
that would be

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.290 align:middle line:84%
independent from Hitler's
weaponization program

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:28.090 align:middle line:90%
in Germany.

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.030 align:middle line:10%
And basically, these
German secret societies

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:34.150 align:middle line:10%
had a different agenda
to the Nazi Party.

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.040 align:middle line:10%
And that's very
important to understand,

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.100 align:middle line:10%
why you could actually have
two separate independent space

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.530 align:middle line:10%
programs that was associated
with Nazi Germany.

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:44.116 align:middle line:90%


00:07:44.116 --> 00:07:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, we know
Hitler lost the war in Germany

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.650 align:middle line:84%
with the Allied powers coming
in and liberating Europe.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.800 align:middle line:84%
But the Germans that
were based in Antartica

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.740 align:middle line:84%
never really experienced
any hostilities,

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:01.180 align:middle line:84%
any major hostilities, with
the west up until 1946, '47.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And that was basically when
you had Operation Highjump.

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And by that time, the
Germans in Antarctica

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.480 align:middle line:84%
had time to fully weaponize
their flying saucer craft.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.080 align:middle line:84%
So with Operation Highjump,
the navy aircraft and the ships

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.970 align:middle line:84%
were no match for
the directed energy

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:19.120 align:middle line:84%
weapons of these flying-saucer
craft they were much quicker

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.270 align:middle line:84%
and basically could just
instantaneously appear off

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.610 align:middle line:84%
the bow of a ship and start
shooting or shooting down

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:25.410 align:middle line:90%
aircraft.

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:27.970 align:middle line:84%
So operation Highjump
was a dismal failure.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And when you combined
that military capability

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:34.539 align:middle line:84%
that the Germans in Antarctica
had with the enormous amounts

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:38.530 align:middle line:84%
of capital that were
taken out of Europe

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:41.559 align:middle line:84%
by the Nazis' industrialists
once they realized

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:44.740 align:middle line:84%
that the war was lost,
the Red House Report, that

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:47.410 align:middle line:84%
dates from around
the August of 1944

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:49.790 align:middle line:84%
immediately after the
Normandy invasion.

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.090 align:middle line:10%
Martin Bormann,
the deputy fuhrer,

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:54.480 align:middle line:10%
basically told the major
German corporations

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.020 align:middle line:10%
to take all their capital out.

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.610 align:middle line:10%
Because the war was lost.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:59.950 align:middle line:10%
The Third Reich was at an end.

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:03.340 align:middle line:10%
With that capital that was
being taken out of Germany,

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:05.570 align:middle line:10%
a Fourth Reich could be created.

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And so they had two major
components of the Fourth Reich.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:12.910 align:middle line:10%
One was the military power of
the German Space Program out

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:17.590 align:middle line:10%
of Antartica and the economic
power of the huge amounts

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:20.080 align:middle line:10%
of capital and
financial resources

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.240 align:middle line:10%
that were taken
out of Germany just

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.700 align:middle line:10%
before the end of
the Second World War.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:28.642 align:middle line:10%
A lot of the capital that
was taken out of Germany--

00:09:28.642 --> 00:09:30.100 align:middle line:10%
in the Red House
Report it actually

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:33.880 align:middle line:10%
specifies where the
industrialists and the bankers

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:38.260 align:middle line:10%
should basically direct the
funds and any other resources,

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.120 align:middle line:10%
patents and so
forth, that would be

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.630 align:middle line:10%
important for the creation
of the Fourth Reich.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And so these were
major companies,

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:50.750 align:middle line:84%
IG Farben, Volkswagen,
Siemens, Krupp, Thyssens.

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:52.480 align:middle line:84%
Many of these
companies basically

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.580 align:middle line:90%
took a lot of this capital.

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.800 align:middle line:90%
And it was taken to places--

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.520 align:middle line:84%
neutral countries like
Switzerland, Spain, Sweden,

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.500 align:middle line:90%
Argentina, Brazil.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And also, they began
sending some of those funds

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:10.150 align:middle line:84%
and resources to companies
that the German industrials had

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:11.800 align:middle line:90%
worked with before the war.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.320 align:middle line:84%
So for example, IG
Farben had worked

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.440 align:middle line:84%
with a number of US
industries like Standard Oil

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.000 align:middle line:90%
and so forth before the war.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.640 align:middle line:84%
So it was very easy for
them to kind of send

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:26.200 align:middle line:84%
some of this capital into, say,
some American subsidiaries that

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:31.950 align:middle line:84%
were actually controlled
by these German companies.

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:35.250 align:middle line:10%
>> When Secretary of Defense
James Forrestal visited Germany

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:38.910 align:middle line:10%
just after the war, he and
others discovered the unusual

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:42.210 align:middle line:10%
technologies that the
Germans had been working on.

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:44.940 align:middle line:84%
It was at this time that the
upper levels of the United

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:49.740 align:middle line:84%
States military began to
contemplate the unthinkable.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Project Paperclip, to me,
is they point at which we made

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.380 align:middle line:90%
a deal with the devil.

00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.530 align:middle line:84%
We sacrificed our
soul for security.

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.870 align:middle line:84%
There was no reason we had
to take on the Paperclip

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:04.925 align:middle line:90%
scientists.

00:11:04.925 --> 00:11:07.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, we had
their documentation.

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:08.890 align:middle line:90%
We interrogated them.

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:11.680 align:middle line:84%
We interrogated Wernher von
Braun in Germany, Dornberger,

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.317 align:middle line:90%
all those guys.

00:11:13.317 --> 00:11:14.650 align:middle line:90%
We had a lot of their documents.

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:18.790 align:middle line:10%
We found enormous
caches of records

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:23.020 align:middle line:10%
and spare parts for aircraft,
and rockets, and the V2s,

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:24.640 align:middle line:10%
all of this we found.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.490 align:middle line:10%
There was no need, really,
to bring them all to the US,

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:31.160 align:middle line:10%
and make them citizens,
and basically replace

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.890 align:middle line:10%
these scientists that we had.

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:34.420 align:middle line:10%
Something was very
fishy about that.

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:37.870 align:middle line:10%
And to this day, I think that
that's the point where we just

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:40.040 align:middle line:10%
crossed the line.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.480 align:middle line:10%
>> When we first discovered
Project Paperclip,

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.530 align:middle line:10%
when I was back working for the
Jesuit National Headquarters

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:49.370 align:middle line:10%
in Washington DC, we realized
that the United States

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:53.300 align:middle line:10%
at the very end of the Second
World War engaged in a very

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:58.400 align:middle line:10%
aggressive program to commandeer
the German scientists that were

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:02.150 align:middle line:10%
working on the rocket
program, the V2 program.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And the United States really got
much the better of the Soviet

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:08.270 align:middle line:84%
Union in that contest
to try to commandeer

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:10.490 align:middle line:84%
these scientists to
try to get access

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:14.540 align:middle line:84%
to that military technology so
the United States can use it

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:16.070 align:middle line:90%
to their advantage.

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And Project Paperclip was the
codename for the actual effort

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:23.020 align:middle line:90%
to recruit these scientists.

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:24.560 align:middle line:10%
Well, recruit them,
either threaten

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:28.130 align:middle line:10%
to put them in prison as war
criminals, or get them to come

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:29.450 align:middle line:10%
and work for us.

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:32.270 align:middle line:10%
And they, not surprisingly,
chose the latter.

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:36.680 align:middle line:10%
>> Truman, as president, ordered
the Pentagon not to bring

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.630 align:middle line:10%
in Nazis into this program.

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.000 align:middle line:84%
He says, if these people
have any kind of suspect

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.600 align:middle line:90%
backgrounds, we don't want them.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.480 align:middle line:90%
I don't care what the value is.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And the Pentagon basically
ignored him completely.

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:47.960 align:middle line:90%
They doctored records.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.040 align:middle line:90%
They changed things.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.900 align:middle line:90%
They brought these guys in.

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:52.730 align:middle line:90%
Some of them were really vile.

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:55.250 align:middle line:84%
One or two we had to send
back-- they were that vile--

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:56.600 align:middle line:90%
because people found out.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.200 align:middle line:90%
But most of them had--

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.990 align:middle line:90%
they were problematic.

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And Paperclip we were doing
because we were afraid

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:04.490 align:middle line:84%
the Soviets would get
ahold of these scientists.

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And they would get
the technology.

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:07.610 align:middle line:90%
We wanted it first.

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:09.890 align:middle line:84%
So we're scrambling
through Europe

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:12.020 align:middle line:84%
to get to all the
documents and the personnel

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:13.760 align:middle line:90%
before the Soviets.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And the Germans were
more than happy to not

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.930 align:middle line:84%
be captured by the Soviets
and be captured by the British

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:21.920 align:middle line:90%
or the Americans.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.040 align:middle line:10%
So they were running in our
direction anyway, Wernher von

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.450 align:middle line:10%
Braun particularly.

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:29.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was an opportunist
from the word "go."

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.770 align:middle line:84%
So all of these
guys were running

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:34.580 align:middle line:84%
towards the American embrace
and willing to just sign off

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:36.830 align:middle line:84%
on anything, according
to what we've learned.

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:39.790 align:middle line:84%
The Soviets were making
the same kind of push.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't get
some scientists.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:42.830 align:middle line:90%
And they got some of that.

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And it did help them
with their programs.

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:48.950 align:middle line:10%
So Paperclip, though,
started with, when I first

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:52.980 align:middle line:10%
started researching
it, maybe 100 to 200,

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.950 align:middle line:10%
maybe 300 scientists.

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:58.310 align:middle line:84%
Now we know it was more
than 1,000, pushing 2,000,

00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:59.270 align:middle line:90%
maybe more.

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:00.728 align:middle line:84%
And that's just
the ones we brought

00:14:00.728 --> 00:14:02.895 align:middle line:84%
in the continental
United States.

00:14:02.895 --> 00:14:04.520 align:middle line:10%
That's not the ones
we helped to escape

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:07.340 align:middle line:10%
to other parts of the world,
and set up one way or the other,

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:08.820 align:middle line:10%
and protected.

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:11.090 align:middle line:84%
So we had Nazi war
criminals everywhere.

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And the scientists were
particularly valuable.

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.520 align:middle line:84%
And we had, you
know, Otto Skorzeny,

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.820 align:middle line:84%
who was a famous Nazi
commando, running an operation

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:23.060 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt composed of
German rocket scientists

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:25.790 align:middle line:84%
developing rocket
technology for Egypt.

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:30.055 align:middle line:84%
So this was going on
at a tremendous clip.

00:14:30.055 --> 00:14:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And we couldn't
trust these guys.

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And we had reasons
not to trust them.

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:35.840 align:middle line:84%
They were screwing
with the program.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:38.458 align:middle line:84%
They were sabotaging it
from the very beginning.

00:14:38.458 --> 00:14:39.750 align:middle line:90%
They knew what they were doing.

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And they were in
constant contact

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:45.170 align:middle line:84%
with the other scientists
in Europe and in Russia.

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:46.880 align:middle line:90%
Their mail was not monitored.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.390 align:middle line:90%
Nothing was censored.

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:52.520 align:middle line:10%
>> And Operation Paperclip was
the parallel program to another

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:56.090 align:middle line:10%
program that was called
Operation Overcast,

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:59.450 align:middle line:10%
which is where the United
States attempted to bring in all

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:03.000 align:middle line:10%
of the anti-Communist,
anti-Soviet,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.110 align:middle line:10%
and ant--Eastern-bloc
political intelligence officers

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:07.040 align:middle line:10%
of the Third Reich.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:10.160 align:middle line:84%
So what happened is the United
States basically harvested

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.600 align:middle line:84%
all of these leaders
of the Third Reich,

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.800 align:middle line:84%
and brought them
in, and put them

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.580 align:middle line:84%
in charge of major-- not
only the rocket program

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:22.460 align:middle line:84%
in the United States, but the
covert intelligence operations

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:23.810 align:middle line:90%
of the United States.

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:26.300 align:middle line:84%
So that we started
taking on this kind

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.520 align:middle line:84%
of authoritarian, fascist,
national security state

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.320 align:middle line:90%
element.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And so our rocket program had
two different faces, the NASA

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:37.850 align:middle line:84%
face, the pretty face,
this peaceful face,

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:39.140 align:middle line:90%
the romantic face.

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.540 align:middle line:10%
And there was this other
clandestine operation

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:44.390 align:middle line:10%
of building bigger, and
bigger, and bigger missiles

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:47.240 align:middle line:10%
with triple boosters
so that we can

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.670 align:middle line:10%
deliver a payload
right on to Moscow

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:51.000 align:middle line:10%
within a matter of minutes.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.840 align:middle line:10%
So there's always been this
schizophrenic quality to NASA

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.410 align:middle line:10%
and the rocket program
in the United States.

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And Paperclip was the codename
for the beginning of this kind

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:05.930 align:middle line:90%
of schizophrenic program.

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>> But there was no
push for them, really.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.520 align:middle line:84%
There was no motivation for
them to help the United States.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:14.600 align:middle line:84%
They didn't suddenly
become patriotic Americans.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.367 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't happen.

00:16:16.367 --> 00:16:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And there were a lot
of personality problems

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.940 align:middle line:90%
with the Nazis we brought over.

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:21.350 align:middle line:90%
But that was Paperclip.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:23.450 align:middle line:90%
It was very controversial.

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:26.750 align:middle line:84%
Roosevelt's widow railed
against the program.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.990 align:middle line:84%
Einstein held a conference at
one point in New York City.

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:32.570 align:middle line:10%
They were all members of
an event in which they said

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:34.260 align:middle line:10%
we can't be doing this anymore.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.140 align:middle line:84%
This is wrong, but
they were considered

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:39.680 align:middle line:84%
to be leftists, and socialists,
and quasi-communists.

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:40.670 align:middle line:90%
So they were ignored.

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:43.130 align:middle line:84%
Because the real enemy
now was the Soviet Union.

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:44.630 align:middle line:84%
We're no longer at
war with Germany.

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:45.740 align:middle line:90%
All is forgiven.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.780 align:middle line:90%
The Holocaust was forgiven.

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.085 align:middle line:90%
The atrocities were forgiven.

00:16:49.085 --> 00:16:50.960 align:middle line:84%
The fact that they killed
20 million Russians

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:54.130 align:middle line:84%
alone was not cause
for concern any longer.

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:55.510 align:middle line:90%
Nothing was.

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And we remember that Patton
at the end of World War II

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:01.390 align:middle line:84%
was urgently telling
Truman, let me go to Russia,

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:03.850 align:middle line:84%
let me go to Moscow, let
me take the troops that I

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:06.843 align:middle line:84%
have plus the Germans
who know how to fight.

00:17:06.843 --> 00:17:07.760 align:middle line:90%
We'll all go together.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.210 align:middle line:90%
And we'll take Russia back.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:10.900 align:middle line:90%
We'll liberate Moscow.

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.589 align:middle line:84%
And Patton is saying, we were
shooting at the wrong enemy,

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:15.339 align:middle line:90%
one of patents famous lines.

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:17.740 align:middle line:84%
He liked the Germans
that he captured.

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And this was kind
of the mentality

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:21.347 align:middle line:84%
of our American
military at the time.

00:17:21.347 --> 00:17:22.930 align:middle line:84%
The Germans are
really great fighters.

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:24.670 align:middle line:84%
They have the great
military operation.

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:26.230 align:middle line:90%
Their machine is wonderful.

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:28.780 align:middle line:10%
Plus they have all these great
toys, all these secret weapons

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:29.665 align:middle line:10%
and stuff.

00:17:29.665 --> 00:17:30.790 align:middle line:90%
They should be on our side.

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:32.110 align:middle line:90%
Or we should be on their side.

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:34.628 align:middle line:84%
And we'll all go against
the Soviet Union.

00:17:34.628 --> 00:17:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And that was the mentality
in the Catholic church

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:38.150 align:middle line:90%
at the time, as well.

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:39.760 align:middle line:90%
Let's go embed with the Nazis.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.100 align:middle line:84%
Because at least
they're anti-Communist.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.470 align:middle line:84%
A lot of Americans felt
that way in those days.

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:46.450 align:middle line:84%
They were more
terrified of Russia

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:49.030 align:middle line:84%
than they were
disgusted by the Nazis.

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:54.220 align:middle line:90%


00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:56.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Although there was outrage
that the United States was

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:59.950 align:middle line:84%
bringing in the so-called
enemy into its most secret

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:03.640 align:middle line:84%
institutions, no one really
tried to stop Operation

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:04.960 align:middle line:90%
Paperclip.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.290 align:middle line:84%
It was the Germans' research
into Die Glocke, or Bell

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Technology, that made
their entrance into America

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:13.120 align:middle line:90%
so important.

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:15.730 align:middle line:84%
The Americans had toyed
with anti-gravity technology

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:19.450 align:middle line:84%
before through the work of
Nikola Tesla and T. Townsend

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:20.680 align:middle line:90%
Brown.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.590 align:middle line:84%
This interest was realized
in the famous Philadelphia

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:27.820 align:middle line:84%
experiment, in which a ship was
made to disappear and reappear

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.620 align:middle line:90%
miles away.

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:31.210 align:middle line:84%
But it was only
with the migration

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:34.150 align:middle line:84%
of German scientists
after World War II

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:36.220 align:middle line:84%
that the United
States got a jumpstart

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:38.396 align:middle line:90%
on these technologies.

00:18:38.396 --> 00:18:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Anti-gravity technology's
been suppressed since the first

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:46.420 align:middle line:84%
studies showed that
this was very feasible.

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think that dates from
the Los Angeles air raid

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:53.170 align:middle line:84%
incident in 1942, where
the Army and the Navy

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:57.850 align:middle line:84%
were able to retrieve some
craft that were shot down

00:18:57.850 --> 00:18:59.795 align:middle line:90%
by the artillery barrage.

00:18:59.795 --> 00:19:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And when they studied
it, they actually

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:06.460 align:middle line:84%
found that these technologies,
anti-gravity, were feasible.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:10.000 align:middle line:84%
But the war effort meant
that they couldn't really

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.970 align:middle line:84%
investigate it until
the war was completed.

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:17.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And in the '50s,
you had people like T.

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Townsend Brown and others openly
talking about gravity control,

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.930 align:middle line:84%
gravity research,
doing anti-gravity.

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:30.750 align:middle line:10%
It was a topic that was being
tossed around quite a bit.

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:34.990 align:middle line:84%
But suddenly in the late '50s
they just put a lid on it.

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:36.260 align:middle line:90%
You didn't hear about this.

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.170 align:middle line:84%
You didn't hear about
scientists talking

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:41.290 align:middle line:84%
about gravity control,
artificial gravity, or anything

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:42.370 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:46.160 align:middle line:84%
Everything suddenly switched
to rockets and jets.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:50.943 align:middle line:84%
They also essentially suppressed
knowledge of the Tesla.

00:19:50.943 --> 00:19:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And that was part
of the thing, is

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:55.210 align:middle line:84%
that they, NASA
and the military,

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:58.210 align:middle line:84%
they wanted us to
think of space travel

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:01.450 align:middle line:84%
as being something
that's done with rockets

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:04.030 align:middle line:84%
like a big giant
firecracker under your half

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:05.910 align:middle line:90%
and going to the moon.

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:08.770 align:middle line:84%
But Tesla died in
1943 during the war.

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:10.870 align:middle line:84%
If he had survived
World War II and had

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:13.380 align:middle line:84%
in any way been a part
of our space program,

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.150 align:middle line:84%
we would have a completely
different space program, one

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:21.040 align:middle line:84%
that-- with electric type
of craft, anti-gravity,

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.550 align:middle line:90%
all of those things.

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:25.250 align:middle line:90%


00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:28.760 align:middle line:84%
>> The other part of
it is the technology.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:33.910 align:middle line:10%
So when people hear
this information,

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:39.340 align:middle line:10%
they are shocked that,
beginning in 1954, October,

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:40.840 align:middle line:10%
we didn't need surface roads.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.840 align:middle line:84%
We'd figured out zero-point
energy from study

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.790 align:middle line:84%
not only what humans
were developing

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:48.670 align:middle line:84%
from the era of Tesla
and T. Townsend Brown,

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:50.350 align:middle line:84%
who was the genius
who was doing things

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:52.810 align:middle line:84%
with high-voltage
systems and crystals

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:54.310 align:middle line:84%
with things
levitating-- literally,

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:56.140 align:middle line:90%
that was going on in late '20s.

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And it was reproduced in
Germany before World War

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:02.210 align:middle line:84%
II in the late '20s, the
Kowsky-Frost experiment.

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:07.510 align:middle line:84%
What you see is that that
stream of covert research

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:11.200 align:middle line:84%
into high-voltage,
high-frequency, electromagnetic

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.350 align:middle line:84%
fields that would give you
free energy and levitation,

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:16.390 align:middle line:84%
joined with the
reverse engineering

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:19.720 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial
vehicles in the mid '40s

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:23.110 align:middle line:84%
and after, after Roswell and
perhaps even before Roswell.

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:26.770 align:middle line:84%
Add to that at the end
of World War II, the OSS,

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:31.750 align:middle line:84%
that became the CIA, went to
Germany and acquired a disk

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:34.720 align:middle line:84%
and also a bell-shaped object
that Adolf Hitler was working

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.290 align:middle line:84%
on, which was his
secret weapon, which--

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:38.930 align:middle line:90%
this is 100% percent true--

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:41.800 align:middle line:84%
which was based on
so-called anti-gravity and

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.420 align:middle line:90%
electromagnetic fields.

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:47.050 align:middle line:84%
Proper term is
electromagneto-gravitic, so

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:49.450 align:middle line:90%
electromagneto-gravitic, EMG.

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:53.980 align:middle line:84%
So those were brought over
under Operation Paperclip.

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:58.090 align:middle line:84%
So all of that was secrecy
from the World War II era on

00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:00.250 align:middle line:84%
became more and more
compartmentalized

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:04.630 align:middle line:84%
the more they had breakthroughs,
including in October of '54,

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:06.620 align:middle line:90%
gravity control was mastered.

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:10.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, a man who was at the Naval
Research Labs, the biggest

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Department of Defense lab in
the United States, personally

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:14.170 align:middle line:84%
told me that he
was in the vault.

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:16.035 align:middle line:90%
And his name's Rick Foch.

00:22:16.035 --> 00:22:18.160 align:middle line:84%
He had been in the vault
and seen the documentation

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:21.040 align:middle line:84%
that we had mastered gravity
control in October of '54,

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:25.310 align:middle line:84%
and also, before that, this
free energy, zero-point energy.

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:27.650 align:middle line:84%
So that means that, if
that were to come out,

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:32.020 align:middle line:84%
it would be the end of oil,
gas, coal, nuclear power,

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:36.790 align:middle line:84%
centralized utilities, road
construction, surface roads,

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:40.930 align:middle line:84%
engines and ships,
rockets, jets, all of it.

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:42.340 align:middle line:90%
All of it's obsolete.

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:46.060 align:middle line:84%
We would the burden that we
had placed upon Gaia because we

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:48.640 align:middle line:84%
have overstayed our
welcome in terms

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.630 align:middle line:84%
of the technological
system we're using,

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:54.940 align:middle line:84%
which is really an 1800s
paradigm, of fossil fuels.

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Even atomic power, nuclear
power, is from the mid '40s.

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:01.720 align:middle line:84%
So everything since the
mid '40s is in a black box.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And we're killing the
planet keeping it secret.

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:09.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, in the future, if we
can overcome the problem that

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:10.720 align:middle line:10%
we're having on our
planet right now,

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:15.100 align:middle line:10%
it's going to allow us to travel
to the stars in a way that we

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:16.510 align:middle line:10%
can only dream about now.

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:19.030 align:middle line:84%
All of the videos
surrounding John Hutchinson,

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:21.340 align:middle line:84%
you're seeing exactly
what I'm describing.

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.260 align:middle line:84%
This is a man who's
figured out a way

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:27.760 align:middle line:84%
to use electromagnetic
energy in order to create

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.660 align:middle line:90%
any gravitational effects.

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:32.530 align:middle line:84%
Right now, the only
scientists that

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:35.680 align:middle line:84%
have been able to
duplicate a lot of this

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.840 align:middle line:90%
have no government funding.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.610 align:middle line:84%
The government doesn't want
the technology to be known.

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And so for these guys to
be doing it on their own

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:50.420 align:middle line:84%
is not only putting themselves
at risk, but at the same time,

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:51.670 align:middle line:90%
it's easy to suppress it.

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:53.950 align:middle line:84%
Because you can just write
them off as crackpots.

00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:55.820 align:middle line:90%
This is just a crazy scientist.

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.250 align:middle line:90%
Oh, don't listen to him.

00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:58.390 align:middle line:90%
He's not part of us.

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:00.937 align:middle line:90%


00:24:00.937 --> 00:24:01.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Here's the truth.

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:04.102 align:middle line:84%
The truth is the patent
dumping has already started.

00:24:04.102 --> 00:24:06.060 align:middle line:10%
Because we just got a
patent a couple days ago,

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:08.490 align:middle line:10%
the TR-3B, this
triangular-shaped

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:11.250 align:middle line:10%
electrostatic,
electro-gravitically-powered

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:12.930 align:middle line:10%
aircraft that
everybody has known as

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:14.575 align:middle line:10%
existed for 10 or 20 years now.

00:24:14.575 --> 00:24:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And they actually just dumped
the patent on the internet.

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:18.720 align:middle line:84%
So that's what's going
to happen, I think,

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.730 align:middle line:84%
is we're going to have
this steady release

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:23.412 align:middle line:84%
of patented information
that's just going to come out.

00:24:23.412 --> 00:24:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to appear on
Google Patents somewhere.

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:27.495 align:middle line:84%
There's not going to be
any big announcement.

00:24:27.495 --> 00:24:28.920 align:middle line:84%
So here's an
anti-gravity device.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.390 align:middle line:84%
But it's slowly
going to come out.

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:31.190 align:middle line:90%
Because it has to.

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:33.873 align:middle line:84%
Because we have to transition
from the oil-based economy

00:24:33.873 --> 00:24:35.790 align:middle line:84%
to the new economy,
whatever it's going to be.

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:37.635 align:middle line:84%
And trust me, I believe
we are still going

00:24:37.635 --> 00:24:38.760 align:middle line:90%
to have an economic system.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.260 align:middle line:84%
We're still going to
have to have money.

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:42.343 align:middle line:84%
We're still going to have
some form of capitalism.

00:24:42.343 --> 00:24:45.750 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the only way that
you can grow into outer space,

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:47.345 align:middle line:84%
you can grow into
the solar system,

00:24:47.345 --> 00:24:48.720 align:middle line:84%
is you've got to
have an economy.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And capitalism gives
you that capability.

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:54.593 align:middle line:84%
Because eventually, the planet
is going to become so wealthy.

00:24:54.593 --> 00:24:56.760 align:middle line:84%
But the population is going
to continue to increase,

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:59.490 align:middle line:84%
that the only way to keep
the system moving forward

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:01.620 align:middle line:84%
and generate growth
is to go off world.

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:04.320 align:middle line:84%
So when I look at it, I
think that by the time

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:07.133 align:middle line:84%
we get done with everything
that happens during this period,

00:25:07.133 --> 00:25:08.550 align:middle line:84%
we're probably
going to be looking

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:11.340 align:middle line:84%
at a new system, maybe
based on helium 3

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:14.010 align:middle line:84%
or some other energy
source like that.

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:19.260 align:middle line:10%
So I don't see that we can
have an immediate crash

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:22.290 align:middle line:10%
transition from
an-oil based economy

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:23.430 align:middle line:10%
to a free-energy system.

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:26.130 align:middle line:84%
I think that would be too
shocking, too disruptive, would

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:27.280 align:middle line:90%
cause a lot of damage.

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.550 align:middle line:84%
So I think we're going to
have a steady, slow walk

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:31.710 align:middle line:84%
kind of release of
this information

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:35.790 align:middle line:84%
over the next few years, maybe
over the next 8 or 10 years.

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:38.430 align:middle line:84%
To me, it looks like setting
the stage for the next phase

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:39.900 align:middle line:90%
of global evolution.

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And the politics
are going to shift.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.817 align:middle line:84%
And I think the Arab-Israeli
conflict is going to go away.

00:25:43.817 --> 00:25:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And the Saudis seem to want
to get on board with that.

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:50.040 align:middle line:84%
So as you look at this stuff,
I see tremendous transition

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.670 align:middle line:84%
and change over
the next few years.

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And it seems like the Saudis
want to be part of that.

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:56.080 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to be enemies.

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.498 align:middle line:90%
And I think-- you know, look.

00:25:57.498 --> 00:25:59.790 align:middle line:84%
We're always going to need
oil, a certain amount of it.

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:01.500 align:middle line:84%
Because we use it for
all kinds of stuff

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:02.790 align:middle line:90%
besides motor vehicles.

00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:05.070 align:middle line:10%
So we're always going
to have a need for oil.

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:08.050 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to be a lot
less of a need than it is now.

00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And the price is going
to be a lot less.

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.990 align:middle line:84%
So I see people
that have benevolent

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:16.197 align:middle line:84%
plans to transition
us to a better way.

00:26:16.197 --> 00:26:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think that you
and I are right-- we're

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:19.620 align:middle line:84%
right in the thick of
it in this generation.

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:21.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, right now, we're
going to see this stuff happen

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:22.590 align:middle line:90%
right before our eyes.

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:27.280 align:middle line:90%


00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Anti-gravity technology
was discovered by the Germans

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:33.540 align:middle line:90%
and perfected by the Americans.

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:36.150 align:middle line:84%
But why did they keep
all of this secret?

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:38.520 align:middle line:10%
After this technology
was perfected,

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:40.680 align:middle line:10%
the United States
started an agency

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.710 align:middle line:10%
that would be in charge
of exploring space.

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:48.500 align:middle line:84%
In our next episode, we'll
explore the origins of NASA.

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:55.000 align:middle line:90%
