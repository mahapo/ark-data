00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.530 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1945, a young Egyptian
farmer discovered some clay

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.900 align:middle line:84%
jars in the back of a cave near
the city of Nag Hammadi, Egypt.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.770 align:middle line:84%
Inside these clay jars were
13 leather bound codices,

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.110 align:middle line:84%
comprising 52 mostly
Gnostic texts.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.720 align:middle line:84%
These texts have been
translated and represent

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.790 align:middle line:84%
one of the greatest
archaeological

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.990 align:middle line:84%
as well as philosophical
discoveries of all time.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.480 align:middle line:84%
For the first time in
history, the ancient Gnostics

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.210 align:middle line:84%
revealed their knowledge
without the interference

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.590 align:middle line:90%
of a pope or monarch.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.840 align:middle line:84%
What we discover is
a far different view

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.360 align:middle line:84%
of reality than that
of the other three

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.737 align:middle line:90%
main Western religions.

00:01:05.737 --> 00:01:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>> The Gnostic texts are a
collection of books that were

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.030 align:middle line:84%
discovered in Nag
Hammadi, Egypt in 1945.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.610 align:middle line:10%
They represent the
writings of the earliest

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.590 align:middle line:10%
or first Christians.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.600 align:middle line:10%
In fact, the Gnostic
texts themselves

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.750 align:middle line:10%
tell us that they were written
by the disciples of Jesus, who

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.630 align:middle line:10%
appeared to them
after his Resurrection

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.900 align:middle line:10%
and gave them instructions
and navigational formulas

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.490 align:middle line:10%
for traveling in the afterlife.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.250 align:middle line:84%
So the Gnostic texts
are really considered

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.900 align:middle line:84%
to be the secret or
lost teachings of Jesus.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.140 align:middle line:84%
"Gnosis" is a Greek word
that means "knowledge".

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.480 align:middle line:84%
the Gnostics believed
that we each had

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.780 align:middle line:84%
within us a divine
spark that manifested

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.960 align:middle line:84%
our physical human body as
a vehicle for exploration

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.140 align:middle line:84%
in this realm, but ultimately
that our divine spark became

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.060 align:middle line:90%
trapped in this realm.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And the only way to
escape earth life

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.050 align:middle line:84%
was to achieve knowledge,
enlightenment, or gnosis.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.930 align:middle line:84%
Gnosticism is really
the self-realization

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.290 align:middle line:84%
or enlightenment of the
divine spark within us.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.419 align:middle line:84%
The Nag Hammadi
texts are vital to us

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:12.450 align:middle line:84%
to understand the earliest
form of Christianity.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.090 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the true
form of Christianity.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.860 align:middle line:84%
Many of them were written
between 200 and 350 to 400 AD,

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.740 align:middle line:84%
before Christianity
and the New Testament

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.960 align:middle line:90%
as we know it was codified.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.930 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually a different
story and a different take

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.530 align:middle line:84%
on Christianity, and
the important part of it

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.020 align:middle line:84%
is that these are the
teachings of the living, risen,

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.360 align:middle line:90%
or resurrected Jesus.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.610 align:middle line:84%
Traditional Christianity,
the New Testament,

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.280 align:middle line:84%
focuses on the words that
Jesus spoke while he was

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.800 align:middle line:90%
in the flesh and blood body.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.870 align:middle line:84%
The Gnostic texts
are the teachings

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.480 align:middle line:84%
of Jesus in his
celestial flesh, where

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.180 align:middle line:84%
he's returning after
his Resurrection

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.400 align:middle line:84%
to assist the Gnostics and
guiding them into the afterlife

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.310 align:middle line:84%
and in navigating the afterlife
realms, the kingdom of heaven.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.820 align:middle line:84%
Because the Gnostic texts refer
to the teachings of the living

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.695 align:middle line:84%
Jesus, they were a threat
to traditional Christianity.

00:03:06.695 --> 00:03:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
they are attacked

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.690 align:middle line:84%
by orthodox or
traditional Christians.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.600 align:middle line:10%
>> Fascinating movement that
took place between roughly 600

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.860 align:middle line:10%
BC and just a little
into the AD years,

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.530 align:middle line:10%
almost 1,000 years
where all of a sudden,

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.830 align:middle line:10%
all these philosophies arose,
like some of the philosophies

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:30.630 align:middle line:10%
of Plato.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.090 align:middle line:84%
The Gnostics later came
along and then adopted

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.510 align:middle line:90%
some of those philosophies.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And in India, you get
this similar thing.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.590 align:middle line:84%
They often started off as
philosophers, like Buddhism.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Or Buddha said the gods are
not the highest thing here.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And these philosophies
generally tried

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.190 align:middle line:84%
to help people escape the
reincarnation process.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.470 align:middle line:84%
For example, some of the
Greek philosophers that

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.590 align:middle line:84%
arose from platonic philosophy
saying the same thing.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And the reincarnation process,
if you read the old creation

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.380 align:middle line:84%
stories, was necessary
to create a slave race.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.160 align:middle line:84%
You had to basically keep
a soul in the human body,

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.760 align:middle line:84%
keep it stuck there, or at
least returning if you wanted

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.980 align:middle line:90%
to keep the slaveries going.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.230 align:middle line:10%
And that's what one of the
very first creation stories

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.420 align:middle line:10%
talks about, like when they
bioengineered human beings,

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.550 align:middle line:10%
they had to put a soul.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.420 align:middle line:84%
They had to put a consciousness
in that body to make it work,

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.960 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.410 align:middle line:10%
But what if the consciousness
says, I'm sick of this?

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.253 align:middle line:90%
I'd rather go be something else.

00:04:31.253 --> 00:04:33.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to come back
and be a human slave again

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.850 align:middle line:84%
on these stupid building
projects and starve and all

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.370 align:middle line:84%
of that, or be
blasted by these ETs.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.390 align:middle line:10%
So basically, a reincarnation,
an involuntary reincarnation

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.970 align:middle line:10%
process had to be instituted.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And what these
philosophies started to do,

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.340 align:middle line:84%
they started to say,
no, this is not healthy.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.390 align:middle line:90%
We have to escape that.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And that was rather
revolutionary.

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it's not necessary
that you have to escape it.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.860 align:middle line:84%
It's just having the choice,
whether you want to or not.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And right now, there's a
whole persuasion process

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.520 align:middle line:84%
that's described in some
of the near-death studies,

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.860 align:middle line:84%
or I should say the
intra-life studies, also,

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.740 align:middle line:84%
that say there's just a very
strong persuasion process

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.880 align:middle line:84%
that causes humans to keep
coming back, even reluctantly.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.600 align:middle line:84%
>> The Dead Sea Scrolls are the
books written by Jewish mystics

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.240 align:middle line:90%
who call themselves the Essenes.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.890 align:middle line:84%
These were individuals
who claimed

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.320 align:middle line:84%
they were living with
angels, and had received

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.500 align:middle line:84%
teachings about
human transformation

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.580 align:middle line:90%
in two celestial beings.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.240 align:middle line:84%
Their texts were stashed away
when Rome invaded Palestine

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.330 align:middle line:84%
in 70 AD, hidden away
in caves, and they

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.990 align:middle line:84%
were discovered
surreptitiously in 1947,

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.440 align:middle line:84%
and caused a worldwide
sensation upon their discovery.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.810 align:middle line:84%
They are essentially
Gnostic in nature,

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.690 align:middle line:84%
because the Essenes
themselves were Gnostics.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.330 align:middle line:84%
They were interested
in self-realization

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.260 align:middle line:84%
and the perfection of the
human body, the transformation

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.160 align:middle line:84%
of the body into a celestial
form or a light body form.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.400 align:middle line:84%
The Dead Sea Scrolls are
not labeled Gnostic texts

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.160 align:middle line:84%
as are the Nag Hammadi
library, but the core

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.030 align:middle line:84%
of them, the heart of
them is Gnostic in nature.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.460 align:middle line:10%
When we read the
Dead Sea Scrolls,

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.750 align:middle line:10%
it becomes very clear that the
Essenes, these Jewish mystics,

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.080 align:middle line:10%
Gnostic mystics, were
having close encounters

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.960 align:middle line:10%
of the first, second,
third, and fourth kind.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.240 align:middle line:84%
They said they
were seeing angels.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.980 align:middle line:84%
They were seeing
things in the sky.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.200 align:middle line:90%
Portals were opening in the sky.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.960 align:middle line:84%
But beyond that, they
also had close encounters

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.450 align:middle line:84%
of the fifth, sixth,
seventh, and eighth kind.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.750 align:middle line:84%
The close encounter
of the eighth kind

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.370 align:middle line:84%
is human transformation
into a celestial being.

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.150 align:middle line:84%
The Dead Sea Scrolls
clearly described

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.330 align:middle line:84%
humans being taken,
possibly abducted

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.190 align:middle line:84%
in a modern conversation,
but they didn't

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.810 align:middle line:90%
think of it as abduction then.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.000 align:middle line:84%
They're taken into
the celestial realms,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.600 align:middle line:84%
and transformed into an
extraterrestrial or celestial

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.620 align:middle line:84%
being by angels, who themselves
were extraterrestrials.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.390 align:middle line:84%
So the Dead Sea
Scrolls are actually

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:04.825 align:middle line:84%
a first moment of
disclosure, is what they are.

00:07:04.825 --> 00:07:07.200 align:middle line:10%
This is very important, because
when they were discovered

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.240 align:middle line:10%
in 1947, there was a parallel
event, the Roswell crash, when

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.980 align:middle line:10%
for the first time
in modern history,

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:17.490 align:middle line:10%
following shortly on Kenneth
Arnold's sighting of a squadron

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:21.870 align:middle line:10%
of flying disks, that mass
consciousness began to think

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.930 align:middle line:10%
about the possibility of
extraterrestrial visitors,

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.240 align:middle line:10%
vis-a-vis the Roswell crash.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very powerful
confluence there,

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.330 align:middle line:84%
or synchronicity, that the
Dead Sea Scrolls come out

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.850 align:middle line:84%
of the ground at
the very same time

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:40.140 align:middle line:84%
that a celestial disk crashes
into the ground in Roswell,

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.420 align:middle line:84%
and now we have this
mixture happening.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.570 align:middle line:84%
It's like, OK, how did
these two things relate?

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:47.520 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
some of the entities

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.025 align:middle line:84%
that are described in the
Gnostic text, the Archons,

00:07:50.025 --> 00:07:53.010 align:middle line:84%
for example, match
up with the entities,

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:55.170 align:middle line:84%
the alleged entities
that were found

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.090 align:middle line:90%
in the crashed disc at Roswell.

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:58.980 align:middle line:84%
When the Essenes are
talking about dealing

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.560 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrial
beings, are these angels

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.200 align:middle line:84%
or are these somehow
some other kind

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.050 align:middle line:84%
of celestial or
extraterrestrial races?

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:10.140 align:middle line:84%
Very important, very
powerful questions.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And there's one interesting
survey that was done by Helen

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.440 align:middle line:90%
Wambach.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And she surveyed her
hypnotic regression subjects,

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.220 align:middle line:84%
about several hundred
of them, and said,

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.212 align:middle line:84%
did you want to come
back between lives?

00:08:20.212 --> 00:08:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Did you want to
come back to Earth?

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:24.660 align:middle line:84%
2/3 said no way, I didn't
want to come back here.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And then we see that in the
near death studies, too.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Long has pointed
that out, too.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.568 align:middle line:84%
That even before
they go, even when

00:08:31.568 --> 00:08:33.110 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
come back, they say,

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:35.330 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to come back here.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:39.400 align:middle line:84%
So that just shows that there's
a problem in this process.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.940 align:middle line:84%
I like to contrast those
studies and this information

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:45.650 align:middle line:84%
about the reluctance
today of people

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.650 align:middle line:84%
who have these experiences,
and their reluctance

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:51.820 align:middle line:84%
then to come back to Earth, to
show why these philosophies may

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:54.050 align:middle line:84%
have arisen like, with
Buddhism and all that.

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you shouldn't
have to come back.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.250 align:middle line:84%
But then the modern studies
then show this very powerful

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:03.070 align:middle line:84%
persuasion process to
get people to come back,

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:04.540 align:middle line:90%
like, oh, you have a mission.

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And you have something
you need to learn.

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And then people go, oh,
OK, I'll go back in.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.470 align:middle line:90%
That's the attitude.

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:14.050 align:middle line:84%
But like I said, human
life can be good.

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:16.510 align:middle line:84%
It's just if the
conditions were improved,

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:19.610 align:middle line:90%
human life can be fun.

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:21.280 align:middle line:84%
There's so much
evidence right now,

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.940 align:middle line:84%
I think in near-death studies
and the between-lives studies,

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.970 align:middle line:84%
reincarnation studies,
good, serious work

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:30.700 align:middle line:84%
by real professional
people doing it.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:35.200 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just inescapable
to conclude that, yeah,

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.080 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness is
separate from the body,

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.420 align:middle line:84%
that the body relies on
a separate consciousness.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:44.050 align:middle line:84%
People call it a spirit, a soul,
whatever you want to call it.

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:47.380 align:middle line:84%
So the ancient
Greeks, they started

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:49.960 align:middle line:84%
to develop a philosophy
that the body became

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.690 align:middle line:84%
a prison for the soul,
and that became then

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:55.420 align:middle line:84%
the Gnostic idea
that grew out of some

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:58.210 align:middle line:84%
of this Greek philosophy, and
became a very popular idea,

00:09:58.210 --> 00:09:59.710 align:middle line:90%
even with the early Christians.

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:02.990 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't need to be
a prison for the soul.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:05.800 align:middle line:84%
It's just the way
it got manipulated

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:10.180 align:middle line:84%
into perhaps this between-lives
amnesia, where we forget,

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.070 align:middle line:84%
where we can't really
remember anymore

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.080 align:middle line:84%
that we are really
a consciousness that

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.880 align:middle line:90%
has this longer continuum.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.040 align:middle line:90%
Then maybe it becomes a prison.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.020 align:middle line:84%
But if we start
having those memories,

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:24.520 align:middle line:84%
if we start realizing, hey,
this can just be a playground,

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:28.120 align:middle line:84%
I think it has the capacity to
be a playground for the soul,

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.190 align:middle line:84%
using the bodies, and
doing all these things,

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:32.320 align:middle line:84%
and having all
these experiences.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:36.010 align:middle line:84%
So it just depends on what
is made of Earth experience,

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:40.210 align:middle line:84%
as to whether it's a prison,
or whether it's a little toy

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:42.910 align:middle line:90%
that we can play with.

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:47.240 align:middle line:10%
>> What I found so compelling
about the Nag Hammadi texts,

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.020 align:middle line:10%
well, a number of things.

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:53.120 align:middle line:84%
One, that they were where
they were for so long,

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.140 align:middle line:84%
from it's estimated maybe 400
BC, and the information going

00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:00.260 align:middle line:84%
back further, that they
couldn't be messed with,

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:04.310 align:middle line:84%
like the texts in the religious
books that have been out

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:06.590 align:middle line:84%
in the open, and therefore
had the potential

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:08.850 align:middle line:84%
for being changed, and
of course biblical texts

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:11.000 align:middle line:90%
have been changed massively.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.610 align:middle line:84%
So that was a big,
compelling thing for me,

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:15.530 align:middle line:84%
that you were looking
at what they really

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:18.800 align:middle line:84%
said rather than a
manipulated version of it.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.360 align:middle line:84%
But what hit me more
than anything else,

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:25.460 align:middle line:84%
and was important for me,
is that I came across them

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:29.900 align:middle line:84%
only after I had concluded many,
many things from other sources

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.940 align:middle line:90%
of research since 1990.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And so I wasn't looking
at them as a one stop

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:36.520 align:middle line:90%
shop for a belief system.

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.440 align:middle line:84%
"Oh, the Nag Hammadi texts,
that's my belief system."

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:44.510 align:middle line:84%
They were more a confirmation,
another significant strand

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:47.520 align:middle line:84%
in the tapestry of the
correlation of information

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.470 align:middle line:90%
ancient and modern.

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:52.010 align:middle line:10%
And what do they talk about
they talked about a force, which

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:53.090 align:middle line:10%
they called Archons.

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:54.860 align:middle line:84%
They call them
the formless ones.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Because in their base state,
they have really no form.

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And I symbolized there that this
Archontic force, shall we say,

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.630 align:middle line:84%
that's basically
a computer virus.

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:09.500 align:middle line:84%
It's a very, very distorted
state of awareness.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And when it manifests itself
in some extreme in humanity,

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:16.430 align:middle line:84%
we call these
people psychopaths.

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:19.520 align:middle line:84%
It's a deeply, deeply
extreme beyond belief

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.490 align:middle line:90%
psychopathic state of awareness.

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And they describe how
this awareness, which

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.830 align:middle line:84%
they call among other names
the Demiurge, of the ruler,

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:32.930 align:middle line:84%
created a fake reality by
making a sort of mad copy

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:34.370 align:middle line:90%
of the original reality.

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:37.487 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're back here to the
ancient-modern correlation,

00:12:37.487 --> 00:12:39.320 align:middle line:84%
because I'm saying what
they were describing

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.830 align:middle line:84%
in their own language, in their
own symbolism from long ago

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:45.080 align:middle line:84%
as we perceive time,
another illusion,

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:48.410 align:middle line:84%
is actually describing the
creation of the simulation.

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And it is my view
that the Lord God,

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:56.930 align:middle line:84%
and the Gnostics who were
responsible for these Nag

00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:59.990 align:middle line:84%
Hammadi texts, the Gnostic
belief system, they described

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:03.920 align:middle line:84%
the main manifestation of
this force as the Lord Archon,

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.030 align:middle line:90%
or Demiurge.

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:07.910 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes, when they wrote
their Dead Sea Scrolls,

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:12.440 align:middle line:84%
knew that this information was
very powerful for humanity.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.000 align:middle line:10%
They were hunted by Rome.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.660 align:middle line:10%
They represented a direct
threat to the power structure

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:18.590 align:middle line:10%
of that time.

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:21.500 align:middle line:10%
When the Dead Sea Scrolls come
out of the ground in 1947,

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.660 align:middle line:10%
they, too, represent
a direct threat

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.725 align:middle line:10%
to the existing power structures
of the world, the US government

00:13:26.725 --> 00:13:28.100 align:middle line:10%
and the religious
structures that

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:29.900 align:middle line:10%
developed around Christianity.

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Because what they drew
into question severely was,

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.090 align:middle line:84%
is this the origins
of Christianity?

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:36.470 align:middle line:90%
Was Jesus an Essene?

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:37.700 align:middle line:90%
John the Baptist was.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.690 align:middle line:84%
John the Baptist
initiated Jesus,

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:42.650 align:middle line:90%
attuned him in the baptism.

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Was he connecting him somehow
to an extraterrestrial race?

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:47.810 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly Christianity
started to sound

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:51.650 align:middle line:84%
like it's an alien
religion, or a religion that

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:55.550 align:middle line:84%
was brought to Earth or promoted
by extraterrestrial beings.

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:59.382 align:middle line:84%
That represents a direct
threat to the powers that be.

00:13:59.382 --> 00:14:01.340 align:middle line:10%
And this is one of the
reasons why the Dead Sea

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:05.450 align:middle line:10%
Scrolls were covered up for as
many as three or four decades.

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:07.730 align:middle line:84%
Initial reports
came out about what

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:09.920 align:middle line:84%
was contained in the
scrolls, but the scholars

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.970 align:middle line:84%
withheld vast amounts
of it for decades.

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And I believe the
reason why is because

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:18.200 align:middle line:84%
of its constant references
to extraterrestrial beings,

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.650 align:middle line:84%
portals, celestial realms,
celestial cities, all kinds

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:24.470 align:middle line:84%
of otherworldly entities that
are described in the Dead Sea

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:26.180 align:middle line:84%
Scrolls, and how
they were actually

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:30.020 align:middle line:84%
living with and
teaching the Essenes.

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>> According to the Gnostics,
the goddess Sophia left her

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:35.780 align:middle line:84%
home in the center
of the galaxy,

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:38.420 align:middle line:84%
because she wanted to
create a world of unlimited

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.190 align:middle line:90%
possibilities.

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:43.640 align:middle line:84%
She built this world on Earth by
creating all of the life forms

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.710 align:middle line:90%
that have ever existed here.

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:47.950 align:middle line:90%
Her creation was amazing.

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:50.000 align:middle line:84%
The plethora of life
forms she created

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.620 align:middle line:84%
was unlike anything that
had ever been tried before.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:56.420 align:middle line:84%
>> In the Gnostic context,
Sophia is considered to be

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.270 align:middle line:84%
the female counterpart
of the creator.

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:01.280 align:middle line:84%
She is a renegade,
too, because she

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.850 align:middle line:84%
breaks away from the heavenly
realm called the Pleroma,

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:06.890 align:middle line:84%
and crosses over what
then was perceived

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:09.290 align:middle line:84%
to be a forbidden boundary
between the material

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:11.240 align:middle line:84%
and the immaterial
realm, and has

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.690 align:middle line:84%
a hand in creating the material
realm in which we live.

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:18.620 align:middle line:84%
The word "pleroma" means
a fullness or completion.

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:19.970 align:middle line:90%
It's equated with heaven.

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And some people
actually believe it

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:25.610 align:middle line:84%
has a physical location in the
center of our Milky Way galaxy.

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:28.340 align:middle line:10%
There's no question that
there was a Hindu and Buddhist

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.800 align:middle line:10%
influence on the
development of Gnosticism,

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.230 align:middle line:10%
going all the way back
to 600 BC in Babylon,

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:35.535 align:middle line:10%
when the Jews were taken
captive from Jerusalem

00:15:35.535 --> 00:15:37.160 align:middle line:10%
and taken to Babylon,
and they're first

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:41.390 align:middle line:10%
introduced to the dualistic
religion of the Zoroastrians,

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:45.680 align:middle line:10%
they start to pick up this idea
of the battle between light

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.770 align:middle line:10%
and dark that is
foundational to Gnosticism.

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:51.600 align:middle line:84%
300 years later, these
same Jewish mystics

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.000 align:middle line:84%
go and live in
Alexandria, Egypt.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.560 align:middle line:84%
At the same time
they're there, we

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:59.130 align:middle line:84%
have Buddhist missionaries
coming from India

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:02.340 align:middle line:84%
to Alexandria, where there's
this amazing library,

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.500 align:middle line:84%
the Library of
Alexandria, and scholars

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.360 align:middle line:84%
gathering from all
over the Middle East

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.840 align:middle line:90%
and throughout Asia.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And they're all formulating
ideas about what?

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.230 align:middle line:84%
About human
transformation, about human

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:15.810 align:middle line:84%
ascension into the
celestial realms.

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And this becomes the foundation
then of the Essene movement.

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:22.350 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes' movement actually
started with the Therapeutae,

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:25.050 align:middle line:84%
who were Buddhist
missionaries in Alexandria,

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:28.770 align:middle line:84%
bringing this gnosis to
that part of the world.

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:32.340 align:middle line:84%
Then these Essenes go back to
Jerusalem, back to Palestine.

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:36.060 align:middle line:84%
They become the progenitors
of the later Gnostics.

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:39.720 align:middle line:84%
The Gnostics can be described
as the children of the Essenes,

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.550 align:middle line:84%
but the Essenes
themselves are children

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:43.200 align:middle line:84%
of the Buddhist
missionaries, who

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.660 align:middle line:90%
brought this gnosis from India.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:48.990 align:middle line:84%
So we see that we've
got a real lineage here

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:51.630 align:middle line:84%
that we're actually
dealing with.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Christos is a light force
or a spiritual force.

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.260 align:middle line:90%
It's transmittable.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.450 align:middle line:84%
We know this, because
John the Baptist was

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:02.850 align:middle line:90%
the Essene baptizer of Jesus.

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And at the baptism,
he transmitted to him

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:08.250 align:middle line:84%
the Holy Spirit,
which is the Christos.

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:11.040 align:middle line:84%
After the baptism,
Jesus now is referred

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.460 align:middle line:84%
to as the Christos,
or the anointed one,

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:18.210 align:middle line:84%
because he has received this
light force or vibration.

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:20.235 align:middle line:84%
In the Gnostic
context, the Archons

00:17:20.235 --> 00:17:22.220 align:middle line:90%
are referred to as the rulers.

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:24.630 align:middle line:84%
They're thought of as
agents of the Demiurge,

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:26.819 align:middle line:90%
the creator of the universe.

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:29.370 align:middle line:10%
The apostle Paul is
not very complimentary

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:31.230 align:middle line:10%
towards the Archons,
describing them

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:35.040 align:middle line:10%
as demonic beings, who seek
who control the human race.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.540 align:middle line:84%
He wrote letters, warning
humanity about the Archons

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:42.030 align:middle line:84%
and how they are attempting
to infiltrate the human race.

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>> The Gnostic texts are
constantly pointing out that

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:47.820 align:middle line:84%
they believed the Earth was
being invaded from an off

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:50.760 align:middle line:84%
planet species
called the Archons.

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.340 align:middle line:84%
The Archons were like an
intergalactic spiritual

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:57.810 align:middle line:84%
parasite that invades the minds
and psyches of common people,

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:01.360 align:middle line:84%
turning them into a
type of psychopath.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.030 align:middle line:84%
The gnostics believed that
these negative entities

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:07.180 align:middle line:84%
had entered into the psyches
of most of our leaders,

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:10.780 align:middle line:84%
whether they're
kings or politicians.

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:12.910 align:middle line:84%
The Gnostics preached
that one must never

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:16.210 align:middle line:84%
fall under the sway of
a leader or a religion,

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:20.230 align:middle line:84%
as that would open one
up to these alien forces.

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:25.140 align:middle line:84%
>> I say that what's being
described in Genesis he is not

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:29.850 align:middle line:84%
the creation of the world, but
the creation of the simulation.

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:34.170 align:middle line:84%
And the bloodthirsty God
of the Old Testament I say

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:36.300 align:middle line:90%
is this Archontic force.

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And the Gnostics described
how, in very similar terms,

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:44.760 align:middle line:84%
although from another
angle, as the Bible talks

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.740 align:middle line:84%
about how the sons
of God, actually

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:49.140 align:middle line:84%
the sons of the gods
in the original text,

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.060 align:middle line:84%
interbred with the
daughters of men,

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:54.040 align:middle line:84%
and basically changed
the human race.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:57.540 align:middle line:84%
What the gnostics do is talk
about basically the same thing

00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:59.640 align:middle line:84%
in the Nag Hammadi
texts, but they

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:03.510 align:middle line:84%
talk about the infusion as a
result of this of what they

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:05.220 align:middle line:90%
call the counterfeit spirit.

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:08.310 align:middle line:84%
The counterfeit
spirit is, for me,

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:10.890 align:middle line:84%
an expression of
this distortion.

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And the common theme
through the ages

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:16.860 align:middle line:84%
of some force of good and
some force of what people

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:20.280 align:middle line:84%
call evil, battling
for supremacy.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.250 align:middle line:84%
When people talk about,
they have a dark side,

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:25.350 align:middle line:84%
I say that's this
counterfeit spirit.

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And the Native Americans
have this concept

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:29.910 align:middle line:90%
of two wolves inside people.

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:33.810 align:middle line:84%
One is goodness and
empathy and compassion.

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:36.750 align:middle line:90%
One is evil, violence, hatred.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:40.260 align:middle line:90%
And they say which wolf wins?

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.190 align:middle line:90%
The one you feed the most.

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we have a
society in this fake reality

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.990 align:middle line:84%
specifically designed
to make us feed

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:53.190 align:middle line:84%
the counterfeit spirit, which is
this Archontic distortion as I

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:56.880 align:middle line:84%
call it, influencing human
behavior and human perception.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.810 align:middle line:90%
And it's a frequency band.

00:19:58.810 --> 00:19:59.790 align:middle line:90%
It has to be.

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a manifestation of
the Archontic frequency band.

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:07.680 align:middle line:84%
>> In his letters, Paul is
describing the Gnostic theory

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:11.730 align:middle line:84%
of alien intrusion, Archon
intrusion into the human race,

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:15.960 align:middle line:84%
and warning us about these
extraterrestrial beings that

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.240 align:middle line:90%
seek to take over our souls.

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:22.200 align:middle line:10%
The Zaddakim are the
ultra righteous wing

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.240 align:middle line:10%
of the Essene movement.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.347 align:middle line:84%
They believed in
human perfection.

00:20:26.347 --> 00:20:27.930 align:middle line:84%
In other words, that
humans can become

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:31.770 align:middle line:84%
whole, holy, and complete,
just like Adam and Eve.

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:34.170 align:middle line:84%
In the Gnostic belief, in
the garden of Eden story,

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:37.200 align:middle line:84%
Adam and Eve did not have
bodies of flesh and blood.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.820 align:middle line:90%
They had light bodies.

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And as a punishment, the
Old Testament god Yahweh

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:45.270 align:middle line:84%
created coats of skin for
humanity, the flesh and blood

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:46.590 align:middle line:90%
bodies that we inhabit.

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:49.230 align:middle line:84%
The Gnostics were
intent on reclaiming

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:52.410 align:middle line:84%
our original primordial
light bodies.

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And this is what the Zaddakim
referred to as perfection,

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.990 align:middle line:84%
returning to our
original perfection.

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And this is very
difficult for some people.

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.950 align:middle line:84%
They look at this
and think, well,

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:03.300 align:middle line:90%
who are you to become perfect?

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.260 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's perfect.

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.540 align:middle line:84%
But the Zaddakim
believed that humans

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:10.830 align:middle line:84%
could transform themselves
into perfect light beings,

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:16.120 align:middle line:84%
actually returning to
our original condition.

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:18.730 align:middle line:84%
Gnosticism was
attacked and destroyed

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:21.580 align:middle line:84%
by Christian
orthodoxy, because it

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:24.670 align:middle line:84%
claimed it possessed the
secret teachings of Jesus,

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:28.840 align:middle line:84%
of the living Jesus, the
risen or resurrected Jesus.

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.090 align:middle line:84%
Gnosticism also
promotes the idea

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:34.840 align:middle line:84%
that any individual can have a
direct, personal, and visionary

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:37.930 align:middle line:84%
experience with
the risen Christ.

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:41.260 align:middle line:84%
If you can have that, what
do you need a pope for?

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:42.490 align:middle line:90%
What you need a priest for?

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:44.590 align:middle line:84%
What do you need a
church hierarchy for?

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:45.550 align:middle line:90%
You don't.

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:49.450 align:middle line:10%
The church sells the past
Jesus, the past actions.

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Gnosticism says, let's
go into the future.

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:54.640 align:middle line:90%
Let's move forward.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are experiencing a
dramatic revival of gnosticism

00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:58.780 align:middle line:90%
worldwide.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:02.260 align:middle line:84%
We're recovering knowledge
of the Gnostic Gospels.

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:04.300 align:middle line:84%
We recovered the
Dead Sea Scrolls.

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And now the public
literature is starting

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:10.060 align:middle line:84%
to open up to the real secret
teachings of Jesus, which

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:12.980 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely phenomenal.

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:18.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So the more that you
re-evaluate self-identity from

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:23.530 align:middle line:84%
little me to infinite me, the
more we expand awareness out

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:25.840 align:middle line:84%
of the frequency band
of the Archontic force

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:29.800 align:middle line:84%
of the counterfeit spirit,
the less that impacts upon

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.216 align:middle line:84%
our behavior and
our perceptions,

00:22:32.216 --> 00:22:34.780 align:middle line:84%
and we start to
come from the heart.

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:36.430 align:middle line:90%
What did the Gnostics say?

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:40.600 align:middle line:84%
The counterfeit spirit hardened
the hearts of humanity.

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.130 align:middle line:90%
Exactly!

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:44.200 align:middle line:90%
What it's designed to do.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.350 align:middle line:84%
This is our connection
to infinite awareness.

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:50.760 align:middle line:84%
They want us here and here,
in the belly, emotion,

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:51.700 align:middle line:90%
low vibrational.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:52.810 align:middle line:90%
They don't want us here.

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:54.740 align:middle line:90%
It's all systematic.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And so in the end, we can
talk forever about way

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.500 align:middle line:84%
it's all unfolded
and how it's done.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:05.950 align:middle line:84%
But how it's undone is
that everything comes from.

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:08.770 align:middle line:84%
This knows, because
it's connected

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:11.650 align:middle line:84%
to that level of
awareness that does know.

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:14.620 align:middle line:84%
This society worships
the intellect.

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:18.130 align:middle line:84%
The intellect is the village
idiot compared with knowing,

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:20.620 align:middle line:84%
with wisdom that
comes from here.

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:24.370 align:middle line:10%
And therefore, the whole
education system, the media,

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:26.890 align:middle line:10%
all of it, all the
sources of information

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:30.440 align:middle line:10%
are directed at the
intellect, not the true self.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And so we celebrate scientists,
because they have a great mind,

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:38.830 align:middle line:84%
but do they have a great
consciousness beyond mind?

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And we can change that
whenever we choose,

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:43.160 align:middle line:90%
because we're in control.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:46.240 align:middle line:84%
The idea that some external
force is in control

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.980 align:middle line:90%
is completely illusory.

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:52.840 align:middle line:84%
It is in theoretical control
because it's persuaded us

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.720 align:middle line:84%
we have no power, and no
control over our lives,

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.710 align:middle line:90%
and have no control over events.

00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:01.417 align:middle line:84%
And while we believe that,
that will be our experience.

00:24:01.417 --> 00:24:02.500 align:middle line:90%
We can change it tomorrow.

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:03.460 align:middle line:90%
We can change it now.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:04.930 align:middle line:90%
It's just a choice.

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:07.180 align:middle line:84%
To pull this
together, I'm saying

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:10.270 align:middle line:84%
that what we call the
reptilians, and also that

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:15.460 align:middle line:84%
the grays, others, too, I say
that they are manifestations

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:17.110 align:middle line:90%
of this Archontic force.

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And how interesting that the
Nag Hammadi texts talk about two

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:25.630 align:middle line:84%
of the ways that this Archontic
force, as I call it, takes form

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:28.690 align:middle line:84%
is through a reptilian form
and through a form that

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:30.460 align:middle line:90%
is like a gray fetus.

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, what the
reptilians are doing,

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:36.850 align:middle line:84%
and what the greys are doing
in manipulating human society,

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:40.510 align:middle line:84%
and what the human what
I call hybrid elite,

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:43.840 align:middle line:84%
reptilian-human hybrid elite
that people call today's

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:48.760 align:middle line:84%
the 1%, I say that that
elite and that reptilian gray

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:54.280 align:middle line:84%
grouping are manifestations in
form of this Archontic force.

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately that force
which takes no form,

00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:01.090 align:middle line:84%
that distortion is
ultimately the one that

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:03.160 align:middle line:90%
is manipulating human society.

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:06.010 align:middle line:84%
Almost every account
I've ever come across,

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:09.910 align:middle line:84%
certainly ancient, certainly the
Nag Hammadi text, and certainly

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:12.760 align:middle line:84%
people I've come across
on the inside in the world

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.700 align:middle line:84%
today, there's a very, very
common theme between all

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:18.550 align:middle line:84%
of them, and that's that
this force feeds off

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:22.690 align:middle line:84%
human low vibrational emotion,
different expressions of fear.

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And I say that it was
when this hijack happened

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:29.320 align:middle line:90%
that fear came into the world.

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:32.710 align:middle line:84%
I say this Archontic force,
this counterfeit spirit

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:34.120 align:middle line:90%
is what we call fear.

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And because you
can only feed off

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:39.190 align:middle line:84%
that which you can make a
frequency connection to,

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:41.920 align:middle line:84%
if you are fear and you
need to absorb energy

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:45.460 align:middle line:84%
within your frequency, what
energy do you need to create?

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Fear, and as much
of it as possible.

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.110 align:middle line:90%
Look at the world.

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:51.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what is the Second
World War in terms of fear?

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And other things,
like anxiety and all

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:54.950 align:middle line:90%
that, violence, conflict.

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And so if you look at the
world from that perspective,

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:01.760 align:middle line:84%
yes, we can break down why
certain wars are happening

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.530 align:middle line:90%
and what the sequence is.

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:07.360 align:middle line:84%
But from the Archontic force
point of view, war in itself

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.260 align:middle line:90%
is an end.

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:10.690 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they'll have an ideal
sequence, because of the way

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:14.111 align:middle line:84%
they're manipulating human
society, but war in its end

00:26:14.111 --> 00:26:16.100 align:middle line:90%
is an end in itself.

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:19.690 align:middle line:84%
The more war conflict you
have, both individual conflict

00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:22.330 align:middle line:84%
and collective conflict,
then the more of this energy

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:25.270 align:middle line:90%
you are creating.

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:26.620 align:middle line:90%
Look at the animal kingdom.

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:29.710 align:middle line:84%
Look at the non-human
kingdoms of this reality.

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:31.000 align:middle line:90%
They're killing fields.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.550 align:middle line:84%
Everything survives by
killing something else.

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:38.140 align:middle line:84%
Everything is constantly
in fear of the next danger.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And I say that is not by
coincidence, but by design.

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.010 align:middle line:10%
So they're feeding off us.

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:47.500 align:middle line:10%
And also, the idea
is to assimilate us,

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:51.070 align:middle line:10%
because very much in the theme
of the Borg in the "Star Trek"

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:53.230 align:middle line:10%
series, who, by the
way, used to fly around

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:56.890 align:middle line:10%
in black cubes, which is an
ancient symbol of Saturn,

00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:59.830 align:middle line:10%
so the assimilation
is assimilating

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:03.490 align:middle line:10%
human consciousness into itself,
just like the Borg talked

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:08.320 align:middle line:10%
about assimilating people
into its hive mind,

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:10.810 align:middle line:10%
connecting human
awareness, the human mind

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:14.260 align:middle line:10%
to artificial intelligence
via technology,

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:16.240 align:middle line:10%
what does that create?

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:20.560 align:middle line:90%
A hive mind, an assimilation.

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And then comes the
question, what is AI?

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:28.560 align:middle line:84%
I say that in its prime form,
it is the Archontic force,

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:33.880 align:middle line:84%
and we, the human race, in
our intellectual stupidity,

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:36.640 align:middle line:84%
are building a
technological vehicle

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.310 align:middle line:84%
for this force, which
doesn't take form in the end,

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:43.970 align:middle line:84%
to not only take over human
minds but take the world over.

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:44.770 align:middle line:90%
Look at it.

00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:48.310 align:middle line:84%
AI is taking the world over,
and it's only just begun.

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:52.570 align:middle line:10%
So this is a whole other area
about how the transhumanist

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:55.660 align:middle line:10%
agenda is the Archontic
agenda to assimilate

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:58.110 align:middle line:10%
the human race into itself.

00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a worldwide
renaissance of Gnostic beliefs

00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:03.090 align:middle line:90%
currently occurring.

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:06.330 align:middle line:84%
This comes at a time when most
of the institutions of the past

00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:07.980 align:middle line:90%
are crumbling.

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:11.460 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps these failing empires
of false belief systems

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:14.940 align:middle line:84%
can be replaced by a world
philosophy that celebrates

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:16.590 align:middle line:90%
knowledge and curiosity.

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:19.890 align:middle line:90%


00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:22.770 align:middle line:84%
In our next episode, we'll
continue our exploration

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:26.630 align:middle line:84%
of the myriad mysteries
present throughout the cosmos.

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:32.000 align:middle line:90%
