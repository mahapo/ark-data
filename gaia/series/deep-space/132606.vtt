00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.160 align:middle line:10%
>> We at NASA, we're an
incredibly unique organization.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.620 align:middle line:10%
We're the only agency in the
federal government that's

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.170 align:middle line:10%
responsible for the safety
and well-being of people,

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.440 align:middle line:10%
not only here on Earth,
but off this planet.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Think about the
natural disasters

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.820 align:middle line:90%
that could occur in your area.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.180 align:middle line:84%
Think about attacks that
could come like 9/11

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.680 align:middle line:84%
from outside forces and talk
to your family about your work

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.540 align:middle line:84%
and what they need to do to
prepare for the unforeseen.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.610 align:middle line:84%
>> On June 13th, 2011, NASA's
administrator, Charles Bolden,

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.850 align:middle line:84%
sends out an emergency
preparedness video to NASA

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.290 align:middle line:90%
employees.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.890 align:middle line:84%
But what kind of natural
disaster is he talking about?

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.280 align:middle line:84%
Some experts believe that
this is just one of many hints

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.300 align:middle line:84%
NASA gives that there is more
going on behind the scenes.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.060 align:middle line:84%
The publicly funded
NASA organization

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.880 align:middle line:84%
could be our largest
database for the truth

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.910 align:middle line:90%
on the secret space program.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.970 align:middle line:10%
>> NASA could very well be
the biggest component of, sort

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.105 align:middle line:10%
of, this drip, drip, drip kind
of disclosure because the fact

00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:47.730 align:middle line:10%
is that they don't
cover everything up.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.650 align:middle line:10%
I mean, they don't give
you great awesome pictures

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.150 align:middle line:10%
of the pyramids on Mars, but
they give you pretty good ones.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.760 align:middle line:84%
They give you ones
you can work with.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And they don't overtly
admit anything on Mars

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.190 align:middle line:84%
or the moon as artificial, but
they keep putting out pictures

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.190 align:middle line:90%
with this stuff in them.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>> People always ask
the question, why Mars?

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:05.410 align:middle line:90%
Several reasons.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.070 align:middle line:84%
One, Mars is very
Earth-like, or at least used

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.389 align:middle line:90%
to be very Earth-like.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.720 align:middle line:84%
It is a planet, sister
planet, to Earth.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.950 align:middle line:84%
It is the most likely planet
in our solar system that

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.030 align:middle line:84%
had life at one time, may
have life now, and, we feel,

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.740 align:middle line:90%
definitely can sustain life.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>> To me, that's almost Masonic
in the way it approaches

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.340 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.190 align:middle line:10%
Like, we will answer
your questions honestly,

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.900 align:middle line:10%
but you have to know
the right question.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.710 align:middle line:10%
It's like that moment in "Star
Trek" when Spock tells Kirk

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.330 align:middle line:10%
in the first "Star Trek"
movie, this alien life form,

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.010 align:middle line:10%
it wants to know its answers,
is looking for answers.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.160 align:middle line:10%
And Kirk goes, I don't
know what the question is.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.272 align:middle line:10%
>> Jim, future
expects an answer.

00:02:47.272 --> 00:02:48.480 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know the question.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's the same kind
of thing that NASA does.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.410 align:middle line:84%
They deliberately
de-res images from Mars.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.360 align:middle line:84%
The cameras that we
have on our iPhones

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.240 align:middle line:84%
today are as good as the cameras
they have on the Mars rovers.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.080 align:middle line:84%
Yet I can take a
picture on my iPhone

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.480 align:middle line:84%
and I can zoom it up
about 50 or 60 times,

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.250 align:middle line:84%
and it's crystal
clear, and I can

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.490 align:middle line:84%
see all the detail of whatever
I've taken a photograph of.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.650 align:middle line:84%
But when you zoom up
all these NASA images,

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.390 align:middle line:84%
it just gets
blurrier and blurrier

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.245 align:middle line:84%
and crappier and crappier, and
that doesn't make any sense.

00:03:18.245 --> 00:03:19.620 align:middle line:84%
So clearly, what
they're doing is

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.530 align:middle line:84%
they're de-resing the images
so that you can't ever

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.110 align:middle line:90%
have a smoking gun.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.600 align:middle line:84%
But you can have
enough information

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.098 align:middle line:84%
to go forward and
continue your hypothesis

00:03:30.098 --> 00:03:32.640 align:middle line:84%
and talk to other people about
it and show it to other people

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.700 align:middle line:84%
and get them to
start going, hmm.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.738 align:middle line:10%
>> Recently, NASA gave curiosity
the best anniversary gift it

00:03:38.738 --> 00:03:41.280 align:middle line:10%
could hope for-- an extension
of its mission for at least two

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.420 align:middle line:10%
more years.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.190 align:middle line:84%
We'll use it to reach
progressively higher

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.300 align:middle line:90%
and younger rocks on Mt.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Sharp, including rock types
we've not yet explored.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.860 align:middle line:84%
We can't wait to
see how the story

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.110 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient habitability
of Mars continues to unfold.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.360 align:middle line:84%
>> September 12th, 2016, NASA
releases images of Mars from

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.610 align:middle line:90%
the Murray Buttes region.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.670 align:middle line:84%
JPL made a statement
in "USA Today"

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.200 align:middle line:84%
that these images rivaled those
taken in the US national parks.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.330 align:middle line:84%
Some photos seemed
to even suggest

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.240 align:middle line:84%
that Mars may have a
slightly bluer sky than we're

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.980 align:middle line:90%
led to believe.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.190 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as if they're
putting the cameras in focus

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.080 align:middle line:84%
for us to even see more clearly
what's on the surface of Mars.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.710 align:middle line:84%
Experts like Billy Carson have
been collecting these images

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.590 align:middle line:90%
for over a decade.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.330 align:middle line:10%
>> As far as Mars go, we have
the most content and data

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.330 align:middle line:10%
on Mars because that's where the
most content and data has come

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.750 align:middle line:10%
from the NASA research.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And we've got probably
around 38,000 images

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.690 align:middle line:84%
from Mars alone anomalies
depicting ancient civilizations

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.130 align:middle line:84%
that existed there in the past
and possibly a small remnant

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.850 align:middle line:90%
remaining there right now.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.950 align:middle line:84%
They're not changed
in any way other

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.990 align:middle line:84%
than just bringing
the contrast down

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.310 align:middle line:84%
because what they do is
they turn the contrast up

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.920 align:middle line:84%
and then everything
is whited out.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.630 align:middle line:84%
We turn the contrast down, and
basically, that's all we do.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.233 align:middle line:84%
And we also provide direct
links to the source images.

00:05:07.233 --> 00:05:08.900 align:middle line:10%
And the reason why I
can say that is I'm

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.630 align:middle line:10%
actually part of a group called
the United Family of Anomaly

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.740 align:middle line:10%
Hunters, and we've cataloged
about 58,000 anomalies

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.580 align:middle line:10%
that we've downloaded from NASA
archives, European space agency

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.983 align:middle line:10%
archives, and also Indian
space agency archives now.

00:05:22.983 --> 00:05:25.400 align:middle line:10%
And we've actually downloaded
a close to a million images,

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.290 align:middle line:10%
but out of that,
we've got about 56,000

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.760 align:middle line:10%
and 58,000 actual anomalies
cataloged and documented.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.760 align:middle line:10%
And on these anomalies,
we've got plenty of bases

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.690 align:middle line:10%
on the moon.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.470 align:middle line:10%
We've got lots of structures,
clear structures on the moon.

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.650 align:middle line:10%
>> The documentation shows that
the defense department was very

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.500 align:middle line:10%
interested in what NASA
was doing with the Apollo

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.710 align:middle line:10%
missions' going to the moon,
trying to figure out, well,

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.042 align:middle line:10%
it's great for science, but
how can we use that for a war?

00:05:52.042 --> 00:05:54.000 align:middle line:10%
How can we use this for
intelligence gathering?

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.930 align:middle line:10%
How can we ultimately
utilize what NASA

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.370 align:middle line:10%
is doing for defense purposes?

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.820 align:middle line:10%
And this was decades
ago, in the 1960s,

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.330 align:middle line:10%
when we were just trying
to set foot on the moon.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.340 align:middle line:10%
The Department of
Defense were exploring

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.760 align:middle line:10%
plans of creating a moon base,
and our government document's

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.920 align:middle line:10%
declassified that
show that they wanted

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.440 align:middle line:10%
to build a base on the moon.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.020 align:middle line:10%
Now, allegedly, they never did.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.890 align:middle line:10%
So we think that after a
couple dune buggy rides

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.530 align:middle line:10%
on the surface of the moon
and a couple great quotes

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.490 align:middle line:10%
and some videos here and there,
ultimately, we never went back.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.940 align:middle line:10%
There absolutely could
still be that connection

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.180 align:middle line:10%
between the space
program and Defense

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.910 align:middle line:10%
because the Defense really
gets into everything.

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.580 align:middle line:84%
They get their
fingers on everything.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And so it's pretty safe to say
that they're still doing things

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.330 align:middle line:90%
that we don't know about.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:50.840 align:middle line:84%
For example, the X-37B, it'll
fly for over a year in orbit

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.580 align:middle line:84%
around the Earth, and yet the
entire mission is classified.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:56.780 align:middle line:90%
Now, why is that?

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.280 align:middle line:90%
What are they hiding in space?

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.750 align:middle line:90%
What are they trying to do?

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.870 align:middle line:84%
This is a space
shuttle-like craft.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.870 align:middle line:84%
It's unmanned,
allegedly, but we don't

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.710 align:middle line:84%
know what the actual
mission objective is.

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.020 align:middle line:84%
I've gone after
documentation for it.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.090 align:middle line:84%
I've waited about a year
and a half, two years.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:16.580 align:middle line:10%
I'm still waiting for
a response for them

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.700 align:middle line:10%
to process these FOIA
requests to actually admit

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.350 align:middle line:10%
to what the objective is.

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:23.900 align:middle line:84%
But when you look at
projects like that,

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.260 align:middle line:84%
there's quite a few that we can
safely say we don't know about.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.690 align:middle line:84%
So I would safely say
that, yeah, NASA's involved

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:31.490 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of top
secret programs that

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.970 align:middle line:84%
are defense-related that
we don't know about.

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>> September 14th, 2016, CNN
released an exciting interview

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:41.737 align:middle line:90%
with Tory Bruno.

00:07:41.737 --> 00:07:43.820 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, I have a
vision, within just a couple

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.730 align:middle line:10%
of decades, where there's going
to be over a thousand people

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:48.830 align:middle line:10%
living and working in space.

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:50.090 align:middle line:10%
>> This is Tory.

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.840 align:middle line:10%
He runs United Launch
Alliance, also known as ULA.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.570 align:middle line:84%
For the past decade,
ULA has been responsible

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:59.860 align:middle line:90%
for 80% of US rocket launches.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.560 align:middle line:84%
Today, they're planning for the
industry's next big challenge--

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.640 align:middle line:90%
living in space.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:10.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Researchers uncovered that
ULA has 95 satellites that

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:13.460 align:middle line:84%
provide critical capabilities
for troops in the field

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:17.540 align:middle line:84%
and, according to their
website, "unlock the mysteries

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:20.810 align:middle line:90%
of our solar system."

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:24.800 align:middle line:84%
Bruno is not only the
president and CEO of ULA,

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.370 align:middle line:84%
but prior, he was vice
president and general manager

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:32.250 align:middle line:84%
of Lockheed Martin's Strategic
Missile Defense Systems.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.280 align:middle line:84%
He is also a
recipient of the Order

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.799 align:middle line:84%
of Merit of the
Sovereign Military Order

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:38.809 align:middle line:90%
of the Temple of Jerusalem.

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:43.100 align:middle line:84%
In retrospect, Bruno and ULA
would be the perfect pair

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.590 align:middle line:90%
to launch rockets into space.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:49.660 align:middle line:84%
The big question is, where
is NASA in all of this?

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I have a strong
interest in false flag

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:52.420 align:middle line:10%
phenomenon.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:56.020 align:middle line:10%
I believe that we live
in an era of false flags.

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.770 align:middle line:10%
I believe we live in
an era of false flags

00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:00.740 align:middle line:10%
because the particular position
that the United States now

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.540 align:middle line:10%
occupies in the world
in which it is really

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:06.260 align:middle line:10%
trying to consolidate
complete hegemonic control

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.060 align:middle line:10%
over essentially
the entire world

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.640 align:middle line:10%
as a tool of its financial
masters is really, I think,

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.810 align:middle line:10%
how it works.

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:13.190 align:middle line:10%
And so part of
the thing to do is

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:15.710 align:middle line:10%
you have to choral public
opinion through a series

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:16.990 align:middle line:10%
of false flags--

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:19.800 align:middle line:10%
rule by fear, rule by
secrecy, and so on.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.330 align:middle line:84%
>> While the ULA is successfully
disclosing their plans

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.760 align:middle line:84%
for building living
arrangements in space,

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:30.470 align:middle line:84%
is it possible that factions of
NASA are disclosing "mysteries

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:34.370 align:middle line:84%
of the solar system" for
us to figure out the truth

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:36.290 align:middle line:90%
on our own?

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:38.390 align:middle line:84%
If this information
is true, then

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:41.180 align:middle line:84%
throughout the years of
the secret space program,

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:46.460 align:middle line:84%
the information to the public
needed to be a slow release.

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:51.470 align:middle line:10%
>> The Brookings Institution at
the end of 1960 issued a report

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:55.030 align:middle line:10%
that discussed essentially
what would happen to human

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:58.510 align:middle line:10%
civilization if we
discovered intelligent life.

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:02.230 align:middle line:10%
What would the implications
be for human civilization?

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:04.810 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of perceptive
things about this report,

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:06.040 align:middle line:90%
in fact.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.410 align:middle line:10%
I think the main thing
that it indicated

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:11.920 align:middle line:10%
was that we ourselves
would be in danger

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.620 align:middle line:10%
of a certain level
of dissolution

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:17.740 align:middle line:10%
of the coherence of our
own society in the event

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.480 align:middle line:10%
that we discovered
extraterrestrial life.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.390 align:middle line:84%
Think about how during the
age of European exploration

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:26.740 align:middle line:84%
of, say, Africa, when they would
encounter very technologically

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:31.200 align:middle line:84%
primitive African tribes
or tribes in South America.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.890 align:middle line:10%
And so the Brookings
Institute really

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:34.810 align:middle line:10%
said essentially the same thing.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:38.290 align:middle line:10%
This would happen to
America-- human civilization.

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And the idea was that
if it were discovered

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.030 align:middle line:84%
that it would have to be
a strong consideration

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:45.638 align:middle line:90%
to keep such a thing secret.

00:10:45.638 --> 00:10:47.680 align:middle line:84%
>> I think if they decided
to do full disclosure,

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.170 align:middle line:84%
the people on this planet
can actually handle it.

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:52.955 align:middle line:84%
According to a contrary belief
that the economy is going

00:10:52.955 --> 00:10:55.330 align:middle line:84%
to collapse and people are
going to go crazy and run down

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.663 align:middle line:84%
the street pulling their hair
out, I don't believe that.

00:10:57.663 --> 00:11:00.740 align:middle line:84%
I believe that people are very
resilient human beings, are

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:01.990 align:middle line:90%
very resilient on this planet.

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:04.570 align:middle line:10%
We've been through
so much already

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:06.520 align:middle line:10%
that this information
actually, I believe,

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.335 align:middle line:10%
would liberate
the human species.

00:11:08.335 --> 00:11:09.460 align:middle line:90%
And I think they know that.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.920 align:middle line:84%
This is why everything has
been coming in drips and drips

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:12.720 align:middle line:90%
and drips.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Looking at the dirt here
on the Martian surface,

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.260 align:middle line:90%
there's nothing there.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And in the very next image we
see this worm-looking object

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:23.440 align:middle line:90%
moving through the dirt.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And if you follow what NASA
would tell us about Mars,

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.280 align:middle line:84%
you'll realize how
amazing this evidence is.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's plain as day.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:33.130 align:middle line:90%
Look at it.

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:36.910 align:middle line:10%
This thing is wiggling up out
of the dirt, whatever it is,

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:40.390 align:middle line:10%
and it proves that there's
more to Mars than just

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:44.710 align:middle line:10%
simple microbial life, if that.

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:47.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Images like these have
experts reeling with more

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.600 align:middle line:90%
questions for NASA.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.840 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that the
NASA we know today is

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.240 align:middle line:90%
hoping we ask these questions?

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.760 align:middle line:90%
And if so, why?

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:02.200 align:middle line:10%
In April of 2015, NASA announced
that they had successfully

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.380 align:middle line:10%
tested electromagnetic
propulsion drives that

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:08.080 align:middle line:10%
could facilitate space travel.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>> In recent years, there's been
these propulsion systems that

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:15.130 align:middle line:84%
have been proposed, which
are called EM drives,

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:16.330 align:middle line:90%
or electromagnetic drives.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.790 align:middle line:84%
They've come up through
private industry.

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:23.200 align:middle line:10%
And basically, what they
are is these containers,

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:27.730 align:middle line:10%
basically closed metal boxes
with one open end and one kind

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:30.340 align:middle line:10%
of a closed end, and they
just bounce microwaves

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:31.840 align:middle line:10%
around inside of them.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, against all the
supposed laws of physics,

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.990 align:middle line:90%
this generates forward thrust.

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:39.730 align:middle line:84%
NASA announced in
April that they've

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:42.363 align:middle line:84%
tested this multiple times,
that they've generated thrust

00:12:42.363 --> 00:12:44.530 align:middle line:84%
on each and every occasion--
small amounts of thrust

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:46.480 align:middle line:90%
but thrust nevertheless.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.180 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't take a whole
lot of forward thrust

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.030 align:middle line:84%
to break the laws of physics
and end Newton's laws

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:52.850 align:middle line:90%
of thermodynamics.

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:54.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it just
takes one little bit.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:58.000 align:middle line:10%
It really appears that we're on
the verge of a new propulsion

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.210 align:middle line:10%
system which can take us,
maybe even to the stars,

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:04.820 align:middle line:10%
at speeds we never
imagined before.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:07.100 align:middle line:10%
It's very similar to the
work of T. Townsend Brown who

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.950 align:middle line:10%
found that when you electrified
a disk-shaped object,

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:12.818 align:middle line:10%
you got a positive charge at
one end and a negative charge

00:13:12.818 --> 00:13:14.360 align:middle line:10%
at the other end,
and then the object

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.760 align:middle line:10%
would move forward
in the direction

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.110 align:middle line:10%
of the positive charge.

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:21.710 align:middle line:10%
And this, again, defies all laws
of physics because electricity

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:24.500 align:middle line:10%
cannot negate gravity.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:27.340 align:middle line:10%
I cannot imagine the NASA of
10 years ago buying into this

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.140 align:middle line:10%
at all.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.795 align:middle line:84%
I think they would have totally
suppressed this information.

00:13:30.795 --> 00:13:32.420 align:middle line:84%
They would have said,
our tests failed.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.128 align:middle line:84%
They would have lied
through their teeth.

00:13:34.128 --> 00:13:37.220 align:middle line:10%
And it's fascinating that NASA
is now coming out and admitting

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:40.220 align:middle line:10%
that this mechanism that
defies the laws of physics

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:42.620 align:middle line:10%
is EM drive apparently
actually works.

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:44.420 align:middle line:84%
That's astonishing,
and it appears to me

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:48.693 align:middle line:84%
to be part of the private
disclosure process.

00:13:48.693 --> 00:13:50.360 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to
say, yeah, it works,

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:53.370 align:middle line:84%
and that means the laws of
physics are not laws at all.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:55.343 align:middle line:84%
There's so many huge
implications to that

00:13:55.343 --> 00:13:57.260 align:middle line:84%
that I'm astonished they
actually went forward

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:58.400 align:middle line:90%
with that announcement.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.620 align:middle line:84%
But it does seem to me
to signal that we're

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:03.710 align:middle line:84%
going to start getting more
good stuff out of NASA.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:06.560 align:middle line:10%
They've probably known
how to do this for years,

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.570 align:middle line:10%
but now they're finally
telling us about it.

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Researchers have gathered
that NASA works with Hollywood

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:15.260 align:middle line:84%
to also slowly release
disclosure on their secret

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:16.427 align:middle line:90%
programs.

00:14:16.427 --> 00:14:18.260 align:middle line:10%
>> The film "Transformers:
Dark of the Moon"

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:19.080 align:middle line:10%
is really interesting.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.930 align:middle line:10%
It was produced by Steven
Spielberg, who, of course,

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:22.280 align:middle line:10%
we know has all
these connections--

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.990 align:middle line:10%
political connections,
space connections,

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:25.400 align:middle line:10%
alien connections--

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:29.660 align:middle line:10%
and in it, what's depicted is
that when we went to the moon,

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:33.410 align:middle line:10%
we actually went dark, slipped
away from the actual landing

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:36.650 align:middle line:10%
site, and went and investigated
these ancient alien ruins,

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:38.480 align:middle line:10%
which, of course, in
the motif of the film,

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.700 align:middle line:10%
were the Transformers.

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:43.850 align:middle line:10%
They even got Buzz Aldrin, the
second man to walk on the moon,

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:46.940 align:middle line:10%
to make a guest appearance where
he talked about all the secrets

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:49.460 align:middle line:10%
that they found on the moon,
which, to me, is, again,

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:52.397 align:middle line:10%
kind of mind-blowing because
NASA and Buzz have always

00:14:52.397 --> 00:14:53.480 align:middle line:10%
denied that kind of thing.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And NASA cooperated
with this film,

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:59.090 align:middle line:84%
so what you're seeing is
that NASA is cooperating

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:03.410 align:middle line:84%
with a film that says that
NASA is a bunch of liars

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:05.000 align:middle line:84%
and that we went to
the moon and found

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.460 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of ancient
technology and artifacts,

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.250 align:middle line:84%
which, personally, is what I
think the Apollo missions were

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:11.330 align:middle line:90%
designed to do--

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.870 align:middle line:84%
basically, go and retrieve
ancient alien technology

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.170 align:middle line:84%
from the moon and
reverse engineer it.

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:20.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And I sure think we should
identify what it is for America

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:25.170 align:middle line:84%
to make such gross expenditures
again for human habitation

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:25.970 align:middle line:90%
on the moon.

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:27.020 align:middle line:90%
We can help.

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:29.330 align:middle line:90%
We can join with together.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:33.380 align:middle line:84%
We can explore the moon
and develop the moon.

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.970 align:middle line:90%


00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:39.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Why would NASA cooperate with
the idea that they themselves

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:41.970 align:middle line:90%
are lying about what they know?

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:43.710 align:middle line:84%
It is believed
that NASA is really

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:46.380 align:middle line:84%
trying to point out that they
have less control than we

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:48.150 align:middle line:90%
think of these hidden agendas.

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:51.180 align:middle line:90%


00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.730 align:middle line:10%
>> I believe that the energy
aspect of it is probably

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:56.550 align:middle line:10%
the single most important
quality of a cover-up.

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:59.670 align:middle line:84%
I think a 10-year-old child
looking at a flying saucer that

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:01.290 align:middle line:84%
can instantly
accelerate is going

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:03.830 align:middle line:84%
to understand somehow that
they're not using gasoline

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:04.630 align:middle line:90%
to go around.

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.713 align:middle line:84%
So it's using something
better than that, whatever

00:16:06.713 --> 00:16:09.780 align:middle line:84%
that is, whether it's
zero point or some kind

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:12.090 align:middle line:84%
of safe nuclear fusion,
or whatever it is.

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:15.360 align:middle line:84%
It's not petroleum
and therein lies--

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.540 align:middle line:84%
that's the revolution because
implicit in this solution

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:22.080 align:middle line:84%
of UFO technology is a
post-petroleum civilization.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
most radical thing

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:27.550 align:middle line:84%
that I can imagine right now
for our global power structure.

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Not just energy but the
whole financial structure

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.010 align:middle line:90%
rests on petroleum.

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:36.300 align:middle line:84%
The whole US hegemonic
system is rested on what

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.130 align:middle line:90%
is known as the petrodollar.

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:41.640 align:middle line:84%
>> If they're slowly disclosing
these advanced technologies,

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.940 align:middle line:84%
what might be another reason
to invite the possibility that

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:47.880 align:middle line:90%
a secret space program exists?

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.940 align:middle line:84%
>> There's another funny
aside about them doing that.

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:54.690 align:middle line:10%
Last year, when the Chinese
lunar lander landed and took

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:57.553 align:middle line:10%
a bunch of pictures, NASA
published on their site,

00:16:57.553 --> 00:16:59.220 align:middle line:10%
hey, here, we'll show
you these pictures

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:00.840 align:middle line:10%
from the Chinese lander.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And in one of the
pictures, people

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:05.160 align:middle line:84%
went, hey, there's a
building in that picture.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.367 align:middle line:84%
And then NASA had to
go, oh, no, no, no.

00:17:07.367 --> 00:17:08.700 align:middle line:10%
That's not what happened at all.

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:10.859 align:middle line:10%
They went, oh, oh, our bad.

00:17:10.859 --> 00:17:12.990 align:middle line:84%
That's not from the
Chinese lunar lander.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:15.579 align:middle line:84%
We accidentally
grabbed a picture out

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:18.569 align:middle line:84%
from the Apollo lander
photos, and it accidentally

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:19.680 align:middle line:90%
got mixed in there.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:23.099 align:middle line:10%
Somehow, we accidentally
grabbed this whole other picture

00:17:23.099 --> 00:17:27.329 align:middle line:10%
from 40 years ago out of
an analog filing system

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:30.060 align:middle line:10%
and got it converted into
a digital filing system

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:32.610 align:middle line:10%
and onto a computer
file and accidentally

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:35.460 align:middle line:10%
got it put up there
with the Chinese ones.

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:36.630 align:middle line:90%
Whoops.

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:39.720 align:middle line:84%
That was a lot of stages
of an accident to happen.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:44.220 align:middle line:84%
NASA is not fully in the know,
and they are very frustrated,

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:47.760 align:middle line:84%
and they would like more tech
space explored so that they're

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.353 align:middle line:84%
pushing what they can without
getting fired or dumped out.

00:17:51.353 --> 00:17:52.770 align:middle line:84%
But we're trying
to be competitive

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:58.050 align:middle line:84%
in an intergalactic market of
potential military conflict.

00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:00.210 align:middle line:84%
So we want to make
sure that of the things

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:02.130 align:middle line:84%
that we know that
we can face, we're

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:04.860 align:middle line:84%
competitive with those things,
that we will match them

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.000 align:middle line:90%
in battle and not lose.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.520 align:middle line:84%
So that means
getting engineering

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.290 align:middle line:84%
the best and the
brightest, picking

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:11.550 align:middle line:90%
the best and the brightest.

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:16.980 align:middle line:84%
I probably estimated to say
that only 17% of the population

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:20.260 align:middle line:84%
is sought out for usefulness
within the military space

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:21.060 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.040 align:middle line:84%
That would be
because of genetics.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:26.310 align:middle line:84%
You have that percentage
of the population that has

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:29.100 align:middle line:84%
top-of-the-bell curve
genetics that you want.

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:34.380 align:middle line:84%
You need people who are
smart, strong, resilient

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:37.080 align:middle line:84%
because you're really putting
people in stressful situations

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:40.110 align:middle line:84%
where what they
really don't have,

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:43.410 align:middle line:84%
intensely strong
flexible minds that

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:46.507 align:middle line:90%
can really bend and snap back.

00:18:46.507 --> 00:18:48.840 align:middle line:10%
>> With somebody coming out
and telling me that there is

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:52.530 align:middle line:10%
a secret program where 17% of
the population is, in essence,

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:56.610 align:middle line:10%
targeted that they will be
ushered away or essentially

00:18:56.610 --> 00:19:00.090 align:middle line:10%
helped to survive, it
wouldn't surprise me much.

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:02.280 align:middle line:10%
I think that there
is a lot of secrecy

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:07.080 align:middle line:10%
behind that selective process
should a disaster happen.

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:12.750 align:middle line:84%
Because let's face it, the
planet Earth will end one day.

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:14.110 align:middle line:90%
That's a safe way to sail.

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:14.910 align:middle line:90%
When?

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:16.450 align:middle line:90%
That's not really as safe.

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:18.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we don't know
when it's going to happen,

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:22.110 align:middle line:84%
but it can end in an
awful lot of ways.

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:25.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, should a disaster
happen, where all of a sudden

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.810 align:middle line:84%
the world gets thrown
into chaos, now

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:29.500 align:middle line:90%
we have a huge problem.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.770 align:middle line:90%
How can we save humanity?

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:34.320 align:middle line:84%
The government first will
react to save itself.

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.940 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Some also believe that by
disclosing the information

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:42.510 align:middle line:84%
slowly, only a certain amount
of the population will be able

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:44.680 align:middle line:84%
to actually figure
out the truth.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And those individuals
can be recruited

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.200 align:middle line:90%
to further the human race.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.930 align:middle line:84%
Randy Cramer believes he
was genetically developed

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:55.320 align:middle line:84%
for this process, and that
this kind of intelligence

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.050 align:middle line:84%
was passed down by
our ancient ancestors

00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:00.510 align:middle line:90%
to our now secret space program.

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:04.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Project Moon Shadow is
the project which genetically

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:09.870 align:middle line:84%
engineered and trained me and
299 other young boys and girls,

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:13.080 align:middle line:84%
for a total of 300
of us in the project.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.960 align:middle line:84%
We were all genetically
engineered from the ground up,

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.340 align:middle line:90%
Petri dish level.

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:18.270 align:middle line:90%
They didn't find me.

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:19.680 align:middle line:90%
They made me.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Technically, there's a serial
number somewhere on my file.

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:25.167 align:middle line:90%
My DNA code got a patent on it.

00:20:25.167 --> 00:20:27.000 align:middle line:10%
Understanding the secret
space program a way

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.480 align:middle line:10%
of going back home for us, it
kind of is in this weird way

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.840 align:middle line:10%
because we know that the
oldest space programs were

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.420 align:middle line:10%
the Mayan space program,
the Egyptian space program,

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:39.030 align:middle line:10%
and the Greek space program,
and the Atlantean space program,

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:39.830 align:middle line:10%
and so forth.

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:42.542 align:middle line:84%
So the older, older, older
ancient space programs,

00:20:42.542 --> 00:20:44.250 align:middle line:84%
at some point, there's
a connecting point

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:47.940 align:middle line:84%
when we learn everything
that that comes into play.

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:51.190 align:middle line:84%
From high to low to high
to low to high to low as

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:53.620 align:middle line:84%
we have continued to try
and grow up, get back

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:56.110 align:middle line:84%
to being spacefaring,
and then fall back down,

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:58.030 align:middle line:84%
and then try to crawl
back up to being

00:20:58.030 --> 00:20:59.620 align:middle line:84%
a spacefaring member
of the galaxy,

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:02.860 align:middle line:84%
and then fall back down from
all the complications of trying

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:04.780 align:middle line:90%
to maintain a civilization.

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:07.990 align:middle line:84%
Or in some cases, like
the Mayan space program,

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:10.150 align:middle line:84%
they developed to
a level where it

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:14.680 align:middle line:84%
was like, oh, if we don't
leave right now, none of us

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.580 align:middle line:90%
are going to survive.

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.470 align:middle line:84%
And basically, it was
just, OK, everybody, we're

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:18.030 align:middle line:90%
getting on the ships.

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:18.940 align:middle line:90%
We're all leaving.

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:20.920 align:middle line:90%
And they became space nomads.

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.830 align:middle line:84%
They became a spacefaring
nomadic tribe species

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:27.250 align:middle line:84%
because it just became
clear that staying

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:29.950 align:middle line:84%
on the ground where they
were, they would not survive.

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:31.743 align:middle line:84%
It was not safe for
them to stay there.

00:21:31.743 --> 00:21:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And the only way that they
could continue to survive

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:36.430 align:middle line:84%
was to take their
ships into space

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:37.765 align:middle line:90%
and essentially live in them.

00:21:37.765 --> 00:21:39.640 align:middle line:84%
That that was the safest
place for them to be

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.265 align:middle line:84%
was living aboard
their ships in space.

00:21:41.265 --> 00:21:46.010 align:middle line:90%


00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:48.230 align:middle line:84%
>> In the opening scenes
of the film "Prometheus, "

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:51.830 align:middle line:84%
they actually discovered these
cave paintings which are from

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:55.160 align:middle line:84%
civilizations that are widely
separated, very, very ancient,

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:58.460 align:middle line:84%
but they're all pointing
to the same star system.

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.950 align:middle line:10%
And it's a really
important scene in the film

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:03.890 align:middle line:10%
because it becomes the impetus
to actually go and explore

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:07.230 align:middle line:10%
the star system once they
figure out where it is.

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that
we're being invited.

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:13.220 align:middle line:84%
The human race is being
invited to return to the place

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:17.540 align:middle line:84%
where our creators, our
progenitors created us.

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:20.360 align:middle line:90%
And it's a very--

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:23.780 align:middle line:84%
to me, it's kind of telling
the story, the entire story

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:28.970 align:middle line:84%
of the human race as we
have come to understand it

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:31.610 align:middle line:84%
through all of these little
bits of disclosure and research

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:33.860 align:middle line:84%
done by other people in the
ancient Sumerian writings.

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:36.500 align:middle line:10%
So to me, it was like a
big hint that the thing

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.830 align:middle line:10%
we need to do to figure out
who we are and where we're from

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:42.170 align:middle line:10%
is to keep investigating
and finding

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:45.350 align:middle line:10%
these old wrecks,
these old ruins,

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:49.370 align:middle line:10%
these old cave paintings,
and studying them for clues.

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:51.400 align:middle line:84%
If there is a secret
space program,

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.850 align:middle line:84%
it could exist for a couple
of different reasons.

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:57.650 align:middle line:84%
One is to defend the
Earth from alien races

00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:00.050 align:middle line:84%
that are going to invade us
or that want to invade us.

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:01.080 align:middle line:90%
That's a possibility.

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.840 align:middle line:10%
The other possibility
is that they're

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:06.143 align:middle line:10%
going to take the global
elite to another world

00:23:06.143 --> 00:23:08.060 align:middle line:10%
to live, another place
to live, another planet

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:09.830 align:middle line:10%
to call their own
because there's

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:13.370 align:middle line:10%
going to be some kind of
catastrophe here on Earth.

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:18.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think that
they thought there

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.250 align:middle line:90%
was going to be a catastrophe.

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:22.220 align:middle line:84%
I think that the global elite,
the secret space program guys,

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:24.890 align:middle line:84%
thought that 2012 was going
to be the beginning of the end

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:26.090 align:middle line:90%
or the end of everything.

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:29.000 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's a new beginning,
and we're still here.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.820 align:middle line:84%
There's no question that
there are people in charge.

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:34.460 align:middle line:84%
You listen to Al Gore
talk about global warming

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:36.110 align:middle line:84%
and all the stuff
he talks about,

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:37.280 align:middle line:84%
they thought there was
going to be some sort

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:38.420 align:middle line:90%
of environmental disaster.

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:41.750 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is all
along, the human race

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:45.230 align:middle line:84%
has come up with solutions
to whatever problems

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:47.240 align:middle line:90%
we've encountered.

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.980 align:middle line:84%
Lifespans continue
to get longer.

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:50.600 align:middle line:90%
We feed more people every year.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.820 align:middle line:84%
Our medicine gets
better and better.

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:56.300 align:middle line:10%
So I suspect that at one
time, the secret space program

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:58.940 align:middle line:10%
was like the
alternative three idea

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:03.770 align:middle line:10%
where they would take the
very, very top, the Aryan race,

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:06.920 align:middle line:10%
to another world to live.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>> On September 1st, one
of SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:13.370 align:middle line:84%
exploded while going
through testing.

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:16.130 align:middle line:10%
After the video was
released, UFO hunters

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:21.050 align:middle line:10%
pointed out a strange object in
the sky during the explosion.

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:23.210 align:middle line:84%
Is this evidence of
a greater force not

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:26.600 align:middle line:84%
allowing space
travel to the masses?

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:31.490 align:middle line:10%
September 11th, 2016,
Elon Musk tweeted,

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:37.720 align:middle line:10%
"We have not ruled out that a
UFO caused SpaceX's explosion."

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:40.690 align:middle line:10%
Is it possible that these
photographs and videos provided

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:43.450 align:middle line:10%
by NASA are part of
a slow disclosure

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:46.220 align:middle line:10%
of their secret space program?

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:49.670 align:middle line:84%
Are they using these images
to not only enlighten us

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:51.920 align:middle line:84%
but to recruit the
few that might be

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.710 align:middle line:90%
able to further the human race?

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:56.990 align:middle line:84%
Is the goal of the
secret space program

00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:59.930 align:middle line:84%
to continue the work of the
Nazis in their current alliance

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:00.860 align:middle line:90%
with us?

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:03.630 align:middle line:84%
When will all the evidence
be presented to us?

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:06.350 align:middle line:84%
And when will we
be told the truth?

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:08.960 align:middle line:84%
Up next, disclosure
takes a new turn

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.990 align:middle line:84%
when evidence reveals
that the source is closer

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:13.900 align:middle line:90%
than you think.

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:17.000 align:middle line:90%
