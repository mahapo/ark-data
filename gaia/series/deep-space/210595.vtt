[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a galactic
federation in our universe made

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.390 align:middle line:84%
up of various
extraterrestrial beings.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.740 align:middle line:84%
One group that is said to be a
key member of this Federation

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.910 align:middle line:84%
is a humanoid species from
the Andromeda constellation

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.932 align:middle line:90%
referred to as Andromedans.

00:00:49.932 --> 00:00:54.230 align:middle line:90%


00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.350 align:middle line:84%
It's believed that in the
distant past, humanoids,

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.860 align:middle line:84%
including the Andromedans,
faced opposition

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.459 align:middle line:84%
from the Draco
reptilians, a warring

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:08.960 align:middle line:84%
race of extraterrestrial beings
in our part of the galaxy.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.910 align:middle line:10%
>> As a means of
protecting themselves,

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.510 align:middle line:10%
the Andromedans along with these
other civilizations that were

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.260 align:middle line:10%
threatened by the reptilians,
banded together themselves

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.150 align:middle line:10%
to form their own council.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.540 align:middle line:84%
This is what we now call
the Andromeda Council.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.520 align:middle line:84%
This enabled them
to work together

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.890 align:middle line:90%
in a great collaborative system.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And to denote the
workings of this group,

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.140 align:middle line:84%
they chose a symbol
that we recognize

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.170 align:middle line:84%
looking a lot like
the letter A, which

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.580 align:middle line:84%
is where we get many of
the familiar A-shaped logos

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.170 align:middle line:90%
on Earth-based space programs.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.960 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, this
Andromeda Council

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.020 align:middle line:84%
became the basis for what we
now understand as a Galactic

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.280 align:middle line:90%
Federation.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.220 align:middle line:84%
Thus, the Andromedans are an
important part of the Galactic

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.550 align:middle line:84%
Federation because the
Galactic Federation

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.320 align:middle line:84%
is an extension of that
original Andromeda Council.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Andromeda is kind of an
interesting star system in that

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.100 align:middle line:10%
it evolved very, very rapidly
unlike some of the other

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.740 align:middle line:10%
systems that had
conflicts and wars.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of, I would say, drama
that happened in those systems.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Andromeda is unique in that
there was very little drama

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.840 align:middle line:90%
in their evolution.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Because they were
so remote, they

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.120 align:middle line:84%
didn't get that much
involved with some

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.340 align:middle line:84%
of the other wars
that were going on

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.340 align:middle line:84%
throughout the galaxy,
at least not until they

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.380 align:middle line:90%
became part of the Federation.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.140 align:middle line:84%
So they went through
a rapid spiritual

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.610 align:middle line:90%
and technological evolution.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the history
of the Andromedans.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.470 align:middle line:84%
They were not kind
to their home world,

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.810 align:middle line:84%
they were not kind of
their planet at all.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And through their own political
infighting, their wars

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.180 align:middle line:84%
and the building
of technology, they

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.740 align:middle line:84%
didn't take care of
their own mother planet.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And so as their life just
faded out of their home world,

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.640 align:middle line:90%
they had to leave.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.310 align:middle line:84%
We know that the Andromedans
came from somewhere

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.980 align:middle line:90%
in the Andromeda constellation.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.990 align:middle line:84%
But as to a home world, a home
star, we don't really know.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.290 align:middle line:84%
But what we do know about
the Andromedans today

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.190 align:middle line:84%
is that they are an
entirely nomadic species.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Kind of the nomadic feature
of Andromeda comes from

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.370 align:middle line:84%
the fact that a lot of these
different star races that

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.930 align:middle line:84%
inhabit the Andromeda
system ended up in Andromeda

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.220 align:middle line:84%
because they came
from other places.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.430 align:middle line:90%


00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.480 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people tend to mix
up Andromeda the constellation

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.310 align:middle line:90%
with Andromeda galaxy.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.920 align:middle line:84%
They are actually two
separate soul groups.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.070 align:middle line:84%
The reason why it's
called Andromeda galaxy

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.740 align:middle line:84%
is because from our vantage
point here on Earth,

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.530 align:middle line:84%
we see it in the
Andromeda constellation,

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.070 align:middle line:84%
but it's actually located much
further away than the Andromeda

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.080 align:middle line:90%
constellation.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.630 align:middle line:84%
The Andromeda galaxy
is a whole other galaxy

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.120 align:middle line:84%
that's approximately two
million light years away

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.070 align:middle line:90%
from our galaxy.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.530 align:middle line:84%
But it is our closest
neighbor galaxy.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.790 align:middle line:84%
I was going to focus on one
that people can relate to.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.670 align:middle line:84%
I will focus on the
humanoid beings.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.500 align:middle line:84%
They have very
long limbs, they're

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.840 align:middle line:84%
very tall, 15-feet tall,
very slender beings.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.300 align:middle line:90%
Their skin is usually blue.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And they have
slightly larger heads,

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.040 align:middle line:90%
maybe slightly larger eyes.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.240 align:middle line:84%
But for the most part, they
look somewhat humanoid.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.490 align:middle line:84%
So if you see an Andromedan,
you would probably

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.380 align:middle line:84%
know they're not from Earth
but you would say, gosh,

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.780 align:middle line:90%
they look kind of human.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.540 align:middle line:10%
>> It's always different
according to my clients deep

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.170 align:middle line:10%
under hypnosis, and there are
many different types or groups

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.740 align:middle line:10%
of Andromedans.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.030 align:middle line:10%
It's not just one
grouping of beings.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.940 align:middle line:84%
Some of my clients have
described Andromedans

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.090 align:middle line:90%
as looking like a human almost.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.640 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes blue eyes, but they
have this very distinct glow

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:14.700 align:middle line:84%
about them and this glow gives
them an angelic-like presence.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.670 align:middle line:84%
Andromedans have quite a large
presence on Earth at this time.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.280 align:middle line:84%
There are many of
my clients that

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.710 align:middle line:90%
remember being an Andromedan.

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.590 align:middle line:84%
So they are inhabiting
human bodies at this time

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.690 align:middle line:90%
to help with the ascension.

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.320 align:middle line:10%
>> So when we ask
the question, well,

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.410 align:middle line:10%
what would an
Andromedan look like?

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.290 align:middle line:10%
You're saying that
they're non-physical,

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:35.340 align:middle line:10%
they're light beings.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.220 align:middle line:10%
Well, how would we
one if we saw one?

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
we're confronted with,

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.840 align:middle line:84%
that you have a lot of
channelers, people that believe

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.707 align:middle line:84%
they have encounters
with the Andromedans

00:05:44.707 --> 00:05:46.290 align:middle line:84%
and they want you
to believe that they

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.350 align:middle line:84%
look like they perceive them
to look like, however that is.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And now all of a sudden,
we've got a stereotype.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.670 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you're an Andromedan.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's tricky
because we really

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.430 align:middle line:84%
don't know for sure
what they look like,

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.660 align:middle line:84%
but we are trying to grasp the
potential advancement that they

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.500 align:middle line:90%
represent.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.010 align:middle line:90%


00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>> While the appearance of the
Andromedans may be as diverse

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.530 align:middle line:84%
as the humans they're
in contact with,

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:18.360 align:middle line:84%
something distinctive to them
that researchers have reported

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.450 align:middle line:84%
is that the Andromedans
are known for being masters

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:26.310 align:middle line:84%
of unique technologies that
allow them to travel throughout

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.960 align:middle line:84%
the universe in huge ships
that appear as small worlds.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>> I've heard that the
Andromedans claim to be ship

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:35.880 align:middle line:90%
builders.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, that would
be very interesting

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.200 align:middle line:84%
because we are trying to
become an interstellar species.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And if they are in fact, a type
3 or even a type 4 civilization

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.270 align:middle line:84%
that's capable of
galaxy hopping,

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.700 align:middle line:90%
how are they doing that?

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.130 align:middle line:84%
If I ever had a conversation
with a member of the Galactic

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.520 align:middle line:84%
Federation, that would be
my number one question.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.010 align:middle line:84%
How did you overcome
the time space barrier?

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.440 align:middle line:84%
How did you overcome
your biology?

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And how were you able to
travel interdimensionally

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.600 align:middle line:84%
or intergalactically or
between star systems?

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.850 align:middle line:90%
That is the ultimate question.

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps the Andromedans
having solved that,

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.800 align:middle line:84%
will be able to assist
us in doing that.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Andromedans, of
course, are shipbuilders.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.520 align:middle line:10%
They can build mother ships,
star ships, fleet ships.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.240 align:middle line:10%
They also can go
into the astrobiology

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.570 align:middle line:10%
of building it and going
into the astral dimensions

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.960 align:middle line:10%
into the higher realm
and farming the materials

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.600 align:middle line:10%
for those kind of craft there.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.410 align:middle line:84%
All of the Galactic
intelligences can do that.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:41.400 align:middle line:84%
But primarily the
Andromedans, they really

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:46.080 align:middle line:84%
can get into the nuts and
bolts of making these new craft

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.320 align:middle line:84%
and ships to do amazing
stuff, and then it

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:53.260 align:middle line:84%
gets shared throughout
the galactic community.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:57.340 align:middle line:84%
>> My understanding with the
Andromedan ships is that some

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:01.090 align:middle line:84%
of them are so huge they
are floating cities.

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:04.360 align:middle line:84%
So they actually
live on these ships.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.710 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a transport
vehicle for them.

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:10.750 align:middle line:84%
The Andromeda
Council actually is

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:14.080 align:middle line:84%
located on one of
these ships and they're

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.460 align:middle line:90%
about the size of a city.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.830 align:middle line:84%
It's like a whole
kind of complex.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And there's maybe hundreds
of beings if not thousands

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:24.850 align:middle line:84%
of beings that live
on board these ships.

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:26.380 align:middle line:84%
So this is where
we get the concept

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.480 align:middle line:84%
of the Andromedan
floating cities

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:33.520 align:middle line:84%
because they are nomadic,
because they move quite a bit,

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.975 align:middle line:90%
they go from place to place.

00:08:34.975 --> 00:08:39.960 align:middle line:90%


00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.870 align:middle line:84%
>> They developed
their spacecraft to be

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:44.460 align:middle line:90%
their home-world.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.770 align:middle line:84%
We call them
biosphere ships, where

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:50.160 align:middle line:84%
they create entire
biospheres within their ships

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.850 align:middle line:84%
so you can have oceans,
you can have forests,

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:55.470 align:middle line:90%
you can have fields.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.530 align:middle line:84%
You can have all of the crops
and agricultural systems

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.800 align:middle line:84%
that you need and you can have
the cities and living quarters.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.830 align:middle line:10%
So these systems are
entirely self-sustaining

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:08.010 align:middle line:10%
and that is how the Andromedans
venture across the galaxy

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:12.330 align:middle line:10%
now as a nomadic species within
their own biosphere ships.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:16.890 align:middle line:84%
The Andromedans primarily have
three types of biosphere ships.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.500 align:middle line:84%
We have the large
one, which is the moon

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.920 align:middle line:84%
sized type ship, where they
have multiple layers in there.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.270 align:middle line:84%
They can have an entire
civilization in there.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And it can be around
for millennia.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:32.640 align:middle line:84%
Then we have the triangle
arrowhead-shaped ships,

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:37.780 align:middle line:84%
which are about 300,
800 miles in length.

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And what we hear
reports of is that there

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.500 align:middle line:84%
is one of these biosphere
arrowhead-shaped ships

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.430 align:middle line:84%
in our solar system operating
as a regional headquarters

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:49.950 align:middle line:90%
for the Galactic Federation.

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Now there are reports of
also smaller types of ships

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.670 align:middle line:90%
that the Andromedans use.

00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:00.480 align:middle line:84%
There are flying saucer
type ships as well as

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.800 align:middle line:84%
different scout types of
ship that are only about 50

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.490 align:middle line:90%
to 65 feet across.

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:08.580 align:middle line:84%
So these are going to be
like some of the smaller

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:12.360 align:middle line:84%
atmospheric command ships that
come in that operate outside

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.700 align:middle line:90%
of these big biosphere ships.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And these are just
a small scattering

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:19.065 align:middle line:84%
of what we do know that
the Andromedans have.

00:10:19.065 --> 00:10:22.630 align:middle line:90%


00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>> When we entertain the
possibility of Andromedan

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:29.860 align:middle line:84%
biosphere spacecraft, the
size of small planets or moons

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:34.060 align:middle line:84%
moving throughout the galaxy,
is it conceivable that one

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:37.720 align:middle line:84%
of these biospheres may
be orbiting planet Earth

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.115 align:middle line:90%
in the form of our moon?

00:10:40.115 --> 00:10:42.490 align:middle line:10%
>> The reports that we have
about the Andromedans is that

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:47.280 align:middle line:10%
they are the original creators
of the moon and this moon

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:52.440 align:middle line:10%
biosphere ship played an
integral part in an ancient war

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.920 align:middle line:10%
in our solar system, a war
that led to the destruction

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.010 align:middle line:10%
of a planet that we call Tiamat.

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:01.050 align:middle line:84%
Because of the
destruction of Tiamat,

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:02.820 align:middle line:90%
our planets were shifted.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.240 align:middle line:84%
A lot of cataclysms came
into our whole solar system

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.350 align:middle line:90%
to Earth.

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:11.610 align:middle line:84%
This moon-sized biosphere
ship was placed into orbit

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:15.360 align:middle line:84%
around the Earth to help temper
the cataclysms that our planet

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.320 align:middle line:90%
was facing at the time period.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:21.630 align:middle line:10%
So that moon is only really
about 12,500 years old

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:25.170 align:middle line:10%
according to what the
Andromedans tell us.

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>> I worked for NASA
and Honeywell Aerospace.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:31.260 align:middle line:84%
I spent 20 years
of my life there.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.980 align:middle line:10%
I was in launch control and
I watched Challenger go down.

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:42.350 align:middle line:90%


00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:44.600 align:middle line:84%
There is a great deal
that is going on there

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.780 align:middle line:90%
that people don't know about.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:51.230 align:middle line:84%
The biosphere was put into
orbit around the Earth

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:53.810 align:middle line:84%
in what scientists
and most people

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:56.930 align:middle line:84%
would call a perfect
circular orbit.

00:11:56.930 --> 00:12:00.500 align:middle line:84%
That perfect circular orbit
is so close with the Earth

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:06.260 align:middle line:84%
and the body is so large that
it literally is tidally locked

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.410 align:middle line:84%
and therefore we only see
one side of the moon, one

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:11.940 align:middle line:90%
face of the moon as it rotates.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:15.590 align:middle line:84%
So the rotation is
synchronized to the rotation

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:17.270 align:middle line:84%
around the Earth
such that we only

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:19.495 align:middle line:90%
see that one face all the time.

00:12:19.495 --> 00:12:20.870 align:middle line:84%
So there are many
things that can

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:24.050 align:middle line:84%
be done on the back side of
the biosphere that are out

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:26.460 align:middle line:90%
of the purview of humanity.

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And so there are
many bases and things

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.380 align:middle line:90%
that allegedly are there.

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.780 align:middle line:90%
I haven't seen them myself.

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:35.000 align:middle line:84%
The biosphere,
unfortunately, it has

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.110 align:middle line:84%
a to my knowledge, 12
reactors or power systems.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Many of them are
damaged or failing

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:46.950 align:middle line:84%
and there are only a few
of them still functional.

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a lot of insiders who
are reporting that the moon has

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:56.640 align:middle line:84%
an influence locking
humanity in our 3D existence.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.740 align:middle line:84%
But since the moon is
thousands of years old,

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:02.290 align:middle line:84%
put into place around
12,500 years ago,

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:04.290 align:middle line:84%
a lot of these
systems are failing

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:08.235 align:middle line:84%
and we're not getting locked
into 3D as much as we were.

00:13:08.235 --> 00:13:11.700 align:middle line:84%
We're starting to evolve into
our fourth and fifth density

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:15.070 align:middle line:84%
existence because we're no
longer locked into this place.

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>> The problem with this is that
if they should all die or go

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:22.240 align:middle line:84%
down at one time, that would
cause a catastrophic reaction

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.040 align:middle line:90%
here on Earth.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:27.530 align:middle line:84%
So that many of the beings
would then be faced with 5D.

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:30.140 align:middle line:84%
Some would be prepared and
could make it through it.

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:32.240 align:middle line:84%
Others would not and
they would perish

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:36.020 align:middle line:84%
or they would leave this place
very quickly or instantly.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:39.590 align:middle line:84%
But Andromedans still
are maintaining that.

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:45.320 align:middle line:84%
At one time it was under direct
control of the reptilian race

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.080 align:middle line:84%
and the reptilian and
Draconian overlords,

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.960 align:middle line:84%
they controlled the
biosphere and they used

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.050 align:middle line:90%
that 3D to control humanity.

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:56.330 align:middle line:84%
That is no longer
the prevalent case.

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:59.540 align:middle line:84%
So humanity is pretty
much doing its own thing.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:01.800 align:middle line:90%
It's like mass hallucination.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.150 align:middle line:84%
So we're hoping and trying very
hard to get humanity to wake

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:06.780 align:middle line:90%
up before it's too late.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:10.340 align:middle line:10%
>> I have been told through
clients under hypnosis that

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:13.143 align:middle line:10%
the moon is actually
not a solid structure.

00:14:13.143 --> 00:14:14.810 align:middle line:10%
It's completely
hollowed out and there's

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:18.740 align:middle line:10%
different bases and different
rooms within this moon.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.390 align:middle line:90%


00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>> On November 1969, Apollo 12
deliberately crashed the ascent

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:31.200 align:middle line:84%
stage of its lunar module,
leading some theorists

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.920 align:middle line:90%
to support a hollow moon theory.

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:38.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Who decided that on the first
landing Neil Armstrong would

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:40.290 align:middle line:90%
set out a seismograph.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:42.970 align:middle line:10%
What made you do that?

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:44.640 align:middle line:10%
Then not a word.

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.410 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, because you
guys know something.

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:49.510 align:middle line:90%
Look at the craters on the moon.

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:50.310 align:middle line:90%
They're huge.

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Tycho goes across
its entire face.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:57.330 align:middle line:84%
That's the size of continent of
North America, a blast that big

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:59.850 align:middle line:90%
and yet it's so shallow.

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:01.892 align:middle line:90%
It hardly even dented it.

00:15:01.892 --> 00:15:03.100 align:middle line:90%
Somebody asked me about that.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.860 align:middle line:84%
I said, pretty good body
armor on the car, I guess.

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:06.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:09.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, when they fired the upper
half of the lunar module back

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.700 align:middle line:84%
to the moon when the
astronauts crawled out

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:15.180 align:middle line:84%
went command module go home,
they fired that thing down

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:18.690 align:middle line:84%
and it crashed a few miles
away from the seismograph

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:22.650 align:middle line:84%
and the moon
resonated like a bell.

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:26.550 align:middle line:10%
So on other flights to put
more seismographs down and then

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:28.140 align:middle line:10%
they added booster
rocket so they

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:31.860 align:middle line:10%
can drive it in much faster,
bigger and more shockwaves.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And on the last one, the
moon rang for three days.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:37.780 align:middle line:90%
The moon is not little y'all.

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:42.300 align:middle line:84%
You can put the North American
continent on the face of it,

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:45.150 align:middle line:90%
times 2 you got a backside.

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:46.650 align:middle line:90%
That's a big area.

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:51.330 align:middle line:84%
We know that the moon is
about 3,600 miles in diameter.

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:55.080 align:middle line:84%
We believe that the moon
thickness was over 500 miles.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.640 align:middle line:90%
Let's start doing the math.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:02.400 align:middle line:84%
That means there's a 2000 mile
diameter void inside the moon.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.330 align:middle line:90%
That's what's resonating.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:05.790 align:middle line:90%
What's in that void?

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:08.070 align:middle line:84%
The people who drove
it here, their homes.

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:15.140 align:middle line:90%


00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>> As the Earth's most
constant companion,

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:21.800 align:middle line:84%
the moon has been guiding and
influencing humanity and this

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.910 align:middle line:90%
planet for millennia.

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:25.820 align:middle line:84%
This is one area
that researchers

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.550 align:middle line:90%
attribute to the Andromedans.

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:32.810 align:middle line:84%
On a sociocultural level, it is
suggested that the Andromedans

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:35.360 align:middle line:84%
influenced the
Hindu gods of India

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.420 align:middle line:84%
and the Sanskrit language,
which is believed

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:41.360 align:middle line:84%
to have been generated
by the god Brahma, who

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.570 align:middle line:90%
lived in the heavenly abodes.

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:49.460 align:middle line:84%
If so, might these blue
hued extraterrestrials

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:54.080 align:middle line:84%
be suggestive of an Andromedan
influence dating back

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:58.130 align:middle line:84%
to the origins of one of the
oldest languages on Earth?

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:01.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Most of the contactees these
that have had interactions with

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.650 align:middle line:10%
the Andromeda Council
beings have said that

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:07.730 align:middle line:10%
their interactions were
telepathic and metamorphic.

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:12.170 align:middle line:84%
According to them, they had
involvement in our language

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:16.040 align:middle line:84%
development in the ancient
past, especially with Sanskrit.

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Some actual Andromedan
representatives or contacts

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:24.020 align:middle line:84%
would have been Shiva, would
have been the city of Dwarka,

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:26.339 align:middle line:90%
Krishna as well.

00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:28.280 align:middle line:90%
So those were direct contacts.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:33.810 align:middle line:10%
Those were the beings themselves
that influenced those cultures.

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:37.580 align:middle line:10%
>> The oldest printed books
that we found on the planet are

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:40.400 align:middle line:10%
the Vedantic writings
of ancient India.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:44.480 align:middle line:84%
When we start to look at how
these writings, philosophies,

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.600 align:middle line:84%
and religions influenced
us on every level,

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:51.170 align:middle line:84%
we see that there are some
very ancient connections there

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:54.950 align:middle line:84%
to beings that are depicted
like the Andromedans.

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>> The Sanskrit language is a
derivative of their language.

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:01.920 align:middle line:84%
It's probably the closest thing
on Earth to their language.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:04.700 align:middle line:84%
In fact, most locations
on this planet

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:08.870 align:middle line:84%
have been influenced
by the Andromedans.

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:11.180 align:middle line:84%
The nice thing about
the Andromedans

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:13.880 align:middle line:84%
is that their
quotations are written

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.770 align:middle line:90%
in the Indian textbooks.

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:19.190 align:middle line:84%
They actually have living
and written history

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:21.035 align:middle line:84%
where a lot of
other races do not.

00:18:21.035 --> 00:18:23.750 align:middle line:90%


00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.900 align:middle line:10%
>> If the ancient language of
Sanskrit was brought to Earth

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:32.210 align:middle line:10%
by blue-colored gods, what else
have they developed that may

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:37.160 align:middle line:10%
one day impact humanity and a
greater federation of planets?

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most
prominent contributions that

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:43.790 align:middle line:84%
the Andromedans made to
the Galactic Federation is

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:46.370 align:middle line:84%
their holographic
political system,

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:50.000 align:middle line:84%
and how that is arranged is that
there's these councils or step

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.300 align:middle line:84%
councils where everybody has a
say and everybody has an input

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:54.500 align:middle line:90%
on what's going on.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's like every single
part of this political system

00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:59.930 align:middle line:84%
knows what's going on
with every other part.

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:03.680 align:middle line:84%
Thus, it's holographic in
nature and what this does

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.350 align:middle line:84%
is it really builds
equality for everybody

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:07.590 align:middle line:90%
throughout the system.

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:10.160 align:middle line:84%
So that it's almost like
there's no one power

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.520 align:middle line:90%
higher than the other.

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.400 align:middle line:84%
And that there's not one source
knowing more than the other.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.540 align:middle line:84%
It's that everybody is on
this nice, even playing field

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:21.290 align:middle line:84%
where everybody seems to have an
input and contribution to make

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:23.130 align:middle line:90%
to the entire political system.

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And we see this system
not only employed

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:27.590 align:middle line:84%
in the Galactic
Federation, but in a lot

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:30.860 align:middle line:84%
of advanced civilizations
throughout the galaxy.

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:35.300 align:middle line:84%
>> The Andromeda Council is
a group of individuals that

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:40.160 align:middle line:84%
oversees certain aspects
of either their worlds,

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.100 align:middle line:84%
their ships and the daily
things that need to be done,

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:47.370 align:middle line:84%
or the interactions with other
species and other groups.

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:50.240 align:middle line:84%
We don't have designated
people to lead or otherwise.

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.530 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work that way.

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:58.990 align:middle line:90%


00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:02.110 align:middle line:84%
>> While the Andromedans may
have contributed to humanity

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:06.250 align:middle line:84%
on a global level, influencing
our gravity and oceans through

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:10.390 align:middle line:84%
the moon as well as the
world's most ancient language,

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:15.760 align:middle line:84%
as humankind evolves, can we
anticipate a more intimate

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:20.020 align:middle line:84%
involvement from the Andromedans
in the future before us?

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:23.230 align:middle line:84%
>> They don't want to have
direct control or any sort

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:27.460 align:middle line:84%
of hand in the course of the
direction that any civilization

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:28.540 align:middle line:90%
is going.

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:31.660 align:middle line:84%
They don't mind working with
the Galactic Federation.

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.550 align:middle line:84%
Their holographic
political system

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:36.100 align:middle line:84%
is an integral part of
the Galactic Federation.

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:37.840 align:middle line:84%
They don't seem to
have a problem making

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:41.200 align:middle line:84%
ships and building ships
for the Galactic Federation.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:45.020 align:middle line:10%
But when it comes to the
affairs of individual planets,

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:47.060 align:middle line:10%
they don't want
anything to do with it.

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:50.128 align:middle line:84%
>> They kind of see their role
as kind of like an overseer

00:20:50.128 --> 00:20:52.420 align:middle line:84%
of the development of Earth,
but they don't want to get

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:56.350 align:middle line:84%
necessarily directly involved
because they have great respect

00:20:56.350 --> 00:21:01.960 align:middle line:84%
for the universal laws of
noninterference and free will.

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Freedom is like a middle
name for Andromedans.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:09.160 align:middle line:84%
>> As Earth is ascending, there
are many people that store

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:13.720 align:middle line:84%
knowledge within their deep
unconscious and this knowledge

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.960 align:middle line:84%
is how to power ships and how
to use the free energy that will

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.960 align:middle line:90%
be available in the near future.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:22.780 align:middle line:84%
As part of the
Galactic Federation,

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:25.210 align:middle line:84%
the Andromedans helped
share this knowledge

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:27.770 align:middle line:84%
and go over this knowledge
with these individuals

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:29.740 align:middle line:84%
so that when the
time is right, they

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:33.490 align:middle line:84%
will be able to use their
mental capabilities so they

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:38.800 align:middle line:84%
can help this ascension process
just through their presence.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:43.240 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe Andromedans
are here assisting Earth,

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:48.670 align:middle line:84%
because when you are part
of a alignment of planets

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:53.950 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness, everyone
chips in to help raise a new

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.950 align:middle line:84%
planet that is ready
for that transformation.

00:21:56.950 --> 00:22:00.670 align:middle line:84%
>> What we gather from these
interactions with the Andromeda

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:04.630 align:middle line:84%
Council is that they've worked
with other galactic federations

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:08.080 align:middle line:84%
and groups that have the best
interests over the development

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.730 align:middle line:90%
of the human family.

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:12.880 align:middle line:84%
They are benevolent,
they're highly advanced,

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.090 align:middle line:84%
technologically superior
to us in every way.

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps we have
part of their DNA,

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:23.080 align:middle line:84%
therefore they have a karmic
attachment and responsibility

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.400 align:middle line:90%
for us and with us.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:29.140 align:middle line:84%
I see that they are a very
important part of our history

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:31.300 align:middle line:84%
and where we will
go in the future.

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>> If the Andromedans
are involved with Earth,

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:38.200 align:middle line:84%
and they are the
ultimate advanced beings,

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.810 align:middle line:84%
they're at the top of the
scale, why would they want to be

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:42.010 align:middle line:90%
involved with humans?

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:43.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, most certainly
they would have

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:46.280 align:middle line:84%
taken on the role of teacher,
that it is their role.

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:49.690 align:middle line:84%
Once you acquire this knowledge
to be able to spread it

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:51.430 align:middle line:90%
to other civilizations.

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Because connection is the raison
d'etre of the universe, where

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.720 align:middle line:84%
we're all seeking connection
amongst ourselves,

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.840 align:middle line:84%
with our source, with
other civilizations.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And if you've got a
way to reduce the time

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:08.440 align:middle line:84%
it takes to get from a star to
a star, that is tremendously

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:09.850 align:middle line:90%
valuable knowledge.

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And the Andromedans having gone
beyond the material needs, gone

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:17.200 align:middle line:84%
beyond our psychology
would certainly

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.880 align:middle line:84%
be the ultimate
benevolent beings

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:21.280 align:middle line:84%
in trying to raise everybody
up to this high level

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.110 align:middle line:84%
because that
assures the greatest

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:25.040 align:middle line:90%
connection in the universe.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:29.170 align:middle line:10%
>> We are living really at the
time of a great renaissance

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:32.620 align:middle line:10%
of the human experience if we
can put together the proper

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:38.080 align:middle line:10%
mosaic or mental roadmap of
how we are uniquely being given

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.840 align:middle line:10%
knowledge that will make this
perhaps the most important part

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:43.920 align:middle line:10%
of human history.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:47.880 align:middle line:84%
The reconnection with
our cosmic teachers,

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:52.260 align:middle line:84%
beings of the divine source
who will illuminate us not

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:55.440 align:middle line:84%

peace constructively

00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:03.060 align:middle line:84%
We are beginning to
redefine scientific truth,

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:05.400 align:middle line:84%
a new ontology of life
or purpose of life,

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:10.140 align:middle line:84%
a new direction by virtue
of the Galactic Federation

make the decisions that

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:21.240 align:middle line:84%
count for the
advancement of humanity.
