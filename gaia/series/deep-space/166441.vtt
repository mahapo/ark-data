00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Of all the mysteries
that our human race faces,

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.230 align:middle line:84%
the largest and most unknown
is the mystery of where we came

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.610 align:middle line:90%
from.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.270 align:middle line:84%
Did we spring up out of
evolution to become who we are?

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Even Francis Crick,
co-discoverer of the DNA code,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.260 align:middle line:84%
came to realize that life
is far too complicated

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.960 align:middle line:90%
to have begun here on Earth.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.960 align:middle line:84%
He resorted to a theory
called panspermia,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.090 align:middle line:84%
which says that there
are life packets floating

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.480 align:middle line:90%
through the universe.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.630 align:middle line:10%
And when these
packets of DNA fall

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.980 align:middle line:10%
onto a planet that has
water, they erupt into life.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.460 align:middle line:10%
But as we learn more about
ourselves and our past,

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.110 align:middle line:10%
the more it becomes
apparent that there

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.490 align:middle line:10%
are other unseen forces at work
in the evolution of our species

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.530 align:middle line:10%
and in our history.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.030 align:middle line:84%
>> You see, according to many
old myths, some religions too,

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.330 align:middle line:84%
the so-called gods created
humans according to their own

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.500 align:middle line:84%
image, which is easy to
understand in our days.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.410 align:middle line:10%
Some unknown millions
of years ago,

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.670 align:middle line:10%
someone infected a
sector of our Milky Way

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.820 align:middle line:10%
with DNA, which
spread out like dust.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.620 align:middle line:90%
The biggest part will disappear.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.440 align:middle line:84%
Because it will come into
the gravity of a sun.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.670 align:middle line:90%
It will burn.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Or it reaches a planet which
has no condition for life,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.030 align:middle line:84%
like our Jupiter, for
example, or our Mercury.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.560 align:middle line:90%
Much too hot there.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.130 align:middle line:84%
A small part of DNA
will land on a planet

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.980 align:middle line:84%
which has similar
conditions than the one who

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.440 align:middle line:90%
started with it.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.370 align:middle line:90%
And now, life begins.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.790 align:middle line:84%
I learned as a student that it
all started on our own planet,

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.490 align:middle line:84%
you know, the atoms
formed together

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.100 align:middle line:84%
molecules,
macro-molecules, et cetera.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.820 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, modern science
say, no, the information

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.580 align:middle line:90%
of life has come from outside.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.440 align:middle line:90%
So we have this problem.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.910 align:middle line:90%
Where did it started?

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.350 align:middle line:90%
No one has an answer.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.980 align:middle line:84%
We cannot say on which
part a circle started.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.910 align:middle line:90%
The circle is closed by itself.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.380 align:middle line:84%
So these ETs who started
to spread out life,

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.340 align:middle line:84%
they knew in advance on which
planets in their Milky Way

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.080 align:middle line:90%
there would be an evolution.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.560 align:middle line:84%
Later, they come,
really, with spaceship.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.350 align:middle line:84%
As expected, they found
a planet full of life.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.060 align:middle line:90%
Among them were our--

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.700 align:middle line:84%
well, so-say parents, the
apes, the chimpanzees,

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.430 align:middle line:90%
all these gorilla types.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.220 align:middle line:90%
It's our evolution type.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.290 align:middle line:84%
They took simply one example of
it out, and one simple shell.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.980 align:middle line:84%
You change the DNA code,
the basic code in the cell.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.010 align:middle line:84%
You put this back into
a liquid nutrition.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.990 align:middle line:90%
The cell multiplies and grows.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.570 align:middle line:84%
The product, you put into
the womb of the female

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.290 align:middle line:90%
of the same species.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.400 align:middle line:84%
This female will give
birth to the child.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.450 align:middle line:84%
>> In the land we call Iraq,
a civilization was born.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.550 align:middle line:10%
About 5,000 BC, the land of
Sumeria began flourishing.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.790 align:middle line:84%
It is here that we had the
beginnings of agriculture,

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.490 align:middle line:90%
writing, temple building.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.010 align:middle line:84%
As more has become
known about Sumeria,

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.710 align:middle line:84%
we discover that the
Sumerian people were ruled

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.350 align:middle line:90%
by a race called the Anunnaki.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.120 align:middle line:90%
Who were the Anunnaki?

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.460 align:middle line:10%
And what was really
going on in Sumeria?

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, the Sumerians were one
of the first cultures of modern

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.180 align:middle line:10%
humanity.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.200 align:middle line:10%
They arose, some people think,
maybe as early as around 5500

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.250 align:middle line:10%
BC.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.030 align:middle line:10%
But their culture really came
about in a significant way

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.300 align:middle line:10%
closer to 3000, 3500 BC.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.780 align:middle line:10%
In some ways, they were
the founding civilization

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.870 align:middle line:10%
of Mesopotamia, Mesopotamia
being that entire region

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.880 align:middle line:10%
along the Tigris and
Euphrates rivers,

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.020 align:middle line:10%
which later included
Babylonia, Assyria, some

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.410 align:middle line:10%
of these other civilizations
that are very famous.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.200 align:middle line:84%
But the Sumerians seem to
be the start of all of that.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.519 align:middle line:84%
And that's generally where
they're placed in history.

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.200 align:middle line:84%
>> In Old Sumeria, there is
the so-called Kings List.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.660 align:middle line:84%
The Kings List is
chiselled on stone.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.330 align:middle line:84%
The stone is today in the
British Museum in London.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.690 align:middle line:10%
And on this Kings List,
you read that the 10

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.680 align:middle line:10%
kings before the
Great Flood, they

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.800 align:middle line:10%
ruled together over 400,000.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.050 align:middle line:84%
Then on the King List, they
say, and then the flood

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.450 align:middle line:90%
came and destroyed everything.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And after the destruction,
other kings from heaven

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:50.940 align:middle line:90%
descended again.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.480 align:middle line:84%
They named 23 kings
after the Great Flood.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.540 align:middle line:10%
And these 23 kings
together, they again

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.380 align:middle line:10%
ruled over roughly 25,000 years.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.870 align:middle line:84%
These figures are
absolutely impossible.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.410 align:middle line:90%
We don't understand it.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Yet if we're talking about
an ET society, of course,

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.270 align:middle line:84%
there's a very good chance
that the ETs have much longer

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.320 align:middle line:84%
lifespans compared to humans
the way humans have much longer

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.530 align:middle line:84%
lifespans than many other forms
of life here on Earth is just

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.860 align:middle line:84%
a very strong variance between
different life forms as to how

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.240 align:middle line:90%
long they live.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Those numbers in the Sumerian
texts have actually many layers

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:29.540 align:middle line:90%
of information.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.230 align:middle line:10%
They may be referring to periods
that these ancient priest

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.210 align:middle line:10%
kings lived for and ruled for.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.750 align:middle line:10%
Some of them ruled for, like,
50,000 years or 60,000 years.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.580 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely, I don't
have a problem with it.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.220 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at those
numbers, 144,000 years,

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.430 align:middle line:84%
and 128,000 years,
432,000 years,

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.670 align:middle line:84%
you start seeing sacred geometry
numbers encoded in those.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we've been
missing for a long time.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.860 align:middle line:84%
Anunnaki, or the
Anunna Gods, as they

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.800 align:middle line:84%
were known in the Sumerian
times, and from the Sumerian

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.290 align:middle line:84%
texts, and the
clay tablets, were

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.140 align:middle line:84%
beings from another planet came
to Earth in search for gold,

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.940 align:middle line:90%
apparently.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.750 align:middle line:10%
That's what seems to be the main
thread of the Anunnaki story.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.430 align:middle line:10%
So whatever perception people
may have of the Anunnaki

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.637 align:middle line:10%
or the Anunna Gods is a
broad perspective, I believe.

00:06:16.637 --> 00:06:18.470 align:middle line:84%
Different people have
different views on it.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.470 align:middle line:84%
They clearly played a very
important role in the situation

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.170 align:middle line:84%
we seem to find ourselves in
today on this world of ours.

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:28.100 align:middle line:10%
They had a very big role to
play in cloning activities

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.570 align:middle line:10%
on this planet, different
animals, different species,

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:35.220 align:middle line:10%
including our human race, which
seems to be one of the projects

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.010 align:middle line:10%
they undertook here,
to clone a new species.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.840 align:middle line:84%
>> The most authentic of the
creation stories that we have

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.530 align:middle line:84%
specifically say that that's
exactly what human beings were

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.970 align:middle line:84%
bio-engineered to do, to be
slaves for the ET society.

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.700 align:middle line:84%
They were designed to
get agriculture going.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And they were designed
then to build structures

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:57.020 align:middle line:90%
for the use of the gods.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.960 align:middle line:84%
Zecharia Sitchin takes
it a step further.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.100 align:middle line:84%
He looks on to maybe
they were intended

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.170 align:middle line:90%
to do gold mining also.

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:07.850 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, you can say that if
you take those myths seriously--

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:11.000 align:middle line:84%
and I use the "myth"
word cautiously.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.090 align:middle line:84%
Because some of
these stories that we

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.690 align:middle line:84%
find in ancient Mesopotamia
have been acknowledged

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.900 align:middle line:84%
by archaeology, for example,
the fact that agriculture did

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.720 align:middle line:90%
start in that very region.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.700 align:middle line:10%
The Gobekli Tepe seems to be
our first shrine, which started

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.500 align:middle line:10%
where agriculture started.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.710 align:middle line:84%
So we can maybe take
some of that seriously.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.980 align:middle line:84%
But they said that that's why
humans were design-- what they

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.830 align:middle line:84%
were designed to do was
to be the slave race

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.170 align:middle line:84%
to get those things built
and to get all that going.

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:43.890 align:middle line:10%
>> And the Anunna Gods, also
referred to by Zulu shaman,

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:47.390 align:middle line:10%
Credo Mutwa, and other shamans,
African shamans that are

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.712 align:middle line:10%
the custodians of
ancient knowledge,

00:07:49.712 --> 00:07:51.170 align:middle line:10%
that talk about
the under Anunnaki,

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:52.878 align:middle line:10%
and the gods that came
down from the sky,

00:07:52.878 --> 00:07:56.420 align:middle line:10%
and created the people, created
humanity in southern Africa

00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:00.080 align:middle line:10%
to be the slaves in the gold
mines that the Anunnaki started

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.710 align:middle line:10%
in their quest for gold.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:04.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's not
about one gold mine.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:05.950 align:middle line:84%
It's about thousands
of gold mines,

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:07.990 align:middle line:84%
actually, probably
hundreds of thousands

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.080 align:middle line:84%
of gold mines that
lie scattered.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.680 align:middle line:10%
And the evidence
of these gold mines

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.320 align:middle line:10%
lies scattered today
throughout southern Africa,

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.530 align:middle line:10%
South Africa, Botswana,
Zimbabwe, parts of Mozambique.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:21.100 align:middle line:10%
And it goes even further north
of Zimbabwe across the Zambezi

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.450 align:middle line:10%
into Zambia.

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.690 align:middle line:10%
And many ancient tunnels
have been discovered

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:29.810 align:middle line:10%
across the last 200 years or
so by explorers, accident--

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:32.049 align:middle line:10%
most of the time,
accidentally, by the way,

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:34.179 align:middle line:10%
not because they
were looking for it.

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:37.390 align:middle line:10%
And also ancient tunnels
discovered by modern mining

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:39.270 align:middle line:10%
companies that they cover up.

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:40.480 align:middle line:90%
There are actually files.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.830 align:middle line:90%
AngloAmerican has a file.

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And this was
volunteered information

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.600 align:middle line:84%
to me by the chief
geologists of AngloAmerican

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.790 align:middle line:84%
over a beer in a
pub, and said to me,

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:51.760 align:middle line:84%
oh, they have a file
in the head office

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.190 align:middle line:84%
where they keep all the
information about ancient mines

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:55.300 align:middle line:90%
that they discover.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:56.920 align:middle line:10%
And their instructions
are, when you

00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.050 align:middle line:10%
come across an ancient mine,
just cover it up, and move on.

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:02.590 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to get stuck in
that red bureaucratic red tape

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:06.190 align:middle line:84%
to declaring it ancient sites,
and protected, and all that.

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:08.920 align:middle line:84%
So they just-- it's
possible that AngloAmerican

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.690 align:middle line:84%
and other mining
companies have destroyed

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:13.420 align:middle line:84%
thousands of ancient
mines, tunnels,

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.760 align:middle line:84%
and evidence of this
ancient civilization

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.890 align:middle line:90%
that were mining gold.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:21.400 align:middle line:10%
Gold, slavery, and the feathered
tool, the winged serpent,

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.640 align:middle line:10%
often can be, I guess,
paralleled by saying the sky

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.370 align:middle line:10%
gods, or the winged serpents
are sky gods who came down

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:29.680 align:middle line:10%
to create humanity, to
give humanity knowledge

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.650 align:middle line:10%
and information, and also to
enslave them and bamboozle them

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:33.550 align:middle line:10%
with BS.

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Because, quite frankly, I don't
believe that their intentions

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:36.940 align:middle line:90%
were pure.

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.610 align:middle line:10%
Their intentions were certainly
not honorable and in the best

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:41.180 align:middle line:10%
interests of the human race.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.920 align:middle line:10%
So I believe that a lot of the
information we get from the sky

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:48.250 align:middle line:10%
gods was maliciously
planted information

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:52.270 align:middle line:10%
that would cause a slave
species and a species

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:54.940 align:middle line:10%
with amnesia that don't know who
they are, where they come, from

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:58.930 align:middle line:10%
and why we're here, and keep
searching for our origins,

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:02.140 align:middle line:10%
only to discover that we are
not where we think we are.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:05.500 align:middle line:10%
And that in itself becomes
a very important discussion

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:09.220 align:middle line:10%
that people have been
having for decades now,

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:12.350 align:middle line:10%
that leads to our sovereignty
our consciousness,

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:14.830 align:middle line:10%
our physical form, connected
to our spiritual form,

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:16.590 align:middle line:10%
and so forth.

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:19.390 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, when you look at
the old Mesopotamian stories,

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:22.240 align:middle line:10%
and you see how the
old temples were used,

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.460 align:middle line:10%
they were built for the gods.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:26.680 align:middle line:84%
The first temples
of Mesopotamia were

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.920 align:middle line:84%
built as, essentially, meet
and greet places for the gods.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.620 align:middle line:90%
They were tall.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:35.290 align:middle line:90%
Only a select few could go up.

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And what historians and
archaeologist readily

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:41.680 align:middle line:84%
acknowledge was their purpose
was for the human elite

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:45.820 align:middle line:84%
to go up there, and wait for the
gods to come down from the sky,

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.700 align:middle line:84%
and meet them on the
temple on the top.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:52.450 align:middle line:84%
Some of the ziggurats
even had a platform.

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And there's a theory
that one of the uses

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:58.270 align:middle line:84%
may have been as a landing
pad for some of of the craft.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:00.430 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, that
structure, I think,

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:03.640 align:middle line:84%
is definitely how all this
temple building started.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.610 align:middle line:84%
It was just, hey, we need
a place to meet the gods.

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:08.140 align:middle line:90%
It needs to be safe.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And it needs to be high enough
where they can come down

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:13.420 align:middle line:90%
and people can't attack them.

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:16.540 align:middle line:84%
Because, when you look at
the old Mesopotamian stories,

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:18.280 align:middle line:84%
a lot of humans did
not like the gods.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.410 align:middle line:90%
They felt they were maltreated.

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:22.570 align:middle line:10%
And there was a
real risk to them

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:24.723 align:middle line:10%
of being attacked
by unhappy humans.

00:11:24.723 --> 00:11:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And that might be
the whole reason

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:29.350 align:middle line:84%
why they're still, today,
apparently taking a back seat

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:30.640 align:middle line:90%
and trying to stay disguised.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.473 align:middle line:84%
Because if they really
came out in the open,

00:11:32.473 --> 00:11:35.020 align:middle line:84%
and people figured out, maybe,
what they've been up to,

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.270 align:middle line:84%
people might get
pretty mad at them.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:39.180 align:middle line:90%
That's one theory.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>> The quest for
gold is, in essence,

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.440 align:middle line:84%
not the human
obsession with gold.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.350 align:middle line:10%
We humans, and our
obsession for gold,

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:49.230 align:middle line:10%
is actually what we
inherited from the Anunnaki.

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.600 align:middle line:84%
The fact that humans
are obsessed with gold

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.242 align:middle line:84%
makes absolutely
no sense, and why

00:11:53.242 --> 00:11:55.200 align:middle line:84%
we would have discovered
gold in ancient times,

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.360 align:middle line:84%
and it became such a
prized, valuable item.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.850 align:middle line:10%
That's all nonsense and
BS by historians who

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:01.320 align:middle line:10%
don't know enough or have not--

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.170 align:middle line:10%
don't have enough information
to string together

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:07.260 align:middle line:10%
a proper creative thought
process or a thought process

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.160 align:middle line:10%
that actually makes any sense.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.810 align:middle line:84%
So the gold obsession, we
inherited, as the human, race

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:14.550 align:middle line:90%
from an Anunnaki.

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:17.430 align:middle line:10%
And the gold never
belonged to the humans.

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:19.200 align:middle line:10%
Remember, when the
conquistadors and those

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.290 align:middle line:10%
thugs from Europe that invaded
the free world started invading

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:25.480 align:middle line:10%
it some 500 years ago
in the late 1400s,

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.680 align:middle line:10%
and they started finding all
these ancient civilizations

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.170 align:middle line:10%
around the world in the
Americas, Africa, Asia,

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:34.860 align:middle line:10%
all had huge, vast
quantities of gold.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And they kept saying
to the Europeans,

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.000 align:middle line:90%
the gold doesn't belong to us.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.340 align:middle line:90%
The gold belongs to the gods.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:45.060 align:middle line:84%
So clearly, they knew the
ancient, native people

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:48.030 align:middle line:84%
of the world knew that the gods
were here looking for the gold

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:50.500 align:middle line:90%
and mining the gold.

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:54.060 align:middle line:84%
>> When you look at the
ancient Egyptian gods,

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.950 align:middle line:84%
they were so similar to
the Mesopotamian gods.

00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:00.400 align:middle line:84%
You find all of this
carryover and duplication.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.700 align:middle line:84%
I look at it as sort
of a management system,

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.690 align:middle line:84%
that they just had a
management system over Earth.

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:09.880 align:middle line:84%
Some were assigned to
lead the Egyptians.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.490 align:middle line:84%
Some were assigned to
lead the Mesopotamia.

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And then that broke
up, and so forth.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's always
been the same gods.

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:22.750 align:middle line:84%
The ETs today are the
same reptoid little grays.

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:24.310 align:middle line:84%
You find the little
grays depicted

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:26.980 align:middle line:90%
in 3000 BC in Mesopotamia.

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:31.000 align:middle line:84%
The reptoid types also
depicted already back in 4000,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.260 align:middle line:84%
5000 BC, and even
insectoids, surprisingly,

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.690 align:middle line:84%
you find rock art
here in this country

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:40.930 align:middle line:84%
where you see what looks like
the mantis type even being

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:43.480 align:middle line:84%
reported over here in
connection with imagery

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.690 align:middle line:90%
that is suggestive of UFOs.

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:50.710 align:middle line:10%
>> Our obsession with gold today
is just really an extension

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:54.910 align:middle line:10%
of that quest for gold by a
species that doesn't know why

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:58.270 align:middle line:10%
we we're digging the gold,
and turning it into jewelry,

00:13:58.270 --> 00:13:59.620 align:middle line:10%
and some technology.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:02.440 align:middle line:84%
But the majority of the gold
that we mine in the world

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:03.625 align:middle line:90%
is not accounted for.

00:14:03.625 --> 00:14:04.750 align:middle line:90%
It's not sitting in vaults.

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:07.330 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- it's
nowhere to be found.

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:10.545 align:middle line:84%
Keep in mind that when the gold,
especially in South Africa--

00:14:10.545 --> 00:14:12.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure how it
works in other countries.

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:15.670 align:middle line:84%
But in South Africa, when the
gold leaves the gold mine,

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:19.920 align:middle line:84%
there is no way for anyone to
trace it or account for it.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:20.720 align:middle line:10%
That's it.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.360 align:middle line:10%
It's gone.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.860 align:middle line:84%
We just know that
there are hundreds

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.570 align:middle line:90%
of gold mines in South Africa.

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:29.870 align:middle line:10%
And all the gold that they
ship out once a week is gone.

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:33.550 align:middle line:10%
We don't know where it's
gone and what happens to it.

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:37.120 align:middle line:84%
>> The ancient cuneiform
tablets found in Iraq show that

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:41.260 align:middle line:84%
the Anunnaki has an eternal
obsession with gold.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:45.780 align:middle line:84%
Many other human cultures also
share this obsession with gold.

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:49.540 align:middle line:10%
The Inca in Peru,
the Aztecs in Mexico,

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:52.150 align:middle line:10%
and many other people from
all over the Earth use

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:56.970 align:middle line:10%
gold in their statues, rituals,
and of course, currency.

00:14:56.970 --> 00:15:00.640 align:middle line:10%
Did our obsession with gold
come from the Anunnaki?

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.980 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
the human race is still

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:05.260 align:middle line:90%
mining gold for the Anunnaki?

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:06.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Abso-bloody-lutely, yes.

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:07.830 align:middle line:10%
Nothing has changed.

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:09.820 align:middle line:10%
Just because we're
6,000 years down

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:12.417 align:middle line:10%
the road, or 4,000
years down the road,

00:15:12.417 --> 00:15:13.750 align:middle line:10%
well, we think it's a long time.

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:14.550 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing.

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:18.310 align:middle line:84%
It's a drop in the ocean in
the infinite pond of time.

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:20.350 align:middle line:10%
And the very long
periods of time

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:22.150 align:middle line:10%
that the Anunnaki
seem to have existed,

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:25.750 align:middle line:10%
or exist, or live, hundreds
of thousands, if not millions

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:28.690 align:middle line:10%
of years that they live for,
until they probably choose

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:32.050 align:middle line:10%
to expire, especially if they
are who I'm now beginning

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:34.830 align:middle line:10%
to think they are,
multidimensional beings that

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:37.700 align:middle line:10%
can traverse time,
space, dimensions,

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:41.500 align:middle line:10%
and that they use this realm,
this world that we think

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.710 align:middle line:10%
is our world, is
actually their world.

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:44.510 align:middle line:90%
It's not our world.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.920 align:middle line:84%
We're the slaves that were
created in their world.

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:51.460 align:middle line:84%
So we need to readjust our
thinking completely and also

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:54.880 align:middle line:84%
readjust our way of interpreting
the nature of our reality,

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.390 align:middle line:84%
which is very different from
what most people think it is.

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:00.178 align:middle line:10%
It is not what we think it is.

00:16:00.178 --> 00:16:02.470 align:middle line:10%
So I believe that the Anunnaki
is still taking the gold

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:03.500 align:middle line:10%
off this planet.

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:06.350 align:middle line:10%
How and where they're
doing this, I don't know.

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:08.350 align:middle line:84%
But there's certainly no
accounting for the gold

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:09.340 align:middle line:90%
that we mine.

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And we mine more and
more gold every month.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:14.565 align:middle line:84%
If people think that the gold
industry is on the decline

00:16:14.565 --> 00:16:15.940 align:middle line:84%
because we are
running out of it,

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:17.650 align:middle line:90%
you are completely mistaken.

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:20.950 align:middle line:10%
There are new gold mines opening
in South Africa every year.

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:23.820 align:middle line:90%
They're mining us into oblivion.

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:27.090 align:middle line:84%
>> As soon as gold was
discovered in South Africa,

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:29.350 align:middle line:84%
the British army
attacked the country,

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:32.670 align:middle line:84%
which was made up mostly of
farmers and tribes people.

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:35.610 align:middle line:84%
The war, now called
the South African War,

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:37.950 align:middle line:84%
was one of the
bloodiest in history.

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:41.230 align:middle line:10%
>> The war that the British
launched in South Africa

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:43.735 align:middle line:10%
that's now-- it was previously
referred to as the Anglo-Boer

00:16:43.735 --> 00:16:44.535 align:middle line:10%
War.

00:16:44.535 --> 00:16:45.983 align:middle line:90%
"Boer" means "farmer."

00:16:45.983 --> 00:16:48.150 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't just the
farmers fighting the British.

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:50.870 align:middle line:84%
It was also Africans, the
Zulu Tribe, the Suthu Tribe,

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:51.670 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:53.220 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were fighting
on the side of the British

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:54.818 align:middle line:90%
because they were being paid.

00:16:54.818 --> 00:16:56.610 align:middle line:10%
Again, shows you what
money does to people.

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:58.620 align:middle line:10%
They betray their own kind.

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.020 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of the
Africans were fighting

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:04.550 align:middle line:84%
on the side of the Boers
against the British occupation.

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:08.284 align:middle line:84%
So it was about 60,000 Boer
farmers and another 60,000

00:17:08.284 --> 00:17:11.130 align:middle line:84%
or 80,000 African
soldiers, or impis,

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.650 align:middle line:84%
or warriors that were
fighting against the British.

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:15.210 align:middle line:10%
And many people in
the west are not

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:17.640 align:middle line:10%
aware of this, that
the South African

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:23.349 align:middle line:10%
War, which it's now called, from
1899 to 1902, remains, today--

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:26.910 align:middle line:10%
pro-rata, what the pound was
worth in those days, obviously.

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:29.190 align:middle line:84%
It remains the
most expensive war

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:32.100 align:middle line:84%
that the British empire
has ever launched.

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.130 align:middle line:10%
That's an incredible
realization to come to.

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And in 1899, they launched
this war with 470,000 soldiers

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.890 align:middle line:84%
that they sent down to
the southern tip of Africa

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:45.900 align:middle line:84%
to fight a bunch of
farmers on horseback

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.480 align:middle line:90%
and a bunch of Zulu impis.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.420 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's incredible.

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:51.640 align:middle line:10%
Why would you want to send
down such an incredible power

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.022 align:middle line:10%
force, supported by--

00:17:53.022 --> 00:17:54.480 align:middle line:10%
remember, there
were no aeroplanes.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.710 align:middle line:90%
So we're talking about ships.

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:57.750 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
horses, the cavalry.

00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:00.990 align:middle line:84%
Talking about the guns, the
cannons, the kitchen staff,

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:03.120 align:middle line:84%
the hospitals that
had to accompany them.

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.610 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about more than
half a million people that

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:07.470 align:middle line:84%
were shipped down
to South Africa

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:10.410 align:middle line:84%
to fight a bunch of
farmers, for God's sake.

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:12.030 align:middle line:10%
What is so important?

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:15.420 align:middle line:10%
And what was so important
is the gold reserves

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:17.640 align:middle line:10%
that the royal
bloodlines of England--

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.290 align:middle line:10%
who rule the world,
incidentally,

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:20.700 align:middle line:10%
if people don't know that.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.100 align:middle line:84%
They pretty much own the
world and rule the world

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.350 align:middle line:84%
through their bloodline
heritage to the ancient priest

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:26.820 align:middle line:90%
kings of Sumer.

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:28.740 align:middle line:84%
These bloodlines go
back thousands of years.

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:30.410 align:middle line:84%
They didn't come
here by accident.

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:33.420 align:middle line:10%
They came here about
brutal abuse of humanity,

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.010 align:middle line:10%
holding onto their
power, and holding

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:37.650 align:middle line:10%
onto the control of
humanity through all kinds

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:41.330 align:middle line:10%
of devious means, which include
murder, torture, extortion,

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:45.480 align:middle line:10%
thuggery of the highest
imaginable atrocities.

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And they invaded southern
Africa to secure the gold

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:52.260 align:middle line:84%
and secure the minerals
of that part of the world.

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:56.640 align:middle line:10%
Because they knew what
lay under the ground.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.860 align:middle line:10%
They knew about
the Anunnaki mines.

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:00.570 align:middle line:84%
They knew about
the ancient tunnels

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:03.250 align:middle line:84%
that are filled
with processed gold

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:04.800 align:middle line:84%
that very few
people are aware of.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:08.580 align:middle line:10%
There are thousands of
ancient tunnels between 30

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:12.270 align:middle line:10%
and 50 meters deep that are
still filled with processed,

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.880 align:middle line:10%
finished, yellow bars of gold.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's that gold that the
British empire is protecting.

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:21.240 align:middle line:84%
>> The question then becomes,
considering where we are today

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.990 align:middle line:84%
as humanity, are we
still a slave race?

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:28.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's a little
bit disturbing to me

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:31.170 align:middle line:84%
to see this hybrid
breading going

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:35.620 align:middle line:84%
on that's being reported in
the modern UFO phenomenon.

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:38.580 align:middle line:84%
Then essentially we
see the same process

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.480 align:middle line:84%
going that they described
in the old creation stories,

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:45.900 align:middle line:84%
where they're breeding now
a new variation of human.

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:47.740 align:middle line:90%
And it could mean--

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:49.440 align:middle line:90%
I don't say it necessarily does.

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:52.980 align:middle line:10%
It could mean that
modern humanity has maybe

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:56.400 align:middle line:10%
now completed its role,
that if the role was just

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.380 align:middle line:10%
to build an
infrastructure for them

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:01.830 align:middle line:10%
to use, which was to do
farming, agriculture, get

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:06.480 align:middle line:10%
a society going, at least get an
infrastructure with buildings,

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:11.520 align:middle line:10%
and electricity going for them
to finally move in and just

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:15.660 align:middle line:10%
take over, then you could
say, in a sense, yeah,

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:17.320 align:middle line:10%
maybe we still are.

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And we are nearing
the end of that.

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And now, they are starting
to get ready to replace us.

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's the significance
of this whole hybrid thing.

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:31.220 align:middle line:10%
>> If humans are the
creation of the Anunnaki,

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:35.040 align:middle line:10%
and were created in their image,
what did the Anunnaki look

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:35.840 align:middle line:10%
like?

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, there are
some descriptions.

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:39.990 align:middle line:10%
They definitely seemed
to be larger than us.

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:42.710 align:middle line:10%
They were much bigger than what
we are, possibly three times

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:44.990 align:middle line:10%
or four times bigger,
maybe even larger.

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:47.700 align:middle line:84%
It seems that some Anunnaki
were larger than other Anunnaki,

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:48.500 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:50.677 align:middle line:90%
So it's quite fuzzy.

00:20:50.677 --> 00:20:52.760 align:middle line:84%
You know, some of the
elders of the under Anunnaki

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.387 align:middle line:90%
may have been really big ones.

00:20:54.387 --> 00:20:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And then their offspring may
have been slightly smaller.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:59.240 align:middle line:84%
Because they already
possibly had mixed DNA.

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.320 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.510 align:middle line:10%
So there's mixed
signals that we get

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:06.920 align:middle line:10%
from the scriptures
in the Sumerian texts.

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.840 align:middle line:84%
But Enki, for
example, is described

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.480 align:middle line:84%
as being much bigger than
we are, but also having

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.370 align:middle line:84%
the hair the color
of the sun and eyes

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:15.230 align:middle line:90%
the color of the blue sky.

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:17.750 align:middle line:84%
So clearly, he was an
Aryan-like looking dude.

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:21.057 align:middle line:84%
But some researchers will claim
that they were reptilians,

00:21:21.057 --> 00:21:22.640 align:middle line:84%
and they were shape
shifters, and they

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.430 align:middle line:84%
had the ability to shape
between dimensions,

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:27.780 align:middle line:84%
and appeared to us
in different forms.

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.360 align:middle line:10%
So it becomes very difficult
to answer the question,

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.210 align:middle line:10%
what did the Anunnaki look like?

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:36.740 align:middle line:10%
And anyone that claims they know
what they look like, I think,

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:41.110 align:middle line:10%
has allowed the ego to
overtake their knowledge pool.

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:43.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, the same gods that
were also the ones that you find

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:45.910 align:middle line:84%
in ancient India,
and depicted there,

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:49.693 align:middle line:84%
they had same high-tech
weaponry, for example.

00:21:49.693 --> 00:21:51.610 align:middle line:84%
If you look at some of
the Mesopotamian texts,

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:53.080 align:middle line:90%
for example, the god Erra.

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.290 align:middle line:90%
He was the god of war.

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:56.710 align:middle line:84%
He's the one who fomented
war amongst humans.

00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:59.020 align:middle line:84%
He's the one who
directly got involved

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:03.640 align:middle line:84%
in shooting high-power weapons
at humans on the ground.

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And the descriptions
of those weapons

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:07.210 align:middle line:84%
are similar to the
weapons that were

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:09.550 align:middle line:90%
fired by the gods of India.

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:12.620 align:middle line:84%
So you have to conclude, if you
have these two high-tech powers

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:13.420 align:middle line:90%
over that little--

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:16.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Mesopotamia is
not that far from India.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.430 align:middle line:84%
So they would
undoubtedly have to have

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:23.050 align:middle line:84%
been the same pantheon of
gods, the same administrators,

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:24.280 align:middle line:90%
I call them.

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And the weapons were
not necessarily nuclear.

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:29.050 align:middle line:90%
They could have been.

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:30.580 align:middle line:84%
But I think the
point needs to be

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:33.910 align:middle line:84%
made that you can have
high-heat, high-tech weapons

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:35.995 align:middle line:84%
that are incredibly
powerful that

00:22:35.995 --> 00:22:38.530 align:middle line:90%
are not necessarily nuclear.

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:42.280 align:middle line:84%
So some skeptics
say, well, you know,

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.830 align:middle line:84%
some aspects of those
weapons don't sound nuclear.

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:47.110 align:middle line:84%
You don't read a description
of the great cloud,

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:49.780 align:middle line:84%
the nuclear mushroom
cloud, for example.

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:53.110 align:middle line:84%
All you read is this very
high-heat just devastating

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:56.560 align:middle line:90%
everything in a single blast.

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's a high-tech weapon.

00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:02.870 align:middle line:84%
>> The scriptures of the
Sumerians are encoded with

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:07.160 align:middle line:84%
critical sacred geometric
numbers that are keys to deeper

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:10.100 align:middle line:84%
levels of knowledge and
information about our world,

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.650 align:middle line:84%
about our solar system,
about our cosmos.

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:15.470 align:middle line:10%
And the nature of that
reality, by the way-- which

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:17.900 align:middle line:10%
has been changing
rapidly in my own mind

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.972 align:middle line:10%
as I do more research
about where we live,

00:23:19.972 --> 00:23:22.430 align:middle line:10%
what our world really looks
like, and what our cosmos looks

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:23.450 align:middle line:10%
like around us.

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:25.400 align:middle line:10%
And again, I'm
reaching the conclusion

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.680 align:middle line:10%
that it's not what we
think and not what we're

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:31.060 align:middle line:10%
being shown by our authorities.

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:33.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Myths from the past
seem to be saying that

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.160 align:middle line:84%
the extraterrestrials
we're dealing with are,

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:39.790 align:middle line:84%
for the most part, benevolent
toward the human race.

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Are there any
incidents from the past

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:46.760 align:middle line:84%
that would show us that this
idea may not always be true?

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:50.680 align:middle line:84%
>> The most disturbing thing
I came across when I did

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:55.900 align:middle line:84%
my research into the whole
subject of the gods of Eden

00:23:55.900 --> 00:24:00.400 align:middle line:84%
were the reports of
bright lights appearing,

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:05.350 align:middle line:84%
spraying gases, gases
appearing in the streets--

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:07.150 align:middle line:90%
they call them mists--

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:08.692 align:middle line:90%
that were visible.

00:24:08.692 --> 00:24:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as they passed
through the streets,

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:13.840 align:middle line:84%
people would come
down with the plague.

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:16.180 align:middle line:84%
These weird figures
and black appearing

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:19.210 align:middle line:84%
on the outskirts of villages
with these long instruments.

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:21.010 align:middle line:84%
They used to think
they were scythes.

00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:22.760 align:middle line:90%
That's what they called them.

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:25.000 align:middle line:90%
And they'd wave them around.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, the plague
would break out in those areas.

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:33.190 align:middle line:84%
That was not in any UFO book I'd
ever seen up until that time.

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:35.260 align:middle line:90%
And it just so disturbed me.

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:38.950 align:middle line:84%
But when I came across that,
and it was so consistent,

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:41.183 align:middle line:84%
I just felt like I just
couldn't withhold this.

00:24:41.183 --> 00:24:42.850 align:middle line:84%
Because I knew what
was going to happen.

00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:44.320 align:middle line:84%
I was going to
put this book back

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:45.730 align:middle line:84%
on the shelf at
the library where

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:48.940 align:middle line:84%
I found it, a book that-- it
was just on the Black Death.

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:50.520 align:middle line:90%
This was not a conspiracy book.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:51.460 align:middle line:90%
It was not a UFO book.

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:54.400 align:middle line:84%
It was just-- just people,
what people were reporting,

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.730 align:middle line:84%
and the omens they
said were happening.

00:24:57.730 --> 00:24:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And I knew if I put that
book up on the shelf

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:04.210 align:middle line:84%
without ever publishing them,
it may never come to light.

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:05.560 align:middle line:90%
Maybe eventually it would.

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.870 align:middle line:84%
So I felt I had a duty at
least to point that out.

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:11.050 align:middle line:84%
Now that doesn't mean
that every outbreak

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:14.650 align:middle line:84%
of the plague in every
place was caused by that.

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:17.860 align:middle line:84%
Because the plague
was contagious.

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:19.440 align:middle line:90%
So it also did--

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.760 align:middle line:90%
like modern biological weapons.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Modern biological
weapons are in canisters.

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:28.310 align:middle line:84%
They're on aerosols,
which people in those days

00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:29.220 align:middle line:90%
called mists.

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:31.690 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the
aerosols are visible.

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:33.190 align:middle line:90%
And they're sprayed.

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:36.160 align:middle line:84%
But then, once a
population is sprayed,

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:40.090 align:middle line:84%
then you can count on the plague
then righting its own course

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:41.470 align:middle line:90%
for a while.

00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:44.410 align:middle line:84%
It'll just spread because
it is a contagious disease.

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:46.630 align:middle line:84%
So, no, not every
outbreak of the Black

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:49.360 align:middle line:90%
Death was caused by a spraying.

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:52.270 align:middle line:10%
But they reported that the
spraying was the start of it.

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And that shows exactly how a
bioweapon today would work.

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And then they used
the contagion.

00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And then, when it starts to die
down, well, the spray again.

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.350 align:middle line:90%
You get more reports then.

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:08.320 align:middle line:10%
>> I believe, I have
deep spiritual feelings,

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:11.830 align:middle line:10%
probably the best description,
that the Anunnaki realize--

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:17.110 align:middle line:10%
that the higher, the senior
members of the Anunnaki family,

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:20.690 align:middle line:10%
whatever that family
may be, Enki, Enlil,

00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:24.580 align:middle line:10%
and those in that kind of
bracket of the Anunnaki--

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:27.010 align:middle line:10%
realize that they've screwed up.

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:29.050 align:middle line:10%
Maybe not
intentionally, but they

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:31.720 align:middle line:10%
realize that they've
created a platform which

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:34.665 align:middle line:10%
could be abused by the beings
of lower consciousness.

00:26:34.665 --> 00:26:36.040 align:middle line:10%
And that's exactly
what happened.

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:39.490 align:middle line:10%
So whatever the situation that
they created on this planet,

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:43.690 align:middle line:10%
in this world of ours, was
abused or was open to abuse

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:45.340 align:middle line:10%
by other beings of
lower consciousness.

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:47.460 align:middle line:10%
And I think that's
what happened.

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:49.990 align:middle line:10%
Now, the Anunnaki realize that
their actions have actually

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:53.860 align:middle line:10%
backfired on them and is
affecting their own survival

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:57.640 align:middle line:10%
because of the whole Prime
Directive principle, right?

00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:00.880 align:middle line:84%
Do not mess with a species
and they consciousness,

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.587 align:middle line:90%
evolution of consciousness.

00:27:02.587 --> 00:27:04.420 align:middle line:10%
You need to allow them
to evolve consciously

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:06.827 align:middle line:10%
so that they can
grow and reunite

00:27:06.827 --> 00:27:09.160 align:middle line:10%
with source, or the source
code, and realize that we are

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:12.250 align:middle line:10%
one with everything in creation,
and become gods ourselves

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:13.080 align:middle line:10%
again.

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.580 align:middle line:84%
Anunnaki created the
opportunity for other beings

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:18.100 align:middle line:90%
to invade and stop that process.

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:21.820 align:middle line:10%
So that has affected their level
of evolution of consciousness

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:25.990 align:middle line:10%
and started, possibly, an inward
spiral of decay and destruction

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:28.990 align:middle line:10%
within the Anunnaki
breed or species.

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:30.970 align:middle line:10%
Because, if you breach
the Prime Directive,

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:34.000 align:middle line:10%
as "Star Trek" has showed
us for so many decades now,

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.663 align:middle line:10%
you start and begin the
process of your own demise.

00:27:36.663 --> 00:27:38.830 align:middle line:10%
And I think that's what's
happening to the Anunnaki.

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:42.190 align:middle line:10%
And they realize, if they
don't come back here and fix

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:46.690 align:middle line:10%
the mistakes, or repair
and help humanity

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:50.380 align:middle line:10%
to stop the decay and
abuse of the human race,

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:52.840 align:middle line:10%
they're going to continue
decaying and devolving

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.470 align:middle line:10%
until they all disappear.

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:56.800 align:middle line:10%
And they basically
get recycled into

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.440 align:middle line:10%
the great creative process.

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:02.920 align:middle line:10%
The Anunnaki are here
kicking butt and getting rid

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:05.680 align:middle line:10%
of all the dark and negative
entities that have infiltrated

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:08.740 align:middle line:10%
and invaded our space,
invaded our bodies,

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:11.440 align:middle line:10%
overtaken humans, and
turned them into beasts,

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.210 align:middle line:10%
and turned some
people on this planet

00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:17.080 align:middle line:10%
into evil entities
that are completely

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:20.675 align:middle line:10%
undermining the human spirit
of creativity and creation.

00:28:20.675 --> 00:28:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what,
ultimately, humans want to do.

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.910 align:middle line:84%
All we want to do is
create, be creative,

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:27.820 align:middle line:84%
and contribute to our
fellow brothers and sisters.

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:31.060 align:middle line:10%
So I believe the Anunnaki
are back and doing everything

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:35.140 align:middle line:10%
they can from a position of
never being physically visible.

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:37.590 align:middle line:10%
Because that would just scare
the [BLEEPED] out of people.

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:39.160 align:middle line:10%
You can just imagine!

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.590 align:middle line:84%
So they're doing it from
a realm just outside

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:44.650 align:middle line:84%
of our visible
perspective, helping

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:47.170 align:middle line:84%
us to channel us
the right direction,

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:49.370 align:middle line:84%
and clearing the space of
all the dark entities that

00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:53.940 align:middle line:84%
have made our life and our
world so bloody miserable.

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:57.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Once the human race as a
whole realizes that it is not

00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:01.220 align:middle line:84%
alone in the universe, we can
then take our place amongst

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:05.690 align:middle line:84%
the many species and groups
that occupy the galaxies.

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:08.210 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps we have to begin
repairing the damage done

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:11.600 align:middle line:84%
to our planet, stop
fighting one another,

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.420 align:middle line:84%
and begin to understand
who we really are,

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:18.010 align:middle line:84%
and what we can
accomplish if we desire.

00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps, if we start there, then
an extraterrestrial presence

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:24.340 align:middle line:90%
will make itself known to all.

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:27.720 align:middle line:90%


00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Stay tuned next week as we
examine the alien origins

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:33.380 align:middle line:90%
of gnosticism.

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:41.000 align:middle line:90%
