>> As we have seen, the Germans,
and later the Americans were

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.970 align:middle line:10%
involved in a secret
space program.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.370 align:middle line:10%
Over the almost
70-year-old program

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.030 align:middle line:10%
many technologies have been
developed but kept secret.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.510 align:middle line:84%
Rumors began, starting
in the early 1980s,

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.850 align:middle line:84%
that the secret space
program had given birth

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.550 align:middle line:90%
to a breakaway civilization.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.340 align:middle line:84%
Speculation began that
if this secret project

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.980 align:middle line:84%
had developed super
technologies that

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.380 align:middle line:84%
could mean that they were
able to make a high tech

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.310 align:middle line:84%
civilization away
from Earth and us.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.130 align:middle line:84%
Is a breakaway
civilization possible?

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.930 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back in
time and find out

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.910 align:middle line:84%
why they wanted to
leave the planet?

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.750 align:middle line:10%
>> So the M Project was a
project that was greenlit

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.410 align:middle line:10%
by FDR in the mid '40s.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And FDR actually used the
black budget to pay for it.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.140 align:middle line:84%
He used his own
personal black budget.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.950 align:middle line:84%
They were tasked by FDR
to understand migration

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.010 align:middle line:84%
and what to do in the event of
some sort of a cataclysmic war.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.872 align:middle line:84%
They were already planning for
World War III and World War II.

00:01:54.872 --> 00:01:55.830 align:middle line:90%
That's how you do this.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:56.640 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.100 align:middle line:84%
So he wanted to
understand how you

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.370 align:middle line:84%
could move massive amounts of
population out of areas that

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.570 align:middle line:84%
were heavily damaged or
soaked with radiation,

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.000 align:middle line:84%
or if there was climate
collapse or whatever.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.790 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to understand
how to move people.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.970 align:middle line:10%
So they spent a few
years researching it.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And what they
ultimately came up with

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.810 align:middle line:84%
was that there was
no good way to do it,

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.970 align:middle line:84%
that if you damage
enough of the Earth,

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.600 align:middle line:84%
whether it's climate damage,
or it's radiation, or whatever,

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.670 align:middle line:90%
there is nowhere to go.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.460 align:middle line:84%
The ultimate result
of their research

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.830 align:middle line:90%
was to move to Alpha Centauri.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.140 align:middle line:84%
The problem was that
Alpha Centauri's too far,

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.220 align:middle line:84%
and in the mid '40s they
lacked the technical capability

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.210 align:middle line:90%
to get there.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.600 align:middle line:84%
So barring Alpha Centauri,
they suggested the moon, Mars,

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.040 align:middle line:90%
or Venus.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.590 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I think that the
elites want to leave the Earth

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.090 align:middle line:10%
because there's a
specific geological event

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.030 align:middle line:10%
that's possibly
pending on this planet.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.030 align:middle line:84%
There's been a lot
of talk about Nibiru

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.780 align:middle line:90%
and Planet X coming back.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.510 align:middle line:84%
But I don't particularly
think that it's

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.380 align:middle line:84%
the actual Planet X that's
going to cause the catastrophe.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.630 align:middle line:84%
What I believe is that Planet
X does exist, according

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.340 align:middle line:84%
to a lot of the ancient texts
and tablets that I've read,

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.100 align:middle line:84%
and that possibly
it's a brown dwarf

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.610 align:middle line:84%
star that's orbiting deep
outside of the orbit of Pluto.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And I also believe that there
is actually a planet orbiting it

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.520 align:middle line:84%
that may be called Nibiru or may
be the planet of the ancients.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.570 align:middle line:84%
But what I feel is that this
brown dwarf star is actually

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.450 align:middle line:84%
dislodging comets
from the Oort cloud

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.510 align:middle line:84%
and sending them streaming
into the inner planets.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.353 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that we can't stop.

00:03:33.353 --> 00:03:34.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you
take somebody who's

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.230 align:middle line:84%
not an expert at throwing darts,
if they throw enough of them,

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.105 align:middle line:84%
eventually they're going
to hit the bullseye.

00:03:39.105 --> 00:03:42.120 align:middle line:90%


00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Project Horizon was an
idea put forth by the military

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.230 align:middle line:10%
in the late 1950s for
sending a man to the moon.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.980 align:middle line:10%
And the idea was that
they would basically

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.680 align:middle line:10%
just launch some
guys to the moon,

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.890 align:middle line:10%
leave them there, and
shoot them supplies

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.292 align:middle line:10%
until they could figure out
a way to get them back home.

00:03:58.292 --> 00:04:00.000 align:middle line:10%
It's kind of a way of
politically beating

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.232 align:middle line:10%
the Russians to the moon.

00:04:01.232 --> 00:04:02.940 align:middle line:10%
What's interesting
about Project Horizon,

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.357 align:middle line:10%
though, is that
they were supposed

00:04:04.357 --> 00:04:07.900 align:middle line:10%
to be sent to the moon
with nuclear weapons.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.990 align:middle line:84%
They were sent there
with nuclear missiles.

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.540 align:middle line:10%
Now, the question
you have to ask

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.430 align:middle line:10%
is if you're going
to send weapons

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.120 align:middle line:10%
on an expedition like that,
exactly who are you defending

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.290 align:middle line:10%
yourself from?

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.498 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to start a
nuclear war with the Russians

00:04:21.498 --> 00:04:22.500 align:middle line:90%
by fighting with them?

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.150 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to start a war
with the German flying saucers?

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.310 align:middle line:84%
Or were we sending
nuclear weapons there

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.320 align:middle line:84%
with them to protect
them from aliens?

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.140 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a really
interesting question.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.170 align:middle line:84%
I can't imagine any reason why
we would send nuclear weapons

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:42.390 align:middle line:84%
to the moon, other than
dealing with aliens, Germans,

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.890 align:middle line:84%
or somebody who had very
advanced technology.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.880 align:middle line:84%
>> The other thing that you see
is that you see the military

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.470 align:middle line:84%
kicking off a
series of programs.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.490 align:middle line:84%
You see the army
goes out and comes up

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:59.730 align:middle line:84%
with Project Horizon by 1962
to land 200 soldier astronauts,

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.770 align:middle line:84%
as they called it, on
the moon, and to build

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.450 align:middle line:90%
a permanent installation.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.120 align:middle line:10%
Then you see the Air Force,
they come out with Lunex,

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.110 align:middle line:10%
the same kind of model.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.110 align:middle line:10%
Except they wanted theirs to
be a little bit more mobile.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And the Soviets at
the same time came out

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.180 align:middle line:84%
with Zvezda, which
was, again, to build

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.480 align:middle line:84%
a subsurface permanent
facility on the moon.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.180 align:middle line:10%
>> I think there is a breakaway
civilization that's sharing

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.800 align:middle line:10%
the world with us.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.740 align:middle line:10%
And in some ways,
it's been integrated

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.750 align:middle line:10%
into the United States.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.430 align:middle line:84%
So whatever was this
renegade, Third Reich,

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.040 align:middle line:84%
breakaway civilization--
and it may still

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.340 align:middle line:84%
be operating on its own
somehow, but portions of it

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.400 align:middle line:84%
have been, say, brought
in from the cold.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And they're part now of some
sort of global intelligence

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:53.130 align:middle line:84%
operation and network, which
must include at least elements

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.850 align:middle line:84%
of the United States
military, secret intelligence

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.590 align:middle line:90%
operations too I think.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.870 align:middle line:10%
And things like
Operation Paperclip

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.230 align:middle line:10%
would have really helped
merge those things together.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:11.490 align:middle line:10%
Now, kind of a global
network of secret bases,

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.690 align:middle line:10%
and even some of them could now
be on the moon and Mars even.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.030 align:middle line:10%
>> So I think there was
a breakaway civilization.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.610 align:middle line:10%
I think it's been
around for a long time.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:26.040 align:middle line:10%
But I think if you study
the history of humanity,

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.410 align:middle line:10%
basically we've had interaction
with a very advanced

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:29.850 align:middle line:10%
civilization for a long time.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.650 align:middle line:90%
And it's been here.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.830 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
what's going on now,

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.920 align:middle line:84%
you see that we have
very advanced technology

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.900 align:middle line:90%
in many, many regards.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it has to
do with anti-gravitics.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.360 align:middle line:84%
A lot of it has
to do with magic.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.190 align:middle line:90%
Or you could say black magic.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:49.380 align:middle line:10%
A lot of it has to
do with mind control

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:57.810 align:middle line:10%
technology and geo-engineering,
and also space navigation.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.050 align:middle line:10%
>> When it comes to the idea
of a secret space program

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:04.020 align:middle line:10%
there's one issue which I
think is very important.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.020 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't necessarily
relate to specifics.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.410 align:middle line:10%
But if you think about it,
we first landed on the moon,

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:14.160 align:middle line:10%
in terms of a manned mission
at least, in July 1969.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you look
at the way in which

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.670 align:middle line:84%
every aspect of technology has
advanced since then, computers

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:23.370 align:middle line:84%
that were once the size
of almost like a car,

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:24.960 align:middle line:90%
they're now like a matchbox.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.470 align:middle line:84%
The internet, medical
technology, everything

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:31.320 align:middle line:84%
has advanced to
incredible degrees.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.380 align:middle line:84%
But we're expected to believe
that the same brute force

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:40.170 align:middle line:84%
rocketry that sends
people to the moon in 1969

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:43.300 align:middle line:84%
is still the only way to
get people into space today.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that is
totally illogical,

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.720 align:middle line:84%
when every other single
aspect of technology

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:53.460 align:middle line:84%
has literally gone through the
roof in terms of developments.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.310 align:middle line:84%
Why is it then
we're still relying

00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:00.930 align:middle line:84%
upon rockets, brute force
engines, and technology that

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:03.510 align:middle line:90%
actually really isn't advanced.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:05.560 align:middle line:84%
The Saturn rocket
wasn't advanced as such.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.930 align:middle line:90%
It was just huge.

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of the
same situation today.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And I find that very
suspicious that we're still

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:17.100 align:middle line:84%
supposedly using
rocket technology when

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.230 align:middle line:84%
every other technology
has advanced.

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.960 align:middle line:10%
For that reason, I do
think there probably

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:26.640 align:middle line:10%
is some sort of covert
space program going on.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.950 align:middle line:10%
>> And this gets
into Gary McKinnon,

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:31.470 align:middle line:10%
the fellow who
was just a hacker.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:33.780 align:middle line:10%
And he hacked into the
Pentagon computers,

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.340 align:middle line:10%
basically looking
to see if he could

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.530 align:middle line:10%
find for any proof on UFOs.

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And what he found was rosters
and tables of organization

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:46.380 align:middle line:84%
for the space fleet, and
the ships we have that

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.390 align:middle line:84%
are being made in
secrecy, again,

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:52.140 align:middle line:84%
the blending of the space
programs, and officers,

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:53.490 align:middle line:90%
named all the officers.

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:54.990 align:middle line:10%
Even though the
Pentagon themselves

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:58.980 align:middle line:10%
admit that he didn't do any
harm to the Pentagon computers

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.950 align:middle line:10%
or to national
security, but he's just

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:03.120 align:middle line:10%
telling tales out of school.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:03.920 align:middle line:90%
They don't like it.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.890 align:middle line:90%


00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:09.780 align:middle line:10%
>> The United States government
eventually dropped its case

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.730 align:middle line:10%
against Gary McKinnon.

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:15.450 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the information was
so sensitive they didn't

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:19.110 align:middle line:90%
want to risk going to trial.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.570 align:middle line:84%
Are there any other hackers
who have discovered evidence

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:24.480 align:middle line:90%
of a secret space program?

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Everybody's heard of Gary
McKinnon and the hacking that

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.420 align:middle line:84%
he did in the early 2000s
looking for information

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:35.280 align:middle line:84%
on UFOs, and may actually have
stumbled on evidence in terms

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.130 align:middle line:84%
of documentation related
to a secret space program.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:42.360 align:middle line:84%
He reportedly uncovered a
listing of military personnel

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.970 align:middle line:84%
that seemed to be like
off planet personnel.

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:47.670 align:middle line:90%


00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.440 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people,
though, don't know

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.510 align:middle line:10%
about the case of
Matthew Bevan, which

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.690 align:middle line:10%
occurred in the mid 1990s,
and in many respects

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:58.560 align:middle line:10%
is more important, more
intriguing than the Gary

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.060 align:middle line:10%
McKinnon story.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, back in the
early 1990s when

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.410 align:middle line:84%
he was still only
a young teenager,

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:07.440 align:middle line:84%
but he was a brilliant
computer expert back then,

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.310 align:middle line:84%
Matthew Bevan developed
a deep interest in UFOs.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And by sort of the mid to late
1990s, when he was sort of 16,

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:19.170 align:middle line:84%
17, he was actually
starting to hack.

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And he hacked into the
likes of, for example, NASA,

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.830 align:middle line:84%
various departments of
defense, US departments

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:31.140 align:middle line:84%
of defense, programs, and
sites, and formats, et cetera.

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that, he also
penetrated Wright Patterson Air

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:36.900 align:middle line:90%
Force Base in Dayton, Ohio.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, the one reason we know
today why he wanted to do that

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:44.880 align:middle line:84%
is because Wright Patterson has
a long history of involvement

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.180 align:middle line:90%
in the UFO subject.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:50.400 align:middle line:84%
For example, we know that the
early acknowledged UFO programs

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.090 align:middle line:84%
of the US military, like
Project Sign, Project Grudge,

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:56.280 align:middle line:84%
and Bluebook operated
out of Wright Patterson.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.170 align:middle line:84%
However, there have
also been a lot

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:00.930 align:middle line:84%
of stories and rumors
of crashed UFOs

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:03.660 align:middle line:84%
and dead aliens stored
at Wright Patterson.

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:08.510 align:middle line:84%
So what Bevan wanted to do was
to try and essentially find

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:10.850 align:middle line:84%
the treasure, the
gold, if you like,

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:12.420 align:middle line:90%
that we're all looking for.

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And he felt that Wright
Patterson would be the place

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:19.860 align:middle line:84%
to go looking for records,
if you like, online records,

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:24.240 align:middle line:84%
or in computer systems,
on alien autopsies, study

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.740 align:middle line:90%
of alien technology.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, he didn't
actually find that.

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:33.150 align:middle line:84%
But what he did find, and what's
really interesting is evidence

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:37.470 align:middle line:84%
of some sort of highly advanced
space plane, if you like,

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:40.620 align:middle line:84%
that was being developed at
Wright Patterson Air Force

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Base, and was being
studied by scientists

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:46.350 align:middle line:90%
and military personnel.

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:50.190 align:middle line:84%
What happened was that Bevan
penetrated Wright Patterson's

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:52.480 align:middle line:84%
systems on a number
of occasions.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And he said, he found it
extremely easy to get into.

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And what he actually
found were records

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:02.640 align:middle line:84%
on what he described as
a split level, very weird

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.790 align:middle line:84%
looking aircraft, kind of like
a circular, egg shaped type

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:07.920 align:middle line:90%
aircraft split into two levels.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:11.880 align:middle line:84%
The top compartment was sort
of where the pilots would be,

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.020 align:middle line:90%
where the crew would be.

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And the bottom part was
the propulsion system.

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And according to the files that
he read, the propulsion system,

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:24.390 align:middle line:84%
it was powered by an
ultra heavy element.

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And it could perform
incredible speeds.

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:30.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, this sort of ties in
very much with the story

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:34.320 align:middle line:84%
that Bob Lazar spoke
about in the late 1980s

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.120 align:middle line:90%
when he was working out at S4.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.220 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
dismiss his story.

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.920 align:middle line:10%
But what Bevan saw
on the computer

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:44.580 align:middle line:10%
systems was eerily
like the kind of things

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.820 align:middle line:10%
that Lazar was talking
about, say, seven or eight

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.240 align:middle line:10%
years prior to this.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, when Bevan
got into the system

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:56.310 align:middle line:84%
and saw these files on what
essentially was a secret space

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:59.700 align:middle line:84%
plane, he thought
he'd got in there

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.890 align:middle line:84%
and got out without
being noticed.

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:04.793 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately for him,
that was not the case.

00:13:04.793 --> 00:13:06.210 align:middle line:84%
But then a few
weeks later when he

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:10.230 align:middle line:84%
was working at an insurance
company in the Welsh city

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:13.260 align:middle line:84%
of Cardiff his boss came into
the office one day and said,

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.668 align:middle line:84%
Matthew, can you
come into the office?

00:13:15.668 --> 00:13:17.460 align:middle line:84%
We want you to have a
look at the computer.

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:19.040 align:middle line:90%
We've got a problem with it.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.520 align:middle line:90%
But that was actually a rouse.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.080 align:middle line:84%
When he got to the
room there were

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.720 align:middle line:84%
four guys in black
suits, the typical thing.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And one of them
said, Matthew Bevan.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.920 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yes?

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And he said, my name's
Detective Sergeant Simon James

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.160 align:middle line:84%
from Scotland Yard's
computer crimes unit.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm arresting you for
hacking NASA Wright Patterson

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:42.810 align:middle line:84%
Air Force Base and various other
US installations, agencies,

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:44.350 align:middle line:90%
and facilities.

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, he realized
he was in not just hot water,

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:48.880 align:middle line:90%
but scalding water.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.810 align:middle line:90%


00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:54.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Gary McKinnon and
Matthew Bevan hacked

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:57.870 align:middle line:10%
into the military's computer
systems and discovered a secret

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:03.300 align:middle line:10%
space program and a possible
breakaway civilization.

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.030 align:middle line:10%
How would it be possible
to finance such a program

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:09.230 align:middle line:10%
without being detected?

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:13.070 align:middle line:10%
>> If you're dealing with
a post-war situation--

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:16.340 align:middle line:10%
let's say you're Allen
Dulles sitting there at CIA,

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:19.770 align:middle line:10%
smoking your pipe, and reading
the intelligence analyses.

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:21.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Soviets
are up to this.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.080 align:middle line:84%
We've got a group of
Germans down somewhere

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.790 align:middle line:90%
in Latin America.

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing
a bunch of stuff.

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know
exactly where this

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:31.190 align:middle line:90%
is based, where it's located.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And we got a bunch of UFOs
flying around the sky,

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.786 align:middle line:84%
and they're turning
our rockets on and off.

00:14:35.786 --> 00:14:37.010 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:39.227 align:middle line:90%
You've got a problem here.

00:14:39.227 --> 00:14:41.810 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing you need to
do, particularly with the UFOs,

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:44.690 align:middle line:84%
because that's the biggest
potential threat that you've

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:47.090 align:middle line:84%
got to deal with,
you've got to find out

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:48.540 align:middle line:90%
intelligence about these guys.

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.780 align:middle line:10%
So the first thing
you do is you're

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:55.670 align:middle line:10%
going to put into play
a long term program.

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:58.310 align:middle line:84%
Because these guys in charge
of the national security

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:03.570 align:middle line:84%
establishment are not of the
mind to surrender to anybody,

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:06.808 align:middle line:84%
regardless of how
superior they may be.

00:15:06.808 --> 00:15:08.600 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to put
into place a program

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.740 align:middle line:84%
to investigate technologies,
to create the technologies

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:17.270 align:middle line:84%
to emulate what you're
seeing so that you can play

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:20.600 align:middle line:84%
the nuclear, mutually assured
destruction game with whoever's

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:24.110 align:middle line:84%
flying these things
around in our skies.

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And to do that, you know
that this is probably

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:31.160 align:middle line:84%
going to be a project that's
going to last decades.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it's
going to require not only

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:35.240 align:middle line:90%
a great deal of financing.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.510 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be like
the Manhattan Project,

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:40.810 align:middle line:90%
but on steroids.

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:44.060 align:middle line:84%
>> I had a conversation with a
scientist who knew about this.

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:46.630 align:middle line:10%
And he said to me, this
is an expensive program.

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:50.750 align:middle line:84%
In fact, what he said to me is
that the security from managing

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:52.640 align:middle line:84%
this program was seven
to eight times more

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:56.780 align:middle line:84%
expensive than the
actual scientific R&D.

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.490 align:middle line:90%
That's what he said to me.

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:01.020 align:middle line:84%
So I think he knew what
he was talking about.

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:03.905 align:middle line:84%
He seemed like he had a very
good understanding of this.

00:16:03.905 --> 00:16:05.780 align:middle line:84%
He didn't tell me how
much money is involved,

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:07.710 align:middle line:90%
but it seemed like a lot to me.

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:09.480 align:middle line:84%
So where does the
money come from?

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:09.630 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:11.150 align:middle line:84%
If you want to hide
this from Congress,

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:12.530 align:middle line:84%
you've got to do
a really good job.

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:14.545 align:middle line:84%
And really the best thing is
to go around Congress and not

00:16:14.545 --> 00:16:15.620 align:middle line:90%
even deal with Congress.

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:16.970 align:middle line:90%
Congress becomes irrelevant.

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:20.780 align:middle line:84%
So you need a very
expensive black budget.

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And this comes through
highly illegal activities.

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:27.080 align:middle line:90%


00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, the big
question, of course,

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:32.960 align:middle line:84%
is who's running this
secret space program?

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.060 align:middle line:84%
I probably have
views that are quite

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:37.790 align:middle line:84%
different to a lot of
people in the UFO subject

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:41.335 align:middle line:84%
on this, because I actually
don't think the US government,

00:16:41.335 --> 00:16:43.460 align:middle line:84%
or the military, or the
intelligence community when

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:46.640 align:middle line:84%
it comes to the space program
or the secret space program,

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.860 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe they're
the guilty party.

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:51.290 align:middle line:10%
What I believe-- and there is
a lot of evidence for this--

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:54.380 align:middle line:10%
is that we're dealing with
sort of black projects,

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:58.190 align:middle line:10%
and what are called SAPs,
Special Access Programs, which

00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:01.880 align:middle line:10%
essentially operate outside
of the regular conventions

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:02.840 align:middle line:10%
of government.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.880 align:middle line:84%
There's no
Congressional oversight.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.849 align:middle line:84%
They're funded
through black budget

00:17:07.849 --> 00:17:09.784 align:middle line:90%
programs and alternative means.

00:17:09.784 --> 00:17:11.797 align:middle line:90%
There's no oversight, nothing.

00:17:11.797 --> 00:17:13.339 align:middle line:84%
For all intents and
purposes, they're

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:15.530 align:middle line:90%
sort of hidden in plain sight.

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:21.380 align:middle line:84%
So I could well understand where
the government, the president,

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:25.190 align:middle line:84%
the CIA, the NSA, the
Pentagon may not know

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:26.869 align:middle line:90%
that perhaps deeply buried--

00:17:26.869 --> 00:17:29.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, maybe even literally
deeply buried, say,

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:32.270 align:middle line:84%
out at Area 51,
there could be sort

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:36.350 align:middle line:84%
of a highly classified
space program going on,

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:38.960 align:middle line:84%
but people like NASA
and the military

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.740 align:middle line:90%
are completely out of the loop.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.470 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I
actually do think

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:44.930 align:middle line:84%
that NASA believes
that what they've got

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:46.490 align:middle line:90%
is the best that we've got.

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:49.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't paint any of those
people as the bad guys.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:52.670 align:middle line:10%
But I think somebody
has been pursuing

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:56.270 align:middle line:10%
a highly classified, highly
advanced space program.

00:17:56.270 --> 00:18:00.290 align:middle line:84%
They may even have made
return visits to the moon.

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:01.580 align:middle line:90%
They may have gone to Mars.

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:05.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, who knows how
far they could have gone?

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.750 align:middle line:84%
But because the
regular government,

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:10.100 align:middle line:84%
the regular body of
NASA doesn't know,

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.590 align:middle line:84%
it actually looks to
everybody else as if, well,

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:15.830 align:middle line:84%
there cannot be a secret space
program because NASA is still

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:17.150 align:middle line:90%
using rockets.

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:20.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually, I think that there
were two secret space programs.

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:22.880 align:middle line:84%
One was created by the
military industrial complex

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.710 align:middle line:90%
and the intelligence agencies.

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:26.742 align:middle line:10%
And they basically got
all the information

00:18:26.742 --> 00:18:27.950 align:middle line:10%
out of the public they could.

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:30.578 align:middle line:10%
They did things like
interviewed T. Townsend Brown

00:18:30.578 --> 00:18:32.120 align:middle line:10%
about his technologies,
had him issue

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.978 align:middle line:10%
a very detailed proposal on
how he wanted to go forward.

00:18:34.978 --> 00:18:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And then they said,
thanks very much.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
end of T. Townsend

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:39.680 align:middle line:84%
Brown having any involvement
with the government.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:40.763 align:middle line:10%
That happened in the '50s.

00:18:40.763 --> 00:18:44.352 align:middle line:10%
And then clearly, if you look
at some of the MJ-12 documents,

00:18:44.352 --> 00:18:45.560 align:middle line:10%
the presidents were involved.

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.235 align:middle line:84%
Truman and Eisenhower
were involved.

00:18:47.235 --> 00:18:48.860 align:middle line:84%
But then I think
somebody on the inside

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:51.630 align:middle line:84%
got the idea that the president
shouldn't be involved.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:53.100 align:middle line:90%
They locked Kennedy out of it.

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.550 align:middle line:84%
There's even a memo that
says Lancer, who was John F.

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:58.340 align:middle line:84%
Kennedy's Secret Service
nickname is making inquiries

00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:00.060 align:middle line:90%
and we cannot allow this.

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.970 align:middle line:10%
And I think what
Kennedy decided is,

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:04.190 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to make my own
secret space program,

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:07.700 align:middle line:10%
and I'm going to make it based
on a public space program.

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:08.950 align:middle line:10%
So we're gonna go to the moon.

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:14.770 align:middle line:10%
So he took all of the resources
that he had control over

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:17.920 align:middle line:10%
and put them into a
public space program that

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:22.010 align:middle line:10%
also had a private aspect which
used other advanced technology.

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:25.307 align:middle line:84%
So I think there have been two
parallel secret space programs.

00:19:25.307 --> 00:19:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And the question is,
which one of them

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:27.973 align:middle line:90%
has won out at this point?

00:19:27.973 --> 00:19:30.060 align:middle line:90%
And we really don't know.

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:33.032 align:middle line:84%
>> Nobody realizes, well, maybe
somebody else is doing it.

00:19:33.032 --> 00:19:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what it comes down to.

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:35.657 align:middle line:90%
That's the crux of it.

00:19:35.657 --> 00:19:38.460 align:middle line:84%
It's not so much that there
is a secret space program,

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:39.820 align:middle line:90%
although that is important.

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:42.590 align:middle line:84%
It's the fact that we don't
know where to look for it.

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:44.580 align:middle line:84%
The regular outlets
where we would

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:47.220 align:middle line:84%
think we should go looking
are not actually the ones

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.050 align:middle line:90%
we should be looking for.

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I didn't used to think that
we had active bases on Mars

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:52.200 align:middle line:90%
and the moon.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.158 align:middle line:84%
And what I can say
factually is that everything

00:19:54.158 --> 00:19:57.070 align:middle line:84%
I've seen on these other
worlds is in ruins.

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:59.070 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean we
don't have bases there.

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And these days, the more I
look at the technology that's

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:04.483 align:middle line:84%
been developed over the
last 20, 30, 40 years,

00:20:04.483 --> 00:20:06.150 align:middle line:84%
I look at the work
of T. Townsend Brown.

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:07.590 align:middle line:90%
I look at the work of Plotnikov.

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:09.180 align:middle line:84%
I look at the work
of these guys,

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:11.940 align:middle line:84%
and the ARV, the Alien
Reproduction Vehicle.

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:12.750 align:middle line:90%
I see these things.

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And I see how much
evidence there

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.480 align:middle line:90%
is that they were produced.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And there's absolutely
no reason we wouldn't

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.207 align:middle line:84%
have gone to the moon and
established bases, or gone

00:20:19.207 --> 00:20:22.020 align:middle line:90%
to Mars and established bases.

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:25.260 align:middle line:84%
>> With their secret
financing and high technology,

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.870 align:middle line:84%
it would seem that there's every
bit of evidence to show that

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:31.510 align:middle line:90%
there is a secret space program.

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:35.260 align:middle line:84%
If this is so, then the
follow up question has to be,

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:38.600 align:middle line:84%
if they all have this
technology hidden from us,

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.330 align:middle line:84%
is it possible that
they're creating

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:46.630 align:middle line:84%
a parallel civilization to
ours, a breakaway civilization?

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's worth suggesting
that if there is a secret space

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:54.135 align:middle line:84%
program, then clearly it
has some sort of agenda.

00:20:54.135 --> 00:20:56.910 align:middle line:90%


00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:59.370 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking
about just, I think,

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:01.130 align:middle line:84%
going back to the moon
for the sake of it,

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:04.250 align:middle line:84%
and picking up a few rocks
and stones here and there.

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:06.100 align:middle line:90%
There has to be an agenda.

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think that agenda would
be to sort of further travel

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:11.640 align:middle line:84%
out into the solar
system and beyond.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.910 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they've even gone beyond
the solar system itself.

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:19.090 align:middle line:90%


00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:21.650 align:middle line:84%
If that's the
case, then we could

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:25.250 align:middle line:84%
be looking at an entire
elite, if you like,

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:29.420 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, which has
access to technology way

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:32.390 align:middle line:84%
beyond the rest of
us, maybe technology

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:34.550 align:middle line:90%
to travel who knows where.

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, they
don't see themselves

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:41.340 align:middle line:84%
as just members of the human
race like the rest of us.

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:45.890 align:middle line:84%
They see themselves as an
elite which has the ability

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:47.600 align:middle line:84%
to, in the future,
and maybe even

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.850 align:middle line:84%
now, do things that the
rest of us will never do.

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:53.900 align:middle line:10%
And that creates sort
of like a hierarchy

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:57.200 align:middle line:10%
that operates outside
of the regular confines

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.970 align:middle line:10%
of civilization.

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And that would be kind of
profound and disturbing

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:06.420 align:middle line:84%
as well, the idea that
somebody is running a program

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:08.450 align:middle line:84%
that the rest of
us are completely

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:09.620 align:middle line:90%
left out of the loop of.

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:12.260 align:middle line:90%


00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:16.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let's go back to the
Cold War and the space race.

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.340 align:middle line:84%
The Russians got
their Nazi scientists,

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.770 align:middle line:84%
but they were focusing
on heavy lift rockets.

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:24.660 align:middle line:10%
They could put big, heavy
payloads up into space.

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:28.670 align:middle line:84%
That's why the Russians beat
us to the first, Sputnik, OK,

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:31.490 align:middle line:84%
the first satellite, Laika,
the first dog in space,

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:34.400 align:middle line:84%
the first woman in space, the
first man to orbit the Earth.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And we were starting
to feel the pain.

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:37.140 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute.

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:38.270 align:middle line:90%
What are we doing?

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:40.610 align:middle line:10%
Well, what we were
doing was building

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:43.520 align:middle line:10%
miniaturized, computerized
type equipment

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:47.210 align:middle line:10%
for trajectory and for all
the scientific things needed

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:48.330 align:middle line:10%
for space travel.

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:49.130 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:51.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, what was happening
is, and what nobody really

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:53.900 align:middle line:84%
knows and has not been
plainly told to people

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:57.210 align:middle line:84%
is that these Nazi scientists
were in touch with each other.

00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:58.988 align:middle line:84%
For example, most of
the Nazi scientists

00:22:58.988 --> 00:23:00.530 align:middle line:84%
early on working on
the space program

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:03.290 align:middle line:84%
were headquartered
down at El Paso.

00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:04.730 align:middle line:90%
They got weekend passes.

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:05.855 align:middle line:90%
Nobody kept tabs with them.

00:23:05.855 --> 00:23:07.522 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have
guards going with them.

00:23:07.522 --> 00:23:08.750 align:middle line:90%
They'd go right into Mexico.

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:11.270 align:middle line:84%
They'd send telephone
messages and letters

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:13.400 align:middle line:90%
to their counterparts in Russia.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And at the very top, at the
very top of the food chain,

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:19.010 align:middle line:84%
at the level of the
international bankers,

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:21.050 align:middle line:84%
at the level of
the John J. McCloy,

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:23.210 align:middle line:84%
who was the high commissioner
of Germany, but then

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:25.460 align:middle line:84%
also had been the
largest lender of money

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:30.080 align:middle line:84%
through Citibank to Hitler
and the Nazis, at that level

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.610 align:middle line:84%
they put the two space
programs together.

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:35.990 align:middle line:84%
They put the heavy lift rockets
with the computerization.

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And then so all of
these years when

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:41.000 align:middle line:84%
we've been paying our tax money
and watching these big rockets

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.330 align:middle line:84%
lift off from Cape Canaveral,
(ROCKET SOUNDS), you know,

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:45.890 align:middle line:90%
it's really quite impressive.

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:50.180 align:middle line:84%
Hey, over here. (WHISTLES)
They had anti-gravity

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:52.060 align:middle line:84%
and they had very
sophisticated stuff.

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And that was the beginning
of a breakaway civilization.

00:23:55.490 --> 00:24:00.080 align:middle line:10%
>> I think at this point, I
think it's very likely that

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:05.900 align:middle line:10%
there are American and perhaps
other bases on the moon.

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:08.780 align:middle line:10%
It's likely, honestly.

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:12.238 align:middle line:10%
And it's quite possible
there are some on Mars too.

00:24:12.238 --> 00:24:14.030 align:middle line:10%
>> I have good reason
to believe-- in fact,

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:16.880 align:middle line:10%
I have interviewed military
officers who say they have been

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:20.060 align:middle line:10%
to bases on the
moon, Mars, Venus,

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:23.060 align:middle line:10%
and that there are this
activities that's going

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:24.035 align:middle line:10%
on in space.

00:24:24.035 --> 00:24:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it's called
the secret space program.

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:29.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Using flying
saucer technology,

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:32.300 align:middle line:84%
it was possible to
get to the moon, Mars,

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:34.250 align:middle line:90%
and other nearby planets.

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:36.410 align:middle line:84%
There have been rumors
for the past 40 years

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:39.800 align:middle line:84%
or so that someone within
the secret space program

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:44.030 align:middle line:84%
had invented and perfected
portal technology.

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:46.370 align:middle line:84%
That is, they've
created a machine that

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:48.740 align:middle line:84%
would allow a human
being to go from one

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:51.770 align:middle line:84%
point in the universe to
another without traversing

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:53.910 align:middle line:90%
the distance in between.

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:56.390 align:middle line:84%
In other words, these
portals allow human beings

00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:59.570 align:middle line:84%
to go to any spot in
the universe instantly,

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:04.460 align:middle line:84%
no matter how far apart these
two spots are from each other.

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:06.530 align:middle line:84%
>> The idea of kind
of portals, stargates,

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:09.200 align:middle line:84%
and things like that, and you
have the famous Skinwalker

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.980 align:middle line:84%
Ranch in Utah that supposedly
has this portal that opens up

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:14.122 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:25:14.122 --> 00:25:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's possible that there
are natural portals like that.

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:19.310 align:middle line:84%
Bermuda Triangle has certainly
been talked about that way.

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like
a natural phenomenon

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:25.370 align:middle line:84%
that's happening with just
the way the Earth works.

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:29.070 align:middle line:84%
We're still trying
to figure it all out.

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:33.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I do know Duncan
Cameron pretty well.

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:37.190 align:middle line:10%
And so he was trained to go
through artificial stargates,

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:39.890 align:middle line:10%
artificial portals that
were set up for him.

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:43.580 align:middle line:10%
And that's interesting, because
they take a lot of energy

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:45.000 align:middle line:10%
to create.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's very constraining,
cause your whole mind is

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.477 align:middle line:90%
focused on just the mission.

00:25:52.477 --> 00:25:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And so it's like you're
going through this tunnel.

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.030 align:middle line:90%
You have tunnel vision.

00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:58.680 align:middle line:84%
And you're not really capable
of being aware of really

00:25:58.680 --> 00:25:59.480 align:middle line:90%
what's going on.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.220 align:middle line:84%
It's just like you're
sent somewhere.

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And you do the mission
what you're supposed to do.

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.160 align:middle line:90%
And then you're brought back.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>> But also, I think that
the military is also capable

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:11.920 align:middle line:84%
of generating portals
like this themselves.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And the idea of stargates and
hyperspace wormhole portals,

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:20.860 align:middle line:84%
whatever, certainly
it's the kind of thing

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:23.180 align:middle line:90%
that they would be looking into.

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And the whole idea too of
the Philadelphia Experiment

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:31.790 align:middle line:84%
and being able to teleport
objects, including battleships,

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:36.390 align:middle line:84%
even submarine type craft, that
was something from World War II

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:37.190 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:41.260 align:middle line:10%
And Einstein and even Tesla
were allegedly involved in that.

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And the Philadelphia Experiment
was to teleport battleships.

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that the American
military was able to do that.

00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of
technology would

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:55.810 align:middle line:84%
be one that would use,
in a sense, a portal.

00:26:55.810 --> 00:27:01.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Look, the stuff I saw there
was the most unbelievable,

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:08.440 align:middle line:10%
literally, because it defied
what we knew as physics.

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:14.590 align:middle line:10%
>> In the late '80s, a
person named Bob Lazar came

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:15.400 align:middle line:10%
to the media.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:19.730 align:middle line:10%
And he claimed that he had
been working in Area 51,

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:24.640 align:middle line:10%
that he was a physicist
and a scientist,

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:28.570 align:middle line:10%
and that he was part of
this top secret Area 51

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:32.140 align:middle line:10%
research into
anti-gravity, and allegedly

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:34.780 align:middle line:10%
retro engineering alien craft.

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:36.610 align:middle line:84%
What he claimed
was that the craft

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:39.940 align:middle line:84%
that he was retro
engineering at Area 51

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:42.430 align:middle line:90%
had a form of anti-gravity.

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:48.130 align:middle line:84%
What that anti-gravity
was a higher element,

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:51.070 align:middle line:90%
an element that he called 115.

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And then Bob Lazar went on to
say that element 115 could only

00:27:56.140 --> 00:28:00.190 align:middle line:90%
come from a double star system.

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And since we're not
a double star system,

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:06.970 align:middle line:84%
Bob Lazar's claim then
was that element 115

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:11.510 align:middle line:84%
had to come from
another solar system.

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:14.560 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
according to Bob Lazar,

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:18.100 align:middle line:84%
you could have anti-gravity
in this element 115.

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.440 align:middle line:84%
But it could never be
made in our solar system.

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:24.580 align:middle line:84%
It could only come from
some other solar system.

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:30.340 align:middle line:10%
And therefore, only aliens
and extraterrestrials

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:34.300 align:middle line:10%
could ever get this element 115.

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, no craft could
ever be made on Earth by humans

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:43.330 align:middle line:84%
if it had element
115 in it, cause it

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:46.930 align:middle line:90%
had to come from another star.

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And to me this is really
an intelligence operation

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:57.490 align:middle line:90%
that he's been promoted to do.

00:28:57.490 --> 00:29:02.060 align:middle line:10%
Because what he's really
saying is that, yes,

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:03.580 align:middle line:10%
there are flying saucers.

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:05.950 align:middle line:10%
Yes, there's anti-gravity.

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:09.360 align:middle line:10%
But no, we could never,
ever make it on this planet.

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.280 align:middle line:10%
It would be impossible.

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:15.100 align:middle line:10%
And only extraterrestrials
could do it.

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:16.930 align:middle line:90%
And that would be the big lie.

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:20.740 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we
can't make anti-gravity.

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And if there's a flying
saucer out there,

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.060 align:middle line:90%
it's not made on this planet.

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:30.310 align:middle line:90%
And that would be the deception.

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:33.130 align:middle line:84%
>> It is clear that someone
is hiding very advanced

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:35.990 align:middle line:84%
technologies from
the rest of humanity.

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:39.010 align:middle line:84%
It is also possible that
these super technologies

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:42.880 align:middle line:84%
are being used by the elite
to not only get off planet,

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:46.150 align:middle line:84%
but also to create a
separate society from ours,

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:49.590 align:middle line:84%
a breakaway civilization,
if you will.
