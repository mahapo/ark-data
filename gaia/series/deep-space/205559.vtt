00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.950 align:middle line:84%
>> The Bible is one of the most
referenced books in the world.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Over the last few decades,
an intense religious

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.540 align:middle line:84%
and scientific debate has been
building around the idea of ETs

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.370 align:middle line:90%
in the Bible.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.840 align:middle line:10%
In 2014, the Center for
Theological Inquiry,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.390 align:middle line:10%
a research institute
in New Jersey,

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.610 align:middle line:10%
was awarded $1.1 million
by NASA to study, quote,

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.620 align:middle line:10%
"the societal implications
of astrobiology" unquote.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.650 align:middle line:84%
In other words, what
would the overall impact

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.730 align:middle line:84%
be on religions if they were
to discover we're not alone

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.770 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.350 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible
that a distant race

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.640 align:middle line:84%
of ancient aliens once inhabited
the lands of the Bible?

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And if so, are we
part of their legacy?

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.270 align:middle line:10%
>> When we're reading the
Bible, we always have to look

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.240 align:middle line:10%
to the first page to see which
version of the Bible are you

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.040 align:middle line:10%
reading--

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.920 align:middle line:10%
the New International version,
the New New International

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.190 align:middle line:10%
version, the King James
version, the St. Jerome version?

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.320 align:middle line:84%
Which version are you
reading, because the language

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.760 align:middle line:90%
is going to be different.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.550 align:middle line:84%
If we were to write, for
example, the ET version

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.460 align:middle line:84%
of the Bible, we'd go back
to every story where it says

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.850 align:middle line:84%
"and the heavens opened"
and realize they're

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.770 align:middle line:90%
talking about a stargate.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.560 align:middle line:84%
What else could be the
heavens opening but a rip

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.580 align:middle line:90%
in the fabric of space-time?

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a
way we can start

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.800 align:middle line:84%
to connect with what the
ancients were actually

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.020 align:middle line:90%
seeing or experiencing.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.700 align:middle line:84%
Their language was
different from ours.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.200 align:middle line:84%
They would say "the
heavens opened."

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.783 align:middle line:84%
We would say, "oh,
a stargate opened."

00:02:05.783 --> 00:02:07.590 align:middle line:84%
It's as much a
function of language

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.900 align:middle line:84%
that separates us from
true understanding

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.320 align:middle line:90%
as it is anything else.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.190 align:middle line:84%
>> There are so many references
of extraterrestrial contact

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.180 align:middle line:90%
in the Bible.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.160 align:middle line:84%
There are 70 verses
describing clouds

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.520 align:middle line:84%
as vehicles, 15 verses
describing pillars,

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.080 align:middle line:84%
10 verses describing
dwellings as vehicles,

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.760 align:middle line:84%
160 verses describing the
light and fires as vehicles.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.090 align:middle line:84%
There are 17 verses
describing spinning wheels

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.280 align:middle line:84%
and also 22 verses
describing dark

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.320 align:middle line:90%
and shining objects as vehicles.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.230 align:middle line:84%
There's also 37 verses of
various objects in the Bible

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.910 align:middle line:84%
that describe UFOs as flying
furnaces and burning bushes.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.400 align:middle line:10%
So as you can see, based
off of the vocabulary

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.080 align:middle line:10%
of the people of
those times, they

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.660 align:middle line:10%
can only use words that
would help them describe what

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.720 align:middle line:10%
we would call nowadays UFOs.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.330 align:middle line:84%
The Bible begins with
the Book of Genesis

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.120 align:middle line:84%
and it ends with the
Book of Revelations.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.210 align:middle line:10%
In between are dozens of
stories that reference

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.640 align:middle line:10%
what many scholars suggest may
be extraterrestrial phenomena.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.000 align:middle line:90%


00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.810 align:middle line:84%
Genesis 6:4 describes
the sons of God

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.470 align:middle line:84%
coming and bearing children
with the daughters of man.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.100 align:middle line:84%
This begs the question,
who were the sons of God?

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>> The ultimate example of an
extraterrestrial intervention

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.360 align:middle line:84%
in the Bible is
Genesis chapter 6.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.300 align:middle line:84%
This is where the fallen angels,
the watcher angels, descend

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.960 align:middle line:84%
onto the earth plane, take
on physical incarnation,

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.480 align:middle line:84%
and have sex with human females
creating a hybrid offspring

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.150 align:middle line:90%
referred to as the Nephilim.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.230 align:middle line:84%
These are described as
the mighty men of renown.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.218 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:03:51.218 --> 00:03:53.260 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean to say
that they're mighty men?

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.610 align:middle line:84%
What distinguishes a mighty
man from an ordinary human?

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is that these
fallen angels are considered

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.750 align:middle line:84%
to be equivalent to, if not
the same as, the Anunnaki

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.580 align:middle line:90%
of Sumeria.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.940 align:middle line:84%
The Anunnaki possessed a
cloak or a garment called

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.410 align:middle line:84%
the [NON-ENGLISH] that
gave them superpowers.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.130 align:middle line:84%
So what this is saying
is that the Nephilim

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.399 align:middle line:84%
were the mighty humans
who possessed this cloak

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:20.380 align:middle line:90%
or garment of the Anunnaki.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.200 align:middle line:84%
And just like the Anunnaki,
when they had the [NON-ENGLISH]

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.070 align:middle line:84%
on, they're radiant, they're
shining, they're luminous.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.630 align:middle line:90%
And they have superpowers.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.770 align:middle line:84%
So this is another hidden
reference to technology

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.030 align:middle line:90%
in the Bible.

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.300 align:middle line:10%
>> That kind of interaction
actually talks about

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.060 align:middle line:10%
the Nephilim actually
interbreeding with human women.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.910 align:middle line:90%
That's a pretty big influence.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Inside of our DNA, there's
a programming language there.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.550 align:middle line:10%
It's been left by
our progenitors.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.240 align:middle line:10%
When we crack this code and
when we figure out who we are

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.780 align:middle line:10%
and where we're going, we'll
realize that our destiny

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:00.950 align:middle line:10%
is in the stars.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.750 align:middle line:84%
Therefore we have
to ask ourselves

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.060 align:middle line:84%
if we go back to
the Genesis story,

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.780 align:middle line:84%
were these a very advanced
group of geneticists that

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.350 align:middle line:90%
made us as a hybrid species?

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.910 align:middle line:10%
>> There are accounts like
this that have appeared--

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.310 align:middle line:10%
the former that I was referring
to actually in the Bible

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.720 align:middle line:10%
itself, but other sources
of ancient origins

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:29.060 align:middle line:10%
like that such as the tablets
that Zecharia was translating--

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.690 align:middle line:10%
that seemed to be
indicative of accounts

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.990 align:middle line:10%
of these other beings
interacting with us.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.750 align:middle line:10%


00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.140 align:middle line:10%
>> Walter Mattfield states
in his book "Eden's Serpent--

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.620 align:middle line:10%
Its Mesopotamian origins"
that the Garden of Eden

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.930 align:middle line:10%
belonged to the
Anunnaki, lending

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.250 align:middle line:10%
more credence to the serpent not
just being a biblical creature

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.693 align:middle line:10%
but a member of the Anunnaki.

00:05:55.693 --> 00:05:57.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Let's think of the serpent
in the Garden of Eden.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.500 align:middle line:84%
This is some type
of a reptilian type

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.610 align:middle line:84%
of being that we've been
taught to be afraid of.

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.340 align:middle line:90%
It's a wisdom bearer.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.290 align:middle line:84%
In the Gnostic Gospels,
they describe it

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.380 align:middle line:84%
as this bright snake,
this illuminated snake,

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.720 align:middle line:90%
taking on a humanoid form.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.810 align:middle line:84%
We have the winged serpents
that are described in the Bible,

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.740 align:middle line:84%
angels as winged serpents,
humanoid beings with serpentine

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:19.670 align:middle line:90%
faces.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.250 align:middle line:84%
They can spin their
bodies into whirlwinds

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.560 align:middle line:90%
and can change their form.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.660 align:middle line:84%
They can shape shift
right before your eyes.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.220 align:middle line:84%
These are clearly
another class of beings.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.980 align:middle line:84%
So I think what's
going to have to happen

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.563 align:middle line:84%
here is we're going
to have to broaden

00:06:32.563 --> 00:06:34.880 align:middle line:84%
our perspective on the
possibility of what

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:40.290 align:middle line:84%
other creatures could
actually look like or be like.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:44.550 align:middle line:84%
>> The Garden of Eden story also
appears in the Book of Ezekiel

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.400 align:middle line:84%
where over the course
of 12 different verses,

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.950 align:middle line:84%
there is mention of possible
extraterrestrial encounters.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.620 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the all time
great extraterrestrial craft

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:59.600 align:middle line:84%
references in the Bible
is Ezekiel 1:1-28.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.290 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel is one of these wise
men from the Temple of Solomon

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.500 align:middle line:90%
who's been deported to Babylon.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.630 align:middle line:84%
He's sitting by
the River Chebar.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:12.110 align:middle line:10%
And he describes, in his
own words, the heavens open.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.930 align:middle line:10%
The heavens open.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.440 align:middle line:10%
OK, this is a rip in the
fabric of space-time.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And he next describes something
absolutely phenomenal.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.430 align:middle line:84%
He says there's a cloud with
this brightness about it.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's flashing
like lightning.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:29.330 align:middle line:84%
>> He actually saw this
vessel not only to land,

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.030 align:middle line:84%
but he actually got inside of
it and he took off with it with

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.020 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.220 align:middle line:90%
He thought that it was God.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And they even said to
him, no, we're not God.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:37.640 align:middle line:84%
We're here to take
you somewhere to meet

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.760 align:middle line:90%
somebody very important.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.940 align:middle line:10%
So basically it was a very, very
good, recorded account of a UFO

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.307 align:middle line:10%
that landed and that
somebody got inside

00:07:46.307 --> 00:07:48.140 align:middle line:10%
of and took off and
went to another location

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:49.850 align:middle line:10%
to meet another being.

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:53.840 align:middle line:10%
And these beings, according
to the writings, were not God.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.790 align:middle line:10%
So it's very interesting
to know that there's

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:59.120 align:middle line:10%
a lot of talk about, not only
UFOs in the Bible, but even

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.790 align:middle line:10%
people taking off.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:05.180 align:middle line:84%
>> When examining the Old
Testament account of Ezekiel,

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.670 align:middle line:84%
perhaps one of the most
fascinating perspectives

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.940 align:middle line:84%
to consider comes from
Erich Von Daniken,

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.280 align:middle line:84%
author of "Chariots
of the Gods."

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:19.470 align:middle line:10%
>> My God, in my
opinion, in my dreams,

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:22.260 align:middle line:10%
does not need a vehicle
in which to move around.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:23.790 align:middle line:10%
God is omnipresent.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.710 align:middle line:10%
God is like the spirit.

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:27.720 align:middle line:90%
He is always there.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.750 align:middle line:84%
Now in the Bible,
the prophet Ezekiel

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.909 align:middle line:90%
describes a strange story.

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:middle line:84%
He says all of a sudden, he
heard a noise in the sky.

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:39.929 align:middle line:90%
All the slaves looked up there.

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:43.919 align:middle line:84%
Then he sees an object
coming down from the sky.

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Then he realizes that the
object makes a tremendous noise.

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:53.160 align:middle line:84%
He compares the noise with
the thundering of a waterfall.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Or he compares it
with fighting wagons.

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.440 align:middle line:84%
So a terrible noise
this object made.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.210 align:middle line:90%
All the slaves looking there.

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:01.330 align:middle line:90%
The object comes down.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.060 align:middle line:90%
The sand is blown up.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel is high
priest by profession.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.470 align:middle line:84%
So he believes in the
beginning, it must be God.

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:14.730 align:middle line:84%
He fells on his nose
to pray to the Lord.

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And then he realize
this is not God.

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And then he describes
exactly what he sees.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.870 align:middle line:90%
The wings move.

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:24.960 align:middle line:84%
When the wings move,
that the tremendous noise

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.620 align:middle line:90%
started to be there again.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.520 align:middle line:84%
When the wings stood still,
they were hanging down.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.930 align:middle line:90%
He describes the leg.

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:33.450 align:middle line:84%
He clearly sees the
legs were out of metal.

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:35.820 align:middle line:90%
Then he describes the wheel.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And the wheel
shocked him totally

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:42.090 align:middle line:84%
because the wheel of his times
can go forward and backward.

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:43.890 align:middle line:84%
But the wheel
which he sees here,

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:45.870 align:middle line:84%
they go also forward
and backward,

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:50.400 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time left and
right without making a steering

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.390 align:middle line:90%
movement.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:55.890 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel sees a wheel which
goes forward, backward, right,

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:59.670 align:middle line:84%
and left without making
a steering movement.

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:02.850 align:middle line:84%
This shocks him so he
cannot understand it.

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:04.950 align:middle line:90%
He describes it four times.

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:10.230 align:middle line:84%
Some 30 years ago, I
had a secret speech

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:13.220 align:middle line:84%
at the headquarter
at NASA in Huntsville

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:14.370 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:17.730 align:middle line:84%
On this speech, I also
talk about five minutes

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:19.350 align:middle line:90%
about Ezekiel.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And after the speech, we
had the dinner together.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:26.160 align:middle line:10%
And there was the
Chief of the Department

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.770 align:middle line:10%
of Construction, an ex-German.

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:31.020 align:middle line:10%
His name was Josef
Blumrich who came to me

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.760 align:middle line:10%
and said that was
very interesting.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.770 align:middle line:84%
But Mr. Von Daniken
in the Bible,

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.930 align:middle line:90%
we never found technology.

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:39.400 align:middle line:90%
The Bible this is imagination.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:44.490 align:middle line:84%
These are dreamings,
visions, but not technology.

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:47.250 align:middle line:84%
He started to read
Ezekiel and finally he

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:51.960 align:middle line:84%
realized that whatever
Ezekiel described is real.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And he started to reconstruct
Ezekiel's description.

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:59.490 align:middle line:10%
The outcome was a book with the
English title "The Spaceships

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:00.810 align:middle line:10%
of Ezekiel."

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And in the foreword of
it, Mr. Josef Blumrich,

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:06.280 align:middle line:84%
the ex-chief of the
construction department at NASA

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.900 align:middle line:84%
said, I absolutely
started this work

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:13.590 align:middle line:84%
to disprove Erich Von
Daniken's story of Ezekiel,

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:17.430 align:middle line:84%
but it was absolutely
sensational what comes out.

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel did saw
extraterrestrial spacecraft.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.140 align:middle line:84%
Now Ezekiel's spaceship is not
a mother spaceship with which

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.180 align:middle line:90%
you can move from star to star.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel's spaceship is only
an object which today we

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.480 align:middle line:90%
would call space shuttle.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.140 align:middle line:84%
You have to have a
mother spaceship.

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And from the mother
spaceship, a smaller vehicle

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.430 align:middle line:90%
comes down to the earth.

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:40.110 align:middle line:90%
So that's what it was.

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:42.730 align:middle line:90%
Now this is very important.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:45.600 align:middle line:90%
I knew the original Ezekiel.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:49.590 align:middle line:90%
I read it first in Hebrew.

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:51.570 align:middle line:84%
I did not learn
special Hebrew, but we

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:53.250 align:middle line:90%
had the Latin translation.

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And in the original
Ezekiel, the word "God"

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:59.100 align:middle line:90%
never appears, never.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:04.110 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel says it was "the
splendorness of the highest."

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:08.100 align:middle line:84%
The word God in the
Bible only comes in later

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.590 align:middle line:84%
by the translators
that translated.

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:13.378 align:middle line:84%
"The splendor of the
highest," he means God.

00:12:13.378 --> 00:12:15.420 align:middle line:84%
In the original, the word
God is never mentioned.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.430 align:middle line:84%
So he continues in
the Book of Ezekiel

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:20.610 align:middle line:84%
and he says that "the
splendorness of the highest

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:22.950 align:middle line:90%
arrived a second time.

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And this time, the hand of the
highest put him on the throne."

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:33.840 align:middle line:84%
In my view, he was sitting
in the co-pilot's chair.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And then he describes
how they started.

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:41.400 align:middle line:84%
He says, "And the hand of the
highest pressed upon my chest,"

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:45.270 align:middle line:84%
because he feels the
gravity when starting.

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:47.760 align:middle line:84%
He does not know
where the trip goes

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:52.440 align:middle line:84%
because he says they brought me
on a very, very high mountain.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.240 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't know where he is.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.620 align:middle line:90%
He looks down.

00:12:55.620 --> 00:13:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And he sees under him something
like a city, a small city

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.200 align:middle line:90%
or a big village.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And in the center of it,
something like a temple.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:08.010 align:middle line:84%
The splendorness of the
Lord comes to a standstill

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:09.120 align:middle line:90%
over the temple.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:14.790 align:middle line:10%
Slowly, slowly, he sinks
inside the so-called temple.

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:17.520 align:middle line:10%
And Ezekiel realized
at that moment

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:22.380 align:middle line:10%
that the noise of the wings were
at this time higher and louder

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:25.470 align:middle line:10%
than what he had heard before
in the desert, because now

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:29.730 align:middle line:10%
the echo comes back from the
walls of the so-called temple.

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:32.490 align:middle line:90%
Then it comes to a standstill.

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel gets out, gets
out of the space shuttle.

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And of a sudden,
a glittering being

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:40.290 align:middle line:84%
appears again, one
of the strangers.

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And he says to Ezekiel,
oh, humans, you humans, you

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:47.820 align:middle line:84%
have eyes to see
but you see nothing.

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And you have ears to hear,
but you hear nothing.

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And then that man
in glittering suit

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:56.070 align:middle line:84%
gives Ezekiel a
measuring device.

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And all the thing to
measure this whole building,

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.080 align:middle line:90%
the so-called temple.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.960 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel in the meantime
he understands that this

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.520 align:middle line:90%
has nothing to do with God.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.870 align:middle line:90%
So he has courage.

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:10.740 align:middle line:84%
He asked back to the
glittering man, why?

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.690 align:middle line:84%
Why should I
measure this temple?

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And the other one says that's
the reason why we brought you

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.100 align:middle line:90%
here, humans.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.730 align:middle line:84%
So Ezekiel starts to
measure length, and wide,

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:23.430 align:middle line:90%
and how many stairs, et cetera.

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:26.220 align:middle line:84%
All this you can
read in the Bible.

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:29.610 align:middle line:84%
All the measurements of
this so-called temple.

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:32.070 align:middle line:84%
Now in Germany we had
a German engineer,

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:34.890 align:middle line:90%
his name is Hans Herbert Beier.

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:38.340 align:middle line:10%
And he read these measurements
and he asked himself,

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:43.050 align:middle line:10%
is this a true building or is
it just imagination and fantasy?

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And he started to
calculate exactly according

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:47.640 align:middle line:90%
to Ezekiel's measurement.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And out comes a building which
looks today like a stadium,

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.410 align:middle line:90%
like a football stadium.

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And then this German
engineer came to me.

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:00.900 align:middle line:10%
And I saw his calculations,
absolutely precise.

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:04.800 align:middle line:10%
I asked him, have you ever
heard of NASA, of Mr. Blumrich's

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:05.850 align:middle line:10%
reconstruction?

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:09.840 align:middle line:84%
Because NASA did only
reconstruct the splendorness

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.030 align:middle line:84%
of the highest, which
means the shuttle,

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:14.940 align:middle line:84%
while the German engineer
was only reconstructing

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.470 align:middle line:90%
the so-called temple.

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:19.780 align:middle line:84%
So one have the splendors of
the highest and the temple.

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:22.560 align:middle line:84%
So I brought the two men
together-- the German engineer

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.210 align:middle line:90%
and the NASA engineer.

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And the space shuttle fit
perfectly into the temple

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:30.930 align:middle line:90%
by every centimeter.

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.780 align:middle line:84%
The so-called temple
was nothing else

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:37.890 align:middle line:84%
but the base station for the
extraterrestrial shuttle.

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:39.660 align:middle line:90%
It was not God.

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:43.830 align:middle line:84%
It was simply the space shuttle
of the extraterrestrials.

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>> That's God's throne
chariot, his celestial chariot.

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:51.040 align:middle line:84%
That's the terminology
they would use.

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:54.030 align:middle line:84%
But we today would say, well,
that's a spacecraft that

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:57.330 align:middle line:84%
just came out of a
stargate or a wormhole

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:00.570 align:middle line:84%
and is suddenly manifested
on the earth plane.

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:03.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's a dramatic
example of what

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.640 align:middle line:84%
we think of as an
extraterrestrial encounter

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:08.700 align:middle line:90%
in the Bible.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Not only do these
celestial-type beings appear

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.550 align:middle line:84%
in the Book of Ezekiel,
but they're also referenced

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:16.280 align:middle line:84%
in other passages
from the Bible.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.990 align:middle line:90%


00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:22.590 align:middle line:84%
If this ancient text is as
much a historical document

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:25.350 align:middle line:84%
as it is a religious
one, might these

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:28.075 align:middle line:84%
be clues of a deeper story
to our human history?

00:16:28.075 --> 00:16:31.960 align:middle line:90%


00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.970 align:middle line:84%
>> If you look into the
other account of Enoch,

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:37.900 align:middle line:84%
Enoch had a designated time
where he would get into a UFO

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.420 align:middle line:90%
to lift off with these beings.

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:43.900 align:middle line:10%
So much so that he even gave his
son the records, and the time,

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.570 align:middle line:10%
and the date, and everything
else that he would be leaving.

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:47.705 align:middle line:10%
And he took off.

00:16:47.705 --> 00:16:50.080 align:middle line:10%
And Enoch was a very, very
important person in the Bible.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.360 align:middle line:84%
He's mentioned in the
Bible several times,

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:54.497 align:middle line:84%
even though they
omitted his book.

00:16:54.497 --> 00:16:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why they omitted
his book from the Bible,

00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:58.510 align:middle line:84%
the Book of Enoch,
is because it talks

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:01.150 align:middle line:84%
about people coming from space
and interacting and engaging

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:01.950 align:middle line:90%
with mankind.

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:04.780 align:middle line:90%


00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:08.260 align:middle line:84%
>> If we consider that advanced
beings came with technologies

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.560 align:middle line:84%
from space and
engaged with mankind,

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:16.750 align:middle line:84%
might we see evidence of this
in the biblical book of Joshua?

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:18.819 align:middle line:84%
It is written that
the walls of Jericho

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:22.720 align:middle line:84%
fell after the Israelites
marched around the city blowing

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.250 align:middle line:90%
their trumpets.

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:27.400 align:middle line:84%
They were carrying with them
the Ark of the Covenant.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.090 align:middle line:84%
Some scholars suggest that
Moses and the Israelites

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:33.460 align:middle line:84%
acquired a supernatural
source of energy

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.820 align:middle line:84%
at Mount Sinai when they were
given the commandments that

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:40.210 align:middle line:84%
were later placed within
the Ark of the Covenant.

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Could the Ark have contained
an energy source so powerful

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:47.200 align:middle line:84%
that it could amplify
Joshua's horns and radiate

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.890 align:middle line:84%
enough sonic frequency to
bring down those walls?

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And if so, what
other examples show

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:54.940 align:middle line:90%
evidence of this power source?

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:57.940 align:middle line:90%


00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:00.400 align:middle line:84%
>> When we're talking about
possible extraterrestrial

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.280 align:middle line:84%
technology, of course, we
have to talk about the Ark

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.500 align:middle line:90%
of the Covenant.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:09.310 align:middle line:84%
A device that was transmitted,
the blueprint was transmitted,

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:14.050 align:middle line:84%
by God to an Israelite
craftsman, Bezaleel,

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:15.340 align:middle line:90%
who crafts this device.

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:17.320 align:middle line:10%
But before he
does, God gives him

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:21.250 align:middle line:10%
all the wisdom of the universe
to build a simple golden box?

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:22.060 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:26.230 align:middle line:84%
This is an extraordinary piece
of extraterrestrial technology.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:28.540 align:middle line:84%
In fact we're told
that there isn't just

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.690 align:middle line:84%
one Ark of the Covenant,
there's one on the Earth

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:34.570 align:middle line:84%
and there's one at
the throne of God.

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:36.580 align:middle line:90%
They must be connected.

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And what this opens up
is the possibilities

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:40.180 align:middle line:84%
that the Ark of the
Covenant is just

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:44.410 align:middle line:84%
not a simple container for
the tablets of the law,

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:46.480 align:middle line:84%
and the rod of Aaron,
and the flask of manna,

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.007 align:middle line:84%
and the cruise of anointing
oil, as we're told.

00:18:49.007 --> 00:18:50.590 align:middle line:84%
That, in fact, the
Ark of the Covenant

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:53.140 align:middle line:90%
is a far more profound device.

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:56.620 align:middle line:84%
That, in fact, it could, in
fact, be a portal device.

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:58.810 align:middle line:84%
This is based on the
eyewitness accounts of it

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:02.260 align:middle line:84%
in operation in the Holy of
Holies of Solomon's temple

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:06.220 align:middle line:84%
where eyewitnesses like
Isaiah report seeing luminous

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:08.680 align:middle line:84%
humanoid beings
suddenly manifested

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.240 align:middle line:84%
between the wings
of the cherubim

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.040 align:middle line:84%
guarding the Ark
of the Covenant.

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.770 align:middle line:84%
So it's a profound
technology that we're

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:19.060 align:middle line:84%
talking about with the
Ark of the Covenant.

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>> And in the Book of Samuel
it says everyone who came too

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:25.360 align:middle line:84%
close to the Ark of
the Covenant died.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And they described
how they died.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:30.010 align:middle line:10%
Their skin becomes pale.

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:34.000 align:middle line:10%
Their nails and fingers
and feet fell out.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.110 align:middle line:10%
They were blind, et cetera.

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:39.340 align:middle line:84%
So they were afraid of
the Ark of the Covenant.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And freely, by free will, they
brought it back to Israel.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:45.220 align:middle line:84%
The Israelites the
next morning saw

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:47.290 align:middle line:84%
that the Ark of the
Covenant were here again.

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:50.310 align:middle line:84%
With four horses, the
horses were already near,

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:52.750 align:middle line:84%
the children of
Israel were dancing

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:55.090 align:middle line:84%
around the Ark of the
Covenant praying to the Lord

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:57.430 align:middle line:84%
that the Ark of the
Covenant is back finally

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:59.170 align:middle line:90%
from the land of the enemy.

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And at that morning,
so says the Bible,

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:07.120 align:middle line:84%
72 of the Israelites
died, including children.

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.970 align:middle line:84%
What have these
children done wrong?

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:12.400 align:middle line:84%
The only thing they were
too close to the Ark

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.710 align:middle line:84%
of the Covenant, because
the Ark of the Covenant

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:18.010 align:middle line:90%
was absolutely dangerous.

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:21.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Humans had no business being
around the Ark of the Covenant.

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:25.120 align:middle line:84%
It was carried on ring posts,
for one thing for protection.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And those who did
carry it reported,

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:30.760 align:middle line:84%
what we today would readily
interpret as radiation affects,

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:34.190 align:middle line:84%
their hair, their
teeth fell out.

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:36.130 align:middle line:10%
Whole populations
of the Philistines

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:38.860 align:middle line:10%
were wiped out by
something emanating

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:40.810 align:middle line:10%
from the Ark of the
Covenant because

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:45.390 align:middle line:10%
of its radioactive qualities.

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Found in the Book of Exodus
is a bush engulfed in flames

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:55.050 align:middle line:84%
that does not singe or calcinate
and where God appears with

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:58.940 align:middle line:84%
a message for Moses
etched in stone.

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:00.980 align:middle line:84%
Could this be a
reference to visitors

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.750 align:middle line:90%
using advanced technology?

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:05.510 align:middle line:84%
>> If you look at
the story of Moses,

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:08.840 align:middle line:84%
he supposedly climbed the
mountain and he then met with

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.720 align:middle line:84%
the Lord who was represented
as a burning bush.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.923 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very
easy nowadays for us

00:21:13.923 --> 00:21:15.590 align:middle line:84%
to understand that
that burning bush may

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:17.270 align:middle line:84%
have been some
type of technology

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:20.750 align:middle line:84%
that he just didn't have
the vocabulary to explain.

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And during this
interaction with him

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:25.160 align:middle line:84%
and this quote
unquote "deity," he

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.170 align:middle line:84%
was then given the
Ten Commandments,

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:28.675 align:middle line:90%
which were etched into stone.

00:21:28.675 --> 00:21:30.050 align:middle line:84%
The only thing
that could do that

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:31.760 align:middle line:90%
nowadays would be technology.

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.218 align:middle line:84%
We have laser
etching technology.

00:21:33.218 --> 00:21:34.760 align:middle line:84%
We have different
types of technology

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.650 align:middle line:84%
that can literally
etch into stone.

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:38.660 align:middle line:10%
So I think that this
may be a representation

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.410 align:middle line:10%
of some type of
technology that etched

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:42.080 align:middle line:10%
these commandments into stone.

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And these commandments
themselves

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:45.920 align:middle line:84%
were given out many
thousands of years earlier

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.510 align:middle line:84%
in the Egyptian
Book of the Dead,

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:50.000 align:middle line:84%
which then made their way
into the story of Moses, which

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.880 align:middle line:84%
is just a reduced version of
the 42 laws of Ma'at, which

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.710 align:middle line:84%
may have been something
much easier for him

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:56.600 align:middle line:84%
to bring down to
the people and get

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.630 align:middle line:90%
them to obey and understand.

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:02.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Throughout the Bible,
we hear all these stories.

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:07.040 align:middle line:10%
Isaiah has one about
beings on clouds.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.120 align:middle line:90%
What is the cloud?

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.610 align:middle line:84%
Well the cloud is a
method of transportation

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:12.380 align:middle line:90%
used by these beings.

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:15.080 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps, again, it's a language
thing where people are looking

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.570 align:middle line:84%
and saying, oh, this being
is riding upon a cloud

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:19.070 align:middle line:84%
but it's actually
maybe some kind

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:22.910 align:middle line:84%
of a merkabah throne chariot
or an actual technological

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:24.660 align:middle line:90%
spacecraft.

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.190 align:middle line:90%
That's very interesting.

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:29.270 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in the Book of Acts,
there's another reference

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:32.990 align:middle line:84%
to this where two angels dressed
in white are walking over

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:36.110 align:middle line:84%
and these men of Galilee just
after the ascension of Jesus

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:38.520 align:middle line:90%
are looking up.

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.240 align:middle line:84%
The angels say to the men of
Galilee, why do you look up?

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Jesus will return
to you on a cloud

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:47.660 align:middle line:84%
exactly the same
way that he left.

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And so it's clear that the
cloud is not a puffy white thing

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:52.490 align:middle line:90%
that we see in our atmosphere.

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:55.280 align:middle line:84%
The cloud is some kind
of method of conveyance

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.178 align:middle line:90%
between Earth and the heavens.

00:22:57.178 --> 00:22:59.720 align:middle line:84%
So when you're in the Bible and
you're seeing a reference to,

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.790 align:middle line:84%
oh, I saw a being
riding on a cloud,

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:04.130 align:middle line:84%
we know that's a reference
to some form of a craft.

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:07.520 align:middle line:90%


00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>> In the United States, the
Pentagon has publicly confirmed

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:15.020 align:middle line:84%
that recent videos of
unidentified aerial phenomena

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:19.350 align:middle line:84%
were authentic and admitted they
don't know how the technology

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:20.150 align:middle line:90%
worked.

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:22.790 align:middle line:90%


00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:24.830 align:middle line:84%
Even the Vatican
has put resources

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:29.960 align:middle line:84%
into the discovery of potential
extraterrestrial life.

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.510 align:middle line:84%
>> The Vatican has been very
interested in extraterrestrial

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:33.900 align:middle line:90%
life for a long time.

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:35.450 align:middle line:84%
They invested
millions of dollars

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:38.360 align:middle line:84%
into an observatory in
Arizona, of all places,

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:41.660 align:middle line:84%
looking for extraterrestrial
life in our universe.

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:46.040 align:middle line:10%
>> A father, Gabriel Funes who
was the director of the Vatican

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.710 align:middle line:10%
Observatory at the
time who said that just

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:52.940 align:middle line:10%
as there's a multiplicity
of creatures on the earth,

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:56.100 align:middle line:10%
why can't there be a
multiplicity of creatures out

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:56.900 align:middle line:10%
in the cosmos?

00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:00.110 align:middle line:84%
That God created other
intelligent beings.

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:05.180 align:middle line:84%
Who are we to limit
God's creativity?

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Because of my having been
Chief Counsel of the Jesuit

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:11.360 align:middle line:84%
National Headquarters in their
National Social Ministry Office

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:16.130 align:middle line:84%
for 10 years in Washington, DC,
I had access to Father Funes.

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:18.680 align:middle line:84%
So I reached out
to him right away

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.780 align:middle line:84%
and actually went to
visit him, and sat down,

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:23.060 align:middle line:84%
and had this face to face
conversation with him.

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:25.760 align:middle line:10%
And in less than
three minutes, he

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:29.450 align:middle line:10%
was acknowledging that what
he was really talking about

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:33.920 align:middle line:10%
was not just microscopic life
elsewhere, or even little

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:36.140 align:middle line:10%
insects or anything
on some other planet,

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:40.250 align:middle line:10%
he was talking about another
highly intelligent, highly

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:44.090 align:middle line:10%
technologically developed,
but categorically

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:51.410 align:middle line:10%
non-human species
elsewhere in our galaxy.

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And that was
extraordinarily important.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:58.430 align:middle line:84%
The implications are that
implied teachings of not

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:03.290 align:middle line:84%
only the Church, but virtually
every human institution

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:06.350 align:middle line:84%
down through the
ages have all been

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:09.740 align:middle line:84%
rooted in the kind of
unconscious premise

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:13.730 align:middle line:84%
that our human
species is at the apex

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:19.850 align:middle line:84%
of all evolved, sentient
evolution in the universe.

00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And for us to discover
that isn't true,

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:31.280 align:middle line:84%
dethrones us from the
apex of the pyramid

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.530 align:middle line:90%
of life in the universe.

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:37.190 align:middle line:84%
Pope Francis, when
he was confronted

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:40.520 align:middle line:84%
with this question about what
the beliefs of the Church

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:42.230 align:middle line:84%
were with regard
to the existence

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:44.660 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial
beings, saying that,

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:47.120 align:middle line:84%
well, he would see
no problem at all

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:51.920 align:middle line:84%
in baptizing our brethren
from an extraterrestrial

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:58.790 align:middle line:84%
civilization, because all life
forms are children of God.

00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:04.010 align:middle line:84%
The, I guess, inertia of
the institutional church

00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:08.660 align:middle line:84%
is causing them to think that
the people are a lot more

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:12.060 align:middle line:84%
ignorant and dumber
than they really are.

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And so when you say
something like the pope

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:18.748 align:middle line:84%
would be willing to
baptize, well, then you

00:26:18.748 --> 00:26:21.290 align:middle line:84%
say, well, what makes you think
that they want to be baptized

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:22.560 align:middle line:90%
by the Catholic church?

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:23.360 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:26.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's like
we go down we find

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:29.450 align:middle line:90%
a whole tribe of chimpanzees.

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And they're talking about
being willing to train us

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:33.390 align:middle line:90%
on how to eat a banana.

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:34.190 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:39.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean you've got to get
on to a higher level.

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.510 align:middle line:84%
>> While the discovery of
advanced intelligent life

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:45.780 align:middle line:84%
elsewhere in the universe
may seem like a contradiction

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:49.170 align:middle line:84%
to conventional
religious doctrine,

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:53.130 align:middle line:84%
what might the implications be
if the highest representatives

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:56.730 align:middle line:84%
of the Church and other
religious institutions

00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:59.520 align:middle line:84%
acknowledge extraterrestrials
in the Bible?

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:03.160 align:middle line:90%


00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:07.150 align:middle line:10%
>> So what are the implications
of ET interaction in the Bible

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:08.570 align:middle line:10%
for us today?

00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:12.580 align:middle line:10%
I think what it tells us is
that, one, extraterrestrials

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:14.210 align:middle line:10%
have been here for
a very long time

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:18.940 align:middle line:10%
and have a definite interest
in the evolution of humanity.

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:20.170 align:middle line:90%
What is the purpose?

00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:22.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, ultimately
in these stories,

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:26.200 align:middle line:84%
it's about showing
humanity how to become

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.420 align:middle line:90%
better versions of ourselves.

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:31.690 align:middle line:84%
That we can actually
become like the gods.

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:33.880 align:middle line:10%
That through our interaction
with these beings,

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:36.670 align:middle line:10%
we, too, can ascend
to the heavens,

00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:39.010 align:middle line:10%
whether that means
in a spiritual form

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:41.560 align:middle line:10%
or traveling in the stars
in some form of a craft

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:43.180 align:middle line:10%
or through a stargate.

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:45.160 align:middle line:84%
Either way, these
beings have been here.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And most of these
stories where we're

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:49.840 align:middle line:84%
talking about an interaction
with extraterrestrials

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:54.040 align:middle line:84%
involved humans somehow
going into the stars,

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:58.810 align:middle line:84%
going to other places, and
sometimes even returning.

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:01.630 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that when you
look at some of the accounts

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:04.570 align:middle line:84%
of ancient craft and UFOs and
maybe even potentially aliens

00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:07.630 align:middle line:84%
in the modern-day Bible, you
look forward to a future where

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:09.580 align:middle line:84%
we're moving in the
direction of the ancients.

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:10.955 align:middle line:84%
We're moving in
a direction where

00:28:10.955 --> 00:28:12.730 align:middle line:84%
we are now obtaining
technologies

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:15.465 align:middle line:90%
that make us look godlike.

00:28:15.465 --> 00:28:16.840 align:middle line:84%
I believe that
right now, the way

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:18.220 align:middle line:84%
we're moving forward
in technology,

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:20.012 align:middle line:84%
it's going to allow
human beings to operate

00:28:20.012 --> 00:28:21.370 align:middle line:90%
on a telepathic level.

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:24.580 align:middle line:84%
We can share information
wirelessly, like Wi-Fi devices.

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And I also do believe that our
space frame technology is going

00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:29.590 align:middle line:84%
to give us the ability to
do things like beam people

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:31.160 align:middle line:90%
from one place to another.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.880 align:middle line:84%
We are already working
on beaming things

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:36.280 align:middle line:84%
through the teleportation
devices in laboratories

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.372 align:middle line:90%
on Earth right now.

00:28:37.372 --> 00:28:38.830 align:middle line:10%
So the future is
going to look much

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:41.320 align:middle line:10%
like the things being described
in the modern-day Bible,

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:44.800 align:middle line:10%
except we'll know that it's
really advanced technology.

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:46.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Everything is
going to change.

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:48.610 align:middle line:90%
Everything is going to change.

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:52.750 align:middle line:84%
The interpretation of all
information on our planet

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:53.960 align:middle line:90%
is going to change.

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:57.305 align:middle line:10%
We're going to be in a
completely new paradigm.

00:28:57.305 --> 00:28:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And so that we're
going to have to view

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:04.900 align:middle line:84%
these reports in biblical
times of encounters with beings

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:11.710 align:middle line:84%
from some other dimension, some
other spiritual plane, vehicles

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:16.180 align:middle line:84%
or encounters like in
Ezekiel of this whirling

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:19.420 align:middle line:84%
light ship of some sort,
all of these things

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:23.290 align:middle line:84%
are going to have to be
reinterpreted in light of this.

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:26.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Many of our modern day
Abrahamic religions are now

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:29.260 align:middle line:84%
being re-examined and their
doctrines reshaped based

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:32.350 align:middle line:84%
on the idea that we're
not alone in the universe.

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:35.110 align:middle line:10%
There's a new type of
spirituality emerging,

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:39.700 align:middle line:10%
because the old ways are not
as relevant as they once were.

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:41.680 align:middle line:84%
More than half of
American adults

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.470 align:middle line:84%
and 75% of young
Americans believe

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:48.340 align:middle line:84%
we've had contact with some sort
of intelligent extraterrestrial

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:49.240 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:54.040 align:middle line:84%
This level of belief rivals
that even of a belief in God.

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:57.010 align:middle line:84%
But one day we might
discover that the Bible

00:29:57.010 --> 00:29:59.800 align:middle line:84%
is one of the greatest
extraterrestrial contact

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:03.140 align:middle line:90%
documents ever written.

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:06.200 align:middle line:84%
>> As we conclude Season
3 of "Deep Space,"

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.030 align:middle line:90%
consider the following--

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:10.630 align:middle line:84%
if a distant race
of ancient aliens

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:13.180 align:middle line:84%
once inhabited the
lands of the Bible,

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:16.750 align:middle line:84%
and these were real-life
events and not merely visions,

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:21.400 align:middle line:84%
then a new paradigm awaits us
where science, spirituality,

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:25.990 align:middle line:84%
and open contact is the next
scripture about to be written.
