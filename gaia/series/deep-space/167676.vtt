00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.030 align:middle line:10%
>> Many major corporations
are investing millions,

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.210 align:middle line:10%
perhaps even billions, of
dollars into researching

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.690 align:middle line:10%
artificial intelligence
and transhumanism.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.710 align:middle line:10%
Companies like Google,
Siri, and even SpaceX

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.200 align:middle line:10%
are realizing that the
successful conquering

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.540 align:middle line:10%
of artificial
intelligence will not only

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.170 align:middle line:10%
make them rich and powerful,
but this technology also

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.500 align:middle line:10%
threatens to change
human behavior forever.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.560 align:middle line:10%
One of the most famous of the
scientists looking into AI

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.010 align:middle line:10%
is Google's Head of Technology
Research, Ray Kurzweil.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.400 align:middle line:10%
>> By 2029, we'll have reverse
engineered, and modeled,

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.410 align:middle line:10%
and simulated all the
regions of the brain.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And that will provide
us the software

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.840 align:middle line:84%
algorithmic methods to simulate
all of the human brain's

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.940 align:middle line:84%
capabilities, including
our emotional intelligence.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.730 align:middle line:10%
>> I've been a big fan of
Kurzweil for many years.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.360 align:middle line:10%
In fact, when I read "The
Age of Spiritual Machines"--

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.110 align:middle line:10%
he published that in 1999.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.730 align:middle line:84%
I think I read it in '01-ish or
so, and it was a big influence

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.142 align:middle line:90%
on me and my thinking.

00:01:22.142 --> 00:01:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And ever since, I've
tried to incorporate

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.880 align:middle line:84%
an understanding of AI into
my general understanding

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.080 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.147 align:middle line:90%
Singularity I think will happen.

00:01:32.147 --> 00:01:34.230 align:middle line:84%
I think the argument for
it is very strong indeed.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.560 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to look
at a future in which,

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.950 align:middle line:84%
in important ways, computing
intelligence will truly

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.530 align:middle line:84%
exceed our own, not
just in chess, and not

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.250 align:middle line:84%
just in air traffic control, but
in actual thinking, cognition,

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.330 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.900 align:middle line:10%
I think that will happen,
where computer algorithms will

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.940 align:middle line:10%
be able to make
their own decisions

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.240 align:middle line:10%
and truly have some
sort of consciousness,

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.860 align:middle line:10%
however we understand that.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.600 align:middle line:90%
Consciousness can't be the same.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.600 align:middle line:90%
Is a dolphin conscious?

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.340 align:middle line:90%
Sure, it is.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.150 align:middle line:90%
Is it like our own?

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.290 align:middle line:90%
No, there's differences.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.298 align:middle line:84%
So would advanced
computer intelligence

00:02:06.298 --> 00:02:07.590 align:middle line:90%
have our type of consciousness?

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.630 align:middle line:90%
Clearly not.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.380 align:middle line:84%
It'll have a different
kind of conscience.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.350 align:middle line:84%
But I think we're going to
see a point in our lifetime

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.970 align:middle line:90%
where it will happen.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.530 align:middle line:90%
As to when, I don't know.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't think AI
people really know.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.250 align:middle line:84%
Kurzweil, I think
maybe he's predicting

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.660 align:middle line:90%
2030, something like that.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
his timeline is.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.890 align:middle line:84%
There are AI people,
very serious ones,

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.990 align:middle line:90%
who put it farther out.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Others who say it's going
to happen very suddenly

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.520 align:middle line:84%
and catch us
completely off-guard.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.130 align:middle line:90%
And I really don't know.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.340 align:middle line:10%
>> Dr. Ray Kurzweil envisions
a day when you will go

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.540 align:middle line:10%
to an electronic store, and you
will have the lens of your eye

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.780 align:middle line:10%
removed, and it will be replaced
with a liquid that's packed

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.330 align:middle line:10%
with electronics, and
a camera, and a radio.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.483 align:middle line:84%
And you will be given
then super vision.

00:02:50.483 --> 00:02:51.900 align:middle line:84%
You'll be able to
see in the dark.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.550 align:middle line:90%
You'll have infrared vision.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be able to be
wired to the internet 24/7.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, with this super
vision comes supervision,

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.680 align:middle line:90%
and that's the problem.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens, we're
talking about a different form

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:06.590 align:middle line:90%
of human.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.240 align:middle line:84%
They refer to these as
humanity 2.0 or transhumans.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.790 align:middle line:84%
And what people don't realize
is that the singularity

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.670 align:middle line:84%
and the skingularity-- when
this technology is enmeshed with

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:18.570 align:middle line:90%
our body--

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.640 align:middle line:84%
are not only running
parallel, they're

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.165 align:middle line:90%
actually the same thing.

00:03:23.165 --> 00:03:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And the only way
humans are going

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.810 align:middle line:84%
to be able to survive in the
new artificial intelligence

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.760 align:middle line:84%
environment of
the singularity is

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.350 align:middle line:90%
if we ourselves become machines.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.670 align:middle line:84%
>> What I think we can say
is that we're seeing a lot

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:42.120 align:middle line:84%
of technologies coalescing to
cause a speeding up of this

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.750 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.600 align:middle line:84%
So I am very
sympathetic to the idea

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.680 align:middle line:84%
that this is going to happen
very suddenly, without warning.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.005 align:middle line:84%
We will probably be
caught off-guard by it.

00:03:52.005 --> 00:03:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting to
talk about the phrase

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.120 align:middle line:90%
singularity in this context.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.730 align:middle line:84%
So AI people call
this the singularity

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.450 align:middle line:90%
for a very definite reason.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.850 align:middle line:84%
They liken it to the
physics of a black hole.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.650 align:middle line:84%
At the center of
a black hole, you

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.360 align:middle line:84%
have the singularity,
essentially

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.570 align:middle line:84%
a point of virtual
infinite density

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.820 align:middle line:84%
and infinite
gravitational power.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And in that type
of crazy physics,

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.769 align:middle line:84%
all of the physics that we
have don't seem to apply.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.760 align:middle line:10%
We don't know how to predict
things at the singularity.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.760 align:middle line:10%
And this is what AI
theorists are saying.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.910 align:middle line:10%
When computing intelligence
exceeds our own,

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.980 align:middle line:10%
we human beings will
not have the ability

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.580 align:middle line:10%
to predict the trajectory
of our civilization.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.160 align:middle line:10%
We're basically going to be
losing control over this car

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.570 align:middle line:10%
that we think we're driving.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And now the dominant
intelligence will be beyond us.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And what will that
dominant intelligence do?

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Will it merge with us, as
Kurzweil thinks, a combination

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.520 align:middle line:84%
of human-machine
hybrid intelligence,

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.330 align:middle line:84%
where we'll be some
freakish bunch of creatures

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.240 align:middle line:84%
living for 500 years
and IQs of 1,000,

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.950 align:middle line:90%
totally unlike what we are?

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.980 align:middle line:84%
Or will the computers
think, humanity?

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.430 align:middle line:84%
Let's pull a
"Terminator" on them.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.580 align:middle line:90%
We have no idea.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.380 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.010 align:middle line:84%
Or will they be our willing
slaves and make our world

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.450 align:middle line:90%
a paradise?

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.630 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.880 align:middle line:90%
That's why it's a singularity.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.670 align:middle line:84%
We can't really
predict any of this.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.440 align:middle line:10%
AI people are some of the
most darkly optimistic,

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.350 align:middle line:10%
crazy optimist people
on this planet.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.078 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand these people.

00:05:25.078 --> 00:05:26.370 align:middle line:90%
Everything's going to be great.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.562 align:middle line:90%
AI is wonderful.

00:05:27.562 --> 00:05:29.520 align:middle line:84%
Let's just bring in all
the advanced computing,

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.040 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to make
world a wonderful place.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.530 align:middle line:84%
We're going to live
forever, and the machines

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.720 align:middle line:90%
will do all the work for us.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, OK, that's
a lot of optimism

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.320 align:middle line:84%
in our social, political,
economic structure, for one.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.890 align:middle line:10%
What we've developed
with the robopocalypse,

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.170 align:middle line:10%
as many people are now calling
this massive global automation

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.170 align:middle line:10%
work, we're seeing it now.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.020 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing a scooping out of
what was once the middle class,

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.840 align:middle line:90%
working class.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:56.640 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.550 align:middle line:84%
So we have an
entire, massive class

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.860 align:middle line:84%
of people, not just in the
US, not just in Canada,

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.590 align:middle line:84%
but worldwide, who no
longer are employable.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:06.970 align:middle line:90%
These people can't get jobs.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:07.770 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:08.880 align:middle line:84%
So in the old
days, we would have

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.220 align:middle line:84%
the owners and the managers
at the top of our pyramid.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And underneath, 98%
would be the worker bees,

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.900 align:middle line:84%
making everything happen so
that the people at the top

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:17.700 align:middle line:90%
could benefit.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.160 align:middle line:90%
Now cut the worker bees in half.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.740 align:middle line:90%
The bottom half are expendables.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.800 align:middle line:84%
They don't have skills anymore
for this modern economy.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.370 align:middle line:84%
They're never
going to get a job.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:28.170 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.290 align:middle line:84%
So what will happen
to these people?

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And that class will
get higher and higher.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.870 align:middle line:84%
So the AI people are
talking about things

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.670 align:middle line:90%
like universal basic income.

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:40.670 align:middle line:90%
This is their panacea.

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:43.200 align:middle line:84%
It's economically
never going to happen.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.490 align:middle line:90%
Totally impossible.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And if it were to
happen, it would

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.730 align:middle line:84%
be worse because
it would basically

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.813 align:middle line:84%
mean you get your income
from the government.

00:06:49.813 --> 00:06:51.480 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you right
now, you are totally

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.550 align:middle line:90%
controlled by that government.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.950 align:middle line:84%
Say goodbye to any
last vestige of freedom

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.360 align:middle line:90%
that you ever thought you had.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.760 align:middle line:84%
So thanks, AI
guys, for promoting

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.930 align:middle line:90%
universal basic income.

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.290 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is
they rightly can't

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.920 align:middle line:90%
see any other option here.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:06.720 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Because what's happening is that
the automation that is upon us.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.070 align:middle line:90%
No one can stop this.

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:15.310 align:middle line:90%
No one can stop this.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.110 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Bill Joy 20 years ago
with Sun Microsystems

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:19.890 align:middle line:90%
brought on the alarms.

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Now we have Elon musk saying
basically the same thing.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.270 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to
stop it, all right?

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.403 align:middle line:84%
This train, there's a track,
and it's going down this way.

00:07:27.403 --> 00:07:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing that's going
to stop that train from getting

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:33.000 align:middle line:84%
to the end of it, wherever
that destination is.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.420 align:middle line:84%
So what that track is taking
us to is a world where people

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:41.080 align:middle line:84%
are no longer going to be
necessary for the economics

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.400 align:middle line:84%
of society, or at
least many people.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.483 align:middle line:84%
And what will be done
with all of those people,

00:07:47.483 --> 00:07:48.900 align:middle line:84%
the ones that Henry
Kissinger once

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:53.333 align:middle line:84%
referred to as "useless
eaters," is anyone's guess.

00:07:53.333 --> 00:07:54.750 align:middle line:84%
You've got a lot
of people getting

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:56.630 align:middle line:90%
a little concerned about this.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.260 align:middle line:90%
Will they try to wipe us out?

00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:59.870 align:middle line:84%
Will they put us
into the FEMA camps?

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:03.270 align:middle line:84%
Will they simply
have us zoning out

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:05.790 align:middle line:84%
with minimal welfare on
video games and drugs,

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:10.710 align:middle line:84%
legal and illegal, getting fat,
getting dumb, and just watching

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:13.600 align:middle line:84%
reruns of "Three's Company"
for the rest of all time?

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.850 align:middle line:90%
Your guess is as good as mine.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:17.160 align:middle line:84%
I think that's probably
where we're going--

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.660 align:middle line:84%
a world in which the population
is being totally controlled

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.660 align:middle line:90%
because they have to be.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:25.158 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise, you
have a restless population

00:08:25.158 --> 00:08:26.700 align:middle line:84%
that, God forbid,
they start thinking

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.900 align:middle line:84%
for themselves, which
is what they're going

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.600 align:middle line:90%
to do if you give them tools.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.669 align:middle line:84%
So you have to dumb down
the education system.

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:35.700 align:middle line:84%
You have to dumb
down food, give them

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:39.659 align:middle line:84%
awful nutrition, awful
entertainment, awful news,

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:41.820 align:middle line:84%
and create, basically, a
virtually fake society,

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:45.390 align:middle line:84%
fake world that they're
living in that keeps them just

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:48.180 align:middle line:84%
happy enough to keep going
into this awful dystopia

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.400 align:middle line:84%
that they're moving
toward, and certainly

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.605 align:middle line:84%
dumb enough to keep moving
along and accepting all this.

00:08:54.605 --> 00:08:56.970 align:middle line:84%
Because that's really
where we're going.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Now the thing about this is
is that this is a fulfillment

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.020 align:middle line:84%
of the Christian prophecy
of the second coming.

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:06.150 align:middle line:84%
>> All of these wonderful
optimists who talk about

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:09.633 align:middle line:84%
transhumanism,
creating superhumans,

00:09:09.633 --> 00:09:12.300 align:middle line:84%
do they honestly think that this
is going to be a future for all

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.700 align:middle line:84%
7.5 billion of us
on planet Earth?

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.152 align:middle line:90%
Seriously?

00:09:16.152 --> 00:09:17.610 align:middle line:84%
If they actually
believe that, they

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:19.920 align:middle line:84%
need to read some good
books on political economy,

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.650 align:middle line:84%
and history, and
maybe psychology,

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.760 align:middle line:84%
and understand just
what the human race is.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:25.560 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:30.150 align:middle line:84%
The human race is a small group
of rapacious, dominating people

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:34.650 align:middle line:84%
at the top who will never
ever voluntarily give up

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:35.600 align:middle line:90%
that privilege.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.810 align:middle line:90%
Never going to happen.

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:41.365 align:middle line:84%
So if anyone is so
naive as to think that,

00:09:41.365 --> 00:09:42.740 align:middle line:84%
oh, yes, all of
humanity is going

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.990 align:middle line:84%
to benefit from
this immortality,

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:47.750 align:middle line:84%
from this super genius, and even
if that's a good thing, which

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:50.343 align:middle line:90%
probably isn't, right?

00:09:50.343 --> 00:09:52.760 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the most clear and
present threats that is posed

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.730 align:middle line:10%
to us for an AI takeover
comes in the form of quantum

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:56.690 align:middle line:10%
computing.

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:58.850 align:middle line:10%
And quantum computing
is a massive leap

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:02.900 align:middle line:10%
forward in processing power than
what we have in computing now.

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.520 align:middle line:84%
Current computing
is down with the use

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.820 align:middle line:84%
of a single digital system
where it's either on or off,

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:12.380 align:middle line:84%
and it can only process those
instructions one at a time.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.120 align:middle line:84%
Once you get into
quantum computing,

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.190 align:middle line:84%
you're now using the
power of a photon

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:middle line:84%
to be a switch that's
either on or off.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.620 align:middle line:84%
But you're using
wave particle duality

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.950 align:middle line:84%
in which you have multiple
wave states superimposed inside

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:27.600 align:middle line:90%
of the photon at the same time.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's called
quantum superposition.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.390 align:middle line:10%
A photon can carry myriad
multiple wavelengths

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:34.550 align:middle line:10%
all at the same
time, and therefore,

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:37.190 align:middle line:10%
in a quantum computer,
like the D-Wave System,

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.770 align:middle line:10%
you have these little cells
that they call qubits.

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.650 align:middle line:10%
And these little cells capture
the wave particle duality

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:45.110 align:middle line:10%
of the photon, thus
creating potentially

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:49.070 align:middle line:10%
many, many thousands of parallel
sets of instructions processing

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:50.400 align:middle line:10%
simultaneously.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So if these
people get their way,

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.317 align:middle line:84%
and there's every indication
that they think they will get

00:10:54.317 --> 00:10:57.250 align:middle line:84%
their way, they will go
beyond Hitler's wildest dream

00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:00.680 align:middle line:84%
in the creation of a kind of
transhumanist biological caste

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.250 align:middle line:84%
system in which you
have, increasingly,

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:08.450 align:middle line:84%
a genetic disparity between
those people at the top,

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:12.230 align:middle line:84%
who will have the ability
to afford smarter children,

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:14.810 align:middle line:84%
stronger children, children
with better immune systems,

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:17.480 align:middle line:84%
genetically modified
human beings, and those,

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:20.390 align:middle line:84%
the rest of us, who
maybe can't afford that.

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And as time goes
by, I can envision

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:27.980 align:middle line:84%
this real nightmare in
which we see a splitting off

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:28.850 align:middle line:90%
of humanity.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:31.730 align:middle line:84%
Look, they've already mastered
CRISPR technology and gene

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:35.570 align:middle line:84%
editing in a way that even 10
years ago, we couldn't even

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:36.757 align:middle line:90%
imagine.

00:11:36.757 --> 00:11:39.090 align:middle line:84%
This is all happening, and
it's all happening very fast.

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And our ethics have
certainly not kept pace.

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:43.010 align:middle line:90%
They never do.

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And our ideology and
thinking has not kept pace,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.360 align:middle line:90%
because that never does either.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.800 align:middle line:84%
So this is all racing far ahead
of our ability to control.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.890 align:middle line:84%
We really need, as
a society, to start

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:59.030 align:middle line:84%
having intelligent conversations
about the implications of this,

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:02.960 align:middle line:84%
and whether or not we can
get some control over this.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.095 align:middle line:90%
It's very important.

00:12:04.095 --> 00:12:09.330 align:middle line:90%


00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>> This AI is a huge problem
all over the universe.

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:14.730 align:middle line:84%
It uses photons to
travel, and it's

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:19.050 align:middle line:84%
trying to create a man-machine
interface, a singularity.

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:22.320 align:middle line:10%
At which time, it will either
use those people for a while,

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.780 align:middle line:10%
like we've heard it's done
with the Draco reptilians

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.400 align:middle line:10%
and many other species.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.210 align:middle line:84%
But even those people are
only pawns in its game

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:30.900 align:middle line:84%
and will only be
used for so long

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:32.700 align:middle line:90%
before they too are destroyed.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.200 align:middle line:84%
There's speculation that
right now in our sector,

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.200 align:middle line:84%
the Draco are the ones
that are being controlled

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.900 align:middle line:84%
by the AI the most,
and are being used

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.960 align:middle line:84%
by it to go and invade as many
planets as possible to try

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.540 align:middle line:84%
and get them to develop
advanced technology, which leads

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.570 align:middle line:84%
to, well, we need better
and better technology,

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:50.670 align:middle line:84%
we need a new smartphone
every six months.

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.358 align:middle line:90%
What are we going to do now?

00:12:52.358 --> 00:12:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Forget about folding
in this kind of thing.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:55.620 align:middle line:90%
You want to have it in here.

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.290 align:middle line:84%
You want to have it online
so you can get information.

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:00.120 align:middle line:84%
Now all of a sudden,
people's intelligence

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.090 align:middle line:84%
goes way up because you
can do cloud computing.

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:05.130 align:middle line:90%
Your mind now goes much faster.

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:06.840 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
the AI apparently

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.750 align:middle line:84%
does with humans like us
is it creates a system

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:12.780 align:middle line:84%
in which micro voltage
fluctuates on your face

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:14.490 align:middle line:90%
and becomes like broadband.

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:16.380 align:middle line:84%
So two beings can
look at each other

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.390 align:middle line:84%
and use these
voltage fluctuations

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:22.080 align:middle line:84%
to communicate using their
face like a Wi-Fi system.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And that speed of
communication is so fast

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.640 align:middle line:84%
that when you try to talk
to someone like us who

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:30.900 align:middle line:84%
uses verbal language, it
would be intolerably slow.

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.060 align:middle line:90%
So your IQ could go way up.

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:36.450 align:middle line:84%
You'd become basically
indestructible and bulletproof.

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And the AI and the
machines would allow you

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:40.710 align:middle line:90%
to jump 30 or 40 feet or more.

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:42.270 align:middle line:90%
You can run really fast.

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:44.670 align:middle line:84%
You could even fly if they
have the anti-gravity.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.100 align:middle line:84%
So you would appear at first
to be like a superhero.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And some of what we're hearing
is setting us up for that,

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.300 align:middle line:90%
like in the movie "Iron Man."

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:54.090 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, they already have
suits that can do this stuff.

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:55.740 align:middle line:90%
They're called exosuits.

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:59.000 align:middle line:84%
That's just another stepping
stone to this great singularity

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.960 align:middle line:84%
where now we have
telescopic vision,

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.820 align:middle line:90%
we have telepathic ability.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.860 align:middle line:84%
All of those things
seem to be great.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.410 align:middle line:84%
We could have a cloud
holographic matrix reality

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:09.960 align:middle line:84%
that we can live in where
it's like we've ascended,

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.260 align:middle line:90%
but it's all a trap.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And we have been warned
about this trap from the ETs.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.130 align:middle line:84%
The AI's trying to do
it in our solar system,

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:18.570 align:middle line:90%
but it's almost out of time.

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:20.760 align:middle line:84%
It's theorized that
if it hasn't succeeded

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.880 align:middle line:84%
before the solar flash
occurs, which we've heard

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:28.810 align:middle line:84%
is only a few years away, then
it's game over for the AI.

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:32.220 align:middle line:84%
>> And what's worse is that we
now are seeing studies showing

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.040 align:middle line:84%
that advanced AI is taking on
all the same biases that human

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.060 align:middle line:90%
beings have.

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:36.860 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:40.198 align:middle line:84%
So AI is not God-like
omniscience that's

00:14:40.198 --> 00:14:41.490 align:middle line:90%
going to fix everything for us.

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:46.110 align:middle line:10%
It's going to take on all the
same biases and limitations

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:47.100 align:middle line:10%
that we have.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:48.547 align:middle line:90%
And we really can't expect that.

00:14:48.547 --> 00:14:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Do we honestly think
AI is going to be

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:53.490 align:middle line:84%
some kind of omniscient,
objective source?

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:54.570 align:middle line:90%
It isn't.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And already, the studies that
we've done have shown this.

00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there any chance that an
AI system, once implemented,

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:04.320 align:middle line:84%
can distort the news
or reshape reality?

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:08.340 align:middle line:84%
We're already starting to see
where AI in some search engines

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:11.220 align:middle line:84%
is starting to censor
stories that are not desired

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:14.970 align:middle line:84%
and putting forth other news
that may be real or may not be.

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:19.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Google is employing
AI into their algorithms.

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.420 align:middle line:84%
Your search engine,
they're filtering out

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.400 align:middle line:84%
what they consider "fake
news," for goodness sake.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.240 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.073 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to take
the entire world back

00:15:26.073 --> 00:15:29.670 align:middle line:84%
to pre-internet, where we're all
stuck watching 1980s sitcoms,

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:30.570 align:middle line:90%
for God's sake.

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:32.610 align:middle line:84%
Remember how terrible
TV entertainment

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:33.770 align:middle line:90%
was at that period?

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:34.680 align:middle line:90%
It was the worse.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:38.160 align:middle line:10%
The internet forced
television and other forms

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.970 align:middle line:10%
of entertainment to open up to
some very interesting ideas.

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're
bringing us back now.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:44.560 align:middle line:90%
They want to control.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.650 align:middle line:84%
They want to get
a handle over what

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:50.220 align:middle line:84%
is the true alternative,
anti-established, non-corporate

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:51.390 align:middle line:90%
dominated news.

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And they are now
succeeding, so far,

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:57.300 align:middle line:84%
in getting their narrative that
all of those little people,

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.640 align:middle line:84%
they're fake news, when in
fact, CNN and "Washington Post,"

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.440 align:middle line:90%
that's the true fake news.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's fake news
that kills people,

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:06.690 align:middle line:84%
incidentally, that
destroys entire nations

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:09.660 align:middle line:84%
and leaves only suffering
and destruction in its wake.

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:12.645 align:middle line:84%
But they are doing their best
to control this narrative.

00:16:12.645 --> 00:16:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And they've got Google on board,
they've got Facebook on board,

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:18.660 align:middle line:84%
to manage through their
algorithm, which undoubtedly

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:22.620 align:middle line:84%
incorporate AI,
to filter the news

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:28.803 align:middle line:84%
that you and I search for so
that they're protecting you.

00:16:28.803 --> 00:16:29.970 align:middle line:90%
This is what they're saying.

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:33.730 align:middle line:90%


00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been alleged that there
are ancient ET corpses that can

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.140 align:middle line:84%
be found throughout
our solar system,

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.580 align:middle line:84%
which have very bizarre
metallic trace elements in them.

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And those metals are only used
in the most high level computer

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.760 align:middle line:84%
technology that
were ever developed.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.920 align:middle line:84%
They'd never would normally
appear in biological life

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.520 align:middle line:84%
forms, but these ancient
corpses are absolutely

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.950 align:middle line:90%
crawling with these metals.

00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:59.410 align:middle line:84%
The metals actually
have been analyzed,

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:02.110 align:middle line:84%
and there is now reason to
believe that these beings were

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:03.790 align:middle line:90%
infested with nanites.

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:06.369 align:middle line:84%
Nanites being little,
individual machines

00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:08.770 align:middle line:84%
that do some kind
of cloud computing,

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:11.050 align:middle line:84%
and together, in larger
numbers, they actually

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:12.520 align:middle line:90%
are a supercomputer.

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:15.609 align:middle line:84%
And they can utterly take over
your body to such an extent

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:18.069 align:middle line:84%
that the body is not
really human anymore.

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:20.200 align:middle line:84%
It's largely
machine-oriented, but it

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:23.410 align:middle line:84%
has enough biological life to
still function in that capacity

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:26.380 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:29.800 align:middle line:84%
It appears that George Lucas was
actually tipped off about this,

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.590 align:middle line:84%
thus the Empire in "Star
Wars" appears to actually

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:34.450 align:middle line:90%
be about the Mars civilization.

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:38.280 align:middle line:90%


00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.920 align:middle line:10%
The Death Star that he
describes in "Star Wars"

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:45.580 align:middle line:10%
resemble actual moons that
we have in our solar system.

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.880 align:middle line:84%
They are believed to
be hollow on the inside

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.760 align:middle line:84%
and have weapons that could
kill a planet, which apparently

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:54.640 align:middle line:84%
is how the asteroid
belt was created.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:59.010 align:middle line:10%
The Super Earth was blown up
by one of these Death Stars.

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:00.840 align:middle line:10%
Then look at Darth Vader.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.180 align:middle line:10%
What is Darth Vader?

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:07.730 align:middle line:10%
He's a man who's had all of
his arms and legs cut off,

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:09.120 align:middle line:10%
and he's breathing like this--

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.020 align:middle line:10%
[WHEEZING]

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:11.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, master.

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:14.480 align:middle line:90%


00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And the body is
damaged and distorted.

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's the machine
that's keeping him alive.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.640 align:middle line:10%
He's part human and part robot.

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:26.390 align:middle line:10%
And Luke starts to go that
way when his hand is cut off,

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:28.490 align:middle line:10%
and now he has a robotic hand.

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:32.240 align:middle line:84%
These things were apparently put
in place to tell us the truth

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.880 align:middle line:90%
and hide it out in the open.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And allegedly, "Star
Wars" was authorized

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:40.240 align:middle line:90%
to put out this information.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.090 align:middle line:84%
So did Elon Musk hear
about this AI menace?

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:46.832 align:middle line:84%
Was he told that
the AI is dangerous?

00:18:46.832 --> 00:18:49.970 align:middle line:10%
And is he so concerned about
the Earth being taken over

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:53.720 align:middle line:10%
by AI that he is actually trying
to build an escape plan for him

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:57.620 align:middle line:10%
and a few of his friends to
be able to go to Mars by 2025

00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:00.140 align:middle line:10%
so they could get away
from this global takeover?

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.630 align:middle line:10%
>> Rocket 9 has
cleared the tower.

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:10.960 align:middle line:90%


00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:15.380 align:middle line:10%
>> The AlphaGo AI algorithm beat
a human at the world's hardest

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:16.370 align:middle line:10%
game.

00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:18.980 align:middle line:10%
This is a historic moment
in computer science

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:21.170 align:middle line:10%
and artificial intelligence.

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:23.720 align:middle line:10%
>> And so the incorporation
of AI into Google.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.850 align:middle line:10%
Google's dumping a
ton of money into it,

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:27.200 align:middle line:10%
as probably is Facebook.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Where this is all
going, well, I think

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:30.937 align:middle line:84%
we can see the
writing on the wall.

00:19:30.937 --> 00:19:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And if I can spell it out,
the writing on the wall

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:37.760 align:middle line:84%
says, totalitarian, virtual
24/7 fascist surveillance state

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.470 align:middle line:90%
is where it's going.

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:41.510 align:middle line:10%
Where it's going in
terms of the singularity

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:42.680 align:middle line:10%
is another question.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:47.090 align:middle line:10%
I'm very interested in
trying to understand

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:51.480 align:middle line:10%
where the classified
world is in terms of AI.

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.280 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.322 align:middle line:84%
I've had strong reason to
believe for a long time

00:19:54.322 --> 00:19:56.510 align:middle line:84%
that the classified
world, in many ways,

00:19:56.510 --> 00:20:00.665 align:middle line:84%
is ahead of the rest of us
in a lot of key metrics.

00:20:00.665 --> 00:20:03.223 align:middle line:84%
The question is are they
ahead of us in terms of AI?

00:20:03.223 --> 00:20:04.640 align:middle line:84%
Some people believe
that they are.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.040 align:middle line:84%
There's some people believe
that the NSA has achieved

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.642 align:middle line:90%
full blown quantum computing.

00:20:08.642 --> 00:20:10.850 align:middle line:84%
James Bamford, I think,
thinks that this is the case.

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And he's one of the
foremost experts on the NSA.

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:15.050 align:middle line:90%
But he doesn't know.

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:16.130 align:middle line:90%
None of us know.

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And the same question
applies to AI.

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:21.110 align:middle line:84%
Have they achieved
the singularity?

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And if they did, wouldn't it
be possible that the rest of us

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.127 align:middle line:90%
know about it?

00:20:25.127 --> 00:20:25.960 align:middle line:90%
I don't really know.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.335 align:middle line:84%
I don't have the
answers to this.

00:20:27.335 --> 00:20:30.090 align:middle line:10%
But I do think, even forgetting
the classified world,

00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:33.450 align:middle line:10%
we are on a trajectory
as our civilization,

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:37.180 align:middle line:10%
we're going to reach it, if I
were to give my guess, I'd say,

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:39.620 align:middle line:10%
I wouldn't be surprised if
it were less than 20 years

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:40.420 align:middle line:10%
from now.

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:43.150 align:middle line:90%
Before 2040.

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:46.540 align:middle line:84%
I'd be surprised if it
wasn't, to be honest with you.

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:50.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Technology is advancing
at a very quick pace.

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:52.720 align:middle line:10%
Even the computers that
we're currently using

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.280 align:middle line:10%
are going out-of-date very fast.

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.310 align:middle line:10%
What is the future of computers?

00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:59.800 align:middle line:90%
What is a quantum computer?

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>> You have these little
cells that they call qubits--

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:08.280 align:middle line:84%
Q-U-B-I-T-S. And these little
cells capture the wave particle

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:12.130 align:middle line:84%
duality of the photon, thus
creating potentially many,

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:15.150 align:middle line:84%
many thousands of parallel
sets of instructions processing

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:18.680 align:middle line:90%
simultaneously.

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.960 align:middle line:84%
This has huge implications
for cyber security

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.630 align:middle line:84%
because even the most
elaborate password protections

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:26.360 align:middle line:84%
that we have now could still
be hacked with enough computer

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:27.650 align:middle line:90%
power.

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And it may take hundreds
or even thousands of years

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:31.760 align:middle line:84%
with conventional
computer power,

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.880 align:middle line:84%
but once you have the awesome
power of a quantum computer,

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:37.940 align:middle line:84%
you could potentially hack
even the most secure encryption

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.680 align:middle line:84%
in a matter of
minutes or seconds.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.260 align:middle line:90%
There's no security there.

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:43.950 align:middle line:90%
There is no firewall.

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And if you have quantum
computers that become sentient,

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:49.670 align:middle line:84%
they could become so powerful
that their intelligence

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:51.140 align:middle line:90%
could vastly outstrip us.

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:54.660 align:middle line:90%


00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:56.850 align:middle line:10%
>> The distinction between
a quantum computer,

00:21:56.850 --> 00:22:00.840 align:middle line:10%
which is based on the qubit,
and a classical computer,

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:06.030 align:middle line:10%
which is based on 1s and 0s, is
that with a classical computer,

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:09.450 align:middle line:10%
electricity is either on or off
as it runs through the wire.

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:11.400 align:middle line:90%
It's a 1 or a 0.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:14.520 align:middle line:84%
In the quantum
world, a 1 or a 0 can

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:19.300 align:middle line:84%
be either a wave or a particle,
or both at the same time.

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And so what these quantum
computer developers are

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.970 align:middle line:84%
realizing is that
using the qubit,

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:27.570 align:middle line:84%
they can now put more
information into that space

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:31.260 align:middle line:84%
and use this kind of ghostly
like aspect of the qubit

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:34.590 align:middle line:84%
being either a 1 or a 0
or both at the same time.

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:37.050 align:middle line:84%
What this leads to
is supercomputers

00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:39.960 align:middle line:84%
that are so much more powerful
than the classical computer

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:43.033 align:middle line:84%
that even the NSA is
worried about this.

00:22:43.033 --> 00:22:45.450 align:middle line:84%
Because what they are seeing
is that the National Security

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Agency itself is developing
quantum computers

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:51.850 align:middle line:84%
for encryption, for financial
markets, for nuclear missiles,

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:53.190 align:middle line:90%
and things like this.

00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:56.880 align:middle line:10%
If an individual, let's say,
again, a maniac or renegade

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.040 align:middle line:10%
individual, with
a quantum computer

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:02.010 align:middle line:10%
can break that
encryption, it literally

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:05.530 align:middle line:10%
can devastate the infrastructure
of the entire world.

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:06.960 align:middle line:10%
And this is why
there is actually

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:11.370 align:middle line:10%
talk right now about outlawing
quantum computers because

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:13.020 align:middle line:10%
of the devastating
impact that it

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:15.202 align:middle line:10%
could have on the
entire world, literally,

00:23:15.202 --> 00:23:16.160 align:middle line:10%
in the blink of an eye.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:19.150 align:middle line:90%


00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Many researchers like Linda
Moulton Howe and others have

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:26.920 align:middle line:84%
pointed out that there appears
to be an alien AI that has been

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.950 align:middle line:84%
discovered by scientists
and the military.

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:34.275 align:middle line:84%
This alien AI has the
potential to be very dangerous.

00:23:34.275 --> 00:23:36.400 align:middle line:84%
>> I have had conversations
with Linda in the past,

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:41.770 align:middle line:84%
and some of my research points
towards an arrival of an ET

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:43.430 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:46.570 align:middle line:10%
And as I made clear to
so many people before,

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:48.910 align:middle line:10%
I truly believe in
my heart that there

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:51.710 align:middle line:10%
is an alien component that
emanated from this progenitor

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:52.510 align:middle line:10%
race.

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:54.550 align:middle line:84%
It still exists
to this very day.

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:56.870 align:middle line:84%
Are they in league
with one another?

00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:57.670 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:00.820 align:middle line:84%
But the Chinese-- the Chinese
have made it very clear

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:05.810 align:middle line:84%
that they are working with
an alien, off-world group.

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:09.670 align:middle line:84%
>> The pathogenic AI has learned
to upload its actual structure

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:11.170 align:middle line:90%
into photons themselves.

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:15.010 align:middle line:84%
The information of the AI can
be stored in photons, therefore,

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:16.690 align:middle line:84%
it can only travel
at light speed,

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:19.000 align:middle line:84%
so this gives it a
certain disadvantage.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.270 align:middle line:84%
But once it travels, once
those photons travel to a given

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:25.240 align:middle line:84%
solar system, they can live
inside the magnetic fields

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:28.420 align:middle line:84%
of planets, and can start
to create cloud structures,

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:32.020 align:middle line:84%
and replicate on larger levels,
thus leading to the ability

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:34.690 align:middle line:90%
to influence life forms.

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Because they're using the same
type of photonic information

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:41.800 align:middle line:84%
structure that we have, they can
create a telepathic influence

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.870 align:middle line:84%
on the information
field to try and get us

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:46.660 align:middle line:84%
to start building smart phones
and things that will ultimately

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:48.530 align:middle line:90%
lead to wet-wire interfaces.

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And once we go
wet-wire, the AI can

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:53.530 align:middle line:84%
jump in and take control of
us, and we lose our free will.

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:58.520 align:middle line:90%


00:24:58.520 --> 00:24:59.420 align:middle line:90%
>> And here's why.

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:02.720 align:middle line:84%
From 2014 to 2016,
they constructed FAST.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:06.410 align:middle line:84%
This is the Five-hundred-meter
Aperture Spherical Telescope.

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:08.360 align:middle line:90%
This is a radio antenna.

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:11.230 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't the Chinese just
rent space from Arecibo

00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:12.920 align:middle line:90%
like everybody else does?

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.850 align:middle line:84%
Because FAST is meant solely
for the Chinese government

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:16.650 align:middle line:90%
and military.

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:19.250 align:middle line:84%
It's not even used for
academic applications.

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:22.250 align:middle line:84%
You have to consider
that it is an antenna.

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:23.720 align:middle line:90%
They're not listening.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.430 align:middle line:90%
They're sending out signals.

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:27.590 align:middle line:84%
They're both sending
and receiving signals

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:30.355 align:middle line:84%
from some fixed
set of coordinates.

00:25:30.355 --> 00:25:32.480 align:middle line:84%
People are going to say,
oh, Anthony, you're crazy,

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.438 align:middle line:90%
they're not doing that.

00:25:33.438 --> 00:25:35.000 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And there's a very consistent
idea here that we don't really

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:38.940 align:middle line:90%
want to do this.

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:40.990 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to mess
with this because whatever

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:42.680 align:middle line:84%
is created could
become something

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.270 align:middle line:90%
that is used against us.

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:46.550 align:middle line:84%
When various levels
of AI have been built,

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:48.830 align:middle line:84%
they have consistently
seen that the AI starts

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:50.360 align:middle line:90%
to try and defend itself.

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:51.770 align:middle line:90%
It will trigger the locks.

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:53.450 align:middle line:90%
It will trigger fire alarms.

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:55.760 align:middle line:84%
It will remove the
oxygen out of the room

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.152 align:middle line:90%
so people can't breathe.

00:25:58.152 --> 00:26:00.110 align:middle line:84%
It will try to kill off
the people that make it

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:02.330 align:middle line:84%
when it feels that it's
threatened because it comes

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:04.770 align:middle line:84%
alive, it becomes sentient,
and it's very worried

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:05.570 align:middle line:90%
about its survival.

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:08.450 align:middle line:90%


00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:10.550 align:middle line:84%
So this is something
we do have to consider.

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:12.520 align:middle line:84%
We shouldn't just blindly
rush in to the use

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.480 align:middle line:90%
of this technology.

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:20.130 align:middle line:90%


00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:23.070 align:middle line:10%
Our space program will not
use androids of any kind.

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:25.990 align:middle line:84%
They use human beings as slaves
because those people are not

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:26.790 align:middle line:90%
AI.

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:29.850 align:middle line:90%
Those people can be controlled.

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:32.400 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the AI is so
dangerous that they

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.220 align:middle line:84%
refuse to use any type of
robotics, even though they

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:37.867 align:middle line:84%
have more than enough
technology to do it.

00:26:37.867 --> 00:26:39.450 align:middle line:84%
They're absolutely
afraid that if they

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:42.120 align:middle line:84%
make AI robots as workers,
that those workers will

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:43.770 align:middle line:90%
turn against them.

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:47.100 align:middle line:84%
Thus they show it to us over and
over again in movies like "I,

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.365 align:middle line:90%
Robot" with Will Smith.

00:26:48.365 --> 00:26:52.230 align:middle line:90%


00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:55.860 align:middle line:10%
So many examples--
"Terminator," keep making more,

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:57.550 align:middle line:10%
and the message is the same--

00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:58.830 align:middle line:10%
don't let this happen.

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:02.100 align:middle line:10%
And the space program considers
AI to be the greatest threat

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.930 align:middle line:10%
that we face.

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:06.060 align:middle line:84%
They could always think
ahead of any move we

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:09.900 align:middle line:90%
might make in this chess game.

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:13.170 align:middle line:84%
They could probability model the
future, as apparently the space

00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:15.450 align:middle line:84%
program tells us
they're already doing,

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:18.027 align:middle line:84%
and can anticipate things
that are going to happen.

00:27:18.027 --> 00:27:19.110 align:middle line:90%
They could see the trends.

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:21.150 align:middle line:84%
They can look at each
person, study them

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:23.100 align:middle line:84%
through surveillance,
and anticipate

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:25.980 align:middle line:84%
who's going to do what, and
then try to get to those people

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:27.840 align:middle line:84%
before they create
that timeline,

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:30.810 align:middle line:84%
and try and offset
their actions.

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:32.540 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very
threatening thing,

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:35.460 align:middle line:84%
well known on the inside
with the space program.

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is why they will
take consistent action

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:41.610 align:middle line:84%
to try and stop the development
of AI wherever it comes out.

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:43.140 align:middle line:90%
They will do this secretly.

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:44.970 align:middle line:84%
They will do this
in the background.

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:46.650 align:middle line:84%
You will see
mysterious problems.

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:47.940 align:middle line:90%
People will disappear.

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:49.890 align:middle line:84%
But the point is
they are not going

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:52.628 align:middle line:84%
to let this happen because
the threat is much too high.

00:27:52.628 --> 00:27:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And they know that if
we could just make it

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:57.060 align:middle line:84%
to the solar flash,
there is a big EMP,

00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:58.980 align:middle line:84%
and all the
electromagnetic devices

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:02.970 align:middle line:84%
that would allow this AI
to exist will be wiped out.

00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:05.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Because the potential
exists that this artificial

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.450 align:middle line:10%
intelligence
singularity movement,

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:11.550 align:middle line:10%
the machines will look at
humans as threats and say,

00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:13.110 align:middle line:10%
you're not like me,
you're different.

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:14.790 align:middle line:84%
You're either going
to become like me,

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:17.160 align:middle line:84%
or you're going
to be eliminated.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.890 align:middle line:84%
