00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Mankind has continued to be
fascinated by the Great Pyramid

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.950 align:middle line:90%
in Egypt.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.640 align:middle line:90%


00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.970 align:middle line:84%
How were people of the
time able to create

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.130 align:middle line:90%
this massive structure?

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.500 align:middle line:84%
The Great Pyramid
in the Giza Plateau

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.530 align:middle line:84%
is the oldest
monument of its size.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.470 align:middle line:84%
It was created to such
perfection that modern

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.890 align:middle line:84%
technology cannot
structurally replicate it,

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.270 align:middle line:84%
let alone envision
its full potential.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.380 align:middle line:84%
More than 150 years after
the academic establishment

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.780 align:middle line:84%
of Egyptology,
there still appears

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.330 align:middle line:84%
to be little agreement
between scholars

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.820 align:middle line:84%
on the function of the
Great Pyramid of Giza.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.270 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that a
highly advanced civilization

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.000 align:middle line:90%
existed in prehistory?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.661 align:middle line:84%
If so, is the Giza Pyramid a
remnant of their technology?

00:01:24.661 --> 00:01:27.540 align:middle line:84%
>> The theory that the
pyramids were tombs,

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.980 align:middle line:84%
that is obviously the
academic position in terms

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.990 align:middle line:90%
of the analysis of them.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.630 align:middle line:10%
And the evidence to
support that theory,

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.960 align:middle line:10%
they don't really have
that much evidence.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.190 align:middle line:10%
In fact, most of the evidence
that you find in the pyramids,

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.460 align:middle line:10%
the Great Pyramids specifically,
argues against tomb theory.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.060 align:middle line:90%


00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.610 align:middle line:10%
>> There has never been, in all
the three pyramids on the Giza

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.370 align:middle line:10%
Plateau, any bodies ever
found in the sarcophagi.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.996 align:middle line:84%
So no, they probably
were not tombs.

00:02:04.996 --> 00:02:08.690 align:middle line:10%
>> The reason I don't think
it's a tomb is because of how

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.500 align:middle line:10%
intricate it's designed.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.310 align:middle line:10%
I mean, just look
at it, for example.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.550 align:middle line:84%
We know that it's made
of granite, sandstone,

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.530 align:middle line:90%
and limestone.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.280 align:middle line:10%
Essentially, operating
like a Faraday cage.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.800 align:middle line:84%
If we look at what
granite is, which

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.670 align:middle line:84%
most of our pyramids on the
planet share this component,

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.180 align:middle line:84%
granite is composed of
something called silica.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And from silica, we get silicon
like you use microchips.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is a great
insulator and conductor

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.350 align:middle line:90%
of electromagnetic energy.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.510 align:middle line:84%
Just like you'd see
with quartz crystal

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.750 align:middle line:84%
where you get
piezoelectrical energy.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.140 align:middle line:84%
Thus, when we see
this structure and how

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.920 align:middle line:84%
it operates, what we
have to ask ourselves,

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.550 align:middle line:84%
why would you take so
much time and effort

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.490 align:middle line:84%
to put together
something that has

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.240 align:middle line:84%
all these various
components, and chambers,

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:11.480 align:middle line:84%
and ways of operating to
just use it as a tomb?

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.790 align:middle line:84%
If you think about it,
why would the highly

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.970 align:middle line:84%
advanced civilization
capable of using

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.410 align:middle line:84%
such precise mathematical
equations and precision

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.705 align:middle line:84%
build this for
storing dead bodies?

00:03:23.705 --> 00:03:27.462 align:middle line:90%


00:03:27.462 --> 00:03:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Mainstream archeologists
estimate the age of the Great

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.540 align:middle line:84%
Pyramid in Giza to be
approximately 4,500 years old.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.810 align:middle line:90%
Others contend it's much older.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.290 align:middle line:84%
When researchers look back
at the Orion constellation

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.050 align:middle line:84%
and how it would have
appeared to earthly observers

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.830 align:middle line:84%
over centuries past, the
age of the Giza Pyramid

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:55.230 align:middle line:84%
appears to date back
to around 10,500 BC,

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.190 align:middle line:84%
while other researchers
suggest it's even older.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Alternatively, others
go as far to suggest

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.520 align:middle line:84%
that the pyramids were not built
by the indigenous population

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.960 align:middle line:84%
of Egypt, but in fact
predate the Egyptian culture,

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.660 align:middle line:84%
and more significantly,
were built

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.065 align:middle line:84%
by a conglomerate of
cooperative ET races.

00:04:17.065 --> 00:04:19.589 align:middle line:90%


00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:22.410 align:middle line:84%
While the date and method
of the pyramids construction

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.170 align:middle line:84%
is highly disputed,
it is generally

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.100 align:middle line:84%
agreed that there were more
than 2.3 million limestone

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.200 align:middle line:84%
and granite blocks
ranging in weight from 2

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:41.150 align:middle line:84%
to up to 30 tons each quarried
and transported from Aswan more

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.430 align:middle line:90%
than 500 miles away.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.100 align:middle line:84%
The largest of these
stones are estimated

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.770 align:middle line:84%
to weigh as much as 50 to
80 tons, or approximately

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.172 align:middle line:84%
the combined weight of
80 average size cars.

00:04:56.172 --> 00:05:01.240 align:middle line:10%
>> In my opinion, it's clear
that the structure and design

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.160 align:middle line:10%
of the Great Pyramid is not
simply some kind of tomb like

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.420 align:middle line:10%
you might have in a
cathedral or in a churchyard.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.310 align:middle line:84%
It's there with a
specific function in mind.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.230 align:middle line:84%
It generates an energy
which can be not only felt

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.200 align:middle line:84%
by whoever enters
inside the structure,

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.810 align:middle line:84%
but can actually
be detected using

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.682 align:middle line:90%
scientific instrumentation.

00:05:28.682 --> 00:05:32.410 align:middle line:84%
>> The reason for building
the Great Pyramid remains

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:33.790 align:middle line:90%
an enigma.

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.730 align:middle line:84%
Due to their precise
alignment with the stars,

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.120 align:middle line:84%
many researchers speculate the
Great Pyramid may have been

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.270 align:middle line:90%
a type of portal to the cosmos.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.730 align:middle line:84%
Others have speculated
that the pyramid may

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.180 align:middle line:84%
have been used as an
energy-generating technology

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.060 align:middle line:90%
for various purposes.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Either way, what
can be certain is

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.630 align:middle line:84%
that the builders possessed
highly sophisticated knowledge

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.330 align:middle line:90%
of mathematics and geometry.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.940 align:middle line:84%
They had knowledge of the
true dimensions of the Earth

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.790 align:middle line:84%
to extreme precision
and they possessed

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.240 align:middle line:84%
exceptionally advanced
technical instrumentation

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.330 align:middle line:90%
to cite the Great Pyramid.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:18.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Within the Great Pyramid is
extraordinary precision within

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:23.550 align:middle line:84%
its design and the engineering,
and the sheer finish of it.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're dealing with
blocks made of granite.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.330 align:middle line:84%
Granite, which is one of the
hardest substances in the world

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:31.350 align:middle line:90%
to work.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And you're talking about the
precision cutting of this

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:40.230 align:middle line:90%
as much as 4,600 years ago.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:44.550 align:middle line:84%
But then the placement
of it to a level

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:51.270 align:middle line:84%
that's certainly below 1% of
precision, and to such a degree

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:55.740 align:middle line:84%
that you're not even able
to put a piece of paper

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:01.260 align:middle line:84%
between the different courses
of the exterior-facing blocks.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:06.692 align:middle line:84%
So you have to ask yourself, why
did they need such precision?

00:07:06.692 --> 00:07:09.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Today's buildings, if
you're laying down a footing,

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:13.440 align:middle line:84%
a foundation for a building,
you are required to hold

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:19.170 align:middle line:84%
the accuracy, flatness, within
20,000s per linear foot.

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:23.490 align:middle line:84%
If you take that over the
acreage of the Great Pyramid,

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.790 align:middle line:90%
you have a base of 13 acres.

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And so using 20,000
of an inch per foot,

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:36.440 align:middle line:84%
you could be out 15 inches
based on modern specs

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.590 align:middle line:90%
and modern requirements.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:43.050 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the actual variance of
being a perfectly flat plane

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.690 align:middle line:84%
on the Great Pyramid
instead of being 15 inches

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:47.610 align:middle line:90%
is less than an inch--

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:49.210 align:middle line:90%
7/8 of an inch.

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:53.560 align:middle line:84%
So they were working on a
high degree of accuracy.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.040 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at
the building pillars

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.740 align:middle line:84%
that we have today
or masonry work,

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.320 align:middle line:84%
you don't find that
kind of accuracy.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.600 align:middle line:10%
If you look at the interior
design, the schematics

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.030 align:middle line:10%
of the Great Pyramid,
to me, it look

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:12.360 align:middle line:10%
more like the inner
workings of a machine

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:17.290 align:middle line:10%
than a building or a tomb
or cathedral or anything

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:18.090 align:middle line:10%
like that.

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And taking the appearance
and discovering the precision

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:26.410 align:middle line:84%
of these inner
chambers occurred to me

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:30.420 align:middle line:84%
that something that had the
precision of a machine, that

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:34.590 align:middle line:84%
had the appearance of a machine,
well, perhaps it was a machine.

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.182 align:middle line:90%


00:08:37.182 --> 00:08:43.990 align:middle line:84%
>> If the pyramid is a machine,
then for what possible purpose?

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:46.680 align:middle line:84%
What if in the
ancient past someone

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:51.610 align:middle line:84%
wanted to build an instrument
to generate light and energy?

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:53.120 align:middle line:90%
Light can be created.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.730 align:middle line:84%
If the machine can emit charged
particles into the ionosphere.

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:01.870 align:middle line:84%
Like the Aurora Borealis where
electrons created by the sun

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:05.290 align:middle line:84%
collide with air
molecules to create light,

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:07.300 align:middle line:84%
what would it take
for the Great Pyramid

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:10.870 align:middle line:84%
to create a similar
energetic emission?

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:14.590 align:middle line:84%
To accomplish that goal,
high conductivity material

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:17.275 align:middle line:90%
at high frequency is required.

00:09:17.275 --> 00:09:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>> A limestone is a
very conductive material

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:21.950 align:middle line:90%
for electricity.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:24.880 align:middle line:10%
And when you look to the
inner design of the pyramid,

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.280 align:middle line:10%
you'll find that the most
important part of the pyramid,

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:32.620 align:middle line:10%
which is the so-called the
tin chamber is completely

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:36.970 align:middle line:10%
built from granite,
rose granite from Aswan.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:41.690 align:middle line:10%
And we understand that
granite contains quartz on it,

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:44.050 align:middle line:10%
especially that
draws granite, it

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:49.090 align:middle line:10%
contains 13% of its
molecular structure quarters.

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:51.940 align:middle line:84%
So as if it is serving
a very good need

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.190 align:middle line:84%
because if it is any
other type of granite,

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:59.650 align:middle line:84%
it will contain less than
10%, sometimes 6% or 5%.

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:03.320 align:middle line:90%
So 13% is serving high purpose.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:07.030 align:middle line:10%
Also, the design of the
shafts and the tunnels

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:10.030 align:middle line:10%
inside the pyramid, it
indicates that there

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:13.960 align:middle line:10%
are patterns of
movements or like energy

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.850 align:middle line:10%
movements inside the pyramid.

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:18.430 align:middle line:84%
It comes from the top
of the pyramid goes

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.860 align:middle line:90%
to the depths of the ground.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:25.420 align:middle line:84%
Or the opposite-- it comes from
the deep levels of the ground

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:28.330 align:middle line:84%
and continue up to the
middle of the pyramid

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.520 align:middle line:84%
and then to the
top of the pyramid

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.980 align:middle line:84%
until leaving from the
summit of the pyramid.

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:37.450 align:middle line:84%
So for sure, the
pyramid was power plant,

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:40.190 align:middle line:90%
and there are so many evidences.

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>> The National Research Center
of Cairo analyzed limestone

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.140 align:middle line:90%
from the region of Aswan.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:50.320 align:middle line:84%
It was discovered that
its conductance improves

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.560 align:middle line:84%
at higher frequency to
an exceptional degree.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.880 align:middle line:84%
In addition to its structural
strength limestone,

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.490 align:middle line:90%
is highly conductive.

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:04.150 align:middle line:84%
The Great Pyramids of Giza
has a few chambers, shafts,

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:05.800 align:middle line:90%
and passages.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Each of these
elements potentially

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:11.095 align:middle line:84%
served an important role
in the pyramid's function.

00:11:11.095 --> 00:11:14.980 align:middle line:10%
>> The Great Pyramids of
Giza is just the upper part

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:19.780 align:middle line:10%
of a massive underground
power system that you can only

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:23.110 align:middle line:10%
understand if you have
the opportunity to use

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:27.130 align:middle line:10%
ground-penetrating radar,
or be fortunate enough to go

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:28.500 align:middle line:10%
underground as we did.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.930 align:middle line:10%
My scientific team
in the 1970s, '80s,

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:38.080 align:middle line:10%
and '90s to look at the
unusual complex of water,

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:42.610 align:middle line:10%
tunnels, and passages that
bring water in from the Nile.

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:45.070 align:middle line:84%
That then is
recycled underground

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:50.440 align:middle line:84%
providing an energy source,
of energy differentials

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.830 align:middle line:84%
between fresh water
and salt water.

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:57.610 align:middle line:10%
That's my hypothesis that
the Great Pyramid represents

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:00.520 align:middle line:10%
the floor plan of a
gigantic Earth battery

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.860 align:middle line:10%
that the Egyptians used
very carefully and left

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:07.960 align:middle line:10%
behind as a model by
virtue of the storage rooms

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.500 align:middle line:10%
also underground,
underneath the Giza Plateau

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:17.390 align:middle line:10%
as a showing of a
simplified way, free energy.

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:21.180 align:middle line:10%
>> While many experts agree the
Giza pyramid was a structure

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:24.780 align:middle line:10%
to generate power, they have
slightly different theories

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:27.452 align:middle line:10%
about how this was accomplished.

00:12:27.452 --> 00:12:30.830 align:middle line:84%
>> So to describe
the Giza power plant,

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:35.450 align:middle line:84%
we go back to the source of
the energy that feeds into it.

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:37.880 align:middle line:90%
We go to the Earth.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.730 align:middle line:90%
The Earth is the power source.

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And the Great Pyramid
is tapping into it.

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:46.140 align:middle line:90%
So how did it do that?

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:50.160 align:middle line:84%
Principally, you have
mechanical energy flowing

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.830 align:middle line:90%
through the Great Pyramid.

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:55.890 align:middle line:84%
The Great Pyramid is cause
to resonate with the Earth.

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:58.980 align:middle line:84%
That is its
fundamental function.

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:03.390 align:middle line:10%
And when it resonates
with the Earth, energies

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:04.810 align:middle line:10%
drawn through it.

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:07.290 align:middle line:10%
And so once it's
primed, it becomes

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:09.570 align:middle line:10%
like a coupled oscillator.

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:12.840 align:middle line:84%
A coupled oscillator
is a device that's

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.160 align:middle line:84%
attached to a larger
vibrating body.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:21.100 align:middle line:84%
It's in tune or harmonically
tuned to that larger vibrating

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:21.900 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And as long as the
vibrating body continues

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:29.100 align:middle line:84%
to feed energy or vibrate,
then the coupled oscillator

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.080 align:middle line:84%
will vibrate in
sympathy with it.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.815 align:middle line:90%
It will draw energy from it.

00:13:33.815 --> 00:13:38.870 align:middle line:84%
>> I was one of the founders of
the Osiris tomb over 100 feet

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.210 align:middle line:90%
down under the Giza Plateau.

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:46.640 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of water, and yet
you have a huge sarcophagi.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.970 align:middle line:84%
So why would you
have this sarcophagus

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:51.830 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of water?

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:55.010 align:middle line:84%
Why would you have
temples along the Nile

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:57.540 align:middle line:90%
that are flooded with water?

00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:02.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, perhaps if they were
energy generators using water,

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:06.570 align:middle line:84%
using solar technology
which is plentiful in Egypt.

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:13.370 align:middle line:84%
>> The pyramids was used as an
energy structure to show us how

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:18.500 align:middle line:84%
we could harness the water
energy system that ran closely

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:22.010 align:middle line:90%
along the Great Pyramids.

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:26.150 align:middle line:10%
Water, thus, was
used and managed

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:29.850 align:middle line:10%
by pressure and by the
relationship of chambers

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:34.580 align:middle line:10%
interconnected with each other
to provide a water circulatory

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.200 align:middle line:10%
system.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:40.580 align:middle line:10%
A hydraulic of a
continuous feedback system

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:45.020 align:middle line:10%
of emptying the salt
water chambers to those

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:47.720 align:middle line:10%
of fresh water and
vise versa, to running

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:51.710 align:middle line:10%
water over electrodes, salt
water over electrodes where

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:55.790 align:middle line:10%
the sodium chloride ions
were removed and electricity

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:57.590 align:middle line:10%
was produced.

00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:01.760 align:middle line:84%
A simple electrical charge
and discharge system

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:05.380 align:middle line:84%
was there in place
beneath the pyramid.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:08.810 align:middle line:10%
>> I proposed in the
southern shaft carried dilute

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:13.050 align:middle line:10%
hydrochloric acid, and then the
northern shaft carried hydrated

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:13.850 align:middle line:10%
zinc.

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:18.180 align:middle line:10%
And so what I was seeing
supported the theory.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And one of those electrodes
was electroplated,

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:27.230 align:middle line:84%
where some of the metal
was actually deposited

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:29.150 align:middle line:90%
on one of the electrodes.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And then in the
northern shaft, you

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:34.220 align:middle line:84%
have quite a lot of
erosion in that shaft.

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:37.520 align:middle line:84%
You have the creation
of gypsum oozing out

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.170 align:middle line:90%
of some of the cracks.

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
a condition where

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:44.960 align:middle line:84%
the lower parts of
the shaft were more

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:48.950 align:middle line:84%
eroded than the upper parts,
which makes sense considering

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:51.170 align:middle line:84%
that you have a
higher concentration

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:55.670 align:middle line:84%
of the acid towards the
bottom than you would the top.

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:59.060 align:middle line:84%
So that seems to
confirm the theory

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:02.180 align:middle line:84%
that they were using that
as a reaction chamber,

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:06.390 align:middle line:84%
and everything
seemed to make sense.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And I found some very,
very interesting,

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:13.740 align:middle line:84%
and I would say evidence, of
electrical symbols painted

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.330 align:middle line:90%
on the floor.

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:19.380 align:middle line:84%
Behind the door,
they had these loops,

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:23.490 align:middle line:84%
metal fittings came outside
of the back of the door

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:25.870 align:middle line:84%
and looped around and
then went back in.

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:28.440 align:middle line:84%
So it was almost like
they were locking

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:33.620 align:middle line:84%
those electrodes in place
so they wouldn't shift.

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:37.410 align:middle line:84%
>> If metal had
been placed there,

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:42.090 align:middle line:84%
those could have been the
anodes and cathodes for energy

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:44.490 align:middle line:90%
generation.

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:48.510 align:middle line:10%
This is a great possibility
that the pyramid itself

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:52.230 align:middle line:10%
was an energy factory.

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:56.100 align:middle line:10%
>> One emerging theory suggests
that the pyramid was a power

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:59.460 align:middle line:10%
plant for Tesla-like
free energy.

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:02.580 align:middle line:84%
To achieve this, it's believed
that the Queen's Chamber

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:05.369 align:middle line:90%
was used as a power collector.

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:09.329 align:middle line:84%
Originally, the Queen's Chamber
as well as the entire pyramid,

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:12.690 align:middle line:84%
was covered in a
polished white limestone

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:16.020 align:middle line:84%
with the top of the pyramid
covered with crystal and gold

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:17.910 align:middle line:90%
at the apex.

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:21.869 align:middle line:84%
As particles funneled down from
the atmosphere toward the Earth

00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:25.440 align:middle line:84%
and through the pyramid,
the insulating properties

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:29.370 align:middle line:84%
of the piezoelectrically-charged
white limestone in the Queen's

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:32.220 align:middle line:84%
Chamber prevented the
electrical particles

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:35.700 align:middle line:84%
from returning back
into the atmosphere.

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.250 align:middle line:84%
Connecting to the
aquifers below,

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:40.830 align:middle line:84%
they created a
concentrated differential

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:44.550 align:middle line:84%
of charges between
sky and Earth.

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:47.130 align:middle line:84%
This would be like having
a continuous lightning

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:49.980 align:middle line:90%
bolt with regulated voltage.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.940 align:middle line:84%
The unique thing to understand
is that between sky and Earth,

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:56.520 align:middle line:84%
there is a charge in
polarity, depending

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.250 align:middle line:90%
on atmospheric circumstances.

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.710 align:middle line:84%
Even today in the
underground chamber,

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:06.400 align:middle line:84%
there are traces of cables and
metal structures for grounding.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.210 align:middle line:84%
It's dry now but
water was flowing,

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:12.090 align:middle line:90%
creating a grounding effect.

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.100 align:middle line:84%
The suggestion is
that there is now

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:18.090 align:middle line:84%
a place of continuous
charge creating free energy.

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:20.820 align:middle line:84%
That is why they were
on the lay lines,

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:24.420 align:middle line:84%
giving them a greater connection
to the ground essentially.

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.240 align:middle line:84%
It only concentrates
the charge differential

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.430 align:middle line:90%
between sky and Earth.

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:32.940 align:middle line:84%
It is the planet itself
that creates the energy.

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:37.170 align:middle line:84%
In short it is pure Tesla as
we would reference it today.

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:40.050 align:middle line:90%


00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:42.720 align:middle line:84%
While experts explore
the physical evidence

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:46.740 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid as a
power-generating technology,

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:49.770 align:middle line:84%
the design elements also
suggests the importance

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:52.632 align:middle line:90%
of acoustics.

00:18:52.632 --> 00:18:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Every room from the highest
chamber to the lowest chamber

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.950 align:middle line:84%
was thought out and
designed beforehand.

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Even the so-called unfinished
or subterranean chamber

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.960 align:middle line:84%
right within the
bedrock itself hundreds

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:14.070 align:middle line:84%
of feet beneath the
pyramids was specifically

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:18.570 align:middle line:84%
designed with
acoustics in mind, it

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:22.110 align:middle line:84%
was being chiseled away until
they reached a point where

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:23.250 align:middle line:90%
they said, that's it, stop.

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:28.830 align:middle line:90%


00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:31.470 align:middle line:84%
We've achieved
exactly the acoustics

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:35.160 align:middle line:84%
we need to generate
certain sound frequencies.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.450 align:middle line:90%
We need go no further.

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:40.170 align:middle line:84%
So they left it the
way that it was.

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And those sound frequencies
can be detected today, which

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:48.178 align:middle line:90%
is exactly what we have done.

00:19:48.178 --> 00:19:52.940 align:middle line:84%
>> The Great Pyramid has always
attracted attention when it

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:59.690 align:middle line:84%
comes to the unusual
acoustics on the interior.

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:06.170 align:middle line:84%
I think the first recording of
somebody actually commenting

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:10.790 align:middle line:90%
on the acoustics is Napoleon.

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:15.610 align:middle line:10%
The other one was Paul
Horn who is a flutist.

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:18.110 align:middle line:10%
[FLUTE MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:19.610 align:middle line:90%


00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:23.252 align:middle line:84%
He made a recording
inside the Great Pyramid.

00:20:23.252 --> 00:20:25.562 align:middle line:90%
[FLUTE MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:25.562 --> 00:20:26.490 align:middle line:90%


00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:28.710 align:middle line:90%
It is called Inside.

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And he recorded in
all the chambers.

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:35.540 align:middle line:84%
Paul noted that
the reverberation

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:39.170 align:middle line:84%
in the King's Chamber
was about eight seconds.

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:41.008 align:middle line:90%
It was a very long.

00:20:41.008 --> 00:20:43.448 align:middle line:90%
[FLUTE MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:43.448 --> 00:20:45.890 align:middle line:90%


00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And he also reported that the
frequency, when you struck it,

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:56.440 align:middle line:84%
rang it around 438 hertz
which is close to 440.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:02.480 align:middle line:84%
>> In 2019, I was able to go
into the Great Pyramid with

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.790 align:middle line:90%
a team of about 15 people.

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:12.530 align:middle line:84%
And we were permitted to carry
out a very simple experiment.

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And everybody went into
every different part

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:18.890 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid
and sounds were

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:23.000 align:middle line:84%
made in each of these chambers
so that we could not only

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.460 align:middle line:84%
monitor the different
frequencies,

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:28.880 align:middle line:84%
the different decibels,
but also to find out

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.850 align:middle line:84%
whether those sounds could be
heard in different chambers.

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And we're able to build up
an incredible picture of what

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:40.370 align:middle line:90%
was going on an acoustic level.

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And the different
frequency ranges not only

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:49.490 align:middle line:84%
were those fine tuned
towards the human voice.

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:53.350 align:middle line:84%
In other words, chanting,
singing, and other forms

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:56.950 align:middle line:84%
of ceremonial activity
were obviously in mind

00:21:56.950 --> 00:22:00.550 align:middle line:90%
with the design of the chambers.

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:03.760 align:middle line:10%
But beyond that, we
were able to detect

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:07.810 align:middle line:10%
in the lowest of the chambers,
the so-called subterranean

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:13.330 align:middle line:10%
chamber, and a long passage
that exits from this chamber

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:15.850 align:middle line:10%
called the dead-end
passage, we were

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:21.870 align:middle line:10%
able to find that in
here, there was generated

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:25.440 align:middle line:10%
incredibly low
frequencies as well

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.560 align:middle line:10%
as what is known as infrasound.

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And this seems to
have been deliberate.

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:38.970 align:middle line:10%
Infrasound is sound frequencies
that are below 20 hertz.

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:44.170 align:middle line:10%
So we do not hear them so much
as feel them and experience

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:44.970 align:middle line:10%
them.

00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And they affect us on
a very subtle level.

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:54.390 align:middle line:84%
They cause what we would refer
to as paranormal experiences

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:59.485 align:middle line:84%
or the sense that we're entering
into otherworldly environments.

00:22:59.485 --> 00:23:02.490 align:middle line:84%
>> We most certainly know that
when you visit in the Great

00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:05.340 align:middle line:84%
Pyramid and you go into
these various rooms,

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:08.740 align:middle line:84%
there's a particular
tonal frequency.

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And when you visit
the King's Chamber,

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.690 align:middle line:84%
and you can make the
sacred ohm sound,

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:18.700 align:middle line:84%
it's almost as if it's been
harmonized towards this.

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:22.800 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in our groups
that have made that sound,

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:26.670 align:middle line:84%
it's almost as if there's this
transcendental experience where

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:30.510 align:middle line:84%
the entire room disappears and
the stars become present out

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:31.470 align:middle line:90%
the top of it.

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:36.780 align:middle line:84%
There most certainly is this
timeless sound and frequency

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:40.050 align:middle line:84%
wavelength like feeling
when you immerse yourself

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:42.505 align:middle line:90%
into this magnificent monument.

00:23:42.505 --> 00:23:47.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Resonance has gives a
certain physical feature to this

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:49.220 align:middle line:10%
monument.

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:53.870 align:middle line:10%
For example, it allows waves
like electromagnetic waves

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:58.490 align:middle line:10%
to be concentrated in
some parts of the monument

00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:01.190 align:middle line:10%
or specifically
under the monument,

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:04.190 align:middle line:10%
whereas in other parts,
they do not concentrate.

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:05.360 align:middle line:90%
And so what does that do?

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.790 align:middle line:90%
It creates a gradient.

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:12.302 align:middle line:84%
You have an area where you have
a high concentration of energy.

00:24:12.302 --> 00:24:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
other areas where

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.520 align:middle line:84%
you have a low concentration,
and those areas

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:18.890 align:middle line:84%
are closer to the top
of the Great Pyramid.

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:19.790 align:middle line:90%
So what does that do?

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:22.370 align:middle line:84%
It basically creates
a flow of current

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:25.070 align:middle line:90%
in this case or magnetic waves.

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:29.493 align:middle line:84%
And that to me suggests
that it is possible

00:24:29.493 --> 00:24:31.160 align:middle line:84%
that the Great Pyramid
may have actually

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:37.625 align:middle line:84%
operated to concentrate power
by creating this gradient.

00:24:37.625 --> 00:24:40.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And this seems to
be something very,

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:43.980 align:middle line:84%
very important in connection
with the function of the Great

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:44.780 align:middle line:90%
Pyramid.

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:49.380 align:middle line:84%
It was to generate sound
on many different levels.

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:53.450 align:middle line:84%
But beyond this is the
fact that infrasound

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:58.910 align:middle line:84%
can be carried through rock
for great distances, perhaps

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:02.630 align:middle line:90%
many miles, like seismic waves.

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'm pretty certain that the
builders of the Great Pyramid

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:09.500 align:middle line:84%
would have been very
much aware of this.

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:11.860 align:middle line:84%
So they are carrying
energy, they

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:16.420 align:middle line:84%
are generating energy that can
be carried through the rock

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:19.420 align:middle line:84%
to the other monuments
on the Giza Plateau.

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:22.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, why would
this be important?

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:28.000 align:middle line:84%
The answer is so that rituals
and ceremonies can take place

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.690 align:middle line:84%
at other locations
on the plateau that

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:36.350 align:middle line:84%
can resonate and harmonize
with the Great Pyramid itself.

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:42.610 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it was all part
of one huge great harmonizing

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:49.488 align:middle line:84%
landscape that was all
working as one together.

00:25:49.488 --> 00:25:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>> The very geometry
of the Great Pyramid,

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:56.450 align:middle line:90%
the angles themselves.

00:25:56.450 --> 00:26:01.970 align:middle line:84%
A 51-51 approximately for
the geometry is amazing.

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:05.700 align:middle line:84%
It does put you into an
altered state of reality.

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:08.840 align:middle line:10%
And Professor
Golod in Russia has

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.840 align:middle line:10%
built pyramids not even
of the same geometry

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:15.710 align:middle line:10%
and certainly not of bricks
and stones and limestone

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:17.390 align:middle line:10%
and mortar.

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:20.030 align:middle line:84%
He makes them
simply out of wood.

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And people go inside
and they're healed.

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:26.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's an amazing
geometry no matter

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:30.960 align:middle line:84%
how you place it around
yourself or around the planet.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:35.090 align:middle line:84%
So the pyramid itself
is a key geometry

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:37.260 align:middle line:90%
for our own life system.

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that our
body itself creates

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.770 align:middle line:90%
its own pyramidal geometry.

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And inside our mind,
we have pyramidal cells

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:49.110 align:middle line:84%
which are really pyramidal
brain cells in our body.

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:53.620 align:middle line:84%
So all of this is part
of our geometry of life.

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>> The Great Pyramid is
a geographical marvel.

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:01.910 align:middle line:84%
Located at the exact
center of the planet

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:05.270 align:middle line:84%
at the intersection of the
longest line of latitude

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:08.390 align:middle line:84%
and the longest
line of longitude.

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:11.030 align:middle line:84%
Some researchers
suggest for a structure

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:14.000 align:middle line:84%
to generate high
frequency radiation, which

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.340 align:middle line:84%
is really light, it must be
surrounded by a large landmass.

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:22.670 align:middle line:84%
This begs the question,
is it possible

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:25.010 align:middle line:84%
that the Giza
Pyramids function is

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:29.000 align:middle line:84%
connected to its actual
location on Earth?

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.720 align:middle line:84%
>> The answer to that
almost certainly is yes,

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:38.430 align:middle line:84%
because it lies at exactly
30 degrees latitude.

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:44.210 align:middle line:84%
That's one third of the distance
from the equator to the North

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:45.380 align:middle line:90%
Pole.

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And although as far as
longitude is concerned,

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:51.650 align:middle line:90%
it's also at 30 degrees.

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Quite clearly, it is also
1/12 of the circumference

00:27:57.410 --> 00:27:59.640 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth itself.

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And this seems to be
beyond coincidence.

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:08.060 align:middle line:10%
And this tells us very
clearly that there

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:14.600 align:middle line:10%
was a specific purpose in
building the Great Pyramid

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.400 align:middle line:10%
exactly where it was.

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:21.620 align:middle line:84%
Again, I don't think this is
coincidence because as we know,

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:25.730 align:middle line:84%
the number 12 plays
such an important role

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:30.050 align:middle line:84%
in the canon of cosmic numbers
in cultures all the way

00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:33.135 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:28:33.135 --> 00:28:37.370 align:middle line:84%
>> The geology of
the site is ideal.

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:40.430 align:middle line:84%
It is what people
call a power place.

00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And the ancients knew
about these power places.

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:48.850 align:middle line:84%
So as far as Giza, that seems
to be Grand Central right there.

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:55.138 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it definitely is
a very energetic site.

00:28:55.138 --> 00:28:58.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Some theories suggest
that humans may have had help

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:02.550 align:middle line:84%
creating the Great Pyramid
from extraterrestrials,

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:06.180 align:middle line:84%
or that some divine knowledge
and inspiration is what made

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:08.750 align:middle line:90%
the feat possible.

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:12.470 align:middle line:10%
In part, that's because
some explanations put forth

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:17.150 align:middle line:10%
suggested that the Great Pyramid
was constructed using long lost

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:22.130 align:middle line:10%
sonic technology to levitate
and place the massive stones as

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:24.500 align:middle line:10%
well as high energy
tools which may

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:29.520 align:middle line:10%
have resembled modern-day lasers
to precisely cut the blocks.

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:32.900 align:middle line:84%
Whatever explanation is offered
about the pyramids origins

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:35.540 align:middle line:84%
and construction,
it seems evident

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:38.830 align:middle line:84%
that a higher
consciousness was involved.

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>> My book, The Keys of Enoch,
states that there is a global

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:48.950 align:middle line:84%
power grid system in the shape
of a dodecahedron which is

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:52.880 align:middle line:84%
a very complex geometry that
is then sliced into pyramidal

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.530 align:middle line:90%
sections.

00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:58.340 align:middle line:84%
The Great Pyramid, it represents
the center of this grid system

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:01.160 align:middle line:90%
that was to harness energy.

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:05.900 align:middle line:84%
The Great Pyramid represents, at
a much earlier dates, knowledge

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:10.430 align:middle line:84%
that I believe was
given to the human race

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:14.490 align:middle line:84%
by higher evolutionary
intelligence.

00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:19.710 align:middle line:84%
Masterminded by the
Egyptian priest scientists,

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:22.920 align:middle line:84%
and then distributed
in later generations

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:29.380 align:middle line:84%
and dynastic periods by a wide
variety of global societies.

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>> So legends say
that after Atlantis,

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:39.420 align:middle line:84%
some of the remaining
civilizations went to Egypt,

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:42.660 align:middle line:84%
and that was one of the
energy activation points.

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:46.050 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that many of the
other points that have been

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:49.780 align:middle line:90%
ancient stargates are lost.

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:55.530 align:middle line:84%
But Egypt seems to be a key
remaining activated energy

00:30:55.530 --> 00:31:01.996 align:middle line:84%
point, a real stargate, a real
place of energy generation.

00:31:01.996 --> 00:31:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>> The depth of symbolism and
mystery surrounding the Giza

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:10.540 align:middle line:84%
Pyramid makes it unique on Earth
for what some describe as its

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:12.595 align:middle line:90%
metaphysical properties.

00:31:12.595 --> 00:31:18.820 align:middle line:84%
>> I think if the Great Pyramid
was meant to be a mathematical

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:23.890 align:middle line:84%
shrine, or a tome to physics,
or a communication device,

00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:26.170 align:middle line:84%
then I think we have
to seriously entertain

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:29.590 align:middle line:84%
the possibility that we live
in a simulated universe.

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:36.130 align:middle line:84%
Because we have to then consider
the idea that it was planted

00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:43.086 align:middle line:84%
for us to figure out on our own
that we live in a simulation.

00:31:43.086 --> 00:31:46.300 align:middle line:84%
>> So the Great Pyramid
is a place of initiation.

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:50.020 align:middle line:84%
If you go inside the King's
Chamber and you chant,

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:54.400 align:middle line:84%
you actually get initiated
because the frequencies drop

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:58.300 align:middle line:84%
your mind from the normal
waking state to the alpha,

00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:01.000 align:middle line:84%
to the theta, even
into the delta range.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And you're able to be initiated
with the star gods, connected

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:07.850 align:middle line:90%
with Orion.

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:09.520 align:middle line:90%
This is powerful stuff.

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:14.020 align:middle line:84%
We are activated by those
in the heavenly dimensions,

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:18.700 align:middle line:84%
and they are helping us to make
that reconnection, that linkage

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:21.940 align:middle line:90%
back into our cosmic selves.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>> If you take all those
pyramids and tune them and make

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:31.710 align:middle line:84%
them sing to the Earth, then the
Earth would sing back but with

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:34.290 align:middle line:90%
a louder voice.

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:37.590 align:middle line:84%
But the result will be
that you would harmonize

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:40.110 align:middle line:84%
the planet,
harmonize the plates,

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:44.162 align:middle line:84%
and also the people that
are living in the area.

00:32:44.162 --> 00:32:48.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Now whether the Great Pyramid
was a power plant or it was

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:51.880 align:middle line:84%
a portal aligned with Orion's
Belt to take you somewhere,

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:56.670 align:middle line:84%
I feel from my experiences
in visiting it that it is one

00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:59.740 align:middle line:84%
of the most magnificent
monuments on this planet.

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:02.130 align:middle line:84%
It's the greatest doorway
to our ancient past,

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:06.150 align:middle line:84%
and it holds clues about
the origins of humanity.

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:09.900 align:middle line:84%
There is an immense feeling
of power when you visit it

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:14.280 align:middle line:84%
that overwhelms the puny
sensibilities of humankind.

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing
I can say about it

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:20.895 align:middle line:84%
is that it's transformational
when you walk into it.

00:33:20.895 --> 00:33:28.650 align:middle line:10%
>> In essence, the Great Pyramid
complex is the inductive spark

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:33.790 align:middle line:10%
to activate the cosmic roadmap
that connects Mother Earth,

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:38.320 align:middle line:10%
the stars of Orion, the
mortality of the human race

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:42.040 align:middle line:10%
with immortality of the gods
or those who live in the reach

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:47.140 align:middle line:10%
of hmw-sk, the Egyptian word
for the imperishable star gods.

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Merion to Ion, there is
the chemistry of eternity.

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And that is why these
terms have come down even

00:33:56.490 --> 00:34:01.740 align:middle line:84%
from the Greek philosophers and
scientists into our vocabulary.

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:05.970 align:middle line:84%
The ionization of the water, the
ionization of the human blood,

00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:08.909 align:middle line:84%
the heartbeat of the
human body, the activation

00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:12.270 align:middle line:84%
of the sound structure of
higher states of consciousness

00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:18.269 align:middle line:84%
all reflect a periodic charts
of birth, death, and ascension.

00:34:18.269 --> 00:34:22.689 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't think that we
can ever recreate the Great

00:34:22.689 --> 00:34:23.489 align:middle line:90%
Pyramid.

00:34:23.489 --> 00:34:30.690 align:middle line:84%
I think that it is one of the
pinnacles of human engineering

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:33.030 align:middle line:90%
and achievement.

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:36.630 align:middle line:84%
Not just in the ancient
world but in the modern world

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:38.489 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:34:38.489 --> 00:34:42.969 align:middle line:84%
And to understand its
function, I think,

00:34:42.969 --> 00:34:47.880 align:middle line:84%
is something that will
unlock the cosmic secrets

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:50.300 align:middle line:90%
of humankind.

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:53.590 align:middle line:84%
>> While the physical pyramid
emerges from the Earth

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:57.430 align:middle line:84%
and ascends energetically
toward the light of the cosmos,

00:34:57.430 --> 00:35:01.120 align:middle line:84%
so too does the energy of
the cosmos shine down through

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:06.130 align:middle line:84%
the Great Pyramid
energizing the Earth below.

00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:09.520 align:middle line:10%
The modern world may hold
the key to many secrets

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:13.600 align:middle line:10%
but the ancient world knew
one of monumental proportions,

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.990 align:middle line:10%
and to this day,
safeguards the secret

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:20.140 align:middle line:10%
within the hidden chambers
of the Giza Pyramid.

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:24.580 align:middle line:90%


00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Next time on Deep Space, we
explore the world of illusion.

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:31.630 align:middle line:10%
Do we live in a
holographic universe?

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:34.380 align:middle line:90%
