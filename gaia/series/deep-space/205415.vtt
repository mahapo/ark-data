caused a frenzy of speculation

stated that the object remained
in place for several hours

that probably it

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.250 align:middle line:10%
was something related
to the weather

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.190 align:middle line:10%
because it was announced some
days before that Russia was

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.580 align:middle line:10%
going to prove different

moment that probably this

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.269 align:middle line:90%
was related to that.

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.440 align:middle line:84%
However, since they didn't
see anything in the papers

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.210 align:middle line:84%
right away, they upload
this video to YouTube

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.730 align:middle line:90%

Another thing that
is very important

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.390 align:middle line:84%
is that the pyramid was
there for three hours.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.570 align:middle line:84%
We need to see patterns, clues,
real clues, regular clues,

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:25.300 align:middle line:84%
dispositive clues, and
we need to connect these

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:28.560 align:middle line:84%
and see the patterns and see
how they could all be connected.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.630 align:middle line:84%
>> What if the rotating
tetrahedron appearing over

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:36.130 align:middle line:84%
the Kremlin is of unknown
extraterrestrial origin?

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:39.220 align:middle line:84%
What might the significance
of this extraordinary event

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.776 align:middle line:90%
suggest?

00:11:40.776 --> 00:11:42.610 align:middle line:90%
>> This cannot be ignored.

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:44.620 align:middle line:84%
I believe this is
a communication

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.270 align:middle line:90%
to promote world peace.

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:48.520 align:middle line:84%
This is what the
extraterrestrials want,

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.695 align:middle line:84%
and this is what humanity
desperately needs.

00:11:50.695 --> 00:11:53.470 align:middle line:90%


00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:59.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Nine years and nine months
later, on December 19, 2018,

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:01.450 align:middle line:90%
the same pyramid-shaped object--

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:02.836 align:middle line:90%
>> Look up, look up, man.

00:12:02.836 --> 00:12:07.230 align:middle line:84%
>> --was observed and recorded
by at least four witnesses from

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:10.920 align:middle line:84%
three different locations
hovering very close

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.930 align:middle line:84%
to the Pentagon
in Washington, DC.

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:15.630 align:middle line:90%


00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:18.360 align:middle line:84%
How could a pyramid hover in
the airspace above the two

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.510 align:middle line:84%
most sensitive and
secure political military

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:24.540 align:middle line:90%
establishments on this planet?

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.000 align:middle line:84%
If real, these
two cases could be

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.920 align:middle line:84%
amongst the most
significant events

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:33.390 align:middle line:84%
in the history of
unidentified aerial phenomena.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.670 align:middle line:84%
The implications
are extraordinary

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:38.340 align:middle line:90%
and raise many questions.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:42.210 align:middle line:84%
Alex was one of the
witnesses from that night.

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:49.540 align:middle line:10%
>> I saw something hovering
over the Pentagon, far away.

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.970 align:middle line:10%
I did not understand
what is this.

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:57.010 align:middle line:10%
It was a black, big object.

00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:02.360 align:middle line:10%
I tried to film it with my
iPhone, but it didn't exist.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.960 align:middle line:10%
It was just pitch black sky.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:12.840 align:middle line:10%
But with my camera Nikon,
I could make some shots,

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.740 align:middle line:10%
and so that's the story.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.320 align:middle line:90%
But my life became really scary.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Just come on the way,
we shouldn't picture.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:26.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, basically I was
afraid to leave because I

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:28.510 align:middle line:90%
didn't know what the place.

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:31.810 align:middle line:84%
>> He was working on a
photography project around 4:00

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:35.320 align:middle line:84%
in the morning at Arlington
National Cemetery when he

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.505 align:middle line:90%
captured this video.

00:13:36.505 --> 00:13:39.720 align:middle line:90%


00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:43.590 align:middle line:10%
Alex estimated the size of
this tetrahedron-shaped object

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:47.670 align:middle line:10%
to the best of his abilities,
which was somewhere between 300

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:51.060 align:middle line:10%
to 600 feet at the base.

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Two other witnesses also
recorded the incident.

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:58.920 align:middle line:10%
Richard and Nick were at a
party that night with friends.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:02.460 align:middle line:84%
Around 4:00 in the morning,
they were driving in a taxi

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.410 align:middle line:84%
when they observed
a large object

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:05.910 align:middle line:90%
floating above the Pentagon.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:08.395 align:middle line:90%
>> Look up.

00:14:08.395 --> 00:14:10.383 align:middle line:90%
Look up, man.

00:14:10.383 --> 00:14:13.670 align:middle line:84%
>> They thought it was
a joke or a hologram.

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:17.600 align:middle line:84%
However, they decided to drive
around the area several times

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:21.030 align:middle line:84%
to take a closer look
at what was in the sky.

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:25.574 align:middle line:84%
These are the remarkable
images they captured.

00:14:25.574 --> 00:14:29.720 align:middle line:10%
>> So my first reaction
was this is very strange.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.200 align:middle line:10%
My second reaction was
we've got to record this.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:37.610 align:middle line:10%
And my first reaction was why
is it just around the Pentagon?

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:40.310 align:middle line:84%
Why did I never see
anything like this before?

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:42.860 align:middle line:90%
And why am I only seeing it now?

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, that was in Pentagon
early in the morning, not too

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:48.590 align:middle line:90%
many people around.

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:52.265 align:middle line:84%
My first reaction was,
what the hell is this?

00:14:52.265 --> 00:14:56.510 align:middle line:10%
>> I work in the music industry
so I'm seeing a lot of light

00:14:56.510 --> 00:15:00.410 align:middle line:10%
shows, but this is the Pentagon.

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:01.970 align:middle line:10%
It's not my house
or your house, it's

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:04.040 align:middle line:10%
not somebody's neighborhood.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.090 align:middle line:10%
It's the Pentagon.

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:09.920 align:middle line:10%
So when you see this,
my first reaction

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:13.040 align:middle line:10%
was it's going to be a joke.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:19.640 align:middle line:10%
But then I thought it can't
be a joke because the morning,

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.410 align:middle line:10%
it's 4:00 in the morning.

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:25.310 align:middle line:84%
Who's going to do a joke
and why you do a joke?

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Because you do a joke because
you want people to see.

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.200 align:middle line:84%
You don't do a joke at
4:00 in the morning.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:37.870 align:middle line:90%
So, well, I don't--

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:39.985 align:middle line:84%
I try not to believe
in anything strange.

00:15:39.985 --> 00:15:43.900 align:middle line:90%


00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:44.700 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:47.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what the
purpose was of this.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.530 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:53.600 align:middle line:84%
>> The second video of the
object was recorded a few

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.420 align:middle line:84%
minutes later, very
close to the Pentagon,

00:15:56.420 --> 00:16:01.640 align:middle line:84%
as they were traveling
under Interstate 395.

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:05.120 align:middle line:84%
They eventually had to exit on
Washington's South Boulevard

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:09.270 align:middle line:84%
to avoid reaching the
Pentagon's restricted area.

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:12.750 align:middle line:84%
The Pentagon is one of the
most highly secure institutions

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:14.020 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:15.210 align:middle line:90%
Why there?

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:16.800 align:middle line:90%
Was it a warning?

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.120 align:middle line:90%
Was it a message?

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:20.370 align:middle line:90%
Was it a communication attempt?

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And why over the Kremlin and the
Pentagon, in the two countries

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:28.884 align:middle line:84%
with the greatest nuclear
power in the world?

00:16:28.884 --> 00:16:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>> We have another
witness, Farou.

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:35.330 align:middle line:84%
Farou comes from
the Middle East.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Farou is married to
an American woman.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.600 align:middle line:84%
He was walking his dog,
3 o'clock in the morning

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.060 align:middle line:90%
at the Air Force Monument.

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:46.800 align:middle line:90%
From there, he saw it.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And this with witness,
Farou, is the first one

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:54.076 align:middle line:84%
who was able to record
it with a cell phone.

00:16:54.076 --> 00:16:56.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And I was squinting because
it was very difficult to see

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.500 align:middle line:84%
because there were a
few clouds in the sky.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:02.130 align:middle line:84%
But I could make out
the shape of a pyramid.

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:07.109 align:middle line:84%
It's a three-sided pyramid,
the bottom of the pyramid

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:09.119 align:middle line:84%
was lighter than
the sides, and it

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:11.430 align:middle line:90%
was rotating on its own axis.

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:12.240 align:middle line:90%
It was floating.

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.800 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't moving left
or right, up and down,

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:21.119 align:middle line:84%
it's just rotating on its own
axis like above the Pentagon.

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:25.500 align:middle line:84%
So I took up my mobile because
I was very surprised, of course.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:28.300 align:middle line:84%
So I like, wow, what
the hell is that?

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.710 align:middle line:84%
So I took off my mobile
and I try to film it.

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:33.390 align:middle line:90%
>> The image is good.

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:35.220 align:middle line:10%
You can see it's
further away, you

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:38.820 align:middle line:10%
can see the pyramid
is smaller, you

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:42.390 align:middle line:10%
can see the river,
the Potomac River,

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:46.950 align:middle line:10%
you can see one airplane coming
down and probably landing

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:49.770 align:middle line:10%
at the National
Airport in Washington.

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:54.270 align:middle line:84%
You have so many details
in this last video.

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:56.220 align:middle line:84%
They recorded this
with a camera.

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:59.700 align:middle line:10%
We have four different
videos recorded

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.310 align:middle line:10%
from four different angles.

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:05.860 align:middle line:84%
These people don't
know each other.

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:09.570 align:middle line:84%
They were in
different activities.

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:12.750 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this is the
most important sighting

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:15.570 align:middle line:10%
in the history of UFO.

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:18.510 align:middle line:10%
And considering
this is a hologram,

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:21.960 align:middle line:10%
would you do a hologram
above the Pentagon?

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.910 align:middle line:90%
What could happen to you?

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:26.340 align:middle line:84%
Could they accuse
you of terrorism?

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.560 align:middle line:84%
Could they put you
in jail for years

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.810 align:middle line:90%
just because you did a hologram?

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And again, the holograms
don't reflect the lights

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.040 align:middle line:90%
from the city.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:41.160 align:middle line:84%
A hologram, you can
see through them

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.360 align:middle line:90%
even though they are good--

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.090 align:middle line:84%
the hologram, you
see through them.

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Here we have this large
pyramidal structure that's all

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:51.390 align:middle line:90%
black.

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:55.140 align:middle line:84%
It's got this really low
reflective surface to it,

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:58.590 align:middle line:84%
and it's just sort of hovering
there and moving around

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:00.990 align:middle line:90%
in this circuitous pattern.

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And the witnesses that
are seeing this thing,

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.580 align:middle line:90%
they can't believe their eyes.

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:09.278 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely shocking.

00:19:09.278 --> 00:19:12.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Due to the poor quality of
both the Kremlin and Pentagon

00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:16.060 align:middle line:84%
videos, there are a number of
people who suggest that this is

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:19.980 align:middle line:90%
nothing more than a CGI hoax.

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Mark D'Antonio is the Mutual
UFO Network's chief photo/video

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:27.680 align:middle line:84%
analyst with a
degree in astronomy.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:31.380 align:middle line:10%
>> These videos purport to
show a pyramidal UFO over

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:33.320 align:middle line:10%
the Pentagon.

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:36.000 align:middle line:10%
If you can get past the
problem with anything appearing

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.010 align:middle line:10%
over the Pentagon not
being responded to

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:43.843 align:middle line:10%
by jet fighters, which to me
is a very, very long shot,

00:19:43.843 --> 00:19:45.760 align:middle line:10%
then you have to look
at just the UFO and say,

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.700 align:middle line:10%
OK, is there anything
in this UFO object

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.490 align:middle line:10%
that shows that it
might not be real?

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And in one of those
videos, I could

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:58.140 align:middle line:84%
see when the
pyramid rotated, you

it'll diffuse light down here,

There's many lights everywhere.

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:22.710 align:middle line:84%
So at the very least, the
light should have been diffused

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:26.670 align:middle line:84%
and even as it was rotating,
generally it would fade,

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.290 align:middle line:90%
generally it would brighten.

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:31.890 align:middle line:84%

hot spots on it.

received every jet plane that

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:14.040 align:middle line:84%
came after them, and the UFOs
did loop-de-loops around them,

they did over and unders, they
did backwards, forwards, they

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:21.000 align:middle line:84%

embarrassment after 14 days

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:33.000 align:middle line:84%
that the Air Force
was just called back.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.900 align:middle line:10%

was never repeated

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:45.440 align:middle line:84%
who originally
uploaded the images

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.450 align:middle line:84%
deleted all of their
personal information.

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:50.780 align:middle line:84%
It was only possible to
obtain the information

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:54.620 align:middle line:84%
of the first YouTube user
who copied the video.

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:57.920 align:middle line:10%
Just two days later,
on January 31st,

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:00.260 align:middle line:10%
another user claimed
to have discovered

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:02.220 align:middle line:10%
that it was a forgery.

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:04.430 align:middle line:84%
According to the
researcher, the figure

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:08.030 align:middle line:84%
of Turkish Prime Minister
Recep Tayyip Erdogan

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:11.090 align:middle line:84%
was replaced with that
of the Russian CEO

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:15.110 align:middle line:84%
in an exceptional piece of
computer-generated imaging.

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:18.050 align:middle line:84%
Here, we can see the original
recording of the speech

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:20.330 align:middle line:84%
from the Prime
Minister of Turkey.

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:23.060 align:middle line:84%
It is a very
sophisticated manipulation

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:27.380 align:middle line:84%
of a video demonstrating
a high level of expertise.

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:31.280 align:middle line:84%
When carefully comparing both
images, the deception is clear.

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:34.790 align:middle line:84%
Without actually knowing
that this is a manipulation,

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:38.210 align:middle line:84%
the new version is almost
impossible to detect.

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:40.940 align:middle line:84%
It is evident that
this extraordinary work

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:43.640 align:middle line:84%
was done by highly-skilled
professionals.

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:44.870 align:middle line:90%
But why?

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:49.280 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that the UN
video was created as a hoax

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:53.690 align:middle line:84%
to generate confusion toward the
authenticity of the event that

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:55.460 align:middle line:90%
occurred over the Pentagon?

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:57.680 align:middle line:84%
>> I've seen this
in other places.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.540 align:middle line:90%
There's two levels of this.

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:02.150 align:middle line:84%
This hoax video at
the United Nations

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:07.790 align:middle line:84%
was created by a psychological
operation from the Cabal.

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And they had the cooperation
of this lady, this Aliya,

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:16.520 align:middle line:84%
and the reason that they do
these operations, number one,

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:19.700 align:middle line:84%
is to try to take
control of the agenda

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:24.440 align:middle line:84%
because they believe that the
pyramid appearances are going

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:28.130 align:middle line:84%
to continue into
the future, perhaps

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:32.360 align:middle line:84%
over other military
installations in other nations.

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:34.460 align:middle line:84%
The second level
that I know of is

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:37.190 align:middle line:84%
that if it is found
to be a fraud, then

00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:41.150 align:middle line:84%
they will qualify the
entire phenomena as a fraud

00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:43.550 align:middle line:84%
even though there's
no other indications

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:45.920 align:middle line:90%
that the pyramids are fraud.

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.230 align:middle line:84%
By connecting this United
Nations announcement which

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:50.540 align:middle line:84%
is a fraud to the
pyramid phenomena,

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:53.540 align:middle line:84%
then it makes people believe
the whole phenomena qualifies

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:54.725 align:middle line:90%
as a fraud.

00:30:54.725 --> 00:30:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Whether the pyramid-shaped
object in these videos are

00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:00.860 align:middle line:84%
proven to be authentic
is yet to be determined,

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:04.790 align:middle line:84%
but the UN video announcing
extraterrestrial contact is

00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:06.440 align:middle line:90%
definitely a hoax.

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:14.570 align:middle line:10%
>> How could someone could knew
every single speech from the UN

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:18.800 align:middle line:10%
and be able to change
one character for another

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.540 align:middle line:10%
character?

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:23.090 align:middle line:10%
It's almost impossible.

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:28.310 align:middle line:10%
It means that the same
person who did the hoax

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:34.190 align:middle line:10%
did the finding of the hoax.

00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:39.620 align:middle line:10%
Nobody knows who did the
original video the real hoax

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:42.390 align:middle line:10%
and who demonstrated
that this was a hoax.

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:46.100 align:middle line:10%
There is no names
though under that.

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:51.140 align:middle line:10%
It means that they wanted to
discredit not just these hoax

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:53.930 align:middle line:10%
in this video,
but they also want

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:59.060 align:middle line:10%
to discredit any
video related to this.

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:01.976 align:middle line:10%
And that is why they did it.

00:32:01.976 --> 00:32:06.110 align:middle line:84%
>> This video of the UN reminds
me of another occurrence that

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:08.150 align:middle line:84%
was very similar to
this whole operation.

00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:12.360 align:middle line:90%


00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:17.130 align:middle line:84%
On January 11, 2011, I
had a task force operation

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:19.022 align:middle line:90%
that was going on in Israel.

00:32:19.022 --> 00:32:21.480 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing secret about
it because it came to nothing.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.220 align:middle line:84%
The reason it came
to nothing was

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:27.420 align:middle line:84%
because suddenly our
operators in the ground

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:29.070 align:middle line:90%
told us the operation is over.

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:34.450 align:middle line:84%
We have had the arrival, the
same thing this woman is saying

00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:37.380 align:middle line:84%
about the pyramids that
alien visitors have

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:40.575 align:middle line:84%
arrived in Jerusalem and
everybody is going nuts.

00:32:40.575 --> 00:32:43.470 align:middle line:90%


00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:46.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, what occurred
is we had this sort--

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:50.940 align:middle line:84%
it looked like a plasma
UFO and it came down,

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:54.270 align:middle line:84%
there was 1:00 in the morning in
Jerusalem, a residential area.

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:57.962 align:middle line:10%
So there were lots of
civilians out and tourists.

00:32:57.962 --> 00:32:59.970 align:middle line:10%
>> You can almost
hardly look at it.

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:03.610 align:middle line:10%
>> And so we have lots
of genuine videos of this

00:33:03.610 --> 00:33:06.940 align:middle line:10%
phenomena from different
angles from many witnesses,

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:09.302 align:middle line:10%
and it really happened.

00:33:09.302 --> 00:33:11.415 align:middle line:90%
>> Whoa.

00:33:11.415 --> 00:33:16.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I had a visit from
a senior government official.

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:18.310 align:middle line:90%
His name is Milsud.

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:21.490 align:middle line:84%
He said by the morning, you'll
have a bunch of fake videos

00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:25.000 align:middle line:84%
that will be uploaded to
take over the algorithm.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.100 align:middle line:84%
At that time, we didn't
even know what that meant.

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:29.530 align:middle line:10%
To take over the algorithm
of these millions

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:33.220 align:middle line:10%
of people going to look
up, Dome of the Rock UFO.

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:36.470 align:middle line:84%
Dome of the Rock UFO, that's
what everybody was looking for.

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:39.280 align:middle line:10%
And he said, there will
be lots of fake videos,

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.855 align:middle line:10%
and this whole thing
will be quashed.

00:33:41.855 --> 00:33:43.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Holy shit.

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And he told us that he is
from people who oversee this

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:53.740 align:middle line:84%
sort of things, that he
is someone who takes care

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:59.220 align:middle line:84%
of things because people are not
ready to know the truth about

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:00.600 align:middle line:90%
alien visitors.

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.840 align:middle line:84%
By the next day, happened
exactly as he said.

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:08.380 align:middle line:84%
All the original, the real
videos were taken down

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:12.820 align:middle line:84%
and fake sort of
CGI-looking crappy videos

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:17.980 align:middle line:84%
were uploaded under the
algorithm Dome of the Rock UFO.

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:22.929 align:middle line:84%
And in the same way, I see this
operation Cabal operation over

00:34:22.929 --> 00:34:24.416 align:middle line:90%
at the UN.

00:34:24.416 --> 00:34:28.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Then again, they declare the
video is a hoax and the great

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:31.040 align:middle line:84%
part about that is you
could just dismiss it all,

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.760 align:middle line:84%
deny everything, and
it didn't happen.

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>> I can tell you categorically
that as an FBI agent retired

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:44.120 align:middle line:84%
who's done 25 years
of investigations,

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:48.800 align:middle line:84%
who has investigated
numerous UFO phenomena,

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:52.340 align:middle line:84%
I found both authentic,
and I found frauds also.

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:56.000 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you categorically,
the pyramid incidents

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.310 align:middle line:84%
over the Kremlin and
over the Pentagon

00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:04.017 align:middle line:84%
appear to be absolutely valid,
authentic UFO phenomena.

00:35:04.017 --> 00:35:05.350 align:middle line:90%
That's what it looks like to me.

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:08.759 align:middle line:90%


00:35:08.759 --> 00:35:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been journalist
investigative reporter for 50

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:15.640 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And what really convinced
me about these two cases

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:23.950 align:middle line:84%
being real is that in
every one of those cases,

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:29.230 align:middle line:84%
there were more than one
witness, more than one video.

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:32.860 align:middle line:10%
I was the only one
who has approach

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:37.930 align:middle line:10%
to the witnesses in Russia
and in the United States.

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:39.460 align:middle line:90%
They were surprised.

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:43.540 align:middle line:84%
They never thought
that this was a UFO.

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:46.330 align:middle line:84%
They thought it
was something else

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:51.250 align:middle line:84%
until I made them think
that this was probably

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:53.710 align:middle line:90%
something extraordinary.

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>> When you look at all the
events going around these two

00:35:56.530 --> 00:36:01.750 align:middle line:84%
separate UAP incidents over
the symbols of world power

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:05.620 align:middle line:84%
and force, these are the
extraterrestrials sending us

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:08.980 align:middle line:84%
the signal to say, we know
you have advanced technologies

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:12.690 align:middle line:84%
and you really need to
go the way of peace.

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:17.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the take-away message
is that we are watching you,

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:22.600 align:middle line:84%
we are maintaining
stability on your actions,

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:26.530 align:middle line:84%
and we may interfere again,
depending on what kinds

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:30.430 align:middle line:84%
of missiles are being sent
over what types of countries

00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:31.520 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:34.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that's
a good message.

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:36.320 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a very
positive message.

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think missiles interfered
with, missiles stopped,

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:46.270 align:middle line:84%
my first thought is
benevolent alien visitors

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:50.660 align:middle line:84%
interference with this
in a good positive way.

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:51.550 align:middle line:90%
That's what I see.

00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:54.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's so
important this case.

00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:56.890 align:middle line:84%
It's even more
important than Roswell.

00:36:56.890 --> 00:37:00.610 align:middle line:84%
This is the most important
case ever because it involves

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:03.010 align:middle line:84%
the Kremlin, involves
the Pentagon,

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:05.830 align:middle line:84%
involves a huge
UFO that was there

00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:10.870 align:middle line:84%
not just for a few seconds
and sending a clear message.

00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:14.360 align:middle line:84%
No one, no one is
talking about this.

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:15.670 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:18.190 align:middle line:84%
This case needs to
be investigated.

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:21.640 align:middle line:84%
It needs to be presented
to the American public.

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:30.028 align:middle line:84%
It needs to be really find
out what the hell means this.

00:37:30.028 --> 00:37:32.620 align:middle line:10%
>> The events that
occurred on December 9,

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:36.460 align:middle line:10%
2009 above the Kremlin
and on December 19,

00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:41.200 align:middle line:10%
2018 over the Pentagon may
be related to the safety

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:45.940 align:middle line:10%
and security of the world
as world tensions escalate

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:50.410 align:middle line:10%
and nations race to levels of
military technology we have not

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:52.420 align:middle line:10%
seen for decades.

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Is it conceivable that
we might find ourselves

00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:58.420 align:middle line:84%
facing the possibility
of a war-like conflict

00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:00.950 align:middle line:90%
of great proportions?

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:02.630 align:middle line:84%
Might the pyramids
appearing over

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:05.030 align:middle line:84%
