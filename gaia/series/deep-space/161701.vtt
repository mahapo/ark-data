>> When we examine the various
planets that exist in our solar

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.370 align:middle line:84%
system, perhaps the most
enigmatic of all is the planet

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.780 align:middle line:90%
Saturn.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.210 align:middle line:84%
The sixth planet
from the sun, Saturn

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.690 align:middle line:84%
has many unique features
that remain unexplained.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Look at the work of a
man called Norman Bergrun.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.820 align:middle line:10%
He was a straight up and down
scientist from the mainstream.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.670 align:middle line:10%
He was looking at things
as the mainstream does,

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.200 align:middle line:10%
from the song sheet.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.989 align:middle line:84%
And then his life
changed when he

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.810 align:middle line:84%
started seeing the pictures
coming back from the early 80s,

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.990 align:middle line:84%
when there were
the Voyager craft

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.240 align:middle line:84%
missions to Saturn to get
a look at this amazing body

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.620 align:middle line:90%
with its rings.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And what Bergrun saw
from these pictures

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.950 align:middle line:84%
was a progression which showed
him that the rings were not

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.650 align:middle line:84%
something that were made or
formed and then stood still,

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.280 align:middle line:84%
but were actually changing
picture from picture, sometimes

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.720 align:middle line:90%
in minutes.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote a book called
"Ringmakers of Saturn"

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.250 align:middle line:90%
detailing his findings.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.710 align:middle line:84%
But when Bergrun then looked
at the pictures of Cassini,

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.070 align:middle line:84%
he was even more flabbergasted
because these rings

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.440 align:middle line:90%
were changing dramatically.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.220 align:middle line:84%
But there was one thing more
than anything that stood out.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.650 align:middle line:10%
In these pictures, he could see
not what he called spacecraft

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.800 align:middle line:10%
but what he called
electromagnetic vehicles--

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.360 align:middle line:10%
fantastic size electromagnetic
vehicles, two, three times

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.477 align:middle line:10%
the Earth and more.

00:02:14.477 --> 00:02:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you've only got
to look at the size of Saturn

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.360 align:middle line:84%
to the Earth to see
the difference in size

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.280 align:middle line:90%
is just extraordinary.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.950 align:middle line:10%
And as he was observing the
pictures of these vehicles,

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.800 align:middle line:10%
he was seeing exhaust
coming out of them--

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.900 align:middle line:10%
what he calls plasma exhaust--

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.700 align:middle line:10%
that were making the rings and
were changing their nature.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And then of course,
you've started

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.660 align:middle line:84%
to see in the
mainstream media stories

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.490 align:middle line:84%
saying that the
rings have changed.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.770 align:middle line:84%
The rings have got bigger,
and no one knows why.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.490 align:middle line:10%
>> There are some rumors and
stories of very interesting

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.893 align:middle line:10%
objects in the rings of Saturn.

00:02:49.893 --> 00:02:52.060 align:middle line:10%
The most important one, I
think, is called the thing

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.250 align:middle line:10%
in the ring, which was
actually spotted by NASA.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.050 align:middle line:90%
It's been recorded.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.467 align:middle line:84%
There have been
photographs of it.

00:02:57.467 --> 00:02:59.890 align:middle line:84%
They're a little blurry,
but it is this wedge

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.850 align:middle line:84%
shaped block like object in
Saturn's rings, which actually

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.610 align:middle line:84%
has been giving off radio
signals off and on now

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.410 align:middle line:90%
for, again, 25 or 30 years.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And nobody really
knows what it is.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.873 align:middle line:84%
There has been speculation
that it might be artificial.

00:03:12.873 --> 00:03:15.040 align:middle line:84%
There have been some
interesting, scholarly articles

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.850 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And the bottom line is it
remains a mystery to this day.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And even with the
Cassini probe up

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.090 align:middle line:84%
there taking all
kinds of measurements,

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.800 align:middle line:84%
using all of its
different instruments,

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.980 align:middle line:84%
taking photographs of the area,
nobody really knows what it is.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.322 align:middle line:84%
But it certainly doesn't
appear to belong there.

00:03:29.322 --> 00:03:30.655 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't appear to be natural.

00:03:30.655 --> 00:03:33.385 align:middle line:90%


00:03:33.385 --> 00:03:40.120 align:middle line:84%
>> NASA has these pictures, and
it absolutely fits the ancient

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.660 align:middle line:84%
accounts and the tremendous
research of David Talbott

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.080 align:middle line:90%
in "The Saturn Myth"--

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.350 align:middle line:84%
that actually Saturn
was once ringlets,

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.727 align:middle line:84%
and these rings are
actually formed.

00:03:49.727 --> 00:03:50.560 align:middle line:90%
They're not natural.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.340 align:middle line:90%
They've been created.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And when I look at pictures of
the Saturn rings, what I see

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.250 align:middle line:90%
is a DVD or a CD.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.960 align:middle line:84%
It's a broadcasting
system of fantastic power.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And I was sent a picture by
a professional sound engineer

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.029 align:middle line:84%
of a ring of Saturn taken
from a certain angle.

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:20.920 align:middle line:90%
And he said that sound!

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.180 align:middle line:90%
He said I see that every day.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And there's a sound frequency
or frequencies coming off

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Saturn which I say is
having a massive impact

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.790 align:middle line:84%
on human sense of
perception, sense of reality.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.670 align:middle line:84%
But it's also having
an impact on Saturn,

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.720 align:middle line:84%
because what these
missions to Saturn found--

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.690 align:middle line:84%
and we can use the word
permanent in the sense

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.350 align:middle line:84%
that since they were first
seen, they're still here--

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.060 align:middle line:84%
at the southern pole
of Saturn, you've

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.000 align:middle line:84%
got a storm that looks
just like an eye.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And at the northern
pole, you've got

00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:01.600 align:middle line:84%
this absolutely extraordinary
phenomenon of a hexagon storm

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.220 align:middle line:84%
where clouds are whipping
around at an enormous speed

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.970 align:middle line:84%
and changing direction
at 60 degrees.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
NASA mainstream

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.460 align:middle line:90%
has no idea what this is.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.870 align:middle line:90%
They can't explain it.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.314 align:middle line:90%


00:05:20.314 --> 00:05:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>> There isn't really any
basis in physics-- geophysics,

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.170 align:middle line:84%
planetary physics-- that can
explain why you would have this

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.840 align:middle line:84%
tunnel of clouds that would
make these sharp turns and form

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.640 align:middle line:90%
a hexagon.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.250 align:middle line:84%
So to me, I think that's
the most unusual feature

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.025 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:05:37.025 --> 00:05:40.620 align:middle line:84%
>> What Hans Jenny discovered
was that he could take a drop

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.760 align:middle line:84%
of water and have these free
floating particles of sand

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.780 align:middle line:90%
in it called colloidals.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's called
colloidal suspension.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And if you have the water
with colloidal suspension,

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.970 align:middle line:84%
normally it's just
going to look milky.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.320 align:middle line:84%
There will be no
distinct forms at all.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.760 align:middle line:84%
However, once Dr. Jenny
started to vibrate the water

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.310 align:middle line:84%
with the diatonic
sound frequency, which

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.730 align:middle line:84%
is the white keys on the
piano, then all of a sudden

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:09.360 align:middle line:84%
those sand particles would
mysteriously arrange themselves

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.560 align:middle line:90%
into geometric patterns.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.320 align:middle line:10%
These patterns included
square, triangle, diamond,

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.830 align:middle line:10%
hexagonal shapes
just like we see

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.520 align:middle line:10%
on the North Pole of Saturn,
as well as in some cases

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.630 align:middle line:10%
pentagonal symmetry, which does
not occur in normal crystal

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:28.990 align:middle line:10%
formation.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.380 align:middle line:84%
This is a very strange
finding in science.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at the ancient
mystery school teachings,

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.580 align:middle line:84%
there's a very consistent
thread of scholarship suggesting

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.980 align:middle line:84%
that geometry is
the key to unlocking

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.450 align:middle line:90%
the secrets of the universe.

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:45.300 align:middle line:90%

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.630 align:middle line:84%
We look at the ancient
Tibetan and Hindu mandalas,

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:55.680 align:middle line:84%
and they show what appear to be
matrices of geometry unfolding,

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.510 align:middle line:84%
and then attribute
these matrices

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:01.960 align:middle line:84%
to the nature of the universe,
to the nature of creation.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.460 align:middle line:84%
There are undoubtedly so many
reports of anecdotal people

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.570 align:middle line:84%
having psychedelic experiences
and seeing geometric patterns

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.480 align:middle line:84%
while they're in that exotic
state of consciousness.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.330 align:middle line:84%
We take a closer examination
through the problem

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:16.650 align:middle line:90%
of geometry.

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.080 align:middle line:84%
We discover that the
planets are gating

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.760 align:middle line:84%
through hyper
dimensional energy.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.380 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that was originally

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.200 align:middle line:84%
discovered by Lieutenant
Colonel Tom Bearden

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.330 align:middle line:84%
and then was picked
up by Richard C

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.275 align:middle line:84%
Hoagland in his classic book
"The Monuments of Mars."

00:07:30.275 --> 00:07:33.290 align:middle line:90%


00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.020 align:middle line:84%
We can look at certain
examples in our solar system

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.960 align:middle line:84%
and see examples in
this fluid geometry

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.790 align:middle line:90%
by how the planets look.

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:43.730 align:middle line:90%

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:49.120 align:middle line:90%


00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there is an idea
that the universe is actually

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:55.480 align:middle line:84%
controlled by a theory
that was developed way,

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.200 align:middle line:84%
way back in the late 1980s
called hyper dimensional

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.130 align:middle line:90%
physics.

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is pretty
simply that everything

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:04.110 align:middle line:84%
in this universe, everything
in this 3D universe

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:06.660 align:middle line:84%
actually receives energy
from a higher spatial

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.130 align:middle line:84%
dimension-- the fourth
dimension, the fifth dimension,

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:10.600 align:middle line:90%
however that may be.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.110 align:middle line:84%
There are a number
of calculations

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:16.980 align:middle line:84%
by these very, very exotic
mathematical theorists which

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:17.970 align:middle line:90%
is called topology.

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And in topology, it
really kind of describes

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.860 align:middle line:84%
these higher spatial dimensions,
what they might look like.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.110 align:middle line:84%
It also explains
their signatures here

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:26.820 align:middle line:84%
in the three
dimensional universe.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is that
somewhere in a given system

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:33.990 align:middle line:84%
like our solar system, you're
going to have upwellings

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:36.539 align:middle line:84%
of energy-- which would be at
certain places on a planetary

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:37.679 align:middle line:90%
sphere--

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:40.450 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to have
inwelling points of energy.

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And it says in the math that
the inwelling point is going

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.260 align:middle line:90%
to be shaped like a hexagon.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.090 align:middle line:84%
So I wonder if
maybe Saturn isn't

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:50.760 align:middle line:84%
kind of a gateway to
that higher dimension

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.280 align:middle line:84%
where energy from this
universe is going back

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.762 align:middle line:90%
up into those higher realms.

00:08:55.762 --> 00:08:59.930 align:middle line:10%
>> My answer to why the 19.5
degree point has the swirling

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:04.160 align:middle line:10%
activity is that just like
in Hans Jenny's experiments,

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.520 align:middle line:10%
when you vibrate that water
those particles of sand appear

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.200 align:middle line:10%
in a geometric pattern.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.610 align:middle line:90%
But they're always moving.

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:12.230 align:middle line:90%
They don't sit still.

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.000 align:middle line:84%
They're actually
moving very quickly.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.120 align:middle line:84%
There's more motion at a
faster speed in the geometry

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.460 align:middle line:84%
than there is anywhere
else in the water.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.658 align:middle line:84%
So in that same
way if the geometry

00:09:21.658 --> 00:09:23.200 align:middle line:84%
is affecting the
planet, you're going

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.160 align:middle line:84%
to get that same
amount of motion,

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.740 align:middle line:84%
that same amount of
swirling in the areas where

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:29.300 align:middle line:90%
the geometry is.

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.730 align:middle line:84%
So in the gas planet, it's going
to swirl the clouds around.

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And in the solid planet, it's
going to swirl the magma around

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.000 align:middle line:84%
under the crust,
which then breaks

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.460 align:middle line:84%
through the crust
as a volcano which

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:45.930 align:middle line:84%
we see in Hawaii at 19.5
and at Olympus Mons.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:49.340 align:middle line:84%
So you have visible atmospheric
or crustal phenomena,

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.620 align:middle line:90%
and you have portal effects.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:53.540 align:middle line:84%
So now let's look
back at Saturn.

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.450 align:middle line:84%
We have an undeniable
hexagonal shape.

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:58.190 align:middle line:84%
Even skeptical
scientists have had

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:01.310 align:middle line:84%
to admit that this is a
functional characteristic

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:05.190 align:middle line:90%
of fluid dynamics behavior.

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:07.430 align:middle line:84%
So that's not even
being disputed anymore.

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:10.863 align:middle line:84%
Fluid dynamics are actually
the only reasonable answer

00:10:10.863 --> 00:10:12.530 align:middle line:84%
as to how these
patterns could be there.

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:15.904 align:middle line:90%


00:10:15.904 --> 00:10:19.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Hoagland talked about
how the upwelling point was

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:23.258 align:middle line:84%
at 19.5 degrees, give or
take a planetary body,

00:10:23.258 --> 00:10:24.550 align:middle line:90%
a spinning body like the Earth.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:27.250 align:middle line:84%
For instance on Earth, there
is the Mauna Kea volcano

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.650 align:middle line:84%
which is the highest
shield volcano on Earth

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:31.270 align:middle line:90%
at 19.5 degrees.

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:32.900 align:middle line:84%
You have the great
red spot of Jupiter,

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.450 align:middle line:90%
which is 19.5 degrees south.

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:38.590 align:middle line:84%
This has to do with the geometry
of a circumscribed tetrahedron.

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:40.720 align:middle line:84%
So you've got these
outwelling points of energy

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.137 align:middle line:84%
coming from the
higher dimensions,

00:10:42.137 --> 00:10:45.280 align:middle line:84%
and the inwelling point would
be this hexagonal shape.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Sure enough, we went out looking
and we found that on Saturn,

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.470 align:middle line:90%
and that storm has been there.

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:54.130 align:middle line:84%
Those winds have been doing
that now for well over 30 years,

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:55.510 align:middle line:90%
and they have not dissipated.

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:56.980 align:middle line:90%
They have not changed.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And something is
driving it, and there

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.390 align:middle line:84%
is no conventional
explanation in physics

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:04.794 align:middle line:90%
that could account for it.

00:11:04.794 --> 00:11:06.950 align:middle line:84%
>> The classic
example, of course,

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:10.600 align:middle line:84%
is the vortex that would be
at 19.5 degrees north or south

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.770 align:middle line:90%
of the equator.

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And Hoagland went
through this extensively.

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:16.910 align:middle line:84%
The most obvious example
would be on Jupiter,

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:21.220 align:middle line:84%
where you have the great red
spot at 19.5 degrees south,

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.310 align:middle line:84%
which is a stable consistent
hurricane you could fit

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:27.850 align:middle line:90%
five Earths in side by side.

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And it has been there
ever since the dawn

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:32.830 align:middle line:84%
of the invention of the
telescope in the 1600s, that we

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:35.720 align:middle line:84%
know of, and probably
a lot longer.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.110 align:middle line:84%
It stays there and
doesn't change latitude.

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:39.970 align:middle line:90%
It's just spinning and spinning.

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:43.090 align:middle line:84%
We also see that there is a
great dark spot on Neptune,

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:44.770 align:middle line:90%
and it's on the same latitude.

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:48.700 align:middle line:84%
We see that the sunspots on the
sun tend to be at 19.5 north

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:52.180 align:middle line:84%
and 19.5 south and
really nowhere else.

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:55.570 align:middle line:84%
Also when we look at solid
planets like Earth or Mars

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:58.240 align:middle line:84%
where they have a crust,
we see huge volcanoes

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.670 align:middle line:90%
that appear at this latitude.

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And they only appear to be
the largest at that latitude

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:04.990 align:middle line:90%
like we see on Mars.

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:07.810 align:middle line:84%
The biggest volcano, twice
the height of Mount Everest,

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:11.900 align:middle line:84%
called Olympus Mons
exists right at the 19.5.

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And then if you go one
tetrahexagonal turn off,

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.620 align:middle line:84%
you have where the face
of Mars is, Cydonia.

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.028 align:middle line:84%
It's 120 degrees
away in longitude,

00:12:21.028 --> 00:12:22.570 align:middle line:84%
so it definitely
appears that there's

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:25.870 align:middle line:84%
some sort of multi-dimensional
energy going on that's

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.400 align:middle line:90%
causing this to happen.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.110 align:middle line:84%
Now the theory gets
more interesting

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:31.780 align:middle line:84%
when we look at what
has happened with Earth,

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.420 align:middle line:84%
because Dr. Ivan T
Sanderson investigated

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.000 align:middle line:84%
the so-called Bermuda
Triangle phenomena.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.010 align:middle line:10%
He was the first
to really do that,

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.470 align:middle line:10%
and this was picked up
by Charles Berlitz who

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:44.140 align:middle line:10%
wrote the classic book
"The Bermuda Triangle"

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:47.472 align:middle line:10%
and also coined the
term Bermuda Triangle.

00:12:47.472 --> 00:12:51.230 align:middle line:84%
>> But it is not just the rings
or the odd geometry that make

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:53.180 align:middle line:90%
Saturn so enigmatic.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:55.490 align:middle line:84%
As NASA's Cassini
mission showed,

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:57.620 align:middle line:84%
some of the moons
of Saturn are also

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.840 align:middle line:90%
a puzzle waiting to be solved.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.457 align:middle line:84%
>> Saturn's moons are
about as weird as it gets.

00:13:02.457 --> 00:13:04.040 align:middle line:84%
You've got Enceladus
now where they're

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.110 align:middle line:84%
pretty sure there's
a subsurface ocean,

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:09.650 align:middle line:84%
similar to probably there's an
ocean on the moon of Jupiter

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:10.543 align:middle line:90%
named Europa.

00:13:10.543 --> 00:13:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And now it appears that a
whole bunch of these moons

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:16.280 align:middle line:84%
might actually have liquid water
below their visible surfaces.

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.800 align:middle line:84%
Now this is really interesting,
because when you have

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.270 align:middle line:90%
water you probably have life.

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:22.980 align:middle line:84%
That means you have enough
heat for life to be created.

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.460 align:middle line:84%
It's only a question now
of going there, landing,

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:28.280 align:middle line:84%
drilling through the ice, and
putting submarines in there

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:32.600 align:middle line:84%
and seeing if, in fact, there
is some life on these worlds.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.510 align:middle line:84%
The most interesting one to
me has always been Iapetus.

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:37.670 align:middle line:84%
Now again, it's been
discovered or pointed out

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:40.460 align:middle line:84%
by researchers, especially
Richard C Hoagland,

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:42.650 align:middle line:84%
that Iapetus has all
the characteristics

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:44.420 align:middle line:84%
you would expect of
an artificial body,

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:45.890 align:middle line:90%
an artificial moon.

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:47.990 align:middle line:84%
It's orbiting at about
a 60 degree angle, which

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:49.290 align:middle line:90%
is kind of very different.

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:51.830 align:middle line:84%
It's not in the orbit of
the other moons of Saturn.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And it has a horizon that
is shaped geometrically.

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:57.870 align:middle line:84%
It does not have a
spherical curve to it.

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:01.290 align:middle line:84%
It has a very distinct
set of equally long lines

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:02.090 align:middle line:90%
on the horizon.

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And you can see this in a
number of different photographs

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:06.230 align:middle line:84%
that have been taken
by Iapetus, that it

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:07.890 align:middle line:90%
has this polygonal shape to it.

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:10.670 align:middle line:84%
In fact, some people argue
that it's a dodecahedron.

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:14.540 align:middle line:84%
It's an actual dodecahedron
that has got dirt, debris,

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:16.425 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of
staining on top of it

00:14:16.425 --> 00:14:18.050 align:middle line:84%
that has made it look
more like a moon.

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:21.020 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, it appears to
be an artificial satellite.

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:23.600 align:middle line:84%
In addition to that,
there is this ring

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.370 align:middle line:84%
around the center of
it that kind of makes

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:26.990 align:middle line:90%
Iapetus look like a walnut.

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:29.160 align:middle line:84%
It looks like it
was glued together,

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.580 align:middle line:84%
and a little bit of the glue
beaded up around the equator.

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And the fascinating
thing about that is it's

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:35.540 align:middle line:90%
right on the equator itself.

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:37.130 align:middle line:84%
It's right where
you would put it

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:39.303 align:middle line:84%
if you were manufacturing
a death star.

00:14:39.303 --> 00:14:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
people that argue--

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:43.040 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not going to
disagree with them--

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.540 align:middle line:84%
that's exactly
what the thing is.

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:46.700 align:middle line:84%
It's some sort of
planetary body,

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:50.481 align:middle line:84%
a Dyson sphere, or as we might
call it today a death star.

[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC]

00:14:53.367 --> 00:14:58.177 align:middle line:90%


00:14:58.177 --> 00:15:00.850 align:middle line:10%
>> It's important also to
remember that if you actually

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:04.000 align:middle line:10%
read the book "2001:
A Space Odyssey"

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.900 align:middle line:10%
that the planet that Commander
David Bowman goes to with HAL

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.350 align:middle line:10%
was Saturn, not Jupiter.

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:12.670 align:middle line:84%
It was Stanley Kubrick
that wanted to change it

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:15.550 align:middle line:84%
to Saturn for visual
and creative purposes

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:19.910 align:middle line:84%
and was worried about getting
the rings right and stuff.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:22.400 align:middle line:84%
But then we have some very
strange things around Saturn,

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:25.640 align:middle line:84%
like the moon Iapetus
which is white on one side

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.080 align:middle line:90%
and black on the other.

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And that was a key part
to the book as well.

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:32.150 align:middle line:84%
Iapetus was the gateway
that led to whatever

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:35.210 align:middle line:90%
this portal was around Saturn.

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:37.010 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking at
people tipping us off

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:39.185 align:middle line:90%
that portal phenomena may exist.

00:15:39.185 --> 00:15:43.314 align:middle line:90%


00:15:43.314 --> 00:15:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>> The question of whether
Iapetus is still occupied is

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:47.390 align:middle line:90%
wide open.

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:48.380 align:middle line:90%
Nobody really knows.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:51.313 align:middle line:10%
It appears to be abandoned,
and certainly logically, we

00:15:51.313 --> 00:15:53.980 align:middle line:10%
would assume it's been there for
millions and millions of years.

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.280 align:middle line:10%
So it seems doubtful to me
that it would be occupied.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:57.710 align:middle line:10%
But who knows?

00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:00.995 align:middle line:10%
Who knows where ET's got his
bases in the solar system?

00:16:00.995 --> 00:16:02.120 align:middle line:90%
And who knows who built it?

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.710 align:middle line:90%
Was it built by human hands?

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:05.150 align:middle line:90%
Was it built by alien hands?

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:07.550 align:middle line:84%
Was it built by
extraterrestrial hands,

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:10.520 align:middle line:84%
which I would say
are people like us,

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.650 align:middle line:84%
humanoids that built an
environment for themselves out

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:14.450 align:middle line:90%
at Saturn.

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:15.815 align:middle line:84%
The question is, why
would you build it

00:16:15.815 --> 00:16:17.870 align:middle line:84%
so far away from Earth
and the inner solar system

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:20.360 align:middle line:84%
where you've got a
lot more life teeming

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:23.150 align:middle line:84%
on various different planets,
or at least at one time we did?

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>> It is interesting to
note that NASA is sending

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:27.680 align:middle line:84%
the Cassini space
probe to Saturn,

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.950 align:middle line:84%
knowing that it has 72
pounds of plutonium on it.

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:33.020 align:middle line:84%
This is something they've
tried to do before,

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:36.560 align:middle line:84%
and we've heard that
from multiple experts.

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.500 align:middle line:84%
They want to take a
radioactive nuclear bomb,

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.590 align:middle line:84%
and then plunge it into a
hydrogen laced atmosphere

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:45.290 align:middle line:84%
of a planet like
Jupiter or Saturn,

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:47.990 align:middle line:84%
because they have this
mythological belief that's

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:50.550 align:middle line:84%
probably not a myth
that there's going

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:54.950 align:middle line:84%
to be some sort of reactivation
of a planet into a star.

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And this was directly
laid out for the public

00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:03.270 align:middle line:84%
to see at the end of Arthur
C Clarke's book "2010."

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:04.410 align:middle line:90%
We've got to get out there.

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:06.180 align:middle line:84%
We have to explore
these planets.

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:09.150 align:middle line:10%
And they're telling us that when
they put out their manifesto

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:10.470 align:middle line:10%
in "2010."

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:13.140 align:middle line:84%
We see countless
Earth like planets

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:15.750 align:middle line:84%
that are in what we call the
Goldilocks Zone, that are

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:17.890 align:middle line:90%
near their star and have water.

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:19.140 align:middle line:90%
They're habitable.

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And we're even getting reports
now that Jupiter's moon Europa

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:25.540 align:middle line:90%
has water and life on it.

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:28.260 align:middle line:84%
>> The more we learn
about the planet Saturn,

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.150 align:middle line:90%
the stranger it becomes.

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:31.980 align:middle line:84%
The spacecraft
Cassini has fallen

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:36.090 align:middle line:84%
into the atmosphere of Saturn
in its last great adventure.

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:39.150 align:middle line:84%
With Cassini now gone, we'll
have no more visual access

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:42.798 align:middle line:84%
to the planet outside
of our telescopes.

00:17:42.798 --> 00:17:45.090 align:middle line:84%
But what if the planet is
something different than what

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:46.560 align:middle line:90%
we were told?

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.530 align:middle line:84%
In mythology, we discover
many stories of Saturn

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:52.590 align:middle line:84%
being a controlling
god, a fearful god who

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:54.600 align:middle line:90%
murders his children.

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Saturn is also father
of time with his scythe.

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:01.920 align:middle line:84%
Saturn is also associated
with Satan, the dark lord

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.780 align:middle line:90%
of Western mythology.

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:06.225 align:middle line:84%
Is Saturn somehow
controlling us?

00:18:06.225 --> 00:18:11.910 align:middle line:84%
>> If you can change the
information source that people

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:13.800 align:middle line:90%
are decoding, i.e.

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.080 align:middle line:84%
broadcast it from
Saturn with a heck

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.780 align:middle line:84%
of a lot of amplification
from the moon,

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:23.160 align:middle line:84%
then you can change
the reality--

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:27.150 align:middle line:84%
physical, actually holographic--
that people are decoding.

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:30.660 align:middle line:84%
If you've got the headset on in
a video game and someone puts

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.760 align:middle line:84%
another disk in, your
reality completely

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.160 align:middle line:84%
changes because now you're
decoding another information

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:36.960 align:middle line:90%
source.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.690 align:middle line:90%
That is what I say happened.

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's what changed
this reality from something

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:46.710 align:middle line:84%
that was described in
blissful, harmonious terms

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:51.000 align:middle line:84%
into the madhouse that we have
today called human society.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.670 align:middle line:84%
>> When one looks to
mythology and history,

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:56.700 align:middle line:84%
it's soon discovered that
many cultures, societies,

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.940 align:middle line:84%
and even religions are based on
the idea that they're somehow

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.530 align:middle line:90%
linked to Saturn.

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:05.040 align:middle line:84%
Why would so many varied
human populations and groups

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:08.205 align:middle line:84%
have this almost universal
connection with Saturn?

00:19:08.205 --> 00:19:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, you look at the
symbolism of Freemasonry,

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.920 align:middle line:84%
which the vast majority of
Freemasons have no idea about.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.350 align:middle line:90%
And it's all Saturnia.

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And Rome is a major
point on this journey.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:27.150 align:middle line:84%
What then emerged were the
cultures of Mesopotamia, Sumer,

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:31.170 align:middle line:84%
leading onto Babylon, and of
course there was Egypt as well.

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:35.820 align:middle line:10%
And these were centers where
this new psyche started

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:39.360 align:middle line:10%
to get a real grip,
started to create

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:44.970 align:middle line:10%
its own networks of control,
had its own bloodlines of rule

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:47.130 align:middle line:10%
that we called royal bloodlines.

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And you know what's
kind of interesting?

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:50.790 align:middle line:84%
It's not just that the
new psyche came out

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:51.840 align:middle line:90%
of the Middle East.

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.805 align:middle line:84%
But that's where the
religions came from.

00:19:53.805 --> 00:19:54.930 align:middle line:90%
It's where Islam came from.

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:56.347 align:middle line:84%
It's where
Christianity came from.

00:19:56.347 --> 00:19:57.750 align:middle line:90%
It's where Judaism came from.

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:59.550 align:middle line:90%
And then it moved on.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:05.040 align:middle line:84%
This point of focus moved on to
Rome, and it was all Saturnia.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:09.122 align:middle line:84%
And they had this
festival called Saturnalia

00:20:09.122 --> 00:20:10.830 align:middle line:84%
where they did all
the things, basically,

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:11.960 align:middle line:90%
that we do at Christmas.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:16.600 align:middle line:84%
They had trees and holly
and exchanged gifts.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:22.140 align:middle line:84%
And it was a time in the run
up to what is our Christmas.

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And Saturn, of course,
was the major god of Rome.

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And as you look at Rome,
you look at its time period

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:32.030 align:middle line:90%
within what we call history.

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And you look at
where Saturn is now,

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:35.580 align:middle line:90%
this little dot in the sky.

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:38.650 align:middle line:90%
Why would they focus on Saturn?

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:40.930 align:middle line:84%
Of course, if you look
at the history of Saturn

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:44.670 align:middle line:84%
and what it was before, this
starts to make sense now.

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:48.360 align:middle line:10%
And from Rome through
the Roman Empire

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:55.680 align:middle line:10%
came this Saturnian religion,
but also this hybrid network

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:57.750 align:middle line:10%
of bloodlines which,
for a long time,

00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:00.150 align:middle line:10%
went under the heading of royal.

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:04.620 align:middle line:84%
But then when humanity
started to reject in-your-face

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:08.520 align:middle line:84%
dictatorship by bloodline--
royal dictatorship--

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.770 align:middle line:84%
these bloodlines started
to go underground.

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And they exchanged their
coronets and crowns

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.120 align:middle line:90%
for dark suits.

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.830 align:middle line:90%
And they became the politicians.

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:20.130 align:middle line:84%
They became the bankers,
the corporate leaders,

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:22.350 align:middle line:84%
and they've gone on
manipulating the world ever

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:26.340 align:middle line:84%
since through a network
of secret societies.

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:30.480 align:middle line:84%
One of the greatest forms of
mind control and perception

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:34.320 align:middle line:84%
control is to control the
sense of the possible--

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.490 align:middle line:90%
very, very important.

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:40.530 align:middle line:84%
If you control the sense of the
possible and you squeeze it,

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:42.540 align:middle line:84%
then anyone that's
saying actually this

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:44.700 align:middle line:84%
is happening outside
that squeezed,

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:47.670 align:middle line:84%
programmed, downloaded
sense of the hospital

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:51.990 align:middle line:84%
is going to be rejected
as mad or bad or both.

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:56.400 align:middle line:10%
We have to break out of
this perceptual prison, what

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.580 align:middle line:10%
I call phantom self,
and start to realize

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:07.910 align:middle line:10%
that we have been manipulated
into a sense of the possible--

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:10.370 align:middle line:10%
indeed a sense of what's
happening-- that is

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:14.660 align:middle line:10%
so tiny it's almost pathetic.

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:19.010 align:middle line:10%
And what is actually happening
beyond those perceptual walls

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:25.820 align:middle line:10%
is that technology is being
used that we would never believe

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:31.340 align:middle line:10%
was possible, technology
that can manipulate something

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:35.750 align:middle line:10%
the size of Saturn, build
the rings around it,

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:38.630 align:middle line:10%
and turn it into a
broadcasting system--

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:43.850 align:middle line:10%
technology that can, if not
totally construct the moon,

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:48.320 align:middle line:10%
then at least partly
construct it from a planetoid

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:52.220 align:middle line:10%
and turn it into something they
can control and move around.

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And when you also look at the
nature of reality and the fact

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:02.090 align:middle line:84%
that it's not physical,
it's not solid,

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:08.207 align:middle line:84%
what becomes possible in terms
of manipulation of reality--

00:23:08.207 --> 00:23:10.040 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the moon,
Saturn, or whatever--

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:16.040 align:middle line:84%
becomes vastly expanded,
because were we dealing

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:19.052 align:middle line:84%
with a physical solid
reality, what I'm saying

00:23:19.052 --> 00:23:20.885 align:middle line:84%
is the situation would
not be the situation.

00:23:20.885 --> 00:23:22.220 align:middle line:90%
It would be impossible.

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:23.600 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's why a real
scientist, Nikola Tesla,

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:29.840 align:middle line:84%
said that the day
science starts looking

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:34.100 align:middle line:84%
into the non physical
realm of reality,

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:38.600 align:middle line:84%
its understanding will
advance with dramatic speed

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.670 align:middle line:84%
and putting all
the dots together.

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:43.190 align:middle line:90%
And that's basically what I do.

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:48.420 align:middle line:84%
The picture I'm painting
is not just Saturn, either.

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:50.030 align:middle line:90%
It's only part of it.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:52.910 align:middle line:84%
It's broadcasting
a band of frequency

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:59.300 align:middle line:84%
which is like the information
that a video game player is

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.690 align:middle line:84%
receiving to the senses
through the headset and all

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:05.360 align:middle line:90%
the other gadgetry, the gloves.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.940 align:middle line:90%
And our reality has been hacked.

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And we are decoding that
reality into what we think

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:16.820 align:middle line:84%
is a real world, and it's
actually just a vastly advanced

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:17.900 align:middle line:90%
computer game.

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:24.110 align:middle line:10%
And this is why our reality
works with the same laws

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:26.150 align:middle line:10%
as computer games.

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:28.997 align:middle line:10%
It is a gigantic version of one.

>> The knowledge of Saturn,
both as a physical planet

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:44.960 align:middle line:84%
and in mythology, is a
fascinating subject to review.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.620 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, NASA or the
European Space Agency

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:50.480 align:middle line:84%
is planning another
long term mission

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:54.140 align:middle line:84%
to Saturn and many of the other
planets in our solar system

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:57.980 align:middle line:84%
that have been largely ignored
by these space agencies.

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:00.650 align:middle line:84%
In our next episode,
we'll take our exploration

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:03.290 align:middle line:84%
of the solar system a
little closer to home

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:06.650 align:middle line:84%
as we examine our closest
neighbor in space--

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:08.200 align:middle line:90%
our moon.
