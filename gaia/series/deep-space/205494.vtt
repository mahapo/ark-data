00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.550 align:middle line:10%
>> Portals represent a popular
recurring theme in science

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.810 align:middle line:10%
fiction, an extraordinary
opening in space that connects

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.130 align:middle line:10%
travelers to alternate
timelines and distant realms.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.200 align:middle line:10%
In 2012, NASA announced that
the University of Iowa physicist

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.370 align:middle line:10%
Jack Scudder found hard
evidence of portals created

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.100 align:middle line:10%
by the interaction between
the Earth's and sun's

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.900 align:middle line:10%
magnetospheres.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.320 align:middle line:84%
These portals are extremely
volatile and unpredictable,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.140 align:middle line:84%
opening and closing
in an instant.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.040 align:middle line:84%
But Scudder found markers, which
allowed NASA probes to locate

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.750 align:middle line:90%
and study them.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.220 align:middle line:84%
Observations by NASA's THEMIS
spacecraft and Europe's cluster

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.800 align:middle line:84%
probes suggest
that these magnetic

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.690 align:middle line:84%
portals open and close
dozens of times each day.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.760 align:middle line:90%


00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.980 align:middle line:84%
If portal phenomena
have been proven

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.800 align:middle line:84%
to exist scientifically
in space,

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.420 align:middle line:84%
can we assume it's possible
to find them on Earth?

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.810 align:middle line:84%
If so, what evidence
do we have to support

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.440 align:middle line:84%
the existence of these
hyperdimensional gateways?

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.260 align:middle line:90%
>> So what exactly is a portal?

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.110 align:middle line:84%
A portal in this case
would be somewhere

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.630 align:middle line:84%
that you could quite literally
step inside and exist

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.660 align:middle line:84%
within what I would call a
multi-dimensional environment

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.260 align:middle line:84%
for a short period of time,
what we call a bubble universe

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.830 align:middle line:84%
environment, and then
be thrown out of that,

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.690 align:middle line:90%
back into your own world.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.100 align:middle line:10%
Or it's possible that
by entering inside it,

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.640 align:middle line:10%
it almost acts like what I refer
to as a static elevator that's

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.005 align:middle line:10%
not moving through space.

00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:18.380 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
through distance,

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.150 align:middle line:90%
or it's not moving through time.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.500 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually moving
through realms of existence.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.720 align:middle line:90%
So you walk into it.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.180 align:middle line:84%
You enter into this
bubble universe.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And when you step out of
it, you could possibly

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.500 align:middle line:84%
be in a parallel reality
or a parallel world

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.510 align:middle line:90%
or back in your own world.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And just maybe, just
maybe there is a chance

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.610 align:middle line:84%
that you could end
up on another planet.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.360 align:middle line:90%


00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.010 align:middle line:10%
>> This idea of cosmic shortcuts
came out of Einstein's theories

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.970 align:middle line:10%
originally.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.010 align:middle line:10%
Then around 1916,
they started talking

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.260 align:middle line:10%
about the possibility
of white holes

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.310 align:middle line:10%
as an adjunct to the
known black holes,

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.060 align:middle line:10%
and that the white
hole and the black hole

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.730 align:middle line:10%
would be connected through
some form of a conduit.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And we started then to
think about the possibility

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.220 align:middle line:84%
of wormholes, these
cosmic shortcuts that

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.350 align:middle line:90%
interpenetrate the cosmos.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And the theory is that these are
naturally occurring wormholes.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.140 align:middle line:90%
They're microscopic.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And if we were able
to open one, it

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.850 align:middle line:84%
would require massive
amounts of exotic matter

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.540 align:middle line:84%
to open the mouth of a wormhole
so that actual matter could

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.470 align:middle line:90%
go through it.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.550 align:middle line:90%
But the theory is there.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.330 align:middle line:84%
The science is there that says
that wormholes and stargates

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:32.990 align:middle line:90%
are theoretically possible.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.810 align:middle line:90%
And in fact, they're probable.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.930 align:middle line:10%
>> Now we're starting to
discover that black holes

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.030 align:middle line:10%
and wormholes are connected,
that the black holes are like

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.420 align:middle line:10%
the hubs of the
wormholes, the network.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And these wormholes
connect distant places

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.956 align:middle line:90%
almost instantaneously.

00:03:53.956 --> 00:03:56.550 align:middle line:90%


00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Some theorists suggest
that the sun is a portal.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.280 align:middle line:90%
The entrance is a black hole.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.260 align:middle line:90%
The exit is a sun.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.410 align:middle line:84%
The energy enters through
the black hole and exits

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.440 align:middle line:84%
through the sun,
making a toroid.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.750 align:middle line:84%
The influence of
the toroid can be

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.850 align:middle line:84%
several thousands
of light years,

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.790 align:middle line:90%
and it's all intertwined.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.290 align:middle line:84%
There's a complex system based
on frequencies in its interior.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.020 align:middle line:84%
All the suns and
all the black holes

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.360 align:middle line:84%
are connected from
their interior,

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.810 align:middle line:84%
creating, with the proper
knowledge of frequency mapping,

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.290 align:middle line:84%
a whole communication system
that can take you anywhere

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.780 align:middle line:90%
in the galaxy and the universe.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.720 align:middle line:84%
The portal of our sun,
they further postulate,

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.530 align:middle line:84%
is an exit point of a black
hole entrance connected

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.740 align:middle line:90%
to the Andromeda constellation.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.430 align:middle line:84%
In pop culture, portals are
also commonly referred to

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.290 align:middle line:90%
as stargates.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.110 align:middle line:84%
The term stargate has been
used to describe devices

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.470 align:middle line:84%
that allow practical,
rapid travel between two

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.260 align:middle line:90%
distant locations.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.480 align:middle line:84%
>> But the problem with a
portal, they're not stable.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.955 align:middle line:10%
They're like rubber
bands being pulled tight

00:05:08.955 --> 00:05:10.480 align:middle line:10%
and then being let go.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.280 align:middle line:10%
They snap.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.430 align:middle line:10%
And then when they stop,
that's where they are.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.830 align:middle line:10%
So there's no rhyme or reason
where they're moving around.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.420 align:middle line:84%
So if you enter a
portal, you know,

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.170 align:middle line:84%
god knows where you're
going to end up at.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And if you come back
through to that end,

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.280 align:middle line:84%
if you're lucky
enough to find it,

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.590 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be somewhere else.

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.980 align:middle line:84%
But now a stargate,
that's different.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.600 align:middle line:90%
That's basically taking a--

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:40.680 align:middle line:84%
a random flying black
hole, and you've completely

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.510 align:middle line:84%
immobilized it where
it stays put and moves

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.560 align:middle line:90%
upon your command.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.350 align:middle line:84%
If you have stargate, that's
an implication somebody

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.140 align:middle line:84%
can manipulate that
technology and they

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:57.270 align:middle line:84%
have calmed that thing down
and stabilized the black hole

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.620 align:middle line:90%
till it's stationary.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And that would be
your stargates.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>> While many people distinguish
portals as naturally occurring

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.530 align:middle line:84%
phenomena and stargates as
technologically created,

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.520 align:middle line:84%
theoretical physicist Jack
Sarfatti suggests otherwise.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.080 align:middle line:84%
>> The words portal,
traversable wormhole, stargate,

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.390 align:middle line:84%
just different words
for the same thing.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:28.080 align:middle line:84%
It allows you to get from point
A to point B very quickly.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.410 align:middle line:10%
And-- and you can even in
principle go to the past,

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:36.840 align:middle line:10%
go to the future, or go very far
away in the same time period.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.640 align:middle line:10%
There is a cosmic
time that's determined

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.160 align:middle line:10%
by the temperature
of the black body

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.070 align:middle line:10%
radiation of the photons
coming from the Big Bang.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:49.020 align:middle line:84%
We can determine a kind of
absolute cosmological time

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.270 align:middle line:84%
from the temperature of the
back body radiation coming

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.930 align:middle line:90%
from the Big Bang.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:52.950 align:middle line:90%
That's a whole other--

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.000 align:middle line:90%
that's standard physics.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.520 align:middle line:84%
That's like standard
mainstream cosmology.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.480 align:middle line:90%


00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.840 align:middle line:84%
>> While traversing time
via stargates or portals may

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.810 align:middle line:84%
for now only be
theoretically possible,

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.350 align:middle line:84%
astonishingly we do have
legitimate accounts of people

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:13.950 align:middle line:84%
having actually
traveled through them.

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:16.110 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps one of the
more compelling stories

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.630 align:middle line:84%
of direct portal
experiences comes

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:22.830 align:middle line:84%
from Uri Geller, famous for
his telekinesis abilities

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.230 align:middle line:84%
as well as using his
paranormal skills

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:30.080 align:middle line:84%
for the CIA and other
covert government agencies.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.970 align:middle line:10%
>> My most unbelievable,
incredible, astonishing,

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:39.500 align:middle line:10%
phenomenal, paranormal
experience that I encountered,

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:45.590 align:middle line:10%
that I had throughout my
last 72 years of existence is

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:51.200 align:middle line:10%
the moment my body
dematerialized from 57th Street

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:56.360 align:middle line:10%
in New York, in Manhattan,
to Ossining, New York,

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.270 align:middle line:10%
36 miles away in no time.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:03.530 align:middle line:90%
Just like that.

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:05.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm in New York.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:08.570 align:middle line:84%
I live on 57th Street
and 1st Avenue.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:10.550 align:middle line:90%
I had an apartment there.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And it was the birthday
of a doctor we know.

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:18.410 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to buy him a
binocular in Bloomingdale's.

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:20.240 align:middle line:90%
I go to Bloomingdale's.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.850 align:middle line:90%
I buy the binocular.

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And then I decide, before
I get back to 57th Street,

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:32.780 align:middle line:84%
I decide to go up and visit our
very close friend, Maria Janis

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:35.630 align:middle line:90%
Cooper and Byron Janis.

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:37.850 align:middle line:90%
And I go up to their apartment.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:38.870 align:middle line:90%
We talk a little.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And I say, OK, I'm
going home now.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.810 align:middle line:84%
Binocular in my
hand, package up.

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And I get to 57th Street,
and I can see from afar

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:51.020 align:middle line:90%
the canopy of our building.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.140 align:middle line:84%
You know, in New York, you
have canopies protruding out

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:58.150 align:middle line:90%
of the building for rainy days.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And as I look at the
canopy, I suddenly

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:07.050 align:middle line:84%
feel that my feet are not
touching the pavement anymore.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:08.490 align:middle line:90%
There is something missing.

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:10.710 align:middle line:90%
I was, like, walking in the air.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:13.950 align:middle line:90%
And I look down, and I'm--

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:15.930 align:middle line:84%
I just-- I didn't
know what to think,

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:18.270 align:middle line:84%
because I wasn't
on the pavement.

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing
I can remember,

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:27.420 align:middle line:84%
that I'm being hurled
towards a mesh screen.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:31.110 align:middle line:84%
I didn't recognize where
I was being thrown into,

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.810 align:middle line:84%
but my instinct was
to protect my head.

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:39.090 align:middle line:10%
And I-- I'm crashing
through a mesh screen.

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:42.280 align:middle line:10%
You know, those to keep
out flies in summer.

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And there's a big
round table, and I--

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:48.030 align:middle line:90%
I fall on the table.

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.980 align:middle line:84%
There's glass on the
table, so it slips

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.052 align:middle line:90%
from under my hands and breaks.

00:09:52.052 --> 00:09:53.010 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of noise.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:56.100 align:middle line:90%
And I crash onto the floor.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking around,
and I recognize the room.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:09.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm in the porch, in the summer
porch of Dr. Andrija Puharich's

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:14.750 align:middle line:84%
house in Ossining, New York,
36 miles out of New York.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:18.786 align:middle line:90%


00:10:18.786 --> 00:10:24.240 align:middle line:84%
So I'm-- I'm kind of stunned
from the fall, from--

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:29.910 align:middle line:84%
more from the fall than from
the transition from 57th Street

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:30.810 align:middle line:90%
in New York.

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And I start shouting,
Andrija, Andrija.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.720 align:middle line:84%
So it takes a few minutes
for Andrija to find me.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And he says, what
are you doing here?

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And he looks at the screen
that I came in from,

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.810 align:middle line:90%
and it's torn inwards.

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And I say to him, I
just left Maria's.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:55.330 align:middle line:84%
He knew Maria, of my
friendship with Maria.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:11:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And he picks up the phone and
he says, Maria, Uri's here.

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't
hear, but he later

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:05.620 align:middle line:90%
told me that there was silence.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And Maria then says to him,
what do you mean, Uri's here?

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:12.670 align:middle line:84%
He just left our apartment
on 521 Park Avenue.

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:18.290 align:middle line:90%


00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:20.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, I happen to have
spent a lot of time with Byron

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:21.620 align:middle line:90%
and Maria.

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.040 align:middle line:90%
I know them very well.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.620 align:middle line:10%
And they confirm the story.

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.890 align:middle line:10%
I don't believe there's
anything supernatural.

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:31.940 align:middle line:10%
I think everything that we
think is supernatural is easily

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:36.122 align:middle line:10%
explained by elementary physics,
including our consciousness.

00:11:36.122 --> 00:11:37.330 align:middle line:10%
There's nothing supernatural.

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.830 align:middle line:10%
It's all-- what appears to
be supernatural is simply

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:42.440 align:middle line:10%
because our concept of what
is natural is too small.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.970 align:middle line:10%
We're in too small a box.

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:49.690 align:middle line:84%
My claim is we understand
the phenomenon.

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:54.220 align:middle line:84%
>> The way I explain this
phenomenon to myself,

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:57.730 align:middle line:84%
whether I use the
words a multi--

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:03.640 align:middle line:84%
multi-dimensional shift or a
quantum mechanical, quantum

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:11.470 align:middle line:84%
entanglement phenomenon,
a bizarre dark loophole

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:16.345 align:middle line:84%
in the-- in our existence that
can shift you and materialize

00:12:16.345 --> 00:12:19.450 align:middle line:84%
you, dematerialize you
from one place to another,

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.810 align:middle line:90%
I don't really know.

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:25.220 align:middle line:90%
How-- how can I know?

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:30.180 align:middle line:84%
>> So actually, you know,
black holes themselves could be

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:35.720 align:middle line:84%
thought as evidence of
portals and wormholes.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:39.050 align:middle line:10%
Certainly, we could
think of it that way.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:43.510 align:middle line:10%
You know, and if
that's all true, right,

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:46.700 align:middle line:10%
if it's true that
particle-to-particle

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:50.570 align:middle line:10%
interaction, entanglement
is the result of wormholes,

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:55.370 align:middle line:10%
if it's true that Einstein field
equation predicts wormholes

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:58.100 align:middle line:10%
exist as a result
of these equations,

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:06.290 align:middle line:10%
then it is true that there
could be wormhole attachments

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:10.640 align:middle line:10%
to the surface of our
planet that could be opened

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.940 align:middle line:10%
and entered and utilized.

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:17.880 align:middle line:90%


00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Mainstream cosmology posits
that a natural stargate is

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:25.830 align:middle line:84%
similar to an Einstein-Rosen
bridge, or wormhole,

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:29.640 align:middle line:84%
which has been theorized to form
when space time is distorted

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:33.870 align:middle line:84%
by the intense gravitational
fields generated by collapsing

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:35.490 align:middle line:90%
stars.

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:37.650 align:middle line:10%
At a singularity
point, time would

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.450 align:middle line:10%
stop as it stretches
to infinity,

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:44.820 align:middle line:10%
as predicted by Einstein's
general theory of relativity.

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:47.130 align:middle line:84%
Physicists consider
it to be theoretically

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:50.190 align:middle line:84%
possible for an
Einstein-Rosen bridge

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:56.370 align:middle line:84%
to form wherein one could even
travel back and forth in time.

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>> The portal is simply
the entrance and exit

00:13:58.650 --> 00:13:59.825 align:middle line:90%
to a stargate.

00:13:59.825 --> 00:14:02.070 align:middle line:10%
You know, if you see
the movie "Stargate,"

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:05.310 align:middle line:10%
you have the big ring,
OK, that big metal ring,

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:07.770 align:middle line:10%
that'll be made out
of metal material.

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:10.830 align:middle line:10%
Now, you put electricity into
the-- into the metal ring,

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:12.660 align:middle line:10%
and it generates the
warp field and you

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.730 align:middle line:10%
walk through the stargate.

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:17.730 align:middle line:84%
So they pretty much have it the
way it's going to really be.

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:19.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Scientists are of
two minds about this.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.170 align:middle line:90%
Some say, absolutely no way.

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:23.835 align:middle line:90%
Stephen Hawking was like that.

00:14:23.835 --> 00:14:25.710 align:middle line:84%
He said, there's no way
that you could travel

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:27.750 align:middle line:90%
through time through a portal.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:30.180 align:middle line:10%
But then you have other
scientists that say, no, this

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.890 align:middle line:10%
is theoretically
possible that we

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:34.140 align:middle line:10%
may, in fact, be able
to travel through time

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:34.980 align:middle line:10%
through the portals.

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:38.782 align:middle line:84%
The answer is for now,
we just don't know.

00:14:38.782 --> 00:14:42.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Researchers across a variety
of disciplines have pointed

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:47.030 align:middle line:84%
to areas worldwide known for
their anomalous energies.

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:49.370 align:middle line:84%
Strange phenomena
have been reported

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:52.220 align:middle line:84%
around ancient
megaliths, ley lines,

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.800 align:middle line:90%
and sacred historic sites.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.660 align:middle line:84%
Written history
tells the stories

00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:00.770 align:middle line:84%
of travelers who were able to
journey to mysterious places,

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:04.430 align:middle line:84%
allowing some to even
travel among the gods.

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:06.470 align:middle line:90%
But where are these places?

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And are they nothing
more than a myth?

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:11.420 align:middle line:84%
>> The Great Pyramid,
Solomon's Temple,

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.520 align:middle line:84%
Mount Meru are
just a few of them.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.870 align:middle line:90%
Teotihuacan.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:18.230 align:middle line:84%
These are all powerful
temple complexes

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:21.140 align:middle line:84%
that have portal stories
attached to them.

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.570 align:middle line:84%
They believe they're
places where the gods lived

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:25.850 align:middle line:84%
or where the gods
would come down,

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:28.280 align:middle line:84%
or where even
humans could ascend

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.840 align:middle line:84%
into the celestial
realms from these places.

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And so by definition,
those are portals.

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:40.010 align:middle line:10%
>> There's clearly a worldwide
grid of natural and artificial

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:43.820 align:middle line:10%
time warp zones, which are
actual targets to heavenly

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:44.750 align:middle line:10%
dimensions.

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:47.930 align:middle line:10%
Many of them are currently
deactivated because they

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.510 align:middle line:10%
were used at previous times.

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:53.420 align:middle line:84%
So it seems that
in ancient times,

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:57.800 align:middle line:84%
the Great Pyramid could very
well have been an activated

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.430 align:middle line:84%
stargate that would open
and energize and allow

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:04.340 align:middle line:84%
for consciousness as
well as perhaps even

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:09.170 align:middle line:84%
the body to ascend an activated
stargate with the energy

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:12.510 align:middle line:84%
technology being
produced within it.

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:18.440 align:middle line:84%
So legends say that after
Atlantis, some of the remaining

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:23.570 align:middle line:84%
civilization went to Egypt,
and that was one of the energy

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:25.220 align:middle line:90%
activation points.

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.950 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that many
of the other points that

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:32.990 align:middle line:84%
had been ancient stargates
are lost, like the Bermuda

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:36.500 align:middle line:84%
Triangle, like places
in the Antarctic.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:40.760 align:middle line:84%
So many of them are
not active today.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.090 align:middle line:84%
>> In ancient temples
all around the world,

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:49.280 align:middle line:84%
we find these doorways
that are very strange.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.810 align:middle line:90%
They're carved into the stone.

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:52.390 align:middle line:90%
They don't go anywhere.

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:53.750 align:middle line:90%
They don't go through.

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:57.600 align:middle line:84%
It's unclear why it was
put there, and so on.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And you could think that maybe
in certain circumstances maybe

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:05.599 align:middle line:84%
some of the
technology is missing,

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:09.500 align:middle line:84%
or maybe at a certain time
of the year, a certain moment

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.920 align:middle line:84%
of the day, you know,
when the sun is just right

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.680 align:middle line:84%
or when the moon is just
right, all of a sudden

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:19.910 align:middle line:84%
this doorway becomes
a portal into one

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:25.550 align:middle line:84%
of those wormhole-entangled
structures of spacetime.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:26.810 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:29.900 align:middle line:90%
I think maybe.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:33.670 align:middle line:84%
However, it's very
difficult to demonstrate it.

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And maybe the technology
and the discoveries

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:40.760 align:middle line:84%
we will do in the next
decade, because we're

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:45.740 align:middle line:84%
very much on that path
currently of discovering

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:49.070 align:middle line:84%
wormholes and understanding
black holes better.

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:51.050 align:middle line:84%
Maybe these discoveries
will give us

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:56.420 align:middle line:84%
the key to be able to open
those doorways, those portals,

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:57.950 align:middle line:90%
and utilize them.

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:07.260 align:middle line:90%


00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:10.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, since I've been
talking for about an hour here,

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:14.820 align:middle line:10%
this studio on this planet has
moved 100,000 miles through

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.070 align:middle line:10%
space.

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:17.640 align:middle line:84%
We're on a spacecraft
that's moving

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.105 align:middle line:90%
on 100,000 miles an hour.

00:18:19.105 --> 00:18:25.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, we may flew right across
the path of a mini black hole.

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And that thing
would be independent

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.180 align:middle line:90%
of our gravitational field.

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:33.420 align:middle line:90%
It is its own graviton.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:38.220 align:middle line:10%
>> There are many cases where
people have quite literally

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:42.600 align:middle line:10%
gone missing from a certain
location only to be re-found

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.350 align:middle line:10%
hundreds of miles away.

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think that in some
cases, what's happened

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:53.040 align:middle line:84%
is that they've entered into
a portal and been thrown out.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And where they've
been thrown out

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:58.500 align:middle line:84%
is in space, hundreds of
miles from where they actually

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.300 align:middle line:90%
went in to the portal itself.

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:02.730 align:middle line:10%
So in other words,
you know, it's

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:04.400 align:middle line:10%
a difficult thing to control.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.910 align:middle line:10%
But I think the key is belief,
absolute belief in what you

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:12.480 align:middle line:10%
are doing, because there
is a human consciousness

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.010 align:middle line:10%
interaction taking place.

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:20.250 align:middle line:84%
So if we fully understand that
if we enter into a portal,

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:24.810 align:middle line:84%
we can control what happens
to us when we're inside it

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:27.480 align:middle line:84%
and control where
we come out, this

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:31.290 align:middle line:84%
will actually really
help in us making sure

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:33.150 align:middle line:90%
that we get back to our reality.

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:35.720 align:middle line:90%


00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:39.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Jacques Vallee and Eric Davis
have written a paper called

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.810 align:middle line:90%
"High Strangeness," OK?

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And they claim seeing
a Bigfoot-type creature

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:48.400 align:middle line:90%
at night come through a portal.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:53.290 align:middle line:84%
So the whole Bigfoot phenomenon,
these may be creatures from

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:54.165 align:middle line:90%
where, we don't know.

00:19:54.165 --> 00:19:55.623 align:middle line:84%
But they're coming
through portals.

00:19:55.623 --> 00:19:57.070 align:middle line:84%
They're coming
through stargates.

00:19:57.070 --> 00:20:02.530 align:middle line:84%
So all these weird phenomena are
all tightly connected together.

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:06.430 align:middle line:84%
It really is kind of a
tight weave narrative, OK?

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's a
question of, who's

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:11.320 align:middle line:90%
controlling the narrative?

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>> If in theory the portal
and stargate phenomenon can be

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:17.500 align:middle line:90%
created, what would that take?

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:21.620 align:middle line:10%
And how would we create that
with our technology today?

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:25.510 align:middle line:10%
>> If I wanted to make a
stargate to essentially

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:28.750 align:middle line:10%
teleport or bring me from
one place to another,

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:31.130 align:middle line:10%
what I would do is two things.

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:35.020 align:middle line:84%
First of all, create quantum
sensors, and obviously

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:36.910 align:middle line:84%
the right quantum-computing
algorithms

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:39.730 align:middle line:84%
that could use those
quantum sensors to read

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:42.350 align:middle line:84%
the entire state
of the human body.

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:45.130 align:middle line:84%
So every atomic in quantum
state and information

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:47.690 align:middle line:84%
of the human body
would get read in.

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:49.810 align:middle line:84%
Then you would most
likely unfortunately get

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:53.740 align:middle line:84%
destructed, at which
point at the other side

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.410 align:middle line:84%
of the stargate entry,
we would recreate

00:20:56.410 --> 00:21:00.640 align:middle line:84%
your atomic information
at the quantum level using

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:04.930 align:middle line:84%
transmutations and just, like,
very advanced, let's say,

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.150 align:middle line:84%
alchemy that we
don't have right now.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:10.960 align:middle line:84%
But that's how I would
go about doing that.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>> If successful, what might
the consequences be of traveling

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:17.470 align:middle line:90%
through a portal?

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:20.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Timelines work like a tree.

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:23.560 align:middle line:84%
You got a big trunk, a
main flow, a mainstream,

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:26.660 align:middle line:90%
thousands of branches, 1,000--

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:29.860 align:middle line:84%
10,000 branches
branching off of those.

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:35.713 align:middle line:84%
And all of those, each one of
those veins can be a timeline.

00:21:35.713 --> 00:21:37.130 align:middle line:84%
So it depends on
what you're doing

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:40.540 align:middle line:84%
and what you're changing will
determine where you end up

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:45.580 align:middle line:84%
on the tree of time and
what your reality will

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:47.980 align:middle line:90%
be perceived by you.

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:49.100 align:middle line:90%
You know, god knows.

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.170 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:54.260 align:middle line:84%
But I would recommend
to time travelers

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:59.300 align:middle line:84%
that they better have a real
sense of self-sacrificing,

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:02.810 align:middle line:84%
because you're going to lose
yourself in that eventually.

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And god knows where you
end up, but you're not

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:09.930 align:middle line:84%
going to end up with anything
that you're familiar with.

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:13.250 align:middle line:84%
You may return to your
time and the world

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:16.610 align:middle line:84%
would be entirely different
than you will ever know it.

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:20.730 align:middle line:10%
And you're the only one that
would notice the difference.

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:22.940 align:middle line:90%
Nobody else around you would.

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:26.690 align:middle line:90%
So that's the crazy thing.

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:30.670 align:middle line:84%
>> The concern about portals
often raised is if one travels

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:33.970 align:middle line:84%
through a portal, is
there a way to return?

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:36.430 align:middle line:84%
According to the
description by Uri Geller

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:39.130 align:middle line:84%
and the portal stories
related by others,

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:43.030 align:middle line:84%
very often people are literally
ejected from the portals

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:46.460 align:middle line:84%
as unexpectedly as
they entered into them.

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:51.640 align:middle line:10%
>> So why is it that when we
enter inside these portals that

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:55.960 align:middle line:10%
very often we are
regurgitated out from them?

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.640 align:middle line:10%
Yes, we lose some time.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:00.500 align:middle line:10%
It could be a few minutes,
a few hours, a few days,

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:02.650 align:middle line:10%
maybe even a few weeks.

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:05.720 align:middle line:84%
But why is it that
we do come back?

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And I think the answer to
that is that we can only

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:14.260 align:middle line:84%
stay in a multi-dimensional
state, which quite literally is

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:18.970 align:middle line:84%
every atom of our body, every
particle of our body shattered

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:20.170 align:middle line:90%
into pieces.

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:23.980 align:middle line:84%
I think that we can only
remain in that type of state

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:30.280 align:middle line:84%
for a limited period of time
before our physicality is

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:34.180 align:middle line:84%
almost rejected by these
multi-dimensional environments,

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:36.250 align:middle line:90%
and we're just pushed out again.

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:38.480 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's good.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.180 align:middle line:84%
That's really, really
good, because it

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:44.230 align:middle line:84%
means that certainly,
99% of the people that

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:47.410 align:middle line:84%
enter into these portals
will come back again.

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately,
there probably will

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:54.430 align:middle line:84%
be a few who, once they
do enter these gateways,

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:56.770 align:middle line:90%
will never return.

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:59.320 align:middle line:84%
But that just seems
to be a consequence

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.835 align:middle line:84%
of our understanding of
the existence of portals.

00:24:01.835 --> 00:24:06.660 align:middle line:90%


00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:09.870 align:middle line:84%
>> There's most likely
a way to get back.

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:14.100 align:middle line:10%
However, when you
come back, things

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:19.260 align:middle line:10%
might have changed dramatically
because of relativity.

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:24.000 align:middle line:10%
That is, for you it might have
been only a few seconds for you

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.110 align:middle line:10%
to go to the other side
of the galaxies and back.

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:31.050 align:middle line:84%
But for the people
that stayed behind,

00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:34.710 align:middle line:84%
it might have been
a few generations.

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:40.910 align:middle line:84%
And so you might meet your
grand grand grandson of--

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:47.790 align:middle line:84%
instead of your own
family when you come back.

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>> There have been highly
controversial claims that

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:54.240 align:middle line:84%
the military industrial complex
has had the ability to time

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:58.260 align:middle line:84%
travel through portals
for more than 40 years.

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Buried deep within
unacknowledged special access

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:05.520 align:middle line:84%

advanced technologies allowing

for teleportation, physical time
travel, and holographic time

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:14.730 align:middle line:84%
travel is allegedly run
jointly by the CIA and DARPA

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:18.240 align:middle line:84%
to teleport to Mars as well
as maintain relationships

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:20.520 align:middle line:90%
with extraterrestrials.

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:23.160 align:middle line:84%
If there is any truth
to these assertions

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.010 align:middle line:84%
that portal travel
is indeed possible,

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:28.680 align:middle line:84%
what would be the
implications for humanity

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:32.010 align:middle line:84%
if we discovered a
functional, natural portal

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:36.630 align:middle line:84%
or were able to create a
technological stargate?

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:38.880 align:middle line:90%
>> The implications are--

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.030 align:middle line:90%
they're incredible.

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:41.050 align:middle line:90%
We could go to Mars.

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:42.092 align:middle line:90%
We could go to the stars.

00:25:42.092 --> 00:25:43.920 align:middle line:90%
We could populate exoplanets.

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.212 align:middle line:90%
The stars are our destination.

00:25:46.212 --> 00:25:47.795 align:middle line:84%
This is a way of
getting to the stars.

00:25:47.795 --> 00:25:50.522 align:middle line:10%
We're not going to crawl on
our hands and knees and rockets

00:25:50.522 --> 00:25:52.230 align:middle line:10%
to the stars and take
thousands of years.

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:53.240 align:middle line:10%
That's nonsense.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Geometric engineering
is the future.

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:59.390 align:middle line:90%


00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:05.320 align:middle line:84%
Einstein to me, in his
scientific theories

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:09.190 align:middle line:84%
and equations, proven
scientific equations,

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:12.790 align:middle line:84%
were massively important
to balance my belief

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:20.490 align:middle line:84%
system that these things are not
only ether and exist out there,

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:24.540 align:middle line:84%
but you can derive
them, extract them out

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:35.420 align:middle line:84%
of his scientific formulas and
prove to the ordinary person

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:40.940 align:middle line:84%
that their ideas about
life after death and spirit

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:47.500 align:middle line:84%
and ghosts actually really
do exist, because Einstein

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:52.180 align:middle line:90%
backed it up with hard science.

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:57.450 align:middle line:84%
That's why Einstein
was so brilliant.

00:26:57.450 --> 00:27:01.360 align:middle line:90%


00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.370 align:middle line:84%
>> If we could create
our own portals,

technologies to
anybody, anywhere.

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:11.980 align:middle line:84%
It would equal--
act as an equalizer.

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:15.520 align:middle line:84%
I think that the idea

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:19.060 align:middle line:84%
using engineered wormholes
to communicate with us

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:20.740 align:middle line:90%
is very possible.

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:24.410 align:middle line:84%
If they're advanced enough,
then why not, you know?

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:29.230 align:middle line:10%
Why would they not install a
communication sort of device

00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:33.390 align:middle line:10%
that works anywhere from the
galaxy, from point A to B?

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:36.177 align:middle line:10%
And they have instant
access to everybody.

00:27:36.177 --> 00:27:40.160 align:middle line:90%


00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:45.740 align:middle line:84%
>> We might travel inside our
solar system first before we

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:49.950 align:middle line:84%
endeavor to travel
across the galaxy.

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:54.800 align:middle line:10%
But the connection with other
societies in our universe

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.360 align:middle line:10%
becomes possible.

00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:00.410 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, you know, almost an
infinite amount of resources

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:02.540 align:middle line:90%
would be open to us.

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:06.110 align:middle line:84%
You know, all this would
open up our society

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:09.500 align:middle line:84%
to a whole different way of
interacting with the universe

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:10.730 align:middle line:90%
and with ourselves.

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:15.080 align:middle line:90%


00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:19.700 align:middle line:10%
>> I mean, you're talking
firstly about proving many not

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:23.000 align:middle line:10%
just biblical stories, but
other stories from other sacred

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.910 align:middle line:10%
traditions of beings coming and
going through these portals.

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:28.280 align:middle line:10%
That means those
stories are true,

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.100 align:middle line:10%
that either humans were
advanced enough to do this

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:34.160 align:middle line:10%
or we're talking about advanced
beings that came to Earth

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:37.920 align:middle line:10%
and were demonstrating
their ability to do this.

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:41.540 align:middle line:84%
So that is one of the
implications of portals

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:43.650 align:middle line:90%
becoming real in our world.

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:46.700 align:middle line:84%
The other is that
suddenly, teleportation

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:50.270 align:middle line:90%
becomes a commonplace thing.

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:53.360 align:middle line:84%
What happens to the spiritual
essence of yourself, your soul?

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:56.900 align:middle line:10%
Does it automatically know
to follow your physical body

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.540 align:middle line:10%
and to reformulate at
that other location?

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:01.480 align:middle line:90%
How exactly would that work?

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.280 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.590 align:middle line:84%
But these are part of
the questions that we're

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:05.173 align:middle line:84%
going to have to
answer if we're going

00:29:05.173 --> 00:29:07.757 align:middle line:84%
to be able to ultimately
create a civilization based

00:29:07.757 --> 00:29:08.840 align:middle line:90%
on the concept of portals.

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:13.080 align:middle line:90%


00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:18.030 align:middle line:84%
>> If a portal opened
in front of me now,

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:19.650 align:middle line:90%
would I step through?

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:22.410 align:middle line:90%


00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think the answer
is it would depend

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:30.030 align:middle line:84%
on my state of mind and my
absolute belief in what I was

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:33.870 align:middle line:84%
doing, because only
that would ensure

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:37.590 align:middle line:90%
that I returned afterwards.

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>> We live in fascinating
times where science and what we

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:45.090 align:middle line:84%
imagine through science fiction
are merging their realities

00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:47.400 align:middle line:90%
within the same timeline.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.980 align:middle line:84%
While Albert Einstein
and Nathan Rosen

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:53.400 align:middle line:84%
brought portals and
stargates closer to reality,

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:57.030 align:middle line:84%
the question remains, who
will be the next genius taking

00:29:57.030 --> 00:30:00.300 align:middle line:84%
humanity from one step
closer to one step

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:03.450 align:middle line:84%
through the portal and
stargate phenomenon,

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:06.660 align:middle line:84%
making travel to the most
remote stars in the universe

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:08.085 align:middle line:90%
the reality of today?

00:30:08.085 --> 00:30:11.920 align:middle line:90%


00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:13.990 align:middle line:84%
On the next episode
of "Deep Space,"

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:16.570 align:middle line:84%
we examine the elongated
skulls of Peru.
