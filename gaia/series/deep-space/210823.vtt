00:00:24.108 --> 00:00:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>> According to experts
of ancient Egypt,

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.820 align:middle line:84%
the Sirius star
system is aligned with

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.880 align:middle line:84%
the queen's chamber of
the Great Pyramid of Giza,

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.810 align:middle line:84%
and plays a significant role
in ancient Egyptian mythology.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.130 align:middle line:84%
It is also suggested that
these beings significantly

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.340 align:middle line:84%
contributed to creating
ancient Egypt as well

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.460 align:middle line:84%
as other ancient civilizations
around the world where

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.930 align:middle line:84%
they served as the leaders
and guides of humankind.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.940 align:middle line:84%
What more do we know
about these beings

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.170 align:middle line:84%
from Sirius and their influence
upon humanity's evolution?

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.972 align:middle line:90%


00:01:00.972 --> 00:01:05.459 align:middle line:10%
>> Sirius became a major star
of orientation for the ancient

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:09.520 align:middle line:10%
Egyptians that replaced Alpha
Draconis as their pole star

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.320 align:middle line:10%
essentially.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.720 align:middle line:10%
They started aligning
their temples to Sirius.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.540 align:middle line:10%
And Sirius, in fact,
was the only star

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.970 align:middle line:10%
worshipped by the Egyptians.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.550 align:middle line:90%
They revered Orion.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.590 align:middle line:84%
As we know, the three
pyramids of Giza

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.260 align:middle line:84%
are a mirror of the three
belt stars of Orion.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And they revered Ursa
Major, the casket of Osiris.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.005 align:middle line:84%
But they worshipped
the star Sirius.

00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:34.380 align:middle line:84%
The reason why
they worshipped is

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.560 align:middle line:84%
because they believed
the creator beings came

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.010 align:middle line:84%
from Sirius, and that
Sirius ultimately

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.110 align:middle line:90%
conferred immortality.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it
was so important

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.845 align:middle line:90%
to the ancient Egyptians.

00:01:46.845 --> 00:01:53.040 align:middle line:10%
>> The Egyptian annual calendar
is marked by the helical rising

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.280 align:middle line:10%
of Sirius A and
B on the horizon.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.170 align:middle line:10%
Now that happens essentially
around July 25th,

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.060 align:middle line:10%
and it's also the first marker
date of the Mayan calendar

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.930 align:middle line:10%
system.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.870 align:middle line:10%
And interestingly,
the tie there is

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.930 align:middle line:10%
that the Mayans talked
about the four corn

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.630 align:middle line:10%
peoples of the Earth coming
from the river in the sky, which

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.870 align:middle line:10%
essentially they're referring
to the Milky Way galaxy,

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.470 align:middle line:10%
the galaxy across the
sky, and its crossing

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.230 align:middle line:10%
with the ecliptic as
a fundamental time

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.360 align:middle line:10%
system that is universal
to all humans on Earth.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.550 align:middle line:84%
I think it's
important to recognize

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.130 align:middle line:84%
as we study these
different ancient cultures

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.130 align:middle line:84%
and different memory threads
that individuals have

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.380 align:middle line:84%
to different star
systems that there

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.350 align:middle line:84%
may be many different
star systems that

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.880 align:middle line:84%
came to Earth around the same
time in the time of Atlantis

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.960 align:middle line:90%
and Lemuria.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And so what we see
around the world

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.040 align:middle line:84%
are reference points
tying pieces together

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.746 align:middle line:84%
to different worlds and
to different cultures.

00:03:02.746 --> 00:03:07.270 align:middle line:10%
>> When you see Sirius, it's
like the brightest star that we

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:13.450 align:middle line:10%
have closest to us and it can
be seen in both hemispheres.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.660 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes you can
see it in the north,

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.610 align:middle line:84%
sometimes you can
see it in the south.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And because it's the brightest
one that is in the sky,

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.860 align:middle line:84%
it's also a guide
for people that

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.570 align:middle line:84%
were traveling
through the planet

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.020 align:middle line:90%
to know which season is coming.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.720 align:middle line:84%
So that's why Sirius
was also important

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.690 align:middle line:84%
besides the beings that
could come from there

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.180 align:middle line:84%
and guided the
construction of pyramids.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.210 align:middle line:84%
Besides all that
history for humans,

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.120 align:middle line:84%
the star is very
important and was related

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.830 align:middle line:90%
with the mother of the sky.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.210 align:middle line:84%
That's why in Egypt was named
after Isis, the goddess,

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.520 align:middle line:84%
because she was the
mother of creation.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.960 align:middle line:84%
It's not because the
star created everything,

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.890 align:middle line:84%
but it's related to
the flood of the Nile.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.770 align:middle line:84%
When the star appears
in the horizon,

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.230 align:middle line:90%
the Nile starts to grow again.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.960 align:middle line:84%
That's why also Sirius was
guiding people in harvesting

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.260 align:middle line:84%
and starting the new year,
and it was the mother of life.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.790 align:middle line:84%
It was related to the summer, to
the harvesting, and everything.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.640 align:middle line:84%
That's why there are
two different stories

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.070 align:middle line:84%
about the star related
to the humanity.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.630 align:middle line:84%
>> The god that came
from Sirius, Ptah.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.890 align:middle line:90%
Well, who's Ptah?

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Ptah is the ancient Egyptian
god of smith craft and alchemy.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.340 align:middle line:90%
He fashioned the human body.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.750 align:middle line:84%
He even has a double
helix in his hieroglyph.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And we're developing this
picture where, wait a minute.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.250 align:middle line:90%
That's a technology.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.610 align:middle line:84%
You're saying a god
being came from Sirius?

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.510 align:middle line:84%
A divine being came from Sirius
and fashioned the human body?

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.770 align:middle line:84%
That means he didn't create
the human body from scratch.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.880 align:middle line:84%
He found a primitive being
probably wandering around

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:07.240 align:middle line:84%
and merged some of the
Sirian DNA, and out pops man.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.700 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
Egyptians are saying.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And then you ask the question,
well, why would Ptah do that?

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.460 align:middle line:84%
Why would he come from Sirius
to Earth, tweak our DNA,

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.300 align:middle line:84%
merge their DNA with ours,
and create this new being?

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.410 align:middle line:90%
What is the purpose of that?

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, the answer is provided
in the ancient Egyptian pyramid

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.820 align:middle line:84%
text, and that is Ptah
came here and did this

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.760 align:middle line:84%
so that we could climb
the ladder to heaven,

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.460 align:middle line:84%
to make our body a
more conducive vehicle

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.610 align:middle line:90%
for the ascension of the soul.

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.910 align:middle line:84%
That is fundamental to the
ancient Egyptian belief.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.400 align:middle line:84%
That leads to many
questions about,

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.990 align:middle line:84%
well, what is the
nature of Ptah.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.550 align:middle line:90%
Is this an actual being?

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.420 align:middle line:90%
He's portrayed very robotic.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.750 align:middle line:84%
He's got this
tight-fitting garment on.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.420 align:middle line:84%
He holds his Was
scepter, and he's

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.860 align:middle line:90%
got this tight skull cap on.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.170 align:middle line:84%
Very often his body is
covered with feathers.

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.765 align:middle line:84%
He's feathered because
he flies, right?

00:06:01.765 --> 00:06:04.510 align:middle line:90%
He's capable of ascension.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And that then
opens up, again, is

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.060 align:middle line:90%
this a robotic type of a being?

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.160 align:middle line:90%
Is this a non-physical being?

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.400 align:middle line:84%
Certainly he took
on physicality.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.980 align:middle line:84%
But what we're confronted
with is the belief

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.370 align:middle line:84%
that this is how
we got how we are.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.840 align:middle line:84%
How did we go from
monkey to man?

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.790 align:middle line:90%
Well, it was, again, Ptah.

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:29.080 align:middle line:84%
In 1976, it was Robert Temple
in "The Sirius Mystery"

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.680 align:middle line:84%
who first proposed that it
was beings from Sirius that

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.730 align:middle line:90%
tweaked our DNA.

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:37.540 align:middle line:84%
He was fascinated as many of
us are by this question; how

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.000 align:middle line:84%
did Neanderthals
suddenly erupt 35,000,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.020 align:middle line:84%
40,000 years ago with this
activated neocortex capable

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.400 align:middle line:84%
of doing math and science
and making music and creating

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.450 align:middle line:90%
technology?

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.880 align:middle line:90%
It happened literally overnight.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And the Egyptian
answer is, it was Ptah.

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:59.605 align:middle line:84%
It was beings from Sirius
who came here and did this.

00:06:59.605 --> 00:07:04.060 align:middle line:84%
>> One group with direct ties
to the Sirius star system are

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.790 align:middle line:84%
the Dogon tribe of
sub-Saharan Africa.

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:09.010 align:middle line:84%
Scientists and
anthropologists have long

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:11.560 align:middle line:84%
been amazed by the Dogon's
extensive knowledge

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.230 align:middle line:84%
of the Sirius star
system, including

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.080 align:middle line:84%
details that were unknown
to modern astronomers

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:17.950 align:middle line:90%
until more recently.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:21.970 align:middle line:84%
>> We know about Sirius
as a binary star system.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until the 1980s
that we actually figured out

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:31.060 align:middle line:84%
the exact rotational flow
between the two stars.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.330 align:middle line:10%
One of the gentlemen who was
working on the project studying

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.520 align:middle line:10%
this rotation between
the Sirian stars

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.560 align:middle line:10%
had a friend who
was an archeologist,

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:43.780 align:middle line:10%
and that archeologist friend had
photos of a particular pattern

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:48.490 align:middle line:10%
carved into a cave
wall in Africa

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:50.470 align:middle line:10%
where the Dogon tribe lives.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:54.220 align:middle line:10%
And he saw this pattern
from the cave wall

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.670 align:middle line:10%
and said, "My god,
that is exactly

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:01.870 align:middle line:10%
the rotation between the
Sirius A and B star systems."

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And so we know that
there's been knowledge

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:11.560 align:middle line:84%
about the physical rotation of
this binary system going back

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.405 align:middle line:90%
potentially thousands of years.

00:08:13.405 --> 00:08:16.130 align:middle line:90%


00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:21.130 align:middle line:84%
The Sirian binary star
system may have many planets,

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:26.740 align:middle line:84%
but at the very least,
we know that there's one.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.820 align:middle line:90%
And how do we know this?

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:32.409 align:middle line:84%
Because so many people
and so many cultures

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:34.570 align:middle line:90%
point to the Sirian star system.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:37.210 align:middle line:84%
All of these different
peoples around the world

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:41.809 align:middle line:84%
point to an origin, a
connection with this system.

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:46.670 align:middle line:84%
They feel that their
mythologies come from there.

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:49.330 align:middle line:84%
They tell stories
about this place.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And if we look
around the world, we

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:53.380 align:middle line:84%
can track more and
more and more of

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.395 align:middle line:84%

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:04.850 align:middle line:10%
the Sirius star system, and
they remember being on a planet

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:09.850 align:middle line:10%
that's a water-like planet where
it has dolphins and merpeople,

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:12.220 align:middle line:10%
and they can breathe underwater.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And it has seven moons,
and they describe it

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:18.700 align:middle line:84%
as a beautiful planet full
of love and compassion.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the Sirians would
describe themselves as blue,

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:26.050 align:middle line:84%
and they interact with
humans all the time.

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:29.230 align:middle line:84%

who actually saw them,

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:31.930 align:middle line:84%
they can materialize
and be known.

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:35.590 align:middle line:10%
So like many of
extraterrestrial intelligences,

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:39.280 align:middle line:10%
they can appear and be in
third dimensional reality.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.530 align:middle line:10%
Although simultaneously,
they usually

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:43.720 align:middle line:10%

the fifth dimension.

Matias remembers a time where
he was a Sirian being living

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:59.440 align:middle line:84%
on a planet in the
Sirius star system.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Sirius was my home once.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:09.640 align:middle line:84%
So I am very connected to that
place more than any other.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:13.360 align:middle line:84%
I am emotionally
related with the place.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:19.120 align:middle line:84%
We were not very human-like even
though we had arms and hands.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.780 align:middle line:84%
But we were, like,
maybe 4 meters tall,

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:25.910 align:middle line:90%
like, twice a human being.

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:30.160 align:middle line:84%
And we had this big,
long neck with the head,

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.160 align:middle line:90%
like, very long, egg shaped.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.420 align:middle line:84%
The skins were, like,
grey or brown color.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:47.320 align:middle line:84%
Big eyes like a leaf and tiny
nose, tiny mouth, but very long

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.790 align:middle line:90%
chin.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:53.110 align:middle line:84%
We used to wear some
very light clothes that

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:57.250 align:middle line:84%
cover some parts of the body
even if we didn't have, like,

00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:00.730 align:middle line:84%
outer genitals like we
have in this planet.

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:05.470 align:middle line:84%
They were kind of nude mostly
with just some coverings

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:06.340 align:middle line:90%
on the top.

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:10.780 align:middle line:90%
And no hair and no language.

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:14.530 align:middle line:84%
All the communication
usually was telepathic.

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:16.390 align:middle line:90%
We were not that emotional.

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:19.660 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have
laughter, for example.

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.270 align:middle line:84%
Like, everyone was
still and, like,

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:25.930 align:middle line:90%
this meditational look like.

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:29.680 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of technology,
buildings, spaceship

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.810 align:middle line:90%
with triangular shapes.

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:37.180 align:middle line:84%
And we would move around the
planet with highways, bridges,

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:38.980 align:middle line:90%
and all these structures.

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:43.190 align:middle line:84%
We had pyramids with three
faces, not four like here.

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:48.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, all this civilization
was kind of the same culture.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.740 align:middle line:84%
The whole planet was kind
of using the same culture

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:55.440 align:middle line:84%
even if we had three different
races inside the planet.

physical and dynamical

indications suggesting the
existence of a third body

in the Sirius system or the
possibility of direct detection

the records is that Sirius C

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:20.860 align:middle line:10%
somehow got destroyed.

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.500 align:middle line:10%
I think it was maybe
not through wars,

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:27.220 align:middle line:10%
but maybe it was just kind of
an astronomical anomaly that

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.990 align:middle line:10%
created this
destruction of Sirius C.

of culture, technology,
and spirituality

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:47.410 align:middle line:84%

them towards their evolution

into modern Homo sapiens.

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>> The Sirian culture was
so important for many places

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.280 align:middle line:84%
in different parts of the
world because they would travel

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.230 align:middle line:90%
to these spots.

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Mainly, they were working
with the old equator

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:06.580 align:middle line:84%
that if you take-- that
the North Pole before

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:11.680 align:middle line:84%
was in north of United States,
the magnetical North Pole, all

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.220 align:middle line:84%
that territory, so that
creates that the whole equator

Mauritania in Africa,

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:32.180 align:middle line:84%
crossing through Egypt and the
pyramids, Middle East, Persia,

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:37.550 align:middle line:84%
which is Iran today, coming
back through Pakistan, India,

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:41.740 align:middle line:84%
Indonesia, and crossing
in the South Pacific Ocean

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:45.730 align:middle line:84%
through the French
Polynesia, and then coming

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:50.680 align:middle line:84%
up again through Easter
Island, and in Peru again.

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:54.980 align:middle line:84%
So this whole territory
would be touched by them.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:59.920 align:middle line:84%
So all the pyramids that you
can find in the world basically

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:04.660 align:middle line:84%
are part of a design that the
Sirius people have created.

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And they would come and
give this information

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:09.520 align:middle line:84%
to the most ancient
humans so they

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:15.320 align:middle line:84%
could walk around the planet

The humans asked the gods,
"Where do you come from?"

And they gave names.

But the names mean
nothing to us.

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:02.690 align:middle line:90%
The names are the names of them.

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:07.970 align:middle line:84%
To us, it's a word which has
no meaning on the firmament.

not only the people that came
from the Sirius star system,

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:19.390 align:middle line:10%
but how they were the seeders

And that's exactly what
the ancient Sumerians say

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:33.960 align:middle line:84%
in their tablets, was that this
group of beings came to Earth

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:37.080 align:middle line:84%

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:50.470 align:middle line:10%
contained human DNA, which
was one of the hypotheses that

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:54.310 align:middle line:10%
could explain these
strange bodies.

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:56.800 align:middle line:84%
That possibility was
explored, and the results

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.690 align:middle line:90%
were around a 10% match.

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:01.540 align:middle line:84%
In strict conditions,
and even relaxing some

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.430 align:middle line:84%
of the parameters,
we could not get

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:07.000 align:middle line:90%
a 100% match with human DNA.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.460 align:middle line:84%
The analysis included a
vast array of species.

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:13.360 align:middle line:84%
One of the software programs
we use in particular

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.780 align:middle line:84%
performs comparisons with
more than a million species

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:20.500 align:middle line:84%
which allows us to approximate
as much as possible the sample

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.840 align:middle line:84%
with the DNA of all
currently known species.

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.370 align:middle line:90%


00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:27.670 align:middle line:84%
Some species were
a higher match,

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:31.525 align:middle line:84%
some plants and bovine DNA, but
still in very small portions.

00:19:31.525 --> 00:19:34.810 align:middle line:90%


00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:37.540 align:middle line:84%
I have to say that this
sample contains DNA

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:39.610 align:middle line:90%
that we currently don't know.

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:42.910 align:middle line:84%
It could be from an organism
that has not been studied.

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:46.180 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps there was some
microbiological contamination

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:47.500 align:middle line:90%
of the samples.

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:51.520 align:middle line:84%
But it could also be original
DNA from these bodies.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.040 align:middle line:84%
That means that these bodies
could belong to a previously

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.560 align:middle line:90%
unknown species.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:00.760 align:middle line:84%
>> The genetic results were
also shown to William Brown,

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.550 align:middle line:84%
a biophysicist from
Southern California,

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:08.702 align:middle line:84%
and his take on the tests
were very interesting.

00:20:08.702 --> 00:20:17.670 align:middle line:10%
>> Of the DNA that was isolated,
only 25% of the total matched

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:21.520 align:middle line:10%
any known human gene.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:26.610 align:middle line:84%
So that means that
75% of this DNA

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:32.118 align:middle line:84%
is not matching any known
human reference sequence.

00:20:32.118 --> 00:20:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, this
is pretty rigorous

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:42.240 align:middle line:84%
because there's, like, the
1,000 human Genome Project where

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:45.840 align:middle line:84%
they have done the whole
genome sequencing of over 2,000

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:49.530 align:middle line:84%
individuals from every
continent on Earth

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:55.210 align:middle line:84%
and compiled kind of, like, a
average human reference genome.

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And so you take these sequences
isolated from the sample

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:03.750 align:middle line:84%
with this being, and you
go and you compare them

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:10.530 align:middle line:84%
to that human reference genome
data, and only 25% match up.

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:13.482 align:middle line:90%
75% don't.

00:21:13.482 --> 00:21:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>> If DNA that cannot be
matched with any known species

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:22.610 align:middle line:84%
in the database of human,
mammal, reptile, marine, bird,

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:27.170 align:middle line:84%
and plant life is indeed
of extraterrestrial origin,

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:31.336 align:middle line:84%
could it have a connection
to the Sirian beings?

00:21:31.336 --> 00:21:34.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Some people think that
different star nations like

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:38.460 align:middle line:84%
the Sirians came to Earth,
had an experience, and left,

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:40.020 align:middle line:90%
and never came back.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.850 align:middle line:90%
I strongly disagree.

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:46.680 align:middle line:84%
I feel that we have had
a continual influence

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.280 align:middle line:84%
of different galactic
cultures and galactic species

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.910 align:middle line:84%
on the planet in different
areas of the world over all

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:56.100 align:middle line:84%
of the last many
thousands of years.

00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:00.510 align:middle line:84%
The contact experiences never
stopped in the age of Atlantis.

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:02.240 align:middle line:90%
They continued on.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.520 align:middle line:84%
>> The important thing to know
about the Sirians is that they

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:09.750 align:middle line:84%
have designed our civilization,
our way of thinking.

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:12.150 align:middle line:84%
They were working
with our inner self.

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:14.400 align:middle line:10%
The Sirians were
designing the way

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:19.090 align:middle line:10%
we move in the planet, the
way we structure our world.

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:22.920 align:middle line:84%
So they have created
the first ideas

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:28.350 align:middle line:84%
of a civilization based in
architecture, in religion,

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:30.300 align:middle line:90%
in political aspects.

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:33.660 align:middle line:84%
That's why we still can see
some symbolisms from them

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:40.290 align:middle line:84%
like pope's hat, the ancient
Middle East hats, the Pharaohs

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:41.190 align:middle line:90%
hats.

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:46.170 align:middle line:84%
You can see the symbolism of
the Sirian people all over.

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:49.350 align:middle line:84%
Basically, they designed
the way in which

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:53.640 align:middle line:84%
we are related to one
another as a civilization.

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:56.880 align:middle line:84%
So to understand them,
to know about them,

00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:00.900 align:middle line:84%
helps us to understand
why we have created

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:03.420 align:middle line:84%
these kinds of
complex civilizations

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:06.960 align:middle line:84%
in the past, which is the basis,
the fundaments of all this.

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>> I think one of the most
important issues about

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:14.670 align:middle line:84%
the Sirius constellation is
that it's tied into the feminine

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:16.050 align:middle line:90%
aspect of creation.

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:19.170 align:middle line:84%
That's why the queen's
chamber points to it,

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:21.870 align:middle line:84%
the king's chamber
points to Orion.

00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:24.240 align:middle line:90%
So it's the feminine aspect.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.890 align:middle line:90%
It's a loving intelligence.

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:27.390 align:middle line:90%
It's a caring intelligence.

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:29.100 align:middle line:90%
It's a nurturing intelligence.

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.830 align:middle line:10%
It's a renewing
intelligence that's

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:34.230 align:middle line:10%
present connected
with the Sirius

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:36.750 align:middle line:10%
constellation of
the Sirian beings

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:38.640 align:middle line:10%
that come to this planet.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:43.110 align:middle line:84%
Legends tell us that they have
been around for many millennia,

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:47.110 align:middle line:84%
and that they are
positively here to help us.

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:50.100 align:middle line:84%
I believe very well could be
one of those intelligences

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:53.370 align:middle line:84%
connected with the galactic
federation who are working

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:56.115 align:middle line:90%
to help humanity even today.

00:23:56.115 --> 00:23:58.950 align:middle line:84%
>> The Sirians are
kind of the politicians

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:00.720 align:middle line:90%
of the confederation.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:05.250 align:middle line:84%
That's why they help beings
to build the pyramids and all

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:08.490 align:middle line:84%
the structures that opens
portals because they are

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:12.660 align:middle line:84%
basically the politicians that
tries to find communication

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:14.940 align:middle line:84%
and balance in between each
one of the planets that

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:16.425 align:middle line:90%
are becoming aware.

00:24:16.425 --> 00:24:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Today, I think humans are
at this extraordinary precipice

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:25.650 align:middle line:84%
of becoming an
interstellar species.

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And as we're going
into that initiation,

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:30.720 align:middle line:90%
the star families are here.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.630 align:middle line:84%
They're watching
us, caring for us,

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:38.340 align:middle line:84%
acting like adults watching
teenage kids figure out

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:41.650 align:middle line:84%
how to earn their
first driver's license.

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>> In my studies of the
extraterrestrial races,

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:50.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm probably most
fixated on the Sirians.

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:55.330 align:middle line:84%
I just have this innate desire
to know more about Ptah,

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:57.015 align:middle line:84%
and part of the
reason why that is

00:24:57.015 --> 00:25:01.260 align:middle line:84%
is because Ptah is the original
ascension teacher on Earth,

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:02.430 align:middle line:90%
in my opinion.

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very much interested
in this idea of ascension

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:10.500 align:middle line:84%
and how humans can transform
and scale the ladder to heaven.

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And in my opinion, it's the
Sirians that are most aligned

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.920 align:middle line:84%
with that, and so I'm most
aligned with the Sirians

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:19.394 align:middle line:90%
for that reason.

00:25:19.394 --> 00:25:23.350 align:middle line:84%
>> While remnants of ancient
contact with Sirians can be

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:25.840 align:middle line:84%
found in cultures
from around the world,

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:29.410 align:middle line:84%
perhaps nowhere is their
influence more obvious than

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:33.100 align:middle line:84%
on New Year's day
and the 4th of July.

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:36.010 align:middle line:84%
Embedded within these
cultural celebrations

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:40.330 align:middle line:84%
lay a hidden celestial
synchronicity.

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:43.120 align:middle line:84%
On January 1st,
Earth is directly

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.580 align:middle line:84%
in alignment with our
sun and the brightest

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:47.920 align:middle line:90%
star in the sky, Sirius.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.650 align:middle line:84%
Then again, Earth is
aligned with Sirius

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:54.130 align:middle line:84%
on the day when the United
States declared independence

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:56.920 align:middle line:90%
from British rule, July 4th.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:00.400 align:middle line:84%
Both dates are intimately
linked with traditions

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:04.180 align:middle line:84%
of ending one cycle and
transitioning to a new one,

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:07.690 align:middle line:84%
exactly six months
apart from one another.

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:11.590 align:middle line:84%
Might this be a coded nod
to the influence of Sirius

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:16.870 align:middle line:84%
and those space travelers
who left their mark with us?

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Join us in our next
episode when we

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.720 align:middle line:84%
explore another ET
race who has influenced

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:25.070 align:middle line:90%
humanity; the Pleiadians.

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:32.000 align:middle line:90%
