00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.460 align:middle line:84%
>> In 2009, NASA launched
the Kepler Mission satellite.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.350 align:middle line:84%
The reason given
for the mission was

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.340 align:middle line:84%
to search for and
discover new planets.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.590 align:middle line:84%
Kepler did this by
pointing its telescope

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.050 align:middle line:84%
at a certain area in space
looking for planetary transits.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.150 align:middle line:84%
A planetary transit is when
a planet passes in front

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.250 align:middle line:90%
of the star in its orbit.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.760 align:middle line:84%
As it transits, the planet
can be seen, measured,

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.500 align:middle line:90%
and understood.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.850 align:middle line:84%
In 2011, citizen scientists who
were looking at the Kepler data

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.310 align:middle line:90%
noticed something strange.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.350 align:middle line:10%
A star in the
Cygnus constellation

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.890 align:middle line:10%
was having a transit with
an asymmetrical object that

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.730 align:middle line:10%
was at least a thousand
times larger than the Earth.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Astronomer Tabitha Boyajian
became involved and confirmed

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.700 align:middle line:90%
that the data was correct.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.250 align:middle line:84%
The star, now
dubbed Tabby's Star,

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.620 align:middle line:84%
did Indeed have a huge
object orbiting it.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.100 align:middle line:10%
>> And so it was on, the classic
human versus machine gamble.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And if we found one planet,
we would be thrilled.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.780 align:middle line:10%
When I joined the
team four years ago,

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.650 align:middle line:10%
we had already found a couple.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.310 align:middle line:10%
And today, with the help of over
300,000 science enthusiasts,

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.110 align:middle line:10%
we have found dozens.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.075 align:middle line:84%
And we've also found one of
the most mysterious stars

00:01:42.075 --> 00:01:42.875 align:middle line:90%
in our galaxy.

00:01:42.875 --> 00:01:45.460 align:middle line:90%


00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.400 align:middle line:84%
So to understand
this, let me show you

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.980 align:middle line:84%
what a normal transit in
Kepler data looks like.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.060 align:middle line:10%
On this graph, on
the left-hand side,

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.200 align:middle line:10%
you have the amount of light,
and on the bottom is time.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.440 align:middle line:10%
The white line is the light
just from the star, what

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.690 align:middle line:10%
astronomers call a light curve.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, when a planet
transits a star,

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.590 align:middle line:84%
it blocks out a
little bit this light,

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.580 align:middle line:84%
and the depth of this transit
reflects the size of the object

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.210 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.660 align:middle line:10%
And so, for example,
let's take Jupiter.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.850 align:middle line:10%
Planets don't get much
bigger than Jupiter.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.660 align:middle line:10%
Jupiter will make a 1% drop
in a star's brightness.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.590 align:middle line:10%
Earth, on the other hand, is
11 times smaller than Jupiter,

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.780 align:middle line:10%
and its signal is barely
visible in the data.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.780 align:middle line:10%
So back to our mystery.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.730 align:middle line:84%
A few years ago,
planet hunters were

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.490 align:middle line:84%
sifting through data
looking for transits,

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.970 align:middle line:84%
and they spotted a mysterious
signal coming from the star KIC

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.160 align:middle line:90%
8462852.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.260 align:middle line:84%
The observations in May of 2009
were the first they spotted,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.590 align:middle line:84%
and they started talking about
this in the discussion forums.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.840 align:middle line:84%
They said an object
like Jupiter would

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.600 align:middle line:84%
make a drop like this
in the star's light,

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.990 align:middle line:84%
but they're also
saying it was giant.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.230 align:middle line:84%
You see, transits normally
only last for a few hours,

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.160 align:middle line:84%
and this one lasted
for almost a week.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.760 align:middle line:84%
They were also saying
that it looks asymmetric,

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.930 align:middle line:84%
meaning that instead of the
clean, U-shaped dip that we saw

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.580 align:middle line:84%
with Jupiter, it had this
strange slope that you

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.500 align:middle line:90%
can see on the left side.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.590 align:middle line:84%
This seemed to indicate that
whatever is getting in the way

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.520 align:middle line:84%
and blocking the star light
was not circular like a planet.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.260 align:middle line:84%
There are a few more
dips that happened,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.690 align:middle line:84%
but for a couple of years
it was pretty quiet.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.400 align:middle line:10%
And then, in March
of 2011, we see this.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.246 align:middle line:10%
The star's light
drops by a whole 15%.

00:03:35.246 --> 00:03:37.880 align:middle line:10%
And this is huge compared
to a planet which

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.750 align:middle line:10%
would only make a 1% drop.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.450 align:middle line:84%
We described this feature
as both smooth and clean.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.860 align:middle line:84%
It also is asymmetric,
having a gradual dimming that

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.650 align:middle line:84%
lasts almost a week, and then
it snaps right back up to normal

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.210 align:middle line:90%
in just a matter of days.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:04:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And, again, after this, not much
happens until February of 2013.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.930 align:middle line:84%
Things start to
get really crazy.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.360 align:middle line:10%
There is a huge complex of dips
in the light curve that appear,

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.490 align:middle line:10%
and they last for
a hundred days,

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.550 align:middle line:10%
all the way up into the
Kepler Mission's end.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.500 align:middle line:90%
These dips have variable shapes.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.750 align:middle line:84%
Some are very sharp
and some are broad,

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.029 align:middle line:84%
and they also have
variable durations.

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:24.360 align:middle line:84%
Some last just for a day or two
and some for more than a week.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And there is also
up and down trends

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.100 align:middle line:84%
within some of
these dips, almost

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.430 align:middle line:84%
like several independent
events were superimposed

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.230 align:middle line:90%
on top of each other.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And at this time, this star
drops in its brightness

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.100 align:middle line:90%
over 20%.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Author and researcher Andrew
Collins has been interested

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.060 align:middle line:84%
in the mythology surrounding the
constellation Cygnus for many

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.800 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.440 align:middle line:10%
>> Cygnus is the constellation
of the swan or celestial bird.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.670 align:middle line:10%
It's also known as
the Northern Cross.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.960 align:middle line:84%
It's a series of stars
in the shape of a cross.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.560 align:middle line:84%
In Christian tradition it
was the cross of Calvary,

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.220 align:middle line:84%
and it's very
prominent in the skies,

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.320 align:middle line:90%
particularly in the summer.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.930 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, its brightest
star Deneb forms

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.090 align:middle line:84%
part of what's known
as the Summer Triangle

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.100 align:middle line:84%
with two other stars
which are Vega and Altair.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And for the ancients it would
seem that this area of the sky

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.070 align:middle line:84%
was very, very important,
initially because it's

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.220 align:middle line:84%
placed on the Milky Way,
the edge of our own galaxy

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.460 align:middle line:84%
which is this huge starry
stream that crosses from one

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.270 align:middle line:84%
side of the sky to the other,
that was always seen as a path

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.940 align:middle line:84%
or road on which the
souls of the dead

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.410 align:middle line:90%
could enter the afterlife.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And they would make a leap
of faith onto the Milky Way

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.280 align:middle line:84%
at a certain point, and
that point generally

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.920 align:middle line:84%
was associated with the
constellation of Orion,

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.890 align:middle line:84%
obviously another
very important star

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.230 align:middle line:90%
group in ancient traditions.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.440 align:middle line:84%
However, it would then
carry on its journey

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.870 align:middle line:84%
until it reached the point
where the Milky Way bifurcated

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.410 align:middle line:84%
or broke into two
separate streams.

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And these two
separate streams were

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.110 align:middle line:84%
seen as a bridge, a bridge
with two possibilities.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.540 align:middle line:84%
One, if the soul
was bad, they would

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.870 align:middle line:84%
go into oblivion or
possibly reincarnation.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.910 align:middle line:84%
If the soul had been
good, was righteous,

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.880 align:middle line:84%
it would continue
along the other stream

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.680 align:middle line:90%
and enter into the afterlife.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.380 align:middle line:10%
And therefore, the
stars of Cygnus

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.770 align:middle line:10%
that corresponded to the
position of this bifurcation

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.350 align:middle line:10%
of the Milky Way
became associated

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.910 align:middle line:10%
with the entry of the
soul into the next world.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:36.410 align:middle line:10%
And adding to all of this is
the fact that around 15,000

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:41.030 align:middle line:10%
BC, the stars of Cygnus, for
a period of around that time

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:45.890 align:middle line:10%
of around 3,000 years,
was the so-called turning

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:48.290 align:middle line:10%
point of the heavens,
the place that's

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.400 align:middle line:10%
occupied today by
Polaris, the pole star.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:56.270 align:middle line:84%
Although, at that time, it was
the bright star Deneb in Cygnus

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:57.830 align:middle line:90%
that was the pole star.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And ancient shamanic
tradition has

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.130 align:middle line:84%
seen this position,
which is correctly

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:08.180 align:middle line:84%
known as the Northern Celestial
Pole, as the point of exit

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.640 align:middle line:84%
from the physical world and
the entry into they sky world.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:16.240 align:middle line:84%
So all of those ideas came
together in Palaeolithic time.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's for this
reason that in cave art

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.250 align:middle line:84%
across southwest
Europe, particularly

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.370 align:middle line:84%
in the Lascaux Cave in the
Dordogne region of France,

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.420 align:middle line:84%
you see images that are
clearly of the night sky.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.440 align:middle line:10%
Archaeoastronomers
have written about this

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.860 align:middle line:10%
and they said it's focusing
on the Northern heavens

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.530 align:middle line:10%
and the Cygnus
constellation in particular,

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:40.220 align:middle line:10%
and it's usually represented
as a bird, a bird on a pole

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.260 align:middle line:10%
or a bird man or
something like that.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And it would seem as
if the association

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.570 align:middle line:84%
of that constellation with
a bird is extremely ancient

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.480 align:middle line:84%
and goes back to
Palaeolithic times.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.670 align:middle line:90%
And why a bird?

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:55.970 align:middle line:84%
Because a bird was
seen to carry the soul

00:07:55.970 --> 00:08:00.770 align:middle line:84%
from this world to the
next and to bring souls

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:02.660 align:middle line:90%
into incarnation.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, we all know the story
about the stork bringing babies

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:10.190 align:middle line:84%
into the world, a popular
European folk tradition.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:14.570 align:middle line:84%
However, it's a fact that in
several countries of Europe,

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.860 align:middle line:84%
and I suspect probably
more in the past,

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.130 align:middle line:84%
it was the swan that brought
babies into the world.

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:22.400 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, we're not
talking about real babies

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.900 align:middle line:84%
here because quite
clearly they grow

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:25.490 align:middle line:90%
inside the womb of a mother.

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:28.910 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about bringing
the souls of newborn children

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.980 align:middle line:84%
into this world,
and somehow that's

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.240 align:middle line:90%
become distorted across time.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.049 align:middle line:84%
So you've got the idea
of these soul birds,

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:39.200 align:middle line:90%
a swan in Europe and Asia.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.120 align:middle line:84%
In other parts of the
world, different birds.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.909 align:middle line:84%
For instance, in North
America, the same tradition

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:49.520 align:middle line:84%
was associated with raptor
birds, like hawks and eagles.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.580 align:middle line:84%
In the Near East and Tur--
what is today Turkey,

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:56.040 align:middle line:90%
it was the vulture.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.560 align:middle line:90%
Why a vulture?

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:02.540 align:middle line:84%
Because a vulture was associated
with the act of sky burial,

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:05.420 align:middle line:84%
which is also known
as excarnation.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:10.190 align:middle line:10%
This is the idea that the bodies
of the dead were placed out,

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:13.670 align:middle line:10%
generally on a wooden platform,
and vultures would come down

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:16.282 align:middle line:10%
and peck the bodies
clean of their flesh

00:09:16.282 --> 00:09:17.990 align:middle line:10%
leaving behind the
bones which would then

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.840 align:middle line:10%
be collected up
and either interred

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.420 align:middle line:10%
or the skull occasionally
used for oracular

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.900 align:middle line:10%
purposes, communication
with the ancestors.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
the vulture became

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.970 align:middle line:84%
associated with the
idea of carrying

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:33.800 align:middle line:84%
the soul from this
world to the next,

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.960 align:middle line:84%
and again, bringing
it into this world.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.170 align:middle line:84%
This is shown not only at
places like Gobekli Tepe,

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:41.600 align:middle line:84%
the largest and most
important stone temple

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.700 align:middle line:84%
complex in the world
based about 9500 BC,

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.500 align:middle line:84%
and that's in southeast
Turkey, but also

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.800 align:middle line:84%
at many other sites in this
region, like Catalhoyuk.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.280 align:middle line:84%
This is this town or urban
center of the Neolithic

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.900 align:middle line:84%
going back to about 7000 BC
in southern central Turkey.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:04.310 align:middle line:84%
Here you see images on
the walls of vultures

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:06.860 align:middle line:84%
that are swooping down
and seem to be picking

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:10.580 align:middle line:84%
clean the bodies of
the dead, but also you

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:14.130 align:middle line:84%
see the vultures having
human fetuses in their back.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.070 align:middle line:84%
They're bringing
souls into the world.

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And some you see a head, just
a head, in the shape of a ball

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.400 align:middle line:84%
with just a couple
of eyes and a mouth,

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.130 align:middle line:84%
being taken under
the wings of vultures

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:27.560 align:middle line:84%
as if they're
protecting this, which

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.320 align:middle line:84%
is the symbol of the soul,
the skull or the head

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.240 align:middle line:90%
became the symbol of the soul.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.760 align:middle line:10%
And this particular
image, the idea

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.640 align:middle line:10%
of the vultures taking
the head into their care,

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.770 align:middle line:10%
is like them taking the
soul into their possession

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:43.160 align:middle line:10%
and then taking it
and accompanying it

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.310 align:middle line:10%
to the sky world.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.370 align:middle line:84%
The sky world was
almost certainly

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:49.340 align:middle line:84%
in the vicinity of the
Cygnus constellation.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.070 align:middle line:10%
And it's interesting
that in the Near East

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:55.550 align:middle line:10%
and in neighboring Armenia,
the symbol for Cygnus

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.500 align:middle line:10%
is the vulture.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And even in Egypt we find
the symbol of the soul

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.140 align:middle line:90%
was also a bird.

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:06.290 align:middle line:84%
The higher aspect of the soul,
which is known as the akh,

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:08.780 align:middle line:84%
was represented
by the Ibis bird.

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:11.990 align:middle line:84%
The ba, which is another
part of the soul,

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:13.580 align:middle line:90%
was represented by the hawk.

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And we can see there these
same traditions which

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.700 align:middle line:84%
we find elsewhere in the world,
not just in Europe and in Asia

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.090 align:middle line:84%
but also in North
American tradition,

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:27.080 align:middle line:84%
and even in the Pacific, Cygnus
was a bird of paradise that

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.990 align:middle line:84%
was associated with
creation and bringing life

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.990 align:middle line:84%
into the world on very
specific islands, like Hawaii,

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:33.960 align:middle line:90%
for instance.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.860 align:middle line:84%
So we can say that
we might understand

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:40.340 align:middle line:84%
why Cygnus was important
to the ancient mindset.

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.560 align:middle line:84%
It's prominently placed on
the Milky Way, which was

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.540 align:middle line:90%
a road or river to the stars.

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Cygnus itself was
once the turning point

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:50.180 align:middle line:84%
of the heavens going back
to Palaeolithic times.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And obviously even
the shape, which

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:55.730 align:middle line:84%
is a beautiful cross, which
around November each year

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:58.610 align:middle line:84%
stands up on the horizon and
is probably one of the reasons

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.160 align:middle line:84%
why it was adopted in
Christian tradition

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.940 align:middle line:84%
as the symbol of Christ
and resurrection.

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:08.780 align:middle line:90%
But there's far more to Cygnus.

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:12.650 align:middle line:84%
Because, is it possible that
the ancients knew something

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:15.800 align:middle line:84%
about Cygnus which
perhaps we are only

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:19.340 align:middle line:84%
beginning to understand
today for the first time?

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:23.180 align:middle line:84%
For instance, between
2011 and 2013,

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:27.170 align:middle line:84%
the Kepler space telescope in
the constellation of Cygnus

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:28.230 align:middle line:90%
noticed--

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:29.930 align:middle line:84%
and I say noticed
within the data that

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:31.580 align:middle line:90%
was being sent back to Earth--

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:34.010 align:middle line:84%
one particular star that was
doing something very peculiar

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:34.810 align:middle line:90%
indeed.

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:39.110 align:middle line:10%
Periodically, its light
was dipping by as much as,

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:43.640 align:middle line:10%
on one occasion 17%, on
another occasion 22%.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:46.322 align:middle line:10%
And the astronomers, when they
saw this and realized this,

00:12:46.322 --> 00:12:47.780 align:middle line:10%
they couldn't
understand it at all.

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:50.780 align:middle line:10%
It was a complete mystery
because stars don't usually

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:51.620 align:middle line:10%
do this.

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:54.050 align:middle line:84%
Very young stars will
do this if they've

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:58.400 align:middle line:84%
got a lot of what they call
planetary material just flowing

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.860 align:middle line:84%
around, orbiting
around the star,

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:06.050 align:middle line:84%
gradually coalescing to become
planets like our own, Earth.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:07.640 align:middle line:90%
But this is not a young star.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:11.600 align:middle line:84%
This is a main sequence star,
very much like our own Sun,

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.220 align:middle line:90%
just slightly larger, I think.

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And yet, it was doing
these strange dips.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And it seemed to have a
certain regularity about it.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:22.400 align:middle line:84%
There were certain
cycles, periodicities

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.160 align:middle line:84%
as they call them, which suggest
that there's something very,

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:29.030 align:middle line:84%
very strange in the
orbit around the star,

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:32.150 align:middle line:84%
but nothing, no model that could
be put forward at this time

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:33.260 align:middle line:90%
explains it.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And this star is
called KIC 8462852.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.120 align:middle line:84%
But you don't have to
worry about remembering

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.870 align:middle line:84%
that because it's also known
as Tabby's Star or Boyajian's

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:46.670 align:middle line:90%
Star.

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:49.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's after the
astronomer, the first,

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:53.150 align:middle line:84%
discovered and wrote about
it, who's Tabitha Boyajian.

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:55.070 align:middle line:90%
She's of Yale university.

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And she wrote a paper that
came out in 2015 suggesting

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:02.990 align:middle line:84%
that it was a swarm of
comments, and she admits openly

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:05.960 align:middle line:84%
that this was her best option,
that there was nothing else

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.580 align:middle line:84%
around at the time that could
even possibly try and explain

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:09.380 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:14.000 align:middle line:84%
But then, one of her colleagues,
Jason Wright of Penn State,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.760 align:middle line:84%
suggested that these dips
were exactly what we've

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:20.240 align:middle line:84%
been looking for to
possibly provide evidence

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.640 align:middle line:90%
of an alien civilization.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.840 align:middle line:84%
Because, back in
1960, a physicist

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:29.620 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Freeman Dyson
had a thought experiment,

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:30.850 align:middle line:90%
as he called it.

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And this was the fact that
when civilizations grow,

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.670 align:middle line:84%
eventually they will
expend all of the energy

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:41.180 align:middle line:84%
and resources of
their own planet,

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:44.140 align:middle line:84%
so they will look elsewhere
to get the energy to power

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:47.110 align:middle line:84%
their spaceships, computers,
whatever else they've got,

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:49.060 align:middle line:90%
houses, electricity.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:52.540 align:middle line:10%
And they'll look towards
either their own star

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:55.030 align:middle line:10%
or a neighboring star,
and they will then

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:59.650 align:middle line:10%
build what might be
described as a megastructure

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:04.240 align:middle line:10%
to harness this energy, like
an almighty solar panel,

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:09.400 align:middle line:10%
to draw this energy, store
it, and then somehow radiate

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.870 align:middle line:10%
that back to their home planet.

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And he hypothesized
that you could even

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:19.990 align:middle line:84%
encircle the star with some
kind of construction, which came

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:21.850 align:middle line:90%
to be known as a Dyson Sphere.

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And over the years this
idea was developed.

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:26.380 align:middle line:84%
People said, well, maybe
this model doesn't work.

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.440 align:middle line:84%
What about if they were
swarms or arrays or series

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:31.820 align:middle line:84%
of different smaller
objects in orbit?

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And the latest idea
is a Dyson Ring,

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:39.130 align:middle line:84%
like a ring of objects that
are drawing this energy off.

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:42.340 align:middle line:84%
Is that what was going
on around Tabby's Star?

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:45.220 align:middle line:84%
This is what was suggested,
and that suggestion

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:50.740 align:middle line:84%
created an incredible response
in the international media.

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:53.590 align:middle line:10%
>> Possibility of an
extraterrestrial civilization.

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:55.270 align:middle line:10%
Why haven't they
made contact with us?

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:57.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Not just within the science
media but amongst the general

00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:58.900 align:middle line:90%
public as well.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.150 align:middle line:90%
And this story has run and run.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And although there have been
various counter-theories,

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:07.940 align:middle line:84%
the proposed natural
explanations like,

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:12.520 align:middle line:84%
oh, it's just a star that's
eaten a planet and burping

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.890 align:middle line:84%
and it takes a long
while, this just

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:17.170 align:middle line:84%
doesn't seem to
fit the evidence.

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And although it might help
the skeptics to sleep better

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:25.110 align:middle line:84%
at night, everybody
else is still thinking,

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:29.000 align:middle line:84%
no, it could be an
alien megastructure.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And then, finally,
the astronomers

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.980 align:middle line:84%
have announced that
it's doing it again.

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:36.140 align:middle line:90%
It's happening again.

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:40.760 align:middle line:84%
The light of the star is
dipping dramatically once more

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.220 align:middle line:84%
and has been over
the last few days.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And the astronomers
involved have called out

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:50.960 align:middle line:84%
to the telescopes, large
and small around the world,

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:54.770 align:middle line:84%
to look at this star on
every frequency, everything

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:59.000 align:middle line:84%
from visual observation
to light spectra,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.710 align:middle line:84%
to the different
colors that would

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:06.240 align:middle line:84%
come from it, to infrared,
ultraviolet, X-ray, radios.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:09.710 align:middle line:84%
The SETI telescopes at Green
Bank are looking at it now.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:13.010 align:middle line:84%
They're even trying to get the
Hubble Space Telescope to turn

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:15.380 align:middle line:84%
to look at the star at
this very, very moment,

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:17.089 align:middle line:90%
virtually as I speak.

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:20.130 align:middle line:84%
It's an extremely exciting
thing that's going on.

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:23.300 align:middle line:84%
This is the first time something
like this has happened,

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:26.390 align:middle line:84%
and that all eyes are
focused not just on a star

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:31.790 align:middle line:84%
but a star that could well have
an alien megastructure built

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:35.060 align:middle line:84%
by an extraterrestrial
civilization.

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:39.080 align:middle line:10%
And all eyes are
on this spot now.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.060 align:middle line:10%
And that's the way
that it stands,

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.230 align:middle line:10%
but we can go beyond this.

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:46.430 align:middle line:10%
Because, firstly, an engineer
that I've been working with,

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:51.830 align:middle line:10%
Rodney Hale, has used the raw
data from Kepler from 2011

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:54.950 align:middle line:10%
through to 2013 to
physically model

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:59.630 align:middle line:10%
the objects or objects involved,
and it looks very strange.

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:04.130 align:middle line:10%
It's an ellipse with this
very long, he calls them wings

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:06.940 align:middle line:10%
but you might call
it tails going out

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.350 align:middle line:10%
that precede it and follow it.

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:12.710 align:middle line:10%
And this looks unlike anything
that you've seen before.

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:15.155 align:middle line:10%
It's incredibly peculiar.

00:18:15.155 --> 00:18:16.990 align:middle line:90%
It's certainly not a comet.

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:18.840 align:middle line:90%
It's certainly not a planet.

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:19.900 align:middle line:90%
It's certainly not round.

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.670 align:middle line:10%
A round object, like
a planet, would not

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:26.090 align:middle line:10%
create this type of what
they call a light curve

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:27.920 align:middle line:10%
within the light flux.

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.860 align:middle line:10%
So there's something really
odd going on, that's point one.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:35.540 align:middle line:10%
But secondly is that there are
certain periodicities or cycles

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:38.360 align:middle line:10%
involved in the
data, and these could

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.780 align:middle line:10%
seem to be like orbits
of the star or orbits

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.000 align:middle line:10%
or something else
that's going around it.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.390 align:middle line:84%
One, for instance,
is 0.88 of a day,

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:49.550 align:middle line:90%
in other words, nearly a day.

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:51.500 align:middle line:90%
Another is 48 days.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And there are half cycle
echoes of both of these.

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:55.710 align:middle line:10%
Now, if you start
looking at them,

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:59.510 align:middle line:10%
they generate specific
numbers, and these numbers

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:02.660 align:middle line:10%
are associated not only
to do with the Golden

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:06.380 align:middle line:10%
Angle and the Fibonacci
Sequence but also a very

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:10.460 align:middle line:10%
complex and incredible
mathematical formula known

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:14.240 align:middle line:10%
as Pascal's Triangle, which
is used to solve problems

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.290 align:middle line:10%
of probability.

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:19.640 align:middle line:10%
It could be used very simply
to create the entire Fibonacci

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.400 align:middle line:10%
Sequence.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's first number,
it's like a pyramid.

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:25.925 align:middle line:90%
The first number is 11.

00:19:25.925 --> 00:19:29.090 align:middle line:10%
The second number is
121, which is 11 squared.

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:33.950 align:middle line:84%
The third number is
1331, which is 11 cubed.

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:36.980 align:middle line:84%
And it all relates to 11
and the key number also

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:41.240 align:middle line:84%
121 because 121 is
the correspondence

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:44.850 align:middle line:84%
between the cycles of Tabby's
Star and the own rotation

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:45.650 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth.

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:49.670 align:middle line:84%
In other words, every
121 days, the Earth

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:56.420 align:middle line:84%
synchronizes perfectly with the
periodicities of Tabby's Star.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And what this means
is that if there

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:02.630 align:middle line:84%
is one number that you could
say connects us with this star,

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:04.745 align:middle line:90%
it's 121.

00:20:04.745 --> 00:20:05.870 align:middle line:90%
It's a mathematical number.

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:07.910 align:middle line:84%
It's very important,
but there's more.

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:12.290 align:middle line:10%
Because the Great Pyramid,
the iconic monument

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:14.960 align:middle line:10%
of the ancient world,
the construction

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:18.920 align:middle line:10%
seems to be focused around
not just multiples of 11,

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.780 align:middle line:10%
but if one number
comes out of this,

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:24.230 align:middle line:10%
and my good friend and
colleague Robert Bauval

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:27.930 align:middle line:10%
is talking about this in
his lectures, it's 121.

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:30.830 align:middle line:84%
Rudolf Gantenbrink,
the German engineer

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:32.870 align:middle line:84%
that sent the robots
up inside the air

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:35.000 align:middle line:84%
shafts of the Great
Pyramid, he also

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.460 align:middle line:84%
has realized this, and
many other people as well.

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.630 align:middle line:84%
It gives us an opportunity
to actually use

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:45.500 align:middle line:84%
this new knowledge, this
quantum understanding,

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:50.420 align:middle line:84%
to perhaps make this direct
link with a nonterrestrial

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:52.700 align:middle line:84%
intelligence and
to get a response.

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:57.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what better opportunity
now, when half the world's

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:02.810 align:middle line:84%
telescopes are focused on one
star, one star that's already

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:06.980 align:middle line:84%
seen to be associated with an
extraterrestrial civilization,

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:09.890 align:middle line:84%
to actually say, look,
whilst all these telescopes

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:13.070 align:middle line:84%
are focused on you,
please do something.

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:16.580 align:middle line:84%
Appear, make pretty
colors, let off fireworks,

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:19.520 align:middle line:84%
do something that these
telescopes are going to be able

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:24.800 align:middle line:84%
to see and record and come
back with the answer that, no,

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.630 align:middle line:84%
we cannot explain
this whatsoever.

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:30.390 align:middle line:84%
Something incredibly
weird is going on.

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And the other
strange coincidence,

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:39.300 align:middle line:84%
if coincidence is the word, is
that within the southern shaft

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:42.780 align:middle line:84%
of the Queen's Chamber inside
the Great Pyramid, that

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:45.180 align:middle line:84%
was explored
initially in the 1990s

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.750 align:middle line:84%
by German engineer
Rudolf Gantenbrink

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:52.080 align:middle line:84%
but subsequently by other
teams that investigated

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:56.550 align:middle line:84%
these strange little doors or
panels they've come across,

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:59.760 align:middle line:84%
60-odd meters inside
the pyramid itself,

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:04.650 align:middle line:84%
they penetrated using a
drill on a little tiny robot

00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:09.420 align:middle line:84%
and put a camera through to
look at what's beyond this door,

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.540 align:middle line:84%
and they found hieroglyphs,
or in fact they're

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:16.432 align:middle line:84%
hieratics, which is a sort of
rough form of Egyptian writing.

00:22:16.432 --> 00:22:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And people looked at them
and said, oh, they're

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:20.070 align:middle line:90%
just Mason marks.

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:23.140 align:middle line:84%
Obviously some work gang
has put their mark on it.

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:26.520 align:middle line:10%
But somebody has actually
shown, very cleverly,

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:30.720 align:middle line:10%
that this is actually
the number 121 written

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:35.730 align:middle line:10%
in a strange confirmation of
the number 121 being important.

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:38.900 align:middle line:84%
That is the number of
the Great Pyramid, 121.

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.320 align:middle line:90%
And you think, well, hold on.

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.600 align:middle line:84%
How can you possibly
link some star

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:48.600 align:middle line:84%
that's generating light
dips in 2011, 2013, 2017

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.720 align:middle line:84%
with something that
was built in 2600 BC?

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
this is where it all

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:55.590 align:middle line:84%
starts getting very,
very interesting

00:22:55.590 --> 00:23:00.120 align:middle line:84%
because Tabby's Star is 1300
light years away from here.

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:03.150 align:middle line:84%
That's not only a long
way, but what it means

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:06.720 align:middle line:84%
is that any messages that
you wanted to send there

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.825 align:middle line:84%
would take 1300
years to be received.

00:23:08.825 --> 00:23:10.200 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
even if we did

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:13.710 align:middle line:84%
confirm that an alien
intelligence was behind this,

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:15.630 align:middle line:90%
how would we respond to it?

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:17.730 align:middle line:84%
Because if we sent
back a message

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:20.910 align:middle line:84%
through whatever means and
said, we got your message,

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:21.960 align:middle line:90%
the numbers 121.

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:22.760 align:middle line:90%
Yep, we got that.

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:24.260 align:middle line:10%
And you send it to
them, they're not

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:25.817 align:middle line:10%
going to receive
it for 1,300 years.

00:23:25.817 --> 00:23:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And if they then
receive that and say,

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:30.330 align:middle line:84%
oh, there's this place
called Earth down there

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:32.490 align:middle line:90%
that's received our signal.

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:33.660 align:middle line:90%
We'll send them a message.

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:35.390 align:middle line:84%
It's going to take
another 1,300 years.

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:39.390 align:middle line:84%
So that means round cycle is a
communication for 2,600 years.

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:42.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, you would have thought
that the universe as a whole

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:45.840 align:middle line:84%
would have worked in a
better way of communication

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:50.220 align:middle line:84%
between two different species in
different parts of the galaxy.

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.720 align:middle line:90%
And, of course, it has.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.720 align:middle line:84%
It's what we call
quantum entanglement.

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:59.220 align:middle line:84%
Quantum entanglement is the
idea that every particle

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:03.030 align:middle line:84%
splits in two and these
separate and go their own ways.

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:04.710 align:middle line:84%
Why it does this,
I have no idea.

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:08.460 align:middle line:84%
But what we know is
that if you tweak

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:11.640 align:middle line:84%
one of those twin
particles, the other one

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:14.350 align:middle line:84%
will respond in an equal
and opposite direction.

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:15.820 align:middle line:90%
So how does this help us?

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:18.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are trillions
and trillions and trillions

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:22.230 align:middle line:84%
of particles doing everything
around us, dancing to create us

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:24.250 align:middle line:84%
and everything around
us all the time.

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:26.100 align:middle line:84%
They make up the
universe, of course.

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And, therefore, if
they are dancing

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:32.430 align:middle line:84%
in sequences, in systems,
in patterns, at least some

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:34.710 align:middle line:84%
of those twins will be
doing the same thing

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:38.010 align:middle line:84%
elsewhere, i.e. within the mind
of somebody else around you,

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:42.120 align:middle line:84%
within trees, within animals,
within aliens on other planets.

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Distance means nothing
on a quantum level.

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:47.280 align:middle line:84%
The physicists have
done experiments

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:50.653 align:middle line:84%
to try and show that this
connection between particles

00:24:50.653 --> 00:24:53.070 align:middle line:84%
exists the further out you go,
and I think, at the moment,

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:55.770 align:middle line:84%
they've got it up to something
like 20 kilometers from two

00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:57.900 align:middle line:84%
different islands, I think
they're in the Canaries,

00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.130 align:middle line:90%
and it still works.

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:02.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's clear the mathematical
theory behind this is correct.

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.810 align:middle line:84%
So these ideas are almost
like sound resonance.

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:08.850 align:middle line:84%
The idea that an
aircraft passing over

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:10.890 align:middle line:84%
is going to rattle the
pane of your window

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:13.720 align:middle line:84%
because it resonates at
exactly the same frequency.

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:16.440 align:middle line:84%
So when we think of
this, this therefore

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:20.640 align:middle line:84%
starts to bring us into ideas
of telepathy, of remote viewing,

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.340 align:middle line:84%
between two different people
or two different places.

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:26.130 align:middle line:84%
All of these ideas
suddenly become possible.

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:29.040 align:middle line:84%
But not just that,
but consciousness

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.420 align:middle line:90%
is involved with this.

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:33.420 align:middle line:10%
Because in the experiments,
on a subatomic level,

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:37.860 align:middle line:10%
if you observe a particle,
which before observation can

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:42.450 align:middle line:10%
be either in the state
of a wave or a particle

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:44.730 align:middle line:10%
that does its own thing,
makes its own choices,

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:48.540 align:middle line:10%
as soon as we observe
that particle or wave,

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:52.930 align:middle line:10%
it immediately collapses into
a particle and remains as such.

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:56.410 align:middle line:10%
It fixes it to our
physical reality.

00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:59.700 align:middle line:84%
In other words, consciousness
through observation

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:03.030 align:middle line:84%
affects the subatomic
world and in many ways

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:05.460 align:middle line:84%
probably even creates
physical reality.

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:08.130 align:middle line:84%
Through this, consciousness
creates reality.

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:10.830 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a very
subtle form of psychokinesis,

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:13.350 align:middle line:84%
if you like, the idea of
being able to move an object.

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:15.100 align:middle line:84%
But here we're not
moving an object,

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.990 align:middle line:84%
we're just observing
a subatomic particle

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:19.630 align:middle line:90%
and causing it to collapse.

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:22.680 align:middle line:84%
So how does this help
us with communication

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:23.640 align:middle line:90%
with Tabby's Star?

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:27.330 align:middle line:10%
Well, what it suggests
is that communication

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:29.930 align:middle line:10%
is possible instantaneously.

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:32.060 align:middle line:10%
That's the other
important point here

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:35.450 align:middle line:10%
is that the connection between
these twin particles that

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:38.570 align:middle line:10%
remains is instantaneous
and nonlocal.

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:41.600 align:middle line:84%
What that means is that there's
nothing between them when

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.850 align:middle line:84%
that communication
takes place, nothing.

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:46.260 align:middle line:84%
If there was, it would be
called a local connection,

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:47.060 align:middle line:90%
but it's not.

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:50.150 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing to connect
them, so it becomes nonlocal,

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:52.310 align:middle line:84%
and nonlocality is
something that actually

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:54.170 align:middle line:90%
worried Einstein a lot.

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:57.740 align:middle line:84%
He referred to it as
spooky action at a distance

00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:01.170 align:middle line:84%
and said that God doesn't play
dice with the universe, which

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:03.910 align:middle line:84%
is interesting because
it sort of troubled him

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:08.720 align:middle line:84%
that these ideas may well
affect his own equations.

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.310 align:middle line:84%
They didn't at
all because he was

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:13.110 align:middle line:84%
talking about the physical
universe as a whole.

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:16.190 align:middle line:84%
All of this is on the
quantum or subatomic level,

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:17.480 align:middle line:90%
and that's outside of time.

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.420 align:middle line:84%
That's the other
important point here.

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And because it's
outside of time,

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:25.490 align:middle line:84%
if we were to send a message
to aliens at Tabby's Star,

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:29.060 align:middle line:84%
yes, they would be able to send
back an instantaneous response

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:31.320 align:middle line:84%
on a subatomic level,
in other words,

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.160 align:middle line:84%
as a message that
may enter our minds.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.900 align:middle line:84%
But at that point,
they could also

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:41.090 align:middle line:84%
send a message either directly
or inadvertently to the past.

00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:43.730 align:middle line:84%
They could affect the
mind of the architect

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:46.220 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid
to incorporate

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:48.650 align:middle line:84%
the number 121 and
other key numbers

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:52.490 align:middle line:84%
to do with phi and pi
and Fibonacci, whatever,

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:54.170 align:middle line:90%
into the Great Pyramid.

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:56.900 align:middle line:84%
It's possible through
quantum entanglement.

00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:00.110 align:middle line:10%
And as my colleague Robert
Bauval has been saying,

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:03.560 align:middle line:10%
he is coming to the conclusion,
working with an astronomer

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:06.170 align:middle line:10%
by the name of Chandra
Whitman Singh who

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:09.800 align:middle line:10%
has looked at the idea
of directed panspermia,

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:12.370 align:middle line:10%
the idea that life
on Earth was seeded

00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:14.730 align:middle line:10%
at some very early
point, perhaps

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:16.225 align:middle line:10%
from comets or
something like that,

00:28:16.225 --> 00:28:18.590 align:middle line:10%
that the Great Pyramid,
the design of it,

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:22.970 align:middle line:10%
could have been inspired
by a nonterrestrial source.

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And I also am coming
to the same conclusion.

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And because of this, I
think that this association,

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:31.340 align:middle line:84%
this connection with
Tabby's Star at the moment

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:33.712 align:middle line:90%
is incredibly important.

00:28:33.712 --> 00:28:35.560 align:middle line:90%

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:41.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Our ancient connection to the
constellation of Cygnus is only

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:44.650 align:middle line:10%
now beginning to be understood
by researchers like Andrew

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:45.910 align:middle line:10%
Collins.

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:48.010 align:middle line:84%
As more astronomers
turn their telescopes

00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:50.920 align:middle line:84%
to examine Tabby's
Star, perhaps we'll

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:55.120 align:middle line:84%
discover what exactly
is orbiting that star.

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.910 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps one day we'll
come to understand

00:28:57.910 --> 00:29:01.210 align:middle line:84%
the strange and odd
connection between Cygnus

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:02.500 align:middle line:90%
and the people of the past.

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:07.200 align:middle line:90%


00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.510 align:middle line:84%
In our next episode,
we'll look at the control

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:14.200 align:middle line:84%
grid of our planet and how we
can break free of the matrix.
