00:00:03.493 --> 00:00:11.990 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.830 align:middle line:10%
>> On December 5th,
1948, in the evening,

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.780 align:middle line:10%
not far from
Albuquerque, New Mexico,

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:24.740 align:middle line:10%
an Air Force pilot up in the
air saw an object, a glowing,

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.280 align:middle line:10%
greenish object going on a
horizontal trajectory and just

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.410 align:middle line:10%
lift up and then level
off and continue flying.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.690 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't tell
what this thing was.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Not long after that, a
commercial airline pilot

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.970 align:middle line:84%
saw an orange object moving
in on a horizontal trajectory,

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.800 align:middle line:84%
turn green, and then drop off,
seemingly toward the ground.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.150 align:middle line:84%
This began the
mystery of something

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.770 align:middle line:90%
known as the "green fireballs."

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.530 align:middle line:90%
And it lasted for quite a while.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.400 align:middle line:84%
In New Mexico and the American
Southwest, for several years,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.150 align:middle line:84%
it was the subject
of a very high-level

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.510 align:middle line:84%
of scientific and intelligence
community investigation.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And as far as we can tell,
we have no explanation for it

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.470 align:middle line:90%
to this day.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.960 align:middle line:84%
In fact, over the
next few months,

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.540 align:middle line:84%
up until the spring
of 1949, there

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.780 align:middle line:84%
were a total of 39 of
these green fireball

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.360 align:middle line:90%
reports that were being made.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And they continued
through the rest of 1949,

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.760 align:middle line:90%
into the early 1950s.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's get a little
bit of context here.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.460 align:middle line:84%
We're in the early
stages of the Cold War.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.600 align:middle line:84%
So naturally, a lot of these
scientists and intelligence

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.740 align:middle line:84%
officials were wondering, "Are
the Russians up to something?

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.470 align:middle line:84%
Are they probing our country and
our sensitive installations?"

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.940 align:middle line:84%
Of course, this is all by
Los Alamos National Labs,

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.160 align:middle line:84%
which is where the
United States developed

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.290 align:middle line:90%
most of its nuclear technology.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.610 align:middle line:90%
Very sensitive area there.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.480 align:middle line:84%
You don't want random
aircraft or spies

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.115 align:middle line:90%
flying over there, obviously.

00:02:05.115 --> 00:02:06.740 align:middle line:84%
So the question was
"Was this Russian?"

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And there was never any
indication, frankly,

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:15.080 align:middle line:84%
that Soviets, the Russians, were
behind these green fireballs.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.180 align:middle line:84%
Some of the most brilliant
minds of the American national

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.580 align:middle line:84%
security establishment
were really

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.390 align:middle line:84%
asking long, hard
questions about this.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.080 align:middle line:10%
One of them was Edward Teller.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.260 align:middle line:10%
This is the man who is known
as the father of the hydrogen

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.280 align:middle line:10%
bomb.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.190 align:middle line:10%
Teller was of an
extraordinarily high intellect,

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.470 align:middle line:10%
one of the most
brilliant scientists

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.820 align:middle line:10%
that existed in the
world at that time.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And he was one of
the people that

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.700 align:middle line:84%
was attending the meetings to
try to figure this thing out.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Another one was
Dr. Lincoln LaPaz.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.600 align:middle line:10%
And LaPaz was an
astronomer who was

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.450 align:middle line:10%
one of the great
pioneers of studying

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.580 align:middle line:10%
meteors and meteorites.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.820 align:middle line:84%
LaPaz was in New
Mexico, working there.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.480 align:middle line:84%
He was a longtime consultant
to the United States Air Force.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And LaPaz was
brought in to this.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And LaPaz, in fact, had
a couple of sightings

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.200 align:middle line:84%
of these green fireballs
himself, one of which

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.060 align:middle line:90%
he had painted by his wife.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.870 align:middle line:84%
She did a nice job in
doing a depiction of this.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.020 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, what
could these have been?

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.240 align:middle line:90%
Could they have been meteorites?

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, it seems no
one really believed

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.883 align:middle line:90%
that they were meteorites.

00:03:25.883 --> 00:03:28.440 align:middle line:90%
LaPaz absolutely did not.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.910 align:middle line:84%
This is the guy who's the
expert on meteors and meteorites

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:32.990 align:middle line:90%
and he's saying, "No.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.670 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely not that."

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.040 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, these things
were flying way too slow

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.830 align:middle line:90%
for any kind of meteorite.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And they were of, typically,
a horizontal trajectory.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And then, they would
often be seen to maneuver.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.485 align:middle line:90%
They would go left.

00:03:49.485 --> 00:03:50.360 align:middle line:90%
They would cut right.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.380 align:middle line:90%
They would go up.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.030 align:middle line:90%
They would go down.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.720 align:middle line:90%
Like how is that possible?

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.005 align:middle line:84%
And how is it that
they're glowing?

00:03:57.005 --> 00:03:59.210 align:middle line:84%
What's the mechanism
by which they're

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:00.860 align:middle line:90%
doing the things that they do?

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.320 align:middle line:84%
No one really had
any answer to this.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.720 align:middle line:84%
But there is no
conclusion that we're

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.770 align:middle line:84%
aware of that these
were natural phenomena.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.560 align:middle line:90%
So they seem to be artificial.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And again, the question
is, "If they're artificial,

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.480 align:middle line:90%
who's making them and how?"

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.260 align:middle line:84%
By the later part
of December 1948,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.830 align:middle line:84%
a group was formed called
"The Los Alamos Astrophysics

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.000 align:middle line:90%
Association."

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.240 align:middle line:84%
All of its members were
scientists, engineers.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.710 align:middle line:84%
They all had
security clearances.

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.790 align:middle line:84%
So this wasn't just some
random neighborhood group

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.590 align:middle line:90%
of interested citizens.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.840 align:middle line:84%
These were people all
who had association

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.730 align:middle line:90%
with Los Alamos National Labs.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.870 align:middle line:84%
They were all people who had
a very, very distinct reason

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.920 align:middle line:84%
for wanting to figure out what
these green fireballs were.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, they issued their
own provisional conclusion

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.320 align:middle line:84%
that very month, in which they
said, "These are not meteors.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.120 align:middle line:90%
There's no way.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.860 align:middle line:84%
They're way too
slow to be meteors.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.910 align:middle line:84%
They're flying at a completely
horizontal trajectory

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.760 align:middle line:90%
for extended periods of time."

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:13.350 align:middle line:84%
They were wondering "Is someone,
i.e. the Russians, sending

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.990 align:middle line:84%
some kind of long-range
objects that's

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.500 align:middle line:84%
entering Earth's
atmosphere and leveling out

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.090 align:middle line:90%
for whatever purpose?"

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.835 align:middle line:84%
Maybe espionage, but how
would you have espionage?

00:05:25.835 --> 00:05:27.960 align:middle line:84%
Were they going to attach
a camera to these things?

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.130 align:middle line:84%
In 1948, none of that
really seemed feasible.

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.120 align:middle line:84%
So again, there was really no
understanding, no explanation

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.640 align:middle line:90%
as to what this thing could be.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.940 align:middle line:84%
This situation, really,
quickly escalated

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.950 align:middle line:84%
to high levels of concern
among Army Intelligence,

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.500 align:middle line:84%
among Air Force
Intelligence, and among a lot

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.780 align:middle line:84%
of the scientists
at Los Alamos who

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.140 align:middle line:84%
were witnessing this
phenomenon on a nearly

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.180 align:middle line:90%
daily basis at times.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.530 align:middle line:84%
One Army memorandum
of January 13th, 1949,

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.230 align:middle line:84%
said, well, maybe the
Soviets are engaged

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.730 align:middle line:90%
in some kind of mischief.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.980 align:middle line:84%
But they pretty much
discounted that.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And then, they put
the matter this way.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.120 align:middle line:84%
"The United States
may be carrying

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.790 align:middle line:90%
on some top secret experiments.

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:19.150 align:middle line:84%
It is felt that these incidents
are of such great importance,

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.380 align:middle line:84%
especially as they are
occurring in the vicinity

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.100 align:middle line:84%
of sensitive installations,
that a scientific board

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.500 align:middle line:90%
be sent to this locality."

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.700 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.860 align:middle line:84%
Is it likely that
the United States

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.580 align:middle line:84%
was, itself, doing some kind
of high-level, top secret

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.430 align:middle line:84%
experimentation that
created this phenomenon

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.280 align:middle line:90%
of these green fireballs?

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.288 align:middle line:90%
It's totally possible.

00:06:42.288 --> 00:06:43.830 align:middle line:84%
People wondered
about it at the time.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.420 align:middle line:90%
And you never really know.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.100 align:middle line:90%
Except it has to be said.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.300 align:middle line:84%
We don't have any candidates
all these years later.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.250 align:middle line:90%
It's 70 years now.

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And we don't really know what
these things could have been.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.340 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's fair to say,
it's easy to talk about, "Oh,

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.140 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.930 align:middle line:84%
Some kind of top secret
project here, doing this."

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.120 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't even
have a clue as to what

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.620 align:middle line:84%
that top secret
project was, then I

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.120 align:middle line:84%
don't think you
have much of a case.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what ended up
happening with the explanation

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.590 align:middle line:84%
that the United States was
engaged in some kind of very,

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.770 align:middle line:90%
very secret testing program.

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:24.270 align:middle line:10%
This whole situation led to the
creation of a top secret FBI

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.510 align:middle line:10%
memorandum called "Protection
of Vital Installations,"

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:31.477 align:middle line:10%
from January 31st, 1949.

00:07:31.477 --> 00:07:33.810 align:middle line:84%
This is a document that's
been talked about quite a lot,

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:36.210 align:middle line:84%
including by myself
on many occasions.

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.970 align:middle line:84%
It's a really important
document, because, in it,

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:43.500 align:middle line:84%
the FBI is tracking this whole
conversation by US Military

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence, all
of these meetings,

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:48.450 align:middle line:84%
and just making the
point to say that,

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.480 align:middle line:84%
yes, the Military Intelligence
of the United States

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.520 align:middle line:84%
considers the matter
of these flying

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.130 align:middle line:84%
saucers, these
fireballs, they're

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:57.990 align:middle line:84%
lumping the whole
thing in together

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:02.730 align:middle line:90%
as top secret, top secret.

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:04.530 align:middle line:90%
By the way, I'll just point out.

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:07.380 align:middle line:84%
When you have the
FBI identifying

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:11.160 align:middle line:84%
UFOs as a top secret matter
within the intelligence

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.500 align:middle line:84%
community, that strikes
me as significant,

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:17.760 align:middle line:84%
particularly since most of the
documents that we have received

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.430 align:middle line:84%
on UFOs through
Freedom of Information

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:23.340 align:middle line:84%
have not been at the top
secret classification,

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.830 align:middle line:84%
they've been of lower
levels of classification.

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:29.070 align:middle line:84%
That tells me there's still a
lot of top secret UFO documents

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.050 align:middle line:84%
that have not seen
the light of day.

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:32.580 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they never will.

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.789 align:middle line:10%
The key statement of that
particular FBI document

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:38.490 align:middle line:10%
was Army Intelligence
has recently

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:41.340 align:middle line:10%
said that the matter of
unidentified aircraft

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:44.670 align:middle line:10%
or unidentified aerial
phenomena, otherwise known

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:48.360 align:middle line:10%
as flying discs, flying
saucers, and balls of fire

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:52.620 align:middle line:10%
is considered top secret by
intelligence officers of both

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.640 align:middle line:10%
the Army and the Air Forces.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've always thought that's
a really important statement.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:58.960 align:middle line:90%
I mean, here you've got the FBI.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.470 align:middle line:84%
They're following the discussion
that military intelligence

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.630 align:middle line:84%
is having on this
whole phenomenon,

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.310 align:middle line:90%
focusing on the green fireballs.

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:08.730 align:middle line:84%
But they're talking about flying
saucers and UFOs in general

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.220 align:middle line:84%
and that they considered
this top secret.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.040 align:middle line:84%
There was another big meeting
on the green fireballs

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.170 align:middle line:90%
in February of 1949.

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And LaPaz was there an
Edward Teller was there.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And everyone had their own
opinions on what this was.

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:23.940 align:middle line:84%
Teller, for his part, thought
"Maybe we're not really

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.500 align:middle line:90%
talking about solid objects.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.658 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this is some kind of
electro-optical phenomenon."

00:09:28.658 --> 00:09:30.450 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there wasn't
really a clear idea

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:31.920 align:middle line:90%
about what that could be.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.390 align:middle line:84%
Other people did
think that we were

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:36.850 align:middle line:84%
talking about some kind of
man-made missile of some sort.

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:40.210 align:middle line:84%
But again, no one could
nail this thing down at all.

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:43.350 align:middle line:84%
In April, the Air Force Office
of Special Investigation,

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:46.380 align:middle line:84%
that's Air Force Intelligence,
sent its own memo

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.360 align:middle line:90%
to Air Force headquarters.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.730 align:middle line:84%
That letter noted a couple
of very interesting things

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:52.560 align:middle line:90%
about these green fireballs.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.620 align:middle line:84%
The common characteristics
of most of the incidents

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:59.010 align:middle line:84%
are, A, green color,
sometimes described

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:03.840 align:middle line:84%
as greenish white, bright green,
yellow-green, or blue-green.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.610 align:middle line:84%
B, horizontal paths, sometimes
with minor variations.

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:11.720 align:middle line:84%
C, speed less than
that of meteor,

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.900 align:middle line:84%
but more than any other
type of known aircraft.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:18.920 align:middle line:84%
D, no sound associated
with observation.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:22.280 align:middle line:84%
E, no persistent
trail or dust cloud.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:26.210 align:middle line:84%
F, period of visibility
from 1 to 5 seconds.

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:30.440 align:middle line:84%
What's obvious is that this team
of super brilliant scientists

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.080 align:middle line:84%
with highest level
security clearances

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.930 align:middle line:84%
could not figure out what
they were dealing with.

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:37.880 align:middle line:84%
So if you had a
top secret project

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.327 align:middle line:84%
and guys like LaPaz and Teller
are not being briefed in on it

00:10:41.327 --> 00:10:43.910 align:middle line:84%
and they're just being allowed
to run around in circles trying

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:46.190 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what this is,
that's rather interesting

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:47.430 align:middle line:90%
in and of itself.

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:50.330 align:middle line:84%
But essentially,
no one had a clue

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.850 align:middle line:84%
of what they were dealing
with, solid objects,

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:58.160 align:middle line:84%
not solid objects, missiles, not
missiles, natural, not natural.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually, no one
was saying natural.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.740 align:middle line:84%
Everyone was saying
"not natural."

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:07.580 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't really want to
say "not natural," because that

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.130 align:middle line:84%
begged the question,
"If they're not natural,

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:11.960 align:middle line:84%
then they must
belong to someone."

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.880 align:middle line:84%
Of course, if
they're not natural,

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.980 align:middle line:84%
that is if they're
artificial, that

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:17.750 align:middle line:84%
creates a whole other
series of problems

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:20.120 align:middle line:90%
that you've got to identify now.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.560 align:middle line:90%
Who is making these things?

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And again, we have no clue as
to who's-- this is a classic--

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:31.220 align:middle line:84%
this is the classic UFO problem,
right here in a nutshell.

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:34.670 align:middle line:84%
You've got a phenomenon that
no one believes is natural.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.710 align:middle line:84%
Everyone, therefore,
believes it's artificial.

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And there are no candidates
to ascribe this to.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:45.180 align:middle line:84%
There's no one out there
that's a realistic candidate

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.050 align:middle line:90%
for having made these things.

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that, of course,
the fact that these fireballs,

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:52.020 align:middle line:84%
or whatever they
were, were being

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:55.520 align:middle line:90%
seen in a very sensitive area.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Los Alamos, that is the
spot where the United States

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:02.240 align:middle line:90%
developed its atomic bombs.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.210 align:middle line:84%
It was the headquarters,
the center point

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:08.930 align:middle line:90%
of nuclear technology science.

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:11.503 align:middle line:84%
Particularly, in
1948, 1949, this

00:12:11.503 --> 00:12:13.670 align:middle line:84%
was one of the most important
sciences in the world.

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:16.280 align:middle line:84%
The United States
still, at that time,

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:19.850 align:middle line:90%
had a monopoly of atomic bombs.

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, during 1949, the
Russians did detonate

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:25.880 align:middle line:90%
their first atomic bomb.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:31.580 align:middle line:84%
But this was a very, very, very
secretive type of technology.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:35.450 align:middle line:84%
The United States was not
interested in anyone snooping

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:39.320 align:middle line:84%
around over some of the
most sensitive installations

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:43.460 align:middle line:84%
in the world relating to atomic
science and atomic technology,

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:48.080 align:middle line:84%
which is exactly what these
green fireballs were doing.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.750 align:middle line:84%
You really get the sense
from this phenomenon

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:54.290 align:middle line:84%
is that these scientists
who were meeting just

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:56.790 align:middle line:84%
kept coming over the same
territory again and again

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:57.590 align:middle line:90%
and again.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:01.730 align:middle line:84%
By the later part of
1949, they were actually

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:04.730 align:middle line:84%
using much stronger
language in their reports,

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:07.100 align:middle line:90%
going up the chain of command.

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.750 align:middle line:84%
You hear you've
got Representatives

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:11.600 align:middle line:84%
from the Atomic Energy
Commission, from the FBI,

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:15.890 align:middle line:84%
from the US 4th Army, from
Air Force Intelligence,

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:20.060 align:middle line:84%
and from other organizations
that are all converging here

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.430 align:middle line:84%
to talk about this to
try to figure this out.

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Air Force Office of
Special Investigations,

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:28.310 align:middle line:84%
in October 1949, issued
this confidential memo

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:31.100 align:middle line:84%
that says, "The
continued occurrence

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:34.280 align:middle line:84%
of unexplained
phenomena of this nature

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.800 align:middle line:84%
in the vicinity of
sensitive installations

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.170 align:middle line:90%
is cause for concern."

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:41.270 align:middle line:84%
There still were a
couple of holdouts

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:44.480 align:middle line:84%
who wondered if this was some
kind of natural phenomena.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.980 align:middle line:84%
But then, you have
to ask yourself,

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:47.720 align:middle line:84%
"If this is a
natural phenomenon,

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.880 align:middle line:84%
how come all of
the incidents are

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:54.560 align:middle line:84%
confined to this limited
geographic location that

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.200 align:middle line:84%
just happens to be
where America's most

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.010 align:middle line:84%
sensitive nuclear technology
is being developed?"

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'm guessing all of
the meeting attendees were

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.960 align:middle line:90%
wondering that very same thing.

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:10.610 align:middle line:84%
Sometime during this
period, late part of 1949,

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:14.360 align:middle line:84%
there appears to have been
a very significant incident

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.360 align:middle line:84%
of a UFO or some
kind of object that

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.510 align:middle line:90%
involved a key atomic base.

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And that phrase, "a
key atomic base,"

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:24.500 align:middle line:84%
was actually used in
an article following

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.990 align:middle line:84%
an investigation
about this that was

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:28.955 align:middle line:90%
published a few years later.

00:14:28.955 --> 00:14:31.490 align:middle line:84%
What this incident
seems to have involved

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:36.110 align:middle line:84%
is a very high-ranking US Air
Force officer and the tracking

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:40.940 align:middle line:84%
of five metallic-looking
UFOs traveling

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:45.110 align:middle line:84%
at a tremendous speed
over an unknown base,

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:48.170 align:middle line:84%
probably in New Mexico,
tracked at a speed

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:53.630 align:middle line:84%
of over 4,000 miles per hour,
tremendous velocity, very

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:54.800 align:middle line:90%
high altitude.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.310 align:middle line:10%
Radar tracked these at
an altitude of something

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.080 align:middle line:10%
like 100,000 feet.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.660 align:middle line:10%
That's very, very high indeed.

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.630 align:middle line:84%
We had nothing in the late
1940s that could travel

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:07.070 align:middle line:90%
at that type of an altitude.

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:08.870 align:middle line:84%
The U-2 spy plane,
for example, which

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:11.540 align:middle line:84%
was developed about
a decade later,

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:14.720 align:middle line:84%
could reach a ceiling of
a little over 80,000 feet.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.030 align:middle line:84%
This is 100,000
feet and it's moving

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:20.850 align:middle line:84%
at a speed of about
4,500 miles per hour.

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:23.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, this incident is missing
from the "Project Blue Book"

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:26.480 align:middle line:84%
files, but it was published
in a "Life" magazine article

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.010 align:middle line:90%
from 1952.

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:29.000 align:middle line:90%
Kind of amazing.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's published in a
magazine, you think, "Well,

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:32.190 align:middle line:90%
who cares about that?"

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:34.100 align:middle line:84%
But there's been a
lot of investigation

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.860 align:middle line:84%
by individual UFO
researchers and there

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.320 align:middle line:84%
doesn't seem to be any
doubt that it's authentic.

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.720 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
there was another incident

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.630 align:middle line:84%
in which a UFO in this
region was tracked

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:48.110 align:middle line:84%
at that same altitude, about
100,000 feet, traveling

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:50.000 align:middle line:90%
at a very, very fast speed.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.410 align:middle line:84%
As far as the green
fireballs were concerned,

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:55.070 align:middle line:84%
one thing that we know
that came out of this

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:57.860 align:middle line:84%
was an Air
Force-designed program

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:00.620 align:middle line:84%
called Project
Twinkle, which was

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:04.760 align:middle line:84%
designed, at least in theory, to
set up a triangulation station.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:08.330 align:middle line:84%
So you'd have tracking cameras
in three different areas,

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:12.200 align:middle line:84%
three different parts of New
Mexico, that would, hopefully,

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:17.210 align:middle line:84%
track this object and then
provide triangulation data,

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:20.060 align:middle line:84%
so that you could have a
really good accurate read

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:23.000 align:middle line:90%
on this thing that was going on.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.580 align:middle line:10%
Now, the problem
with Twinkle, this

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:28.220 align:middle line:10%
was written about by people
like Captain Edward Ruppelt

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:30.930 align:middle line:10%
a couple of years later, Air
Force Captain, "Project Blue

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:31.730 align:middle line:10%
Book."

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:34.700 align:middle line:10%
And he said, "Yeah, the whole
thing was a big failure."

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think I
would beg to differ.

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:41.240 align:middle line:84%
I think Twinkle was, perhaps,
set up so that it would fail.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.430 align:middle line:84%
They put two of the
cameras in places

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:46.640 align:middle line:84%
where there was practically
no activity whatsoever.

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.440 align:middle line:90%
Like what are they thinking?

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:53.930 align:middle line:84%
Even so, on one
occasion, they clearly

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:58.220 align:middle line:84%
captured an object traveling
at about 100,000 feet

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.710 align:middle line:84%
at multiple thousand
miles per hour

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:04.099 align:middle line:84%
and with a diameter
of roughly 30 feet.

00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:06.319 align:middle line:90%
So this is an actual object.

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:09.500 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that that event
was buried within the Project

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.300 align:middle line:90%
Twinkle final report.

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.940 align:middle line:84%
Their conclusion had
no correspondence

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:15.440 align:middle line:84%
to the data that
was in the report.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.630 align:middle line:84%
The conclusion was
"Yeah, we didn't really

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:21.720 align:middle line:84%
get any hard data to work with
in terms of this phenomenon."

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:26.000 align:middle line:84%
But if you go into the report,
that's absolutely not true.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.720 align:middle line:84%
On one occasion, you have three
theodolite cameras tracking

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:33.590 align:middle line:84%
an object at 100,000
feet, multiple thousand

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:37.460 align:middle line:84%
miles per hour, with a
diameter of 30 feet or so.

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.410 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's
kind of interesting.

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:42.405 align:middle line:84%
That's really all that we
have of the green fireball

00:17:42.405 --> 00:17:43.205 align:middle line:90%
phenomenon.

00:17:43.205 --> 00:17:47.240 align:middle line:10%
This was this thing that arose
at a certain period of time.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:49.010 align:middle line:10%
It went for a couple of years.

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And then, who knows
what happened to it?

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:53.510 align:middle line:84%
It seems to have
just dissipated.

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:56.330 align:middle line:90%
Was it natural phenomenon?

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:57.470 align:middle line:90%
Or was it artificial?

00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:59.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, it seems to
have been artificial.

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:03.680 align:middle line:84%
So if it was artificial, was it
a test that the United States

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.420 align:middle line:90%
military was undertaking?

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:08.250 align:middle line:10%
Well, if it was a test that
the military was undertaking,

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:10.220 align:middle line:10%
we don't know what it was.

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:14.280 align:middle line:10%
And here we are, two decades
now into the 21st century,

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.400 align:middle line:10%
we still don't
know what that was.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.230 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's
a bit of a stretch

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:21.830 align:middle line:84%
to say that this was some
kind of secret project.

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:26.800 align:middle line:84%
What we can say is that
it seemed artificial.

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:30.430 align:middle line:90%
There's no explanation for it.

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And we don't really know
who was responsible for it

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.450 align:middle line:90%
after all these years.

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:37.600 align:middle line:10%
This is part, however, of
a larger tendency of UFOs,

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.540 align:middle line:10%
or UAP, to be seen
in the vicinity

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:44.410 align:middle line:10%
of very sensitive nuclear or
atomic types of installations

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:45.910 align:middle line:10%
or weapons systems.

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:47.990 align:middle line:84%
I'll come back to
that at another time.

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:51.220 align:middle line:84%
But this is definitely
part of a pattern.

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:54.820 align:middle line:84%
I've always felt that the green
fireball phenomenon constitutes

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:58.060 align:middle line:90%
a genuine case of real UFOs.

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:00.310 align:middle line:84%
That is, these are
objects that are not

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:02.347 align:middle line:84%
explainable in any
conventional sense,

00:19:02.347 --> 00:19:04.180 align:middle line:84%
doesn't look like we
made them, doesn't look

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:05.650 align:middle line:90%
like anyone else made them.

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:06.970 align:middle line:90%
They seem to be artificial.

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:09.610 align:middle line:84%
So you fill in the
blanks from there.

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:12.960 align:middle line:90%
