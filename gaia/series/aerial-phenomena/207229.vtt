00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:11.736 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.736 --> 00:00:17.150 align:middle line:10%
>> The 1950s and the 1960s
were times of massive amounts

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.560 align:middle line:10%
of tests of nuclear bombs.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, from 1945 to the
end of the 20th century,

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.710 align:middle line:84%
there were detonations of
over 2,000 atomic and hydrogen

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:28.725 align:middle line:90%
bombs worldwide.

00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:30.140 align:middle line:90%
It was an incredible amount.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the amount of
damage that those probably

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.510 align:middle line:84%
have done to our atmosphere, I
don't know if anyone has ever

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.460 align:middle line:90%
really tried to calculate that.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.500 align:middle line:84%
But a major number
of these detonations

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.670 align:middle line:84%
took place in the
1950s and early 1960s.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And most of these
detonations took place

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.440 align:middle line:84%
either at the Nevada Test
Site or in Central Soviet Asia

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.300 align:middle line:90%
or over the Pacific Ocean.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.250 align:middle line:84%
Those are the
three major regions

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.390 align:middle line:90%
where these would happen.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.010 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them were
very, very high

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.830 align:middle line:90%
altitude nuclear detonations.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.280 align:middle line:84%
In 1962, the United
States had something

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.890 align:middle line:84%
known as Operation
Dominic, which

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.880 align:middle line:84%
was a series of very high
altitude nuclear detonations

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.270 align:middle line:84%
over the Pacific
Ocean, primarily

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.640 align:middle line:84%
near a place called
Johnston Atoll.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.010 align:middle line:10%
That's a tiny little island
about 500 miles southwest

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.250 align:middle line:10%
of Hawaii, pretty much
in the middle of nowhere.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.810 align:middle line:10%
Now, from April to
October of 1952,

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.720 align:middle line:10%
there were 36 of these high
altitude detonations that

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.400 align:middle line:10%
took place, most of
them from very, very

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.420 align:middle line:10%
high altitude, B-52s,
or a number of them,

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.960 align:middle line:10%
sent up with missiles, either
from the ground or even

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.860 align:middle line:10%
a couple of them
from submarines.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.430 align:middle line:84%
We're talking very high
altitude detonations,

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.950 align:middle line:90%
more than 100,000 feet.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.840 align:middle line:84%
A few years ago, I
was fortunate to talk

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.470 align:middle line:84%
to someone who was part of
Operation Dominic, a former US

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.860 align:middle line:84%
Navy personnel
whose name is David.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.100 align:middle line:84%
David had many, many
years in the US Navy.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.380 align:middle line:84%
David was there for the
second to last exercise

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.260 align:middle line:84%
of Operation Dominic, which
took place on October 26, 1962.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.800 align:middle line:84%
This not only involved the
very high altitude detonation

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.890 align:middle line:84%
of an atomic bomb,
but the downing

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.950 align:middle line:84%
of a UFO and the failed
attempt to recover it.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.330 align:middle line:84%
So David was aboard
the USS Finch.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And he's on the ship
and he's not even aware

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.090 align:middle line:84%
that a missile had
been launched when

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.330 align:middle line:84%
he hears on the loudspeaker,
along with all the other Navy

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.090 align:middle line:84%
personnel, that they had
to get below the deck.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.580 align:middle line:84%
This was standard
procedure any time

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.840 align:middle line:84%
that there was a detonation
about to take place.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.715 align:middle line:84%
So they're all below
the deck and they're all

00:02:44.715 --> 00:02:50.420 align:middle line:84%
waiting in their assigned area
when another officer comes

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.990 align:middle line:84%
into the room and selects
about a dozen of the men

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.370 align:middle line:90%
to come up with him.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.310 align:middle line:84%
They're all brought to the
starboard side of the ship

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.770 align:middle line:84%
and they're wearing
all the gear that they

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.570 align:middle line:84%
need to to protect themselves
from the virtual wall of sea

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.730 align:middle line:84%
spray that's going to
be coming up at them.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And they are ordered
simply to look forward.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.500 align:middle line:84%
They're not allowed to
look to the side at all.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.570 align:middle line:84%
They're just to stand forward,
look in this one direction

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.520 align:middle line:90%
and observe.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.290 align:middle line:90%
Seems very odd what's going on.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, David soon finds out
why they had to do that.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.230 align:middle line:84%
After a little bit
of time had passed,

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.470 align:middle line:84%
the officer orders the
men to look 10 degrees

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.750 align:middle line:90%
off the starboard bow.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, David
says, lo and behold,

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.310 align:middle line:90%
this is what I saw.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.320 align:middle line:84%
"What appeared in
the sky, what I saw

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.470 align:middle line:84%
was a huge cigar-shaped
object coming toward us

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.910 align:middle line:84%
at 10 degrees and about 15 to
20 degrees off the horizon.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.510 align:middle line:84%
It looked like it was two
football fields in length.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.690 align:middle line:84%
It appeared to have some kind
of blue glow at the stern

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.990 align:middle line:84%
as it was moving past
us at a moderate rate.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.720 align:middle line:84%
My judgment is that
it had to be traveling

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.360 align:middle line:90%
at least 400 miles per hour.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.760 align:middle line:84%
When it reached
directly in front of us,

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.170 align:middle line:90%
it picked up speed.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.782 align:middle line:84%
It just went from
there to gone."

00:04:09.782 --> 00:04:11.240 align:middle line:84%
So what's interesting
about this is

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.280 align:middle line:84%
that the object was
moving horizontally

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.560 align:middle line:90%
very low over the ocean.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.600 align:middle line:84%
And there might have been a
wisp of smoke attached to that.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.457 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't quite
sure, but he thought

00:04:22.457 --> 00:04:23.540 align:middle line:90%
that it might be the case.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.380 align:middle line:90%
If there was, there wasn't much.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.590 align:middle line:84%
But it was moving very, very
fast, level, over the ocean.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.830 align:middle line:84%
So that constituted the entire
observation that David had.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.040 align:middle line:84%
But at that time, he
was doing cross-training

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.780 align:middle line:84%
with the ship's
radar technicians.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And so later that day he's on
duty with the radar technicians

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.590 align:middle line:84%
and he finds everyone was
talking about this UFO.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.780 align:middle line:84%
They had tracked a large UFO
with a very tremendous heat

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.160 align:middle line:90%
signature as well.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And the suspicion was
that the detonation

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.760 align:middle line:84%
had caused this thing
to come out of the sky

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.930 align:middle line:84%
and essentially
crash into the ocean.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.810 align:middle line:84%
There were several ships
en route toward it.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that
someone was going

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.520 align:middle line:84%
to try to pick this thing
up out of the ocean.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.170 align:middle line:84%
One of the things David told
me about Operation Dominic--

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.820 align:middle line:84%
and he was part
of all of it-- was

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:18.460 align:middle line:84%
that on nearly every single time
that a detonation took place,

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.300 align:middle line:84%
there were bogeys that
were reported in the sky.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.690 align:middle line:84%
By bogeys, we're
talking UFOs or UAPs--

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.610 align:middle line:84%
that is, unknown objects
that were there that

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:28.693 align:middle line:90%
shouldn't have been there.

00:05:28.693 --> 00:05:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And that he said every time just
before the detonation happened,

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.730 align:middle line:84%
those objects, any
objects that were there,

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:37.930 align:middle line:90%
would just disappear.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.520 align:middle line:90%
They'd be gone.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.270 align:middle line:84%
But on one occasion,
apparently an object

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.410 align:middle line:84%
did not disappear in time
because the explosion appeared

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.120 align:middle line:90%
to have brought it down.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.590 align:middle line:84%
The radar technicians
pretty much

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.470 align:middle line:84%
assumed this was obviously
not an attack on a UFO

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.360 align:middle line:84%
since the whole thing
had been scheduled.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.210 align:middle line:84%
It's just that the object was
not able to get out of the way

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.010 align:middle line:90%
soon enough.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.210 align:middle line:84%
That seemed to be
the basic problem.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.090 align:middle line:84%
So soon after this,
David is debriefed.

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.195 align:middle line:84%
He's told this is a
very serious matter.

00:06:06.195 --> 00:06:07.820 align:middle line:84%
You're not supposed
to talk about this.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.390 align:middle line:84%
He's made to sign
a document stating

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:14.650 align:middle line:84%
that he would not talk about
this for 20 years afterward.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.890 align:middle line:84%
A few years after that, David
just put the incident aside

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.330 align:middle line:90%
and went about his business.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.070 align:middle line:90%
He stayed within the Navy.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And in 1976, and now
we're 14 years after,

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.300 align:middle line:84%
he's stationed at
Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.690 align:middle line:84%
And he's at a bar
there, a Navy bar,

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.990 align:middle line:84%
and he's talking to
another Navy diver

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.360 align:middle line:90%
that he just happens to meet.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.730 align:middle line:84%
This is really interesting
story that he told me.

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And he's basically, he's
here, the Navy diver's

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.960 align:middle line:84%
right next to him, and they
begin to trade stories.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.682 align:middle line:84%
And the one guy says, well, I
got some interesting stories.

00:06:50.682 --> 00:06:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And David is like, well, I've
got some interesting stories.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that they
both had a UFO encounter.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that this diver
had an encounter with a UFO

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:07.150 align:middle line:84%
that he was responsible for
investigating for retrieval.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.210 align:middle line:84%
Turns out to be the
same UFO that David

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:14.650 align:middle line:84%
had seen during Operation
Dominic on October 26, 1962.

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.000 align:middle line:90%
Same event.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.800 align:middle line:84%
What the diver
told him is that he

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.920 align:middle line:84%
had been part of a top
secret salvage operation

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.210 align:middle line:90%
to recover a UFO.

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And this was the UFO
of October 26, 1962.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.240 align:middle line:90%
So he was brought to the area.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.640 align:middle line:84%
He volunteered to
be the first went in

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.240 align:middle line:84%
to basically do a
recon of the area

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.960 align:middle line:84%
under the water to find
out what would be the plan

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.770 align:middle line:90%
to recover this thing.

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:42.850 align:middle line:84%
So he's got the diving bell
equipment, he's all hooked up,

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:44.470 align:middle line:90%
he goes down there.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And he goes down
for quite a while

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:50.110 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't see
anything until he

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:53.050 align:middle line:84%
realizes that he's
actually standing

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.410 align:middle line:90%
on this enormous object.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:08:00.700 align:middle line:84%
He actually slides off of it and
is astonished at what he sees.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:07.370 align:middle line:84%
It had this huge honeycomb
or spongy look to it,

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:09.280 align:middle line:84%
almost like even a
beehive, perhaps,

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.100 align:middle line:84%
with all of these
little cells in it.

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.250 align:middle line:84%
It was almost somewhat
luminescent, like,

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:19.120 align:middle line:84%
as if you could almost see
through it to some extent,

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.010 align:middle line:90%
but not entirely.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.260 align:middle line:84%
In fact, at one point
he tried to touch it

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.570 align:middle line:84%
and he put his hand
right through it.

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:29.050 align:middle line:84%
He admitted to David, he was so
upset he'd lost bladder control

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:33.520 align:middle line:84%
and he was so shaken by this
that he got pulled back up

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.590 align:middle line:90%
shortly thereafter.

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:38.260 align:middle line:84%
When he got back up to the ship,
he was barely able to talk.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.840 align:middle line:84%
He was barely able to recount
anything that he had seen.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.809 align:middle line:84%
But he got the story across
and they decided the next day

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:45.490 align:middle line:84%
they were going to
send a follow-up

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.910 align:middle line:84%
team to do further
investigation and hopefully try

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:50.830 align:middle line:84%
to find a way to
bring this thing up.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And according to
what he had learned,

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:55.840 align:middle line:84%
when the team went
down the following day,

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.160 align:middle line:90%
that object was gone.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:01.108 align:middle line:84%
So whatever happened, it
was able to repair itself.

00:09:01.108 --> 00:09:02.650 align:middle line:84%
It was able to get
out of harm's way.

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And the US Navy was not able
to get that particular prize.

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:10.660 align:middle line:84%
Now that's the main part of
the Operation Dominic story.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:14.140 align:middle line:84%
David and this diver
struck up a real rapport,

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.540 align:middle line:84%
had a definite interest
in pursuing this.

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And according to
David, this diver

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:22.450 align:middle line:84%
died shortly thereafter in some
freakish electrical accident

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:24.470 align:middle line:90%
at the base at Guantanamo.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:26.200 align:middle line:90%
So that was the end of that.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.480 align:middle line:84%
David himself maintained a
very strong interest in UFOs.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.740 align:middle line:84%
It was very obvious when I
was talking with him that he

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.320 align:middle line:90%
was sincere, very levelheaded.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And this just happened
to be his story.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And like a lot of
these stories that

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:44.620 align:middle line:84%
come from military people about
UFOs, they're in a tough spot.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.320 align:middle line:84%
Being able to prove
these accounts

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.070 align:middle line:90%
is not the easiest thing to do.

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:51.130 align:middle line:84%
So when you get them,
you're in a position where

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:54.230 align:middle line:84%
you have to decide, do I
believe this person or not.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.080 align:middle line:90%
I choose to believe his story.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.330 align:middle line:84%
They did frequently
encounter USOs--

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.750 align:middle line:84%
that is, Underwater
Unknown Objects.

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Just an interesting element
of being in the US Navy

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.970 align:middle line:84%
out in the middle of
the ocean, these things

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:08.770 align:middle line:90%
apparently are seen a lot.

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:10.330 align:middle line:84%
According to David,
these objects

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:14.140 align:middle line:84%
could really inspire
genuine fear at times.

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:17.070 align:middle line:84%
So they would be
tracked on sonar,

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:19.530 align:middle line:84%
which is what the
submarines would use

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:23.290 align:middle line:84%
or Navy vessels would use to
detect underwater objects.

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:26.010 align:middle line:84%
But they could also be seen
visually, and typically

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:30.360 align:middle line:84%
by the luminescent glow that
you would see along the water

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.590 align:middle line:90%
as they went by.

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:34.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, look, dolphins and
whales and other sea creatures

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:36.780 align:middle line:84%
can create these
types of effects.

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:41.610 align:middle line:84%
But some of the luminescent glow
that these sailors were seeing

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:43.650 align:middle line:90%
was just absolutely enormous.

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:46.380 align:middle line:84%
No whale could be responsible
for anything this large,

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:47.730 align:middle line:90%
according to David.

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:49.680 align:middle line:84%
On one occasion,
there was a swell

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.930 align:middle line:84%
in the ocean that
nearly capsized

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:55.440 align:middle line:84%
the Finch, caused the captain
to fall over and break his leg.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.660 align:middle line:84%
David said, look,
in my view, most

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.450 align:middle line:84%
of these, probably 3/4
of all of these cases,

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:02.970 align:middle line:90%
were logged and recorded.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:06.000 align:middle line:84%
If you could get access
to those ship's logs,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.560 align:middle line:90%
you'd have a gold mine.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:11.190 align:middle line:84%
Without a doubt, some of the
most interesting UFO stories

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:14.287 align:middle line:84%
you'll ever hear are
from Navy personnel.

00:11:14.287 --> 00:11:15.995 align:middle line:84%
They're out in the
middle of nowhere, out

00:11:15.995 --> 00:11:17.490 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the water.

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's very obvious
now that there's

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:25.320 align:middle line:84%
a great deal of activity going
on in and around the Earth's

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:29.700 align:middle line:84%
oceans, which, after all, 75% of
the Earth is covered by water.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:32.130 align:middle line:84%
I think it really
shouldn't be surprising

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:34.740 align:middle line:84%
why there would
be these UFOs that

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.570 align:middle line:84%
would be seen in
the vicinity of all

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:37.780 align:middle line:90%
of these nuclear explosions.

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:41.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you look over
a 50-year period of time

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:44.340 align:middle line:84%
when you've got about more
than 2,000 high altitude

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.910 align:middle line:84%
detonations of the most
awe-inspiring bombs

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:51.090 align:middle line:84%
that we've ever created,
any observing intelligence

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:53.910 align:middle line:84%
is going to be looking at
that with a lot of interest.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that these things
happened all of these years ago

00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:01.200 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't cause us to dismiss
them as not important.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, Operation Dominic
was more than 50 years ago.

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:07.625 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people alive now
were not alive at that time.

00:12:07.625 --> 00:12:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And you'd think,
well, who cares,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.890 align:middle line:90%
it was long ago in the past.

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:14.220 align:middle line:84%
But there are a number of
people who were present there

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:15.900 align:middle line:90%
who are still alive.

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:21.600 align:middle line:84%
But also, these types of events,
it's not that they have ceased,

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.120 align:middle line:84%
I just like talking about
some of these old events

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:28.050 align:middle line:84%
because, I mean, first of
all, the folks back in 1962

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:31.450 align:middle line:84%
were every bit as smart or
smarter than we are today.

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:33.120 align:middle line:84%
They were very able
to keep records.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.920 align:middle line:84%
They knew what they
were dealing with.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's also interesting to
me because when you go back

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:41.340 align:middle line:84%
50-plus years, when
you start talking

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:44.610 align:middle line:84%
about highly unusual
technology, it

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:46.740 align:middle line:84%
seems to me that it's
harder and harder when

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.740 align:middle line:84%
you go back farther in
time to attribute these

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:53.940 align:middle line:84%
to advanced contemporary
black budget technology.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.100 align:middle line:84%
You hear this in
relationship to discussions

00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:00.610 align:middle line:84%
of the so-called Tic Tac
UFO of 2004, for instance.

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:02.460 align:middle line:84%
But what do you
do with something

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:04.980 align:middle line:84%
that's from the
1960s or 1950s that

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:09.480 align:middle line:84%
also has similar exotic features
and incredible performance?

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:13.020 align:middle line:84%
It's one reason I like looking
at a lot of these old cases.

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:16.960 align:middle line:84%
The observers were very
scientific, very methodical,

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:17.850 align:middle line:90%
very careful.

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And the phenomenon back then,
as now, was just off the charts

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:23.820 align:middle line:90%
incredible.

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think we really should
never lose sight of that.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.450 align:middle line:90%
