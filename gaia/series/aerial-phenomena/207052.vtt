00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:13.160 align:middle line:84%
RICHARD DOLAN: When I look
at the subject of UFOs,

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.020 align:middle line:84%
I see a discrepancy
that has existed

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.280 align:middle line:90%
for years and years and years.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.910 align:middle line:10%
And that discrepancy is
between the incredible amount

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.670 align:middle line:10%
of data that is available
for anyone with eyes

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.590 align:middle line:10%
to look at it,
showing that there

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.620 align:middle line:10%
is a real tangible
phenomenon that behaves

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.990 align:middle line:10%
in ways that are just not
explainable in any conventional

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.790 align:middle line:10%
sense.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.248 align:middle line:84%
Combined with the
fact that there's

00:00:33.248 --> 00:00:35.840 align:middle line:84%
denial about this from
our official channels year

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.650 align:middle line:90%
after year after year.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.160 align:middle line:84%
So you've got this
one situation where

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.500 align:middle line:84%
thousands and actually
millions of people

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.800 align:middle line:90%
encounter this phenomenon.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.770 align:middle line:84%
They see these objects,
they encounter something

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.780 align:middle line:84%
that no one has the language
really for explaining.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.140 align:middle line:84%
But it's there, it's real, and
that includes military people.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, there's
this culture of denial

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.069 align:middle line:84%
that is just seep through
every pore of our being.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:07.190 align:middle line:84%
So that's the UFO cover-up,
that's the UFO secrecy.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I wonder how
many years are we going

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.470 align:middle line:90%
to expect this to continue.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.530 align:middle line:90%
And I don't have the answer.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.697 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how many years.

00:01:14.697 --> 00:01:16.340 align:middle line:84%
We've going for
many years already.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.150 align:middle line:84%
A full human lifetime,
you know, since the 1940s.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.710 align:middle line:10%
And I don't think it
will last forever either.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.680 align:middle line:84%
But there was one
year, at least one year

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.810 align:middle line:84%
where that secret very
nearly came crashing down

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.320 align:middle line:90%
when I look back on it.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is long before I
was around in the world,

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.410 align:middle line:90%
but the year 1952.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.070 align:middle line:84%
I think really can
qualify as a year

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.480 align:middle line:84%
that this secret
seemed to be maybe

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.840 align:middle line:90%
in danger of coming apart.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And to put it in
context, this was a year

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.870 align:middle line:84%
where UFO sightings
in the United States,

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.430 align:middle line:84%
particularly, went
right through the roof.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.630 align:middle line:84%
There was a quantity of
sightings that really had never

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.960 align:middle line:84%
been achieved before
and would not be equal

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.180 align:middle line:84%
until we get to the
era of the internet

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.870 align:middle line:84%
where it becomes
very easy for people

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.290 align:middle line:84%
just to report what they
see to websites and so on.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.360 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays, there are
10,000 or more reports

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.790 align:middle line:84%
that you get in North
America alone that

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.388 align:middle line:90%
go on to different websites.

00:02:24.388 --> 00:02:26.930 align:middle line:84%
But that's because it's easy,
that's because we have the web.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.380 align:middle line:84%
Back in 1952, there
was no internet

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.050 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't all that
easy for people simply

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.360 align:middle line:90%
to report their UFO sightings.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And even so, there were over
1,500 UFO reports for the year.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.420 align:middle line:90%
It's quite a high number.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And in the month of July,
there were 536 UFO reports.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.210 align:middle line:90%
I mean, just amazing amount.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.480 align:middle line:84%
Edward Ruppelt, who ran
Project Blue Book at the time--

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.810 align:middle line:84%
this was the Air Force's
official investigation

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.760 align:middle line:90%
of UFOs--

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.570 align:middle line:84%
he talked a lot
about the year 1952.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it was
really an amazing thing

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.760 align:middle line:84%
because the sightings
became so intense.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.750 align:middle line:84%
They involved high level
people in the US military

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:16.550 align:middle line:90%
and in the CIA.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:22.370 align:middle line:84%
He talked about it, a
lawn party in May of 1952

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.540 align:middle line:84%
that was held at the home
of one of the highest

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.750 align:middle line:84%
people in the CIA, where
everyone there apparently saw

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.810 align:middle line:84%
this unbelievable
spectacular UFO.

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And according to
Ruppelt, he said,

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.430 align:middle line:84%
phone call from these
folks got quick results

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.500 align:middle line:90%
and quick investigation.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened was in
the spring of 1952, two very,

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.070 align:middle line:84%
very important aircraft left
from Southern California

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.620 align:middle line:90%
on their way to Hawaii.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.010 align:middle line:84%
In one plane was the
Secretary of the Navy.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.690 align:middle line:10%
His name was Dan Kimball.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.810 align:middle line:10%
And in the other aircraft
was a very important

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.240 align:middle line:10%
Navy Admiral Arthur Radford.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.400 align:middle line:10%
On their way out,
these two planes

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.430 align:middle line:10%
were about 50 miles apart that
were over the Pacific Ocean,

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.320 align:middle line:10%
and an object, an unknown
object came and circled around

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.690 align:middle line:10%
both of those planes.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.269 align:middle line:84%
First was Kimball's
plane, and what

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.970 align:middle line:84%
ended up happening was this
disk-shaped object zoomed up

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.460 align:middle line:84%
to their plane, circled
around the plane

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.550 align:middle line:84%
as it's flying a
couple of times,

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.630 align:middle line:84%
and then zipped off
where 50 miles away, it

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.800 align:middle line:84%
found the plane carrying
Admiral Arthur Radford where

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.330 align:middle line:90%
it did the exact same thing.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.350 align:middle line:84%
Circled around a few
times, and then zip off.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.020 align:middle line:84%
This obviously concerned
Kimball and Radford,

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.470 align:middle line:84%
and these are two of the top
people making policy for the US

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:52.700 align:middle line:90%
Navy at the time.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.970 align:middle line:84%
After Kimball landed, he really
wanted to look into this,

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.110 align:middle line:84%
was very interested in what the
Air Force was doing in terms

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.960 align:middle line:90%
of its investigation of UFOs.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.660 align:middle line:10%
And from what we
learned through Keyhoe

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.710 align:middle line:10%
who was talking to everyone
around these two men,

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:16.740 align:middle line:10%
was that Kimball tried and
really did not successfully get

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.660 align:middle line:10%
solid information
from the Air Force

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.760 align:middle line:10%
as to what was going on with
their UFO investigation.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And he was definitely
of the opinion

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:31.260 align:middle line:84%
that he wanted the US Navy to
have its own independent group

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.210 align:middle line:90%
studying these UFOs.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the fact was
Navy personnel were often

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.150 align:middle line:90%
kind of annoyed by--

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.290 align:middle line:84%
if they would have a sighting
while on duty on their vessel,

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.620 align:middle line:84%
frequently it turned out
that Air Force people

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.920 align:middle line:84%
would be flown in and would
conduct this investigation,

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.120 align:middle line:84%
which as you might imagine
angered or annoyed a lot

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.470 align:middle line:90%
of the Navy personnel anyway.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.940 align:middle line:90%
Navy had a lot of pride.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.300 align:middle line:84%
They were a service of
very long standing--

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.920 align:middle line:84%
Harris Kimball,
Secretary of the Navy,

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.040 align:middle line:84%
wanting to have an
independent UFO research,

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.200 align:middle line:84%
study organization
within the Navy.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.020 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't look like it
happened as far as we can tell.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.060 align:middle line:84%
But the sighting
itself, that's a heck

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.220 align:middle line:90%
of a sighting in my view.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.830 align:middle line:84%
The month of June was
even more intense in terms

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.510 align:middle line:84%
of UFO sightings and Ruppelt
talks about this as well.

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle
of that month, he

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.420 align:middle line:84%
talked about a meeting that
took place within the Air Force

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.970 align:middle line:84%
technical Intelligence Center
headed by a general named

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.890 align:middle line:90%
John Sanford.

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.680 align:middle line:84%
He's really interesting in my
view because what he describes

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.040 align:middle line:84%
is kind of a situation
where some high level

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.680 align:middle line:84%
officers within the
Air Force and Navy

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.820 align:middle line:84%
are meeting together in this
office, and Ruppelt was there.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And they're talking
about all of these UFOs,

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.230 align:middle line:84%
and like what do
we do about this?

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.290 align:middle line:84%
What is the deal with
all of these UFOs?

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
high level meeting.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And Ruppelt describes how
one Air Force colonel who

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:07.340 align:middle line:84%
was an aide to Sanford complains
that the Project Blue Book's

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:12.480 align:middle line:84%
attitude seem to be biased
against the extraterrestrial

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.280 align:middle line:90%
hypothesis.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And Ruppelt writes, he says,
after the colonel said this,

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.690 align:middle line:84%
you could almost hear him
utter like a breath saying,

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:19.850 align:middle line:90%
OK, now, I've said it.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.210 align:middle line:84%
In other words, making the
obvious statement that no one

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.940 align:middle line:90%
would make.

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.500 align:middle line:84%
But that meaning
according to Ruppelt

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.860 align:middle line:84%
didn't really have any kind
of obvious conclusion to it,

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.360 align:middle line:90%
and things continued.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And then July got
crazier than June.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.430 align:middle line:84%
July was the month with
more than 500 UFO sightings,

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:41.450 align:middle line:84%
and here's Ruppelt in his
little office trying to process

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:42.830 align:middle line:90%
all of these reports coming in.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:46.880 align:middle line:84%
Some of them as many as 30 per
day, just ridiculous amount

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:51.500 align:middle line:84%
of reports for this small team
in 1952 to be able to handle.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.980 align:middle line:84%
He talked at one point about
how there were rumors floating

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:59.420 align:middle line:84%
around about the Air Force being
prepared for an alien invasion.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote, he said, hey,
if you've been in our office

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.370 align:middle line:84%
at the time, you'd have
thought the invasion was

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:06.020 align:middle line:90%
already underway.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.480 align:middle line:84%
Kind of a funny statement
but also there's

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.600 align:middle line:90%
a lot of dramatic truth to that.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.170 align:middle line:84%
The month culminated
in two weekends

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:19.670 align:middle line:84%
in a row of really interesting
and inexplicable UFOs being

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:23.630 align:middle line:84%
tracked over the nation's
capital in Washington DC.

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:27.180 align:middle line:84%
An event that made the
headlines of major newspapers,

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.990 align:middle line:84%
including The New
York Times, which

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:32.159 align:middle line:84%
got the attention of
President Harry Truman

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:35.450 align:middle line:84%
and got the attention
of Truman's Air Force

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.480 align:middle line:84%
liaison, his aide,
Colonel Robert Landry

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.581 align:middle line:84%
who talked to Ruppelt
about these sightings.

00:08:41.581 --> 00:08:43.039 align:middle line:84%
And because it was
such a big thing

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:47.480 align:middle line:84%
it resulted in the Air Force
organizing its largest press

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.170 align:middle line:84%
conference since the end
of the Second World War

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:55.430 align:middle line:84%
here in July of 1952 where
General John Sanford goes

00:08:55.430 --> 00:09:00.710 align:middle line:84%
in front of the cameras, and
he's there telling the world

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:04.400 align:middle line:84%
that these sightings
over the capital

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.780 align:middle line:84%
were apparently caused by
bizarre weather phenomenon that

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.082 align:middle line:84%
fooled the radar
operators and so forth.

00:09:11.082 --> 00:09:13.040 align:middle line:10%
It's interesting because
appearing with Sanford

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.770 align:middle line:10%
at this press conference was
another general by the name

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:17.000 align:middle line:10%
of Roger Ramey.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.700 align:middle line:10%
And Ramey, of
course, was the guy

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:23.900 align:middle line:10%
who had been throwing cold
water over the Roswell

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.120 align:middle line:10%
event five years earlier.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.650 align:middle line:84%
It was Ramey who
was photographed

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:31.940 align:middle line:84%
famously with Captain Jesse
Marcel of the Roswell 509

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.430 align:middle line:84%
bomber unit where
they were saying,

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:35.930 align:middle line:84%
oh, it wasn't a
flying saucer, it

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:37.220 align:middle line:90%
was just the weather balloon.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:38.480 align:middle line:90%
That was Ramey.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:43.280 align:middle line:84%
So Ramey, in other words, was
very experienced in handling

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.040 align:middle line:84%
the UFO matter in
the public realm,

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:49.730 align:middle line:84%
and undoubtedly, that is why
he was there with Sanford

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:53.378 align:middle line:84%
for this particular
press conference.

00:09:53.378 --> 00:09:54.920 align:middle line:84%
But it was a really
interesting thing

00:09:54.920 --> 00:10:00.800 align:middle line:84%
because none of the really
dramatic moments that

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.088 align:middle line:84%
had happened were of
course, allowed to come out

00:10:03.088 --> 00:10:04.130 align:middle line:90%
in that press conference.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:07.580 align:middle line:84%
The fact that the radar
operators during one

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.680 align:middle line:84%
of the nights of
these UFO encounters

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.100 align:middle line:84%
where they'd lock the press
out, they locked the media out

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.490 align:middle line:84%
because as Ruppelt
wrote, they believed

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:22.400 align:middle line:84%
that this was the night
when it would be undeniable

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.800 align:middle line:90%
that these UFOs were real.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't want to
hamper their efforts.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:31.130 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want the press to
go talking about it immediately.

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.890 align:middle line:84%
They just thought this is too
powerful, this is too much.

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:36.750 align:middle line:84%
We're going to deal
with this on our own.

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, the
sightings of that night

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:43.160 align:middle line:84%
and of those two weekends
were powerful indeed.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.670 align:middle line:84%
But the press
conference did its job.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:51.170 align:middle line:10%
Sanford did not allow the
radar operators to talk.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.900 align:middle line:10%
He didn't allow anyone
with a different opinion

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.270 align:middle line:10%
to say anything, and
so it was pretty easy

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:58.640 align:middle line:10%
for him to control
that narrative.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.760 align:middle line:84%
But it was a
dramatic time indeed.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And the threat to UFO
secrecy didn't end there.

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.900 align:middle line:10%
One of the top researchers
of the phenomenon back

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.460 align:middle line:10%
in those days was
Donald Keyhoe, he

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:14.990 align:middle line:10%
was retired Marine Corps major,
who was really by this time

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:17.820 align:middle line:10%
deeply interested in all
of these reports of flying

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:18.620 align:middle line:10%
saucers.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:21.570 align:middle line:10%
And Keyhoe was pretty
well connected.

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:23.810 align:middle line:10%
And one of the things
that he was able to do

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:26.300 align:middle line:10%
is to get friends
over in the Air

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.430 align:middle line:10%
Force and other
military services

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:35.210 align:middle line:10%
to clear certain UFO
reports just for him.

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:37.070 align:middle line:90%
Kind of an amazing thing.

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:40.040 align:middle line:84%
For the remainder of
1952, he apparently

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:43.940 align:middle line:84%
got something like
50, close to 50 UFO

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.840 align:middle line:84%
reports from the military
cleared just for him.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:52.580 align:middle line:84%
And he promptly wrote about it
in a book the very next year.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.460 align:middle line:84%
There was a story of
one Air Force general

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:59.650 align:middle line:84%
named Kelly who said, how the
hell Keyhoe get these reports?

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:03.340 align:middle line:10%
Until he was reformed,
none to his satisfaction

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.070 align:middle line:10%
that they had been
properly cleared for him.

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:08.680 align:middle line:10%
They were not leaked, they
were properly cleared.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.130 align:middle line:84%
So there was a lot of
information that came out.

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:16.150 align:middle line:84%
It definitely went against
the official Air Force

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:18.880 align:middle line:90%
and government line about UFOs.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.780 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, it turned
out the secrecy held.

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:25.840 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely, it held.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.440 align:middle line:84%
What you see in retrospect
after all these years is

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.930 align:middle line:84%
that it's almost
like a football game

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:36.160 align:middle line:84%
where the truth-seekers are the
offense and the secret-keepers

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.390 align:middle line:90%
are on the defense.

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:41.050 align:middle line:10%
And every now and then they
can push the ball downfield,

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.980 align:middle line:10%
but it turns out there's
a lot more territory where

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:47.170 align:middle line:10%
those secret-keepers
can keep retreating,

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:53.030 align:middle line:10%
and they're still able to
keep the main secret hidden

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:58.300 align:middle line:10%
from us, which is that
this phenomenon belongs

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.240 align:middle line:10%
to someone that is not us.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Whoever they are,
whatever they are,

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:10.420 align:middle line:84%
they are beyond what we
have, what we're able to do.

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And you know, honestly,
despite how much all of us, I

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:19.720 align:middle line:84%
think all citizens of the
world really would believe

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.370 align:middle line:90%
in the end of UFO secrecy.

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:25.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm certainly someone who
believes in ending UFO secrecy.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:30.400 align:middle line:84%
But it's not hard to
see why the people

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.160 align:middle line:84%
on the other side of that
would want to keep that secret.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.580 align:middle line:84%
If they believed that they
have no control over this,

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.770 align:middle line:84%
if they believe that
there's a phenomenon,

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:42.340 align:middle line:84%
that's beyond their
ability to deal with.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:46.960 align:middle line:84%
Then it's not difficult to see
that they would do everything

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:51.880 align:middle line:84%
possible to keep that under
wraps, to keep that contained.

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:56.160 align:middle line:84%
Aside from the fact that
very powerful interests

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.330 align:middle line:84%
in this world, and I mean
the most powerful interests

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:00.130 align:middle line:90%
in this world.

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:02.430 align:middle line:84%
Those who control
our means of energy,

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:08.730 align:middle line:84%
those who control our best
and most advanced technologies

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:14.610 align:middle line:84%
might feel and might
believe that releasing

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:16.860 align:middle line:84%
UFO-related technology
would be too

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:19.320 align:middle line:90%
disruptive for their interests.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And if that were to
be the case with them,

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:24.960 align:middle line:84%
they would never
voluntarily allow

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.030 align:middle line:90%
the UFO secret to come out.

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:30.180 align:middle line:84%
The petroleum
gravy train is very

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:32.010 align:middle line:90%
lucrative for certain interests.

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And control over
that resource is

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:42.120 align:middle line:84%
for them far too
valuable to gamble away

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.370 align:middle line:84%
just because the public
might have a right

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:46.470 align:middle line:90%
to know about something better.

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:49.500 align:middle line:84%
Because after all,
anyone can recognize

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:53.100 align:middle line:84%
that a object that
can noiselessly

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.140 align:middle line:84%
zip from one part of
the sky to another part

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:59.310 align:middle line:84%
of the sky like that is
probably not using petroleum.

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:03.190 align:middle line:84%
It's probably using something
better, something beyond.

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:06.270 align:middle line:84%
So implicit within a
solution to the UFO

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:12.610 align:middle line:84%
mystery is, well, a
post-petroleum civilization.

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And it might not
happen overnight

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:18.130 align:middle line:84%
after some kind of disclosure
but it will happen.

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:20.160 align:middle line:10%
So it's a disruptive
thing and it's not

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.430 align:middle line:10%
difficult to see the
motivations of those

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:28.000 align:middle line:10%
who have the secrecy to keep
things the way they are.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.190 align:middle line:10%
But as I always like to say,
secrets can't last forever

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:34.830 align:middle line:10%
and they are not the only
part of this equation.

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:39.090 align:middle line:84%
There's you and me, and
there's the phenomenon itself.

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that we
live in a society that

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:47.190 align:middle line:84%
is moving now here in
the 21st century so fast

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:52.870 align:middle line:84%
into this new future, no one
can really see it for sure,

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:57.300 align:middle line:84%
but we know that it's going to
bring some changes for sure.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.050 align:middle line:90%
