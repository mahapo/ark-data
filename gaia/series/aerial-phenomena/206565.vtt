00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.530 align:middle line:10%
>> When people think about the
FBI's greatest UFO document,

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.400 align:middle line:10%
a lot of times you hear
about a 1950 document,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.560 align:middle line:10%
sometimes known as
the Guy Hottel memo,

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.800 align:middle line:10%
in which there is a
discussion about alien beings,

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.630 align:middle line:10%
alien bodies being acquired.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.530 align:middle line:84%
It actually is the most searched
document on the FBI's website.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.370 align:middle line:10%
But I would argue there's a
better document, a stronger

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.260 align:middle line:10%
document that absolutely
shows just how deep

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.670 align:middle line:10%
and how incredible this whole
subject had gotten for the FBI.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.500 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the memo
about alien bodies

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.850 align:middle line:84%
has been a matter of a lot
of dispute as to what exactly

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.680 align:middle line:84%
they were really
talking about, what

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm about to describe
to you, there's

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.010 align:middle line:90%
no matter of dispute whatsoever.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.080 align:middle line:84%
It's a memo dated
January 31, 1949.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And just to put yourself in
the position of all of this,

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.530 align:middle line:84%
you have to keep in
mind, by early 1949,

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.170 align:middle line:84%
the public had been told
for a couple of years

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.840 align:middle line:84%
already that there was nothing
to this UFO nonsense, all

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.640 align:middle line:90%
this business.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Just forget about
it, put it away,

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.420 align:middle line:90%
don't even think about it.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.670 align:middle line:90%
And yet, what we now know--

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.190 align:middle line:84%
absolutely thank you,
Freedom of Information Act,

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.760 align:middle line:84%
for getting this information
out to us-- is the following.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.280 align:middle line:84%
The FBI was tracking
very carefully

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.620 align:middle line:84%
what was going on
in the military

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.990 align:middle line:84%
and their investigation
into getting

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.420 align:middle line:90%
to the bottom of these UFOs.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And in this particular
document from January 31, 1949,

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.000 align:middle line:84%
the FBI discusses how Office
of Naval Intelligence,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.770 align:middle line:90%
the Army's G-2--

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.360 align:middle line:84%
that's their
intelligence branch--

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.170 align:middle line:84%
and the Air Force's Office
of Special investigation,

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.400 align:middle line:84%
all three key intelligence
units of the Army, Navy,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.920 align:middle line:84%
and the Air Force, that
they had all recently

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.760 align:middle line:84%
met to discuss this
matter of UFOs.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And this FBI memo was being
sent to J. Edgar Hoover, head

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.990 align:middle line:90%
of the FBI, to report.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.800 align:middle line:90%
And what did this memo say?

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, it said a few
things, but let me

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.260 align:middle line:90%
read to you the key statement.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.710 align:middle line:84%
"Army intelligence has
recently said that the matter

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.990 align:middle line:84%
of unidentified aircraft or
unidentified aerial phenomena,

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.010 align:middle line:84%
otherwise known as flying
discs, flying saucers,

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.440 align:middle line:84%
and balls of fire is considered
top secret by intelligence

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.000 align:middle line:84%
officers of both the Army
and the Air Force's."

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.690 align:middle line:84%
My opinion-- this memo is
every bit as extraordinary

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.720 align:middle line:84%
as any UFO memo
that's out there.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.410 align:middle line:84%
Again, the government had been
telling people for a long time

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.000 align:middle line:84%
already that there
was nothing to it.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And yet, here we
have an FBI memo

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.750 align:middle line:84%
going to the boss of the
FBI, J. Edgar Hoover,

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.630 align:middle line:84%
stating that the
military had determined

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.250 align:middle line:84%
that this subject of UFOs
is considered top secret.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.840 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.480 align:middle line:90%
And by the way, why top secret?

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And still, all of the
academic community to this day

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.230 align:middle line:90%
ignores the importance of this.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And if UFOs are silly nonsense,
and hallucinations, and hoaxes,

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.680 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, why
would the military

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.800 align:middle line:84%
call this a top
secret phenomenon?

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, fortunately, this
memo explains exactly why.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.190 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons is because of
all of the incredible sightings

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.390 align:middle line:84%
by military personnel
of objects that were

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.970 align:middle line:90%
described as simply impossible.

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.990 align:middle line:84%
The memo, for example,
discusses the famous Eastern

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.250 align:middle line:84%
Airlines' sighting from the
summer of 1948 in which two

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.580 align:middle line:84%
commercial pilots saw
a cigar-shaped or maybe

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.730 align:middle line:84%
rocket-shaped object
zoom right past them.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.980 align:middle line:84%
But this wasn't a rocket,
because this object

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:59.940 align:middle line:90%
was maneuvering.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.930 align:middle line:84%
It moved straight, horizontally
and then straight up.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And by the way,
the speed estimated

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.270 align:middle line:84%
by all the calculations
and in this memo--

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.570 align:middle line:90%
they state 2,700 miles per hour.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.720 align:middle line:90%
2,700 miles per hour.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.600 align:middle line:84%
In 1949, we had
nothing that was going

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.430 align:middle line:84%
to be able to move at
that type of a speed.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.650 align:middle line:84%
This is all taken
very seriously.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.240 align:middle line:84%
You can read the
words of the memo.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.460 align:middle line:84%
It's very obvious that
this is a serious matter.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.230 align:middle line:90%
But that's just the beginning.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.240 align:middle line:10%
The FBI memo goes on
to talk about sightings

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.360 align:middle line:10%
of an unexplained
phenomenon over Los Alamos.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, Los Alamos, New Mexico is
where all of the top brainpower

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.410 align:middle line:84%
was relating to atomic
technology, nuclear weapons,

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.750 align:middle line:90%
and everything connected to it.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.530 align:middle line:84%
When unknown objects are
hanging out over Los Alamos,

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.860 align:middle line:84%
day after day, after
day, which they were,

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.410 align:middle line:90%
then that's very serious.

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.040 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this memo discusses
the dates in December of 1948,

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.070 align:middle line:84%
quite recent in the
memo's timeline,

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.050 align:middle line:90%
when these objects were seen--

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:12.790 align:middle line:84%
December 5, 6, 7, 8, the 11th,
the 13th, the 14th, the 28th.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.610 align:middle line:84%
They'd been seen all throughout
the month of December.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.860 align:middle line:90%
And what were these things?

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.610 align:middle line:10%
Well, they were noted in
this document being observed

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.900 align:middle line:10%
by intelligence officers,
by scientists, by security

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.720 align:middle line:10%
personnel, by private citizens.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.050 align:middle line:90%
Very serious.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.050 align:middle line:90%
These were spherical shape.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.420 align:middle line:90%
They were diamond shaped.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.820 align:middle line:90%
They had self-illumination.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.210 align:middle line:84%
They were maneuvering
at incredible speeds,

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.450 align:middle line:84%
a minimum of three and
a half miles per second,

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:48.160 align:middle line:84%
a maximum over 12 miles per
second, a mean speed that they

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.680 align:middle line:84%
determine of about seven and a
half miles per second or 27,000

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.710 align:middle line:90%
miles per hour.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.480 align:middle line:90%
27,000 miles per hour.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:02.250 align:middle line:84%
Just to keep in mind, top
speed of an aircraft in 1948,

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.430 align:middle line:84%
'49, we're talking a couple
of hundred miles per hour--

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.560 align:middle line:90%
400, maybe top of the line--

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.330 align:middle line:90%
500 miles per hour.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.280 align:middle line:84%
What goes at 27,000
miles per hour?

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.350 align:middle line:84%
This is very similar to the more
recent stories we get of, say,

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:19.440 align:middle line:84%
the Tic Tac UFO
which, similarly,

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.690 align:middle line:84%
this is 21st century UFOs,
has been arguably going

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.610 align:middle line:84%
at comparable speeds, upwards
of 10,000-plus miles per hour.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.090 align:middle line:84%
But here, you have, back
in 1949, a memo by the FBI

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.780 align:middle line:84%
describing the military's
investigation of these UFOs

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.520 align:middle line:90%
traveling at similar speeds--

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.860 align:middle line:90%
20,000-plus miles per hour.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And we really have
to ask ourselves,

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.400 align:middle line:84%
what could possibly
have been able to do

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.540 align:middle line:90%
those types of speeds?

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.710 align:middle line:90%
And this memo is even better.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.220 align:middle line:84%
It goes on to describe
not simply the speeds,

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:58.650 align:middle line:84%
but the maneuverability of
these objects and distinctly

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:02.400 align:middle line:84%
notes that on at
least two occasions,

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.270 align:middle line:84%
the object maneuvered
horizontally and then dropped

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:10.980 align:middle line:84%
in a very radical,
vertical manner that

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.650 align:middle line:90%
defied any kind of explanation.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:16.350 align:middle line:84%
Also, in other cases in
the Los Alamos sightings,

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:19.650 align:middle line:84%
we know these objects went
horizontally and then ascended

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:21.090 align:middle line:90%
upward.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:24.060 align:middle line:84%
So we're in some really,
really tricky territory

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.550 align:middle line:84%
here in looking at
these sightings.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:30.000 align:middle line:84%
You've got unknown objects
maneuvering in ways

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.010 align:middle line:84%
that no one can
explain over some

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:35.910 align:middle line:84%
of the United States' most
sensitive installations

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:37.230 align:middle line:90%
imaginable.

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.150 align:middle line:84%
So that's a matter of
very serious concern

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:41.850 align:middle line:90%
as anyone could realize.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:44.310 align:middle line:84%
This memo goes on, to try
to provide explanations

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:47.790 align:middle line:84%
for what was being observed,
but they really come up empty.

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:49.740 align:middle line:90%
There's just nothing there.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:53.700 align:middle line:84%
The possibility of the
Russians, the Soviets is raised.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.900 align:middle line:90%
And frankly, no one believed it.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.030 align:middle line:90%
No one believed it then.

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:58.110 align:middle line:90%
No one believes it now.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.840 align:middle line:84%
When you look back
after all these years,

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.860 align:middle line:84%
it's not realistic to think
that the Russians were creating

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:08.550 align:middle line:84%
these incredibly advanced
objects that were hanging out

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:12.240 align:middle line:84%
over the airspace of Los
Alamos back in the late 1940s.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, the analysts
back then didn't believe it.

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:19.110 align:middle line:84%
They looked at other types
of bizarre, natural types

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:20.640 align:middle line:90%
of phenomena.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:24.810 align:middle line:84%
Some talk about cosmic rays,
whatever that would even

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:26.010 align:middle line:90%
mean as causing this.

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:28.740 align:middle line:84%
But frankly, even
they realize there's

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:32.220 align:middle line:84%
no scientific explanation
to account for what

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.750 align:middle line:90%
was going on at Los Alamos.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:36.750 align:middle line:84%
That is why the document
was called Protection

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:38.580 align:middle line:90%
of Vital Installations.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.100 align:middle line:90%
This was a serious matter.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And what you really get in
this three-page typed FBI memo

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:50.640 align:middle line:84%
is a bunch of analysts
talking about this

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.040 align:middle line:84%
as a very serious
matter and throwing up

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:58.200 align:middle line:84%
their hands in the sense that
they had no idea what this is.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And by early 1949, we're
in the era where the Air

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.830 align:middle line:84%
Force particularly
made it clear,

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.080 align:middle line:84%
you're not supposed to talk
about the extraterrestrial

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.180 align:middle line:90%
hypothesis that's out.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:12.720 align:middle line:84%
It was already made very, very
clear to all these analysts.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And so what options
did they really

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:19.710 align:middle line:84%
have, except to
do whatever mental

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:24.750 align:middle line:84%
gymnastics necessary to avoid
dealing with the obvious?

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And the obvious, then
as now, is that someone

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:34.260 align:middle line:84%
had some kind of technology
that was not supposed to exist,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:40.110 align:middle line:84%
that was vastly beyond anything
we could bring to the table

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:43.950 align:middle line:84%
and was investigating,
presumably,

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:48.840 align:middle line:84%
our highest, most important
nuclear installations.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:52.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, you fill in the
blanks after that.

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:55.412 align:middle line:84%
I mean, anyone with
any common sense

00:09:55.412 --> 00:09:56.870 align:middle line:84%
and intelligence
looking at this is

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:01.790 align:middle line:84%
going to realize that if we're
going to explain this in terms

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:04.460 align:middle line:84%
of our civilization-- but
we have a lot of explanation

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:05.600 align:middle line:90%
to do here.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.870 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't have any
science to explain this.

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:11.630 align:middle line:90%


00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:18.410 align:middle line:84%
We don't even have any
candidates to pin this on.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:19.460 align:middle line:90%
It's not the Russians.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:20.420 align:middle line:90%
It's not the Brits.

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:21.410 align:middle line:90%
It's not the French.

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:23.660 align:middle line:90%
It's not the Chinese.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:25.160 align:middle line:90%
Is it black budget American?

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.350 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's think about that.

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:30.440 align:middle line:84%
We don't have any evidence to
this day of any black budget

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.080 align:middle line:84%
American group that could
be responsible for this.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:36.440 align:middle line:84%
To this day, there's
no candidates.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.660 align:middle line:84%
In terms of technology and
in terms of bureaucracy,

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.970 align:middle line:90%
it's just not there.

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And these guys back then were
scratching their head every bit

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:54.020 align:middle line:84%
as much, but no one wanted to
offer the obvious explanation.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:57.230 align:middle line:84%
Because even by
1949, people were

00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:01.640 align:middle line:84%
put in the position of having
to walk around the obvious,

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.610 align:middle line:84%
because no one was
allowed to go there.

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:10.770 align:middle line:84%
Back in 1949, we
had UFOs every bit

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:16.740 align:middle line:84%
as advanced as the so-called
Tic Tac UFO of 2004.

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And we need to
ask ourselves, who

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.070 align:middle line:84%
could possibly have been
responsible for that?

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:26.160 align:middle line:84%
In my view, the most
logical explanation

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.090 align:middle line:84%
is that it's someone,
some group beyond our own.

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:30.990 align:middle line:90%
That's what I think.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:32.610 align:middle line:90%
You can think what you want.

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:34.080 align:middle line:84%
But I would encourage
everyone who

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.620 align:middle line:84%
thinks about this to be guided
by the available evidence

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.240 align:middle line:90%
and take it from there.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.480 align:middle line:84%
The Russians were considered as
possible candidates for this,

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:46.080 align:middle line:84%
but no one was really taking
that explanation seriously.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.200 align:middle line:84%
The document did
spend some time trying

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.470 align:middle line:84%
to explain why
meteorites were not

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:55.020 align:middle line:84%
the explanation for
these sightings.

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:59.640 align:middle line:84%
So that was definitely
looked into and rejected.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.290 align:middle line:84%
Quite a bit of
discussion on that

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:04.110 align:middle line:84%
as well as looking
into other types

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:06.810 align:middle line:84%
of scientific,
natural explanations.

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:10.800 align:middle line:84%
But again, no one really
had any viable theory,

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.990 align:middle line:90%
not then and not now.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And what we can say, even
beyond this particular memo,

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:19.680 align:middle line:84%
is that the discussions
going on at Los Alamos

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:24.610 align:middle line:84%
throughout 1948 and 1949
were very intense and very

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:25.410 align:middle line:90%
high level.

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:29.730 align:middle line:10%
They included some of the most
prominent scientists in the US

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:31.840 align:middle line:10%
military-industrial
complex at the time,

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:35.170 align:middle line:10%
including people like Dr.
Edward Teller, for example,

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:36.810 align:middle line:10%
the inventor of
the hydrogen bomb,

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:41.370 align:middle line:10%
and portrayed most notably by
Peter Sellers in the movie "Dr.

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:44.070 align:middle line:90%
Strangelove" in the 1960s.

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:48.030 align:middle line:84%
But there were actually lots
of highest level scientists

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:51.120 align:middle line:84%
who were engaged in trying to
figure this phenomenon out.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And not just scientists,
but all the intelligence

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:57.000 align:middle line:84%
agencies met again
and again and again

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.430 align:middle line:84%
throughout 1949 and beyond
to try to figure this out.

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:07.200 align:middle line:84%
As far as we know, we don't
have a formal conclusion

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.220 align:middle line:90%
to this day.

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:11.570 align:middle line:90%
