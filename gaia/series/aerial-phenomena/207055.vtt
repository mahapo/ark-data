00:00:11.525 --> 00:00:13.150 align:middle line:10%
>>RICHARD DOLAN: So
much of our history

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.900 align:middle line:10%
is just gone, missing from us.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.680 align:middle line:10%
And so much of our
UFO history is gone.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.730 align:middle line:10%
And even the stuff that's not
gone is just pushed to the side

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.830 align:middle line:10%
as if it is gone.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.230 align:middle line:84%
You know, people who
research UFOs, they all

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.940 align:middle line:90%
know about the year 1952.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.440 align:middle line:90%
It was a big year.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.390 align:middle line:84%
Even UFO researchers,
I think, sometimes

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.950 align:middle line:84%
forget the significance
of that year

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.650 align:middle line:84%
and of so many other
events in our history.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.860 align:middle line:84%
But 1952 was really
an amazing year.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.890 align:middle line:84%
It was the year that UFO
sightings just went completely

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:43.690 align:middle line:90%
through the roof.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.140 align:middle line:84%
No one was expecting the
amount and the intensity,

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.160 align:middle line:84%
the quality of sightings
both by just ordinary people

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.050 align:middle line:84%
and by the military
throughout the entire year.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.260 align:middle line:84%
It got to be so
bad that the US Air

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.240 align:middle line:84%
Force had to issue a massive
press conference in July,

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.925 align:middle line:84%
at the end of July, to kind
of put all of this to the side

00:01:06.925 --> 00:01:09.880 align:middle line:84%
so that people just wouldn't
panic over all of these flying

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.290 align:middle line:90%
saucer reports.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, the official explanation of
something is always one thing.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.200 align:middle line:84%
But what people talk
about behind the scenes,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.200 align:middle line:84%
well, that's always
something very different.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And this was exactly
the case with UFOs.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.570 align:middle line:84%
So whereas the Air Force is
telling the public, yeah,

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.028 align:middle line:84%
this is all pretty
understandable--

00:01:27.028 --> 00:01:29.653 align:middle line:84%
we're not worried about it-- you
shouldn't be worried about it,

00:01:29.653 --> 00:01:30.550 align:middle line:90%
either--

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.650 align:middle line:84%
no big thing here,
nothing to see--

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.730 align:middle line:84%
behind the scenes, Air
Force intelligence,

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.580 align:middle line:90%
Navy intelligence, CIA--

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.110 align:middle line:90%
all of them and others--

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.370 align:middle line:84%
are discussing how the
public explanation is not

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.710 align:middle line:84%
really credible,
no one believes it,

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.640 align:middle line:90%
and what's actually going on.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.350 align:middle line:84%
So within the CIA, there
were quite a few discussions

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.630 align:middle line:84%
from August of 1952 right on
through the end of the year.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And it was really an important
conversation that took place.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And it culminated in an
incredible statement,

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.060 align:middle line:84%
an unbelievable statement
to the Director of the CIA,

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.170 align:middle line:84%
which I'll get to
in just a minute.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.580 align:middle line:84%
But before that,
in August of 1952,

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.640 align:middle line:84%
what we know through
the little snippets

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.160 align:middle line:84%
and scraps of
declassified documents

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.630 align:middle line:90%
that have come to us--

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.130 align:middle line:84%
and believe me,
there's so much more

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.470 align:middle line:84%
that I'm sure we haven't
gotten access to--

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.960 align:middle line:84%
but what we've
learned is that there

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.720 align:middle line:84%
are some pretty interesting
discussions going on

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.760 align:middle line:84%
within the CIA that summer of
1952 about UFOs that didn't

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.530 align:middle line:90%
exactly match the party line.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.100 align:middle line:90%
We'll just put it that way.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.100 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to read a
little bit of a quote

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.080 align:middle line:90%
that we have from one document.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.960 align:middle line:84%
On August 14, the Office
of Scientific Intelligence

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.360 align:middle line:84%
created a new study group to
look into this UFO phenomenon

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.890 align:middle line:84%
due to a special inquiry from
the White House, the memo said.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.440 align:middle line:10%
So President Harry
Truman, in other words,

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.990 align:middle line:10%
asked the CIA to look into these
flying saucers, these UFOs.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.090 align:middle line:10%
And they met.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we have
in this one memo here.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.700 align:middle line:84%
What we know is that
this whole thing

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.340 align:middle line:84%
had to be kept secret
beyond everything else.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.680 align:middle line:84%
The most important
thing was secrecy.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.840 align:middle line:90%
Here's what one part of it says.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.050 align:middle line:84%
"In view of the wide
interest within the agency,

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.490 align:middle line:84%
it must be mentioned that
outside knowledge of agency

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.010 align:middle line:84%
interest in flying
saucers carries

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.770 align:middle line:84%
the risk of making
the problem even more

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.580 align:middle line:84%
serious in the public
mind than it already is,

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.450 align:middle line:84%
which we and the Air Force
agree, must be avoided."

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.120 align:middle line:84%
So before they say anything
about the phenomenon itself,

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.150 align:middle line:84%
the point is the
public can't ever

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.060 align:middle line:84%
know that we're looking into
this because if the public ever

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.450 align:middle line:84%
learns that the CIA is
interested in UFOs, well,

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.860 align:middle line:90%
all hell will break loose.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.660 align:middle line:90%
And we must not let that happen.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:56.710 align:middle line:90%
So that's interesting.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.930 align:middle line:84%
But then this
report actually goes

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.840 align:middle line:84%
into a lot of specifics
about the UFO subject.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.440 align:middle line:84%
It goes so far as to
break these reports down

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.240 align:middle line:90%
into types of UFOs--

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.860 align:middle line:84%
small UFOs, medium sized UFOs
like 100 feet in diameter,

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:17.230 align:middle line:84%
and really super large UFOs,
even much larger than that.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.680 align:middle line:84%
They talk about different
behaviors of the UFOs

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.030 align:middle line:84%
from hovering and slow movement
to very, very rapid movement

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.640 align:middle line:84%
to just like
unbelievable speeds,

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.050 align:middle line:90%
incomprehensible speeds.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:35.110 align:middle line:84%
All of this is noted within
the CIA's memo of August 1952.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And here's where it gets
even more interesting to me.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.770 align:middle line:84%
It describes three
levels of speed--

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.565 align:middle line:84%
hovering, moderate,
and stupendous

00:04:45.565 --> 00:04:46.690 align:middle line:90%
was the word that they use.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.050 align:middle line:90%
That is pretty interesting.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.940 align:middle line:84%
They pretty much ruled out
the Russians or the Soviets

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.350 align:middle line:90%
as being behind this.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.600 align:middle line:84%
That didn't really
seem plausible to them,

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.150 align:middle line:90%
which absolutely, it's not.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.140 align:middle line:10%
But they would not go
down any other road

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.660 align:middle line:10%
to try to identify this because
the fact is they just didn't

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.310 align:middle line:10%
have anything to come up with.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And here's a very interesting
statement from this memo.

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.840 align:middle line:84%
The report, after ruling
out Soviet weapons,

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.170 align:middle line:84%
it talks about
"sightings of UFOs

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.350 align:middle line:84%
reported at Los
Alamos and Oak Ridge

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.550 align:middle line:84%
at a time when the background
radiation count had risen

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.300 align:middle line:84%
inexplicably," and goes
on to say, "in this case,"

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.960 align:middle line:84%
wrote the report's
author, "we run out

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.150 align:middle line:84%
of even blue yonder explanations
that might be tenable.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And we are still left with
numbers of incredible reports

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.530 align:middle line:90%
from credible observers.

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.720 align:middle line:84%
So here we are in the
middle of August 1952.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And you got the CIA talking
about very credible observers

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.570 align:middle line:84%
noticing incredible things,
recording incredible things

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.570 align:middle line:84%
that are described
as very physical--

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.270 align:middle line:84%
small medium to large,
hovering speed, moderate speed,

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.810 align:middle line:90%
stupendous speed-- all of this--

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.190 align:middle line:84%
and saying we don't really
have an explanation for this.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.690 align:middle line:90%
Soviets ruled out.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:14.190 align:middle line:84%
Natural phenomena-- you can
see that they want to go there.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:19.890 align:middle line:84%
But they also don't have any
shred of science to support it.

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And then what you see is once
again the mental gymnastics

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:25.410 align:middle line:90%
come in.

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.110 align:middle line:84%
Thou shalt not discuss
extraterrestrials.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And so the memo says, well,
there's not a shred of evidence

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.050 align:middle line:84%
to support the
extraterrestrial hypothesis.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.050 align:middle line:90%
OK, well, fine.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.100 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is this
memo shows no reason

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.290 align:middle line:90%
to go any other direction.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.960 align:middle line:84%
They leave you
nothing other than

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.870 align:middle line:84%
the extraterrestrial hypothesis,
as far as I'm reading it.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.330 align:middle line:90%
Now, 1952 continued onward.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And the CIA kept wondering,
what do we do about these UFOs.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.630 align:middle line:84%
Like, the Harry Truman
Presidency is about to end.

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.850 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be a
new President coming in.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And is there any a little
bit of housecleaning

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.700 align:middle line:84%
that we need to do before
the new guys come in?

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.410 align:middle line:90%
This is very much on their mind.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And aside from the fact
that throughout all of 1952

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:17.070 align:middle line:84%
these UFO sightings were so
fast and furious and so many

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.040 align:middle line:84%
that there really was a
concern within the CIA,

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.990 align:middle line:84%
not simply of UFOs intrinsically
but of what if there's

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:30.460 align:middle line:84%
so many UFOs that they clog
all the communication channels

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.498 align:middle line:84%
and people just calling in
about them all the time.

00:07:33.498 --> 00:07:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And you can't get
anything else done.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And what if the Russians
use this as an excuse

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:42.090 align:middle line:84%
to launch an attack when
we're busy being confused

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:42.990 align:middle line:90%
by the UFOs?

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:45.720 align:middle line:84%
Like, this was a
concern of theirs.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.210 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me the only
reason they would be concerned

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:51.510 align:middle line:84%
about this is if they
implicitly recognize

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:53.610 align:middle line:90%
the phenomenon was real.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:56.640 align:middle line:84%
If they actually believed
it was imaginary,

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.670 align:middle line:84%
it's really hard to see that
they would be very concerned

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:00.630 align:middle line:90%
about all of this.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:02.700 align:middle line:90%
But the phenomenon was real.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:06.510 align:middle line:84%
It was being taken as real all
throughout the fall and winter

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:07.680 align:middle line:90%
of 1952.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.820 align:middle line:90%
We know this.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:15.180 align:middle line:84%
The military was still deeply
concerned with these UFOs.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:19.530 align:middle line:84%
So now we get to
December of 1952.

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:23.190 align:middle line:10%
And the Director of Scientific
Intelligence for the CIA, a man

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:26.250 align:middle line:10%
named H. Marshall
Chadwell, so he

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:29.790 align:middle line:10%
was running all scientific
intel for the CIA at that time.

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:34.140 align:middle line:10%
He writes a memo to his boss,
the Director of the CIA,

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.659 align:middle line:10%
a man named Walter Bedell Smith.

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:39.450 align:middle line:10%
And Smith himself was kind
of a legendary person.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:41.400 align:middle line:10%
During World War
II, Smith had been

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.250 align:middle line:10%
the Chief of Staff of
General Dwight Eisenhower

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:45.870 align:middle line:10%
during the D-Day invasions.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:49.050 align:middle line:84%
Walter Bedell Smith was
a tough guy, smart man.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:52.260 align:middle line:10%
And in 1952, he was
running the CIA.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And Chadwell in December,
December 2, sends Smith a memo.

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:04.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a secret memo that
is just extraordinary.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.990 align:middle line:84%
It has one of the most
extraordinary paragraphs you

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:11.460 align:middle line:90%
will find in any UFO document.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.500 align:middle line:90%
This is what Chadwell says.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.320 align:middle line:84%
"At this time, the
reports of incidents

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.640 align:middle line:84%
convince us that there is
something going on that

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.760 align:middle line:90%
must have immediate attention.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.900 align:middle line:84%
Sightings of unexplained
objects at great altitudes

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:31.140 align:middle line:84%
and traveling at high
speeds in the vicinity

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:34.380 align:middle line:84%
of major US defense
installations

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.320 align:middle line:84%
are of such nature
that they are not

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.860 align:middle line:84%
attributable to natural
phenomena or known

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.590 align:middle line:90%
types of aerial vehicles."

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:47.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a dead
stop right there.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.900 align:middle line:84%
You know, keep in
mind that this is

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.570 align:middle line:84%
a classified memo,
a bureaucratic memo,

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:55.380 align:middle line:84%
at that, sent to the
Director of the CIA.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.683 align:middle line:84%
And short of Chadwell
saying, boss,

00:09:58.683 --> 00:10:00.600 align:middle line:84%
I think we're being
invaded, I don't know what

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.900 align:middle line:90%
else he could have said here.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.680 align:middle line:10%
This is a very direct statement.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.090 align:middle line:84%
He's talking about
something that

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:12.090 align:middle line:84%
needs immediate attention, not
due to fears of public panic

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:16.660 align:middle line:84%
or communication systems
being jammed, no,

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:20.220 align:middle line:84%
but because unexplained
objects at incredible altitudes

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.440 align:middle line:84%
and incredible speeds
were being seen

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.140 align:middle line:90%
near sensitive installations.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.640 align:middle line:90%
That's a serious problem.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.300 align:middle line:84%
And Chadwell just lays
it out for his boss,

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:33.050 align:middle line:90%
the Director of the CIA.

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:34.822 align:middle line:84%
So what are we
dealing with here?

00:10:34.822 --> 00:10:36.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't know
how much more explicit

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:40.670 align:middle line:84%
you could expect H. Marshall
Chadwell to have been.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.680 align:middle line:84%
The immediate
aftermath of this memo,

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.980 align:middle line:84%
this incredibly
open, candid memo

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.500 align:middle line:84%
on the reality of
these UFOs, was

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:52.280 align:middle line:84%
to create what became known
as the Robertson Panel.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.380 align:middle line:84%
The Robertson Panel is
something I've always felt

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.210 align:middle line:84%
was the last bit
of housecleaning

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:58.010 align:middle line:90%
of the Harry Truman Presidency.

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:04.040 align:middle line:84%
Happened during the weekend of
January 14 to January 18, 1953.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.080 align:middle line:84%
Just two days after
that ended, we

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.360 align:middle line:84%
had a new President,
Dwight Eisenhower.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:12.170 align:middle line:10%
This was a CIA orchestrated
panel of scientists

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:15.440 align:middle line:10%
who looked into UFO
reports, all really

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.860 align:middle line:10%
as a result of what
the CIA was involved

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.320 align:middle line:10%
in all at the end
of 1952 in terms

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:25.280 align:middle line:10%
of trying to get this whole
thing together and make

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.210 align:middle line:10%
it comprehensible.

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And also, really what you
get with the Robertson Panel

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:33.590 align:middle line:84%
is to make it controlled
within the classified world.

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:37.730 align:middle line:84%
The real end result of the
CIA's analysis and investigation

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:40.650 align:middle line:90%
of UFOs in 1952 was real simple.

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:44.300 align:middle line:84%
It was not to solve the problem
because there's no way they're

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.290 align:middle line:90%
going to solve it.

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:47.767 align:middle line:84%
It's not to find
out a proper method

00:11:47.767 --> 00:11:49.850 align:middle line:84%
for dealing with these
objects because they surely

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:51.690 align:middle line:90%
couldn't do that either.

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:53.510 align:middle line:84%
The only thing they
really could do

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:57.140 align:middle line:84%
is to clamp down on the
secrecy even further.

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what
the Robertson Panel did.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.660 align:middle line:84%
Robertson Panel says we're
going to have this debunked

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:05.000 align:middle line:84%
to the public because we
don't want people getting

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.590 align:middle line:90%
engaged in this subject.

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:08.930 align:middle line:84%
We're going to monitor
UFO organizations.

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:11.450 align:middle line:90%
We'll put spies in there.

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And we'll work with
organizations like Disney

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:16.857 align:middle line:90%
to debunk UFOs to the public.

00:12:16.857 --> 00:12:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And basically, we're
just going to put

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.780 align:middle line:84%
it to sleep as far as
the public's concerned.

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:22.820 align:middle line:84%
And also, what
they ended up doing

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:25.790 align:middle line:84%
was making it more difficult
within the military

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:28.550 align:middle line:84%
and within the
intelligence world also

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:30.950 align:middle line:84%
for ordinary people
in the military

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:32.840 align:middle line:90%
just to report these UFOs.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.390 align:middle line:84%
So it was a real
clampdown that ensued.

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:37.970 align:middle line:90%
Because here's the thing.

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:41.300 align:middle line:84%
They're obviously in a
position in the 1950s

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:46.520 align:middle line:84%
where these objects were
totally outclassing anything

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.650 align:middle line:84%
the United States
or any other nation

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:50.190 align:middle line:90%
could bring to the table.

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And so really, what could you do
except deny, debunk, cover up.

00:12:56.870 --> 00:13:00.220 align:middle line:90%
