00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.460 align:middle line:10%
RICHARD DOLAN: A
number of years ago

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.760 align:middle line:10%
when I was doing some
deep research into the UFO

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.220 align:middle line:10%
subject and the
cover-up, and trying

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.450 align:middle line:10%
to understand how this
cover-up actually worked,

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.510 align:middle line:10%
I developed an idea which
is known as the Breakaway

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.300 align:middle line:10%
Civilization, and we'll talk
a little bit about this.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.830 align:middle line:84%
What is a Breakaway
Civilization?

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.150 align:middle line:90%
Does it really exist?

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And how might we
be able to prove

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.520 align:middle line:90%
its existence in the future?

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, I guess it all
started many, many years ago

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.050 align:middle line:84%
when I had a conversation
with a scientist who

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.080 align:middle line:84%
had done a great deal of
civilian work for the NSA back

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.400 align:middle line:84%
in the 1960s, that is the
National Security Agency.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Back in the mid-'60s, hardly
anyone knew of the existence

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.640 align:middle line:90%
of the NSA.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it was so
secret that one of the jokes

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.820 align:middle line:84%
is that it stood
for No Such Agency.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.690 align:middle line:84%
This scientist worked
there during the mid-1960s,

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.020 align:middle line:84%
and in a conversation that I
had with him some time ago,

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.440 align:middle line:84%
he almost offhandedly
mentioned that at that time

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.660 align:middle line:84%
they were running
computers with a clock

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.630 align:middle line:90%
speed of about 650 megahertz.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, not everyone's
a computer expert

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.660 align:middle line:84%
but if you want to put
that in perspective,

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:29.490 align:middle line:84%
650 megahertz clock speed in
the 1960s was ridiculously fast.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.280 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the consumer
market for computers

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.190 align:middle line:84%
didn't achieve that
clock speed in general

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.510 align:middle line:84%
until around the year
2000, about 35 years later.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, in
1965, well, there

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.560 align:middle line:84%
were no consumer
computers at all anywhere.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.870 align:middle line:84%
So this is basically you
have a secret organization

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.880 align:middle line:84%
that practically
no one knew existed

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.480 align:middle line:84%
that had some of the fastest
computers in the world,

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.910 align:middle line:84%
maybe the fastest
computers in the world.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that's a really
amazing thing to think about.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we are
constantly being made aware

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.960 align:middle line:84%
that technology in
the classified world

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.770 align:middle line:84%
is often very, very
far advanced over what

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.410 align:middle line:84%
is available in the
non-classified world.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard always to
get details and specifics

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.240 align:middle line:84%
but it's definitely true that
these hints and suggestions

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.740 align:middle line:84%
have come out for
many, many years.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And so it seems to be
the case that there

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.510 align:middle line:84%
are classified
breakthroughs in technology

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.590 align:middle line:84%
that many years later might
seep out to the general public.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.790 align:middle line:84%
So with that idea, I thought
about a few other things.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.290 align:middle line:84%
I thought about the history
of civilizations in general.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.970 align:middle line:84%
If you think about it, there
are several many distinct human

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.200 align:middle line:84%
civilizations that have existed
and they have different things

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.490 align:middle line:90%
that define them.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.480 align:middle line:84%
They have different
levels of technology,

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.080 align:middle line:84%
they have different
cosmology, that

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.430 align:middle line:84%
is ideas about how human beings
fit into this universe of ours.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.760 align:middle line:84%
They have different
social attitudes

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.850 align:middle line:84%
and social interactions
and rules and regulations

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:16.990 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.710 align:middle line:84%
It's really hard to quantify
what exactly constitutes

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.960 align:middle line:90%
a distinctive civilization.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.240 align:middle line:84%
But I also think that,
generally speaking,

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.840 align:middle line:84%
people have an idea of
what is a civilization.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.430 align:middle line:84%
It also became clear to me
that throughout our history,

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.200 align:middle line:84%
especially the last few hundred
years, all the various cultures

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.420 align:middle line:84%
and civilizations have been
ever so slowly merging together.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.750 align:middle line:84%
We call it globalization today
but even 100 years ago, this

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.540 align:middle line:84%
was a process that was going
on, even 200 years ago.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Cultures were interacting
and learning from each other

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.490 align:middle line:84%
and you could see that there
was a kind of coming together

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.160 align:middle line:90%
of these various civilizations.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.440 align:middle line:84%
However, we also have the
example of the Cold War

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.230 align:middle line:84%
where certain scientific
infrastructures

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.630 align:middle line:84%
and civilizations
even spread apart.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.940 align:middle line:84%
You think of the
Western civilization

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.870 align:middle line:84%
versus the Soviet society
or civilization that

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.430 align:middle line:90%
was in Russia.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.149 align:middle line:84%
We know that the
Russians and the West

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:23.470 align:middle line:84%
had very different, in
fact very secretive,

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.140 align:middle line:84%
scientific
infrastructures where they

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.150 align:middle line:84%
studied often different
things and went

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.900 align:middle line:90%
in different directions.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.540 align:middle line:84%
This was also true
of the Germans

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.430 align:middle line:90%
during the Second World War.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.410 align:middle line:84%
You have a very secretive
scientific and often industrial

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.760 align:middle line:84%
infrastructure that
often doesn't connect

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.060 align:middle line:90%
with other parts of the world.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.780 align:middle line:84%
So there can be this
separation as well, even

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.760 align:middle line:90%
in the last century.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.590 align:middle line:84%
So I started wondering, let's
put a few things together here

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.400 align:middle line:90%
with the UFO situation.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.740 align:middle line:84%
Are there crash
retrievals of UFOs?

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've always believed
that the answer to that is yes.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.620 align:middle line:84%
Is there deep intense secrecy
about maintaining control

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.960 align:middle line:84%
over those technologies
that have been acquired?

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And I've always believed,
yes, that's the case too.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.623 align:middle line:84%
Now here's where it
gets really interesting.

00:05:16.623 --> 00:05:19.040 align:middle line:84%
What if there were interesting
breakthroughs and new ideas

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.750 align:middle line:84%
in areas of energy production or
propulsion or material science

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.820 align:middle line:84%
or a whole array of
other things that

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.560 align:middle line:90%
might be related to alien tech?

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.340 align:middle line:84%
Would those breakthroughs
necessarily and immediately

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.010 align:middle line:84%
translate to the
rest of the world?

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And the answer I think clearly
is no, not necessarily at all.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.080 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.800 align:middle line:84%
In fact, what would
be more likely is

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.040 align:middle line:84%
that some of those breakthroughs
would be kept secret.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And those scientists
within that infrastructure

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.230 align:middle line:84%
would be in on the
secret and they

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:55.940 align:middle line:84%
would be exploiting
that technology

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:56.990 align:middle line:90%
for their own benefit.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.080 align:middle line:84%
They would be exploiting
that technology also

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.750 align:middle line:84%
under orders probably
of their superiors

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.180 align:middle line:84%
not to have that
seep out to the world

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.280 align:middle line:84%
because it's probably a
little bit too disruptive.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.570 align:middle line:90%
Think about energy.

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:15.080 align:middle line:84%
What if in the 1950s
and 1960s or even 1970s,

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.160 align:middle line:84%
some group of genius
scientists figured out

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.730 align:middle line:84%
on the basis of
acquired ET technology

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.945 align:middle line:84%
that there was, in fact,
a really great energy

00:06:25.945 --> 00:06:27.320 align:middle line:84%
solution, something
that we would

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.440 align:middle line:84%
call free energy that
was implicit in the study

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.135 align:middle line:90%
of this technology?

00:06:32.135 --> 00:06:34.010 align:middle line:84%
They might think, wow,
this is a great thing.

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.572 align:middle line:84%
Let's get this out to
the rest of the world.

00:06:36.572 --> 00:06:38.780 align:middle line:84%
But it's not hard to see
that their supervisors would

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.730 align:middle line:90%
say no, no, no, no, no.

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.380 align:middle line:90%
That's way too disruptive.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.750 align:middle line:84%
By the way, we already
have a petroleum industry

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.088 align:middle line:84%
that takes care of the
energy needs for the world.

00:06:47.088 --> 00:06:48.380 align:middle line:90%
We don't want to rock the boat.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.440 align:middle line:84%
Your job is simply to
work on this development

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.040 align:middle line:84%
and go deeper with it and
see how far we can go.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And so what you
would have is a group

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:03.080 align:middle line:84%
of classified scientists in
a very protected environment

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.120 align:middle line:84%
while the rest of the
world is being prevented

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.520 align:middle line:90%
from seeing what they're doing.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And they are just moving ahead,
moving ahead, moving ahead.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.012 align:middle line:84%
If you want to get
far down the road

00:07:13.012 --> 00:07:14.720 align:middle line:84%
in the world of
scientific breakthroughs,

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.180 align:middle line:84%
you probably are going
to need a whole series

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.345 align:middle line:84%
of other breakthroughs
that preceded.

00:07:19.345 --> 00:07:20.720 align:middle line:84%
But what if the
rest of the world

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.830 align:middle line:84%
is prevented from
those by secrecy?

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.220 align:middle line:84%
So there's a situation
where a very restricted

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.040 align:middle line:84%
scientific community working
within the classified world

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.830 align:middle line:84%
has access to
knowledge, has access

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.040 align:middle line:84%
to technology that the rest
of us don't have access to.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's not hard to see that
if the rest of us are prevented

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.230 align:middle line:84%
and they keep going,
well, maybe there's

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:45.830 align:middle line:84%
no limit as to how far they
can go as long as they keep

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.110 align:middle line:84%
that wall up preventing
the rest of us

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.150 align:middle line:90%
from getting that knowledge.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's the beginnings
of what I've called

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:55.460 align:middle line:90%
a breakaway civilization.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Again what is it
that constitutes

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.480 align:middle line:84%
a separate civilization,
a distinct civilization?

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's hard
to know for sure.

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:02.870 align:middle line:84%
But again, I would
say technology

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:04.850 align:middle line:90%
has something to do with it.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:06.963 align:middle line:84%
Your idea of where you
are in the universe

00:08:06.963 --> 00:08:08.130 align:middle line:90%
has something to do with it.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:11.720 align:middle line:84%
So what if this breakthrough
allows them to have

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.648 align:middle line:90%
a flying saucer of some sort?

00:08:14.648 --> 00:08:16.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is really what
we're talking about, right?

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:22.730 align:middle line:84%
So if it's possible that a
flying saucer of some sort

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:26.660 align:middle line:84%
was actually created at
any time in the 1950s

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:32.978 align:middle line:84%
or '60s or '70s based on a
study of alien technology,

00:08:32.978 --> 00:08:34.520 align:middle line:84%
well, it's more than
them just having

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.679 align:middle line:84%
a flying saucer because
that flying saucer allows

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:37.880 align:middle line:90%
them to do things.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.140 align:middle line:90%
It allows them to travel.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:42.650 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they can travel to other
parts of the solar system,

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:45.500 align:middle line:84%
or the far side of
the moon, or looking

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.890 align:middle line:84%
at the ancient monuments of
Mars, or anything of that sort.

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:52.760 align:middle line:84%
That flying saucer, in other
words, gives them knowledge.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.010 align:middle line:84%
It gives them a
different understanding

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:57.740 align:middle line:84%
of this universe
that we live in.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:59.450 align:middle line:84%
A very radically
different understanding

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:01.158 align:middle line:84%
than the rest of the
people of the world.

00:09:01.158 --> 00:09:03.470 align:middle line:84%
So different that
I think, yes, we

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:07.490 align:middle line:84%
might be able to consider
this classified community

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:10.370 align:middle line:84%
a separate
civilization, one that

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:15.110 align:middle line:84%
has broken away from the rest of
us: the breakaway civilization.

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
germ of this idea

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:21.800 align:middle line:84%
that I formulated back
in 2007, 2008, 2009.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.810 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting
that there are people

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:27.560 align:middle line:84%
who talk about a breakaway
civilization more and more

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.060 align:middle line:90%
in the UFO community at large.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.620 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's a good thing.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.080 align:middle line:84%
But I've always
wanted to come back

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:37.010 align:middle line:84%
to there's the theory of
the breakaway civilization

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:39.440 align:middle line:84%
and then there's
evidence that we always

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:43.790 align:middle line:84%
want to find for such a thing
to prove that theory right.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:46.190 align:middle line:84%
My feeling is
we're still looking

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:48.775 align:middle line:84%
for stronger and
stronger evidence

00:09:48.775 --> 00:09:50.150 align:middle line:84%
but I do think
that we're looking

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:51.260 align:middle line:90%
in the right directions.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.740 align:middle line:84%
I think that the case for
a breakaway civilization

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.470 align:middle line:84%
is a reasonable one;
that is, I think

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:01.220 align:middle line:84%
we'd be very foolish to discount
the idea that there is a very

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:02.310 align:middle line:90%
advanced--

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.250 align:middle line:84%
highly advanced,
classified component

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:06.980 align:middle line:84%
to our civilization
that has knowledge

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.410 align:middle line:84%
of the extraterrestrial
presence,

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:14.060 align:middle line:84%
that has had access to at
least some extraterrestrial

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.520 align:middle line:84%
technology, has been
able to work with it,

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:21.050 align:middle line:84%
has been able to come up
with some breakthroughs based

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:26.270 align:middle line:84%
on that, that has allowed them
to go further in their science

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:27.980 align:middle line:90%
than the rest of us.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.920 align:middle line:84%
Keep in mind, in an era
now, and as we're well

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:35.600 align:middle line:84%
into the 21st century
where globalization is now

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.850 align:middle line:84%
in the process of
creating more and more

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:41.450 align:middle line:84%
a unified legal structure
to much of the world,

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:44.270 align:middle line:84%
where things like
intellectual property rights

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:48.290 align:middle line:84%
are being enforced globally,
consider that that actually

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:52.040 align:middle line:84%
can have a really huge effect
on a breakaway civilization.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:56.510 align:middle line:84%
So that if some brilliant person
in some other part of the world

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:58.610 align:middle line:84%
outside of the United
States comes up

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:03.050 align:middle line:84%
with scientific ideas
that might impinge

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:09.350 align:middle line:84%
on classified patents
within the United States

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:13.190 align:middle line:84%
due to their study of ET tech,
it is entirely possible now

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:16.460 align:middle line:84%
that those scientists would
be prevented from pursuing

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:17.690 align:middle line:90%
those breakthroughs.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:20.300 align:middle line:84%
This is really what's
happening in our world today.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.840 align:middle line:84%
We're developing a
truly global system

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:29.360 align:middle line:84%
that will provide IP protections
for the breakaway society,

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.942 align:middle line:90%
the breakaway civilization.

00:11:30.942 --> 00:11:32.900 align:middle line:84%
I think we've got to be
very careful about that

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.058 align:middle line:90%
moving forward.

00:11:34.058 --> 00:11:35.600 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
claims that people

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.370 align:middle line:84%
have made about a
breakaway civilization

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:39.620 align:middle line:84%
that I just don't know can
they be true or not true.

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.200 align:middle line:84%
Are there portals
to other dimensions?

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.990 align:middle line:84%
Do we really have the
ability to take ourselves

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:48.140 align:middle line:84%
throughout the solar system
or beyond as some people have

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:49.108 align:middle line:90%
claimed?

00:11:49.108 --> 00:11:50.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm always waiting for
credible individuals

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.000 align:middle line:84%
to provide me with
something to work with.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.790 align:middle line:84%
I feel that when
claims are made,

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:58.190 align:middle line:84%
it's the obligation
of those individuals

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:02.240 align:middle line:84%
to give some kind
of genuine evidence

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.850 align:middle line:84%
that other people can
test and to work with.

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of claims
that fail that test in my view.

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:10.430 align:middle line:84%
They don't really
provide enough evidence.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:13.940 align:middle line:84%
Having said that, I do think
that there is a very good case

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:17.270 align:middle line:84%
to be made for the fact
that there's a secret space

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:22.190 align:middle line:84%
program of some capacity with
some advanced technology that

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:23.300 align:middle line:90%
is in operation.

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And that this
secret space program

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:29.000 align:middle line:84%
has some level of
interaction with what we

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.010 align:middle line:90%
would call the UFO phenomenon.

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:35.150 align:middle line:84%
Whether collaboration or
competition is a really good

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:37.070 align:middle line:84%
question to ask, and
I wouldn't pretend

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:38.640 align:middle line:90%
that I know the answer to that.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.520 align:middle line:84%
But we do have good
reason to believe

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:43.610 align:middle line:84%
that there are a lot of
anomalous objects in Earth

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:44.880 align:middle line:90%
orbit and beyond.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it's
quite reasonable

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:49.970 align:middle line:84%
to assume that any clandestine
space program is going

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:52.160 align:middle line:84%
to have interaction with
that phenomenon in one

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.167 align:middle line:90%
way or another.

00:12:53.167 --> 00:12:55.250 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of things
going on in our world that

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:59.900 align:middle line:84%
are behind that curtain, that
we are not permitted to look at,

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.460 align:middle line:84%
we're not permitted
to investigate.

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:05.390 align:middle line:10%
Because of that secrecy it's
difficult, it's hard for us

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:07.940 align:middle line:10%
to do the research to
know exactly what's true

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:08.900 align:middle line:10%
and what's not true.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And in that kind of
environment, it's

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:15.680 align:middle line:84%
really easy for truly wild and
unsupported claims to be made.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:19.760 align:middle line:84%
So my advice would be,
just because someone

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:23.240 align:middle line:84%
makes a claim that might
sound really crazy to you,

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.340 align:middle line:84%
it may not be true,
that's for sure,

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:28.970 align:middle line:84%
but that doesn't mean we want
to throw the entire concept out.

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:31.220 align:middle line:84%
We live in a world
of secrecy; we

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:35.270 align:middle line:84%
live in a world that lacks
transparency in so many ways.

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:39.230 align:middle line:84%
The UFO phenomenon has been
cloaked in secrecy since we've

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:41.930 align:middle line:90%
been aware of it in the 1940s.

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:46.010 align:middle line:84%
There has been a deep level
of study within the classified

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:50.510 align:middle line:84%
world, largely privatized with
a lot of government interaction

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:54.540 align:middle line:84%
that has also squirreled away a
lot of the technology and a lot

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:57.950 align:middle line:84%
of the knowledge that has
been acquired over the years.

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And we are blocked out from
accessing most of that,

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:03.980 align:middle line:90%
it seems to me.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:06.770 align:middle line:84%
So there's a really good
case for what we would

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:08.930 align:middle line:90%
call a breakaway civilization.

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:11.600 align:middle line:84%
Does this mean that such
a breakaway civilization

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.930 align:middle line:84%
is people living on Mars like
in an alternative three-type

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:16.730 align:middle line:90%
setting?

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:19.740 align:middle line:84%
Or are they on the backside of
the moon or anything like that?

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And I would say,
well, I have no idea.

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:26.630 align:middle line:84%
I suspect, though, that the
action is always on Earth.

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:29.300 align:middle line:84%
This is where the
action is, our planet.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.520 align:middle line:84%
You could be living right
next door to someone

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.010 align:middle line:84%
who belongs to the breakaway
civilization for all we know.

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:35.420 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
someone who might

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:39.260 align:middle line:84%
have a military job
or classified job.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.680 align:middle line:84%
They go to work;
they punch the clock;

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.480 align:middle line:84%
they're in their
classified program.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.640 align:middle line:84%
Within that classified
program, they

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:49.940 align:middle line:84%
may punch another clock so
to speak for a more deeply

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:51.930 align:middle line:90%
classified program within that.

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's possible that
they then punch yet

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:58.400 align:middle line:84%
another clock for a still
more deeply classified program

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.200 align:middle line:84%
within that where
they're now dealing

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.510 align:middle line:84%
with truly advanced
technologies that would

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:04.490 align:middle line:90%
seem magical to you and me.

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:08.760 align:middle line:84%
That could very well be how the
breakaway civilization operates

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:09.787 align:middle line:90%
for all we know.

00:15:09.787 --> 00:15:11.870 align:middle line:84%
These people come back
home, they mow their lawns,

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.340 align:middle line:84%
they say hello to
their neighbors.

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.350 align:middle line:84%
They kiss their spouse
when they get back.

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:18.830 align:middle line:84%
All of that totally
true, totally possible.

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:20.690 align:middle line:84%
A breakaway civilization
doesn't have

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:23.780 align:middle line:84%
to be completely exotic
filled with wormholes

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.060 align:middle line:90%
and Star Trek-like technology.

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:29.150 align:middle line:84%
We need more time and
resources really to dive

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.280 align:middle line:90%
into this concept.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.950 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a powerful
concept and I also

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:36.140 align:middle line:90%
happen to believe it's true.
