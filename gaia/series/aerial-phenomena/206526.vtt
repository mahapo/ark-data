00:00:11.763 --> 00:00:13.180 align:middle line:10%
>> When you really
think about it,

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.050 align:middle line:10%
the idea of disclosure has
been with the UFO field since

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.900 align:middle line:10%
the very beginning, since we've
known about flying saucers

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.490 align:middle line:10%
in the 1940s.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.010 align:middle line:84%
We just haven't
called it disclosure.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.770 align:middle line:84%
Back in the '50s,
back in the '60s,

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.450 align:middle line:84%
there were other
words used to describe

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.280 align:middle line:84%
this idea that we need to end
secrecy on the subject of UFOs.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.410 align:middle line:10%
Back in those days,
in the United States,

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.230 align:middle line:10%
there was an organization
known as NICAP

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.350 align:middle line:10%
that was run by a
Major Donald Keyhoe,

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.530 align:middle line:10%
and Keyhoe was the guy
back then who was just

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.950 align:middle line:10%
fighting the fight to
end UFO secrecy, what

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.720 align:middle line:10%
we would call disclosure.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.400 align:middle line:90%
It's never stopped.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.320 align:middle line:90%
Through the 1970s, it continued.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.290 align:middle line:84%
New people came onto
the scene, and they also

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.870 align:middle line:84%
were pushing for some form of
openness, the end of secrecy,

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.500 align:middle line:84%
again, what we would call
disclosure through the '80s,

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.790 align:middle line:84%
through the '90s, and into the
21st century, when we finally

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.330 align:middle line:84%
started using that
phrase, disclosure.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.300 align:middle line:90%
It's never stopped.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.820 align:middle line:90%
It's always been an issue.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.080 align:middle line:84%
It's always been something that
UFO researchers and activists

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.670 align:middle line:90%
have been striving for.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.080 align:middle line:84%
The question is, will
we ever have disclosure?

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.110 align:middle line:84%
The question really is, will we
ever have a moment in our world

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.190 align:middle line:84%
where this subject,
this subject of UFOs,

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:40.070 align:middle line:84%
is openly acknowledged by
all elements of our society,

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.690 align:middle line:84%
including all of our
scientific establishments

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.060 align:middle line:90%
and political institutions?

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.710 align:middle line:84%
Because that's
really what we mean

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.300 align:middle line:90%
when we talk about disclosure.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:55.990 align:middle line:84%
It's disclosing the reality
of this from a previous mode

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.280 align:middle line:90%
of secrecy.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.540 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'll just say this.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.970 align:middle line:84%
To understand whether
we can have disclosure,

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.920 align:middle line:84%
I often like to
rewind the clock,

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.570 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, and
look at the past

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.220 align:middle line:84%
and to look at how UFO
secrecy seems to have begun.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And so I like to go
back to the 1940s

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.780 align:middle line:84%
and look at the presidency
of Harry Truman.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.100 align:middle line:10%
He was the US president
from 1945 to 1953.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And it was under Harry Truman's
presidency within the US

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.150 align:middle line:84%
that this whole matter
of flying saucers

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.940 align:middle line:84%
became a really
important public issue.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's also during
that period of time

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:40.660 align:middle line:84%
when we can really see that the
secrecy apparatus around UFOs

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.280 align:middle line:90%
really took root.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.840 align:middle line:84%
You go back to 1947 to events
like Roswell, New Mexico.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.550 align:middle line:84%
Did a flying saucer crash there
with alien bodies recovered?

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.910 align:middle line:10%
Did something similar
happen the following spring

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.400 align:middle line:10%
in Aztec, New
Mexico, not far away,

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.220 align:middle line:10%
with yet more alien bodies?

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.070 align:middle line:84%
There are a number of
these other crash retrieval

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.890 align:middle line:84%
incidents that appear
to have taken place.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And if you believe that
they happened, and I

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.110 align:middle line:84%
do believe that at least
some of them happened,

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.610 align:middle line:84%
then you're facing a really
interesting situation here.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.130 align:middle line:84%
If you're the President
of the United States,

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.650 align:middle line:84%
this information is going
to come to you, obviously.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
to make a decision.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.550 align:middle line:90%
Do you tell the world?

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.260 align:middle line:84%
Do you tell the
world that you have

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.250 align:middle line:84%
recovered this exotic technology
and these alien bodies?

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think the instinct
of most of us looking

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.370 align:middle line:84%
at the matter with a lot
of historical perspective

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.410 align:middle line:84%
and distance-- we
would say, yes, we're

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.430 align:middle line:90%
going to tell the world.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.950 align:middle line:84%
If this were to happen, the
world has a right to know.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And I would agree
with that, absolutely.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's very possible
that Harry Truman might

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.450 align:middle line:90%
have agreed with that, too.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.250 align:middle line:84%
But Harry Truman was
in a really tough spot

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.030 align:middle line:84%
because he'd be surrounded
by advisors, all of whom,

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:04.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure, would say,
bad idea, bad idea.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.860 align:middle line:84%
You tell the world
that this is real.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.680 align:middle line:90%
What's going to happen?

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.100 align:middle line:84%
A, you don't even know who
these other beings are.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.580 align:middle line:84%
You don't even know if
they're friendly or not.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.260 align:middle line:84%
So what are you going
to tell the world?

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.279 align:middle line:84%
You're just going to get
people worked up over nothing?

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:21.070 align:middle line:84%
B, this is seriously
advanced technology.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.350 align:middle line:84%
Are you willing to
share this technology

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.350 align:middle line:84%
with everyone else in the
world, including the Russians,

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.950 align:middle line:84%
including any other potential
adversaries that come up?

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.020 align:middle line:84%
Because, let's
face it, you're not

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.345 align:middle line:84%
willing to share
atomic technology

00:04:34.345 --> 00:04:35.470 align:middle line:90%
with the rest of the world.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And in 1947, just to give
you some perspective,

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.590 align:middle line:84%
the United States still had
a monopoly of atomic bombs

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:42.470 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.080 align:middle line:84%
No one else had atomic
bombs in 1947 except the US.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And the United States was
absolutely not willing,

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.050 align:middle line:84%
I can assure you, not willing
to share its atomic technology

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.030 align:middle line:90%
with any other nation.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.310 align:middle line:84%
If they were not willing
to share atomic technology,

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.380 align:middle line:84%
I think we can probably
assume they were not

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.410 align:middle line:84%
willing to share something as
exotic as alien technology.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.020 align:middle line:84%
So that would be
problem number 2.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And problem number 3 and 4 and
5 and 6 and 7 would be how bad

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.520 align:middle line:90%
would public panic be?

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.470 align:middle line:90%
How bad would public panic be?

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.220 align:middle line:84%
How badly would this affect
our energy infrastructure?

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.810 align:middle line:84%
If these objects are using
something other than petroleum

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.520 align:middle line:84%
to move around, would this
pose a short- or medium- or

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.810 align:middle line:84%
long-term risk to the very
profitable petroleum industry

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.780 align:middle line:84%
that the entire world is using
to move its infrastructure?

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.420 align:middle line:84%
Do we really want to upset that,
and on and on and on and on?

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.060 align:middle line:84%
So this-- these--
there are a lot

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.393 align:middle line:90%
of questions that would come up.

00:05:47.393 --> 00:05:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And it is very likely
that President Harry

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Truman back in the 1940s
would say, you know what?

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.620 align:middle line:90%
Let's keep this quiet for now.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.440 align:middle line:90%
We'll study it for now.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.220 align:middle line:84%
We will review the situation
every so often and decide

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.120 align:middle line:84%
if and when we are going to
disclose any of this reality

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.500 align:middle line:90%
to the rest of the world.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.100 align:middle line:90%
That's how the secrecy starts.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.980 align:middle line:84%
The president might
say, you're in charge

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.390 align:middle line:90%
of managing the media.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.880 align:middle line:84%
You're in charge
of understanding

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.620 align:middle line:84%
all of the scientific
implications

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:21.670 align:middle line:90%
of this phenomenon.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.112 align:middle line:84%
You're in charge
of understanding

00:06:23.112 --> 00:06:25.570 align:middle line:84%
who these other beings are and
do we have anything to worry

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.440 align:middle line:90%
about, and on and on and on.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.240 align:middle line:90%
So that's the team.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And over time, the tasks become
allocated in various ways

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.948 align:middle line:84%
to create an entire
structure of secrecy.

00:06:35.948 --> 00:06:37.240 align:middle line:90%
People think that's impossible.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, I would say study
the world of secrecy

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.670 align:middle line:84%
for a little while,
and then guess again.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:45.490 align:middle line:84%
It is entirely possible
and happens all the time

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.710 align:middle line:84%
that secrets are kept
for years and years

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:52.780 align:middle line:84%
and, indeed, can be kept
indefinitely, and often are.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.250 align:middle line:84%
So the UFO secret begins in
the 1940s, and it continues

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.530 align:middle line:90%
and it deepens.

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And the problem with
this structure of secrecy

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:09.940 align:middle line:84%
is that it appears to have
become very largely privatized.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't mean
that it's moved

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:16.700 align:middle line:84%
100% out of all
government authority,

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.590 align:middle line:84%
particularly relating to the
United States government.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:25.210 align:middle line:84%
But it does appear that
a lot of this knowledge,

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:29.890 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the money, a lot
of the profit, as well,

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:31.960 align:middle line:84%
really accrues to
private industry

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.760 align:middle line:90%
within the UFO secrecy.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And when I say profit,
I mean real profit

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.070 align:middle line:90%
because what's going on here--

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.290 align:middle line:84%
and just understand
this scenario--

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:45.520 align:middle line:84%
the government-- the army
acquires an artifact,

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.970 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a craft or whether
it's a piece of technology,

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:51.640 align:middle line:90%
that now needs to be studied.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.590 align:middle line:90%
It needs to be exploited.

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:56.350 align:middle line:84%
It needs to be understood
scientifically.

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.250 align:middle line:90%
How is this done?

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:01.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, the military itself
has some very brilliant minds

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:03.490 align:middle line:84%
working within it,
without a doubt.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:06.520 align:middle line:84%
But the real scientifically
brilliant minds

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.230 align:middle line:90%
are all in private industry.

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:09.550 align:middle line:90%
That's where the money is.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:11.240 align:middle line:90%
That's where the brainpower is.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens,
inevitably, is

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:16.480 align:middle line:84%
that the Army or the Air
Force or the Navy or whatever

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.600 align:middle line:84%
branch of government hands
off a piece of technology

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:25.900 align:middle line:84%
to a private contractor under
conditions of extreme security

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:27.790 align:middle line:90%
and secrecy.

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And the question really becomes,
who owns that technology?

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:34.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's a question
for lawyers, who hammer out

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:37.179 align:middle line:84%
their arrangements within
the classified world,

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:40.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure, very, very exactly.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:42.909 align:middle line:84%
But what you really
have over time

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:48.820 align:middle line:84%
is a situation where ownership
over technology and ownership

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:54.430 align:middle line:84%
over the information, the data,
slowly, but surely, I think,

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:57.580 align:middle line:84%
becomes transferred
to private entities.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And if you step outside
of the UFO scenario

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:04.090 align:middle line:84%
and you just look at how
the United States government

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:07.060 align:middle line:84%
bureaucracy works, it's
really the same way.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.880 align:middle line:84%
You see that the power
resides more and more

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:13.490 align:middle line:84%
in private entities that are
standing behind the government.

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:15.670 align:middle line:10%
It's not the government
agencies or the government

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:17.260 align:middle line:10%
elected officials
who are going to say

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.660 align:middle line:10%
who really wield the power.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.990 align:middle line:84%
It's the money behind the
state, what some people call

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:27.520 align:middle line:84%
the deep state, which has been
discussed for many, many years

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.630 align:middle line:90%
and decades.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.930 align:middle line:84%
So that's, I think, the
situation we're looking

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:35.200 align:middle line:84%
at vis-a-vis the UFO
part of the problem--

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:40.000 align:middle line:84%
that is, UFO tech
increasingly gets privatized.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, from a disclosure
point of view,

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.590 align:middle line:84%
this presents some
serious problems.

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:50.350 align:middle line:84%
One question is, how much can
any President of the United

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:52.720 align:middle line:84%
States do relating
to this matter?

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.220 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you a story.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:56.020 align:middle line:84%
About 12 years ago,
I had a conversation

00:09:56.020 --> 00:10:00.940 align:middle line:84%
with a very prominent man from
within the US intelligence

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:04.960 align:middle line:84%
community who knew a great
deal about the UFO subject,

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.390 align:middle line:84%
a very, very great
deal, an extremely

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:12.460 align:middle line:84%
articulate, intelligent man who
knew multiple US presidents,

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:15.490 align:middle line:84%
multiple heads of the
Central Intelligence Agency,

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:18.550 align:middle line:84%
the CIA, multiple heads
of the Defense Department,

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:19.570 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:22.360 align:middle line:84%
This man is plugged
in very, very well

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:27.280 align:middle line:84%
to the upper, upper echelon
of American national security.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And he happened to have a deep
knowledge of the UFO subject

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:32.690 align:middle line:84%
to boot-- so very
interesting person.

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:33.940 align:middle line:90%
And I happened to talk to him.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And I said, hey, I
would like to ask you,

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:41.890 align:middle line:84%
how much do presidents
know about UFOs?

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, some
have known more than others.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:46.780 align:middle line:90%
It's not all the same.

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.140 align:middle line:90%
And he just gave me a list.

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.980 align:middle line:84%
He said Jimmy Carter
knew, Ronald Reagan knew,

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.470 align:middle line:90%
George Bush, Senior, knew.

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:56.200 align:middle line:84%
According to this man, he
was strongly of the opinion

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.680 align:middle line:84%
that Bill Clinton did not get
a formal briefing on UFOs,

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:03.350 align:middle line:90%
and nor did George W. Bush.

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:06.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, I happened to have
this particular conversation

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:09.430 align:middle line:84%
during the later part of that
George W. Bush presidency.

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:13.120 align:middle line:84%
So we didn't talk about
Barack Obama or Donald Trump.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.940 align:middle line:84%
But his assessment was
pretty clear, anyway,

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:20.182 align:middle line:84%
which was presidents
come and go.

00:11:20.182 --> 00:11:21.640 align:middle line:84%
Presidents have to
kiss the babies,

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:22.852 align:middle line:90%
be in front of the cameras.

00:11:22.852 --> 00:11:24.310 align:middle line:84%
They've got to meet
with reporters.

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.840 align:middle line:84%
They've got to read
their talking points.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.690 align:middle line:84%
They have thousands
of things that they

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:33.750 align:middle line:84%
have to do in very,
very public light.

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And most nearly all of
the important things

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:40.050 align:middle line:84%
that go on in government
are below the surface,

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:43.680 align:middle line:84%
done in countless special
access programs-- that

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:49.110 align:middle line:84%
is, black budget programs-- with
virtually no real government

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:54.420 align:middle line:84%
oversight whatsoever except
under the most limited basis.

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And he just asked
me, how much do

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:59.880 align:middle line:84%
you think any president
is really going to be

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.940 align:middle line:90%
able to manage all of these--

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:06.510 align:middle line:84%
this mountain of
secret programs?

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:08.610 align:middle line:10%
The answer is almost not at all.

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:11.970 align:middle line:10%
And some presidents
try harder than others

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:13.530 align:middle line:10%
to be on top of all of that.

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:16.230 align:middle line:84%
But it's the bureaucrats,
it's the lifers

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:19.410 align:middle line:84%
within these programs, that
are really running things.

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:22.200 align:middle line:84%
Even within government
programs, the question

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:27.900 align:middle line:84%
is, how much control do they
have over the UFO problem,

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:31.710 align:middle line:84%
over the UFO phenomenon,
over the technology,

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:35.640 align:middle line:84%
over gaining scientific
information about this,

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:40.810 align:middle line:84%
over collecting all the
relevant data on this?

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:45.420 align:middle line:84%
It's not really clear which
formal government agency

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:46.440 align:middle line:90%
does all of this.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.950 align:middle line:10%
There are still many, many
ultra-secret US government

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:52.950 align:middle line:10%
agencies that could
very well have

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:56.790 align:middle line:10%
a great deal of information on
this, from the NSA to the NRO

00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:02.580 align:middle line:10%
to any number of probably
still secret organizations

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:06.300 align:middle line:10%
and programs that exist
that we have no idea about.

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:09.060 align:middle line:84%
Keep in mind that the NSA
existed for many, many years

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:11.280 align:middle line:84%
before anyone knew
that it did exist,

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.740 align:middle line:84%
and the same is with the NRO,
the National Reconnaissance

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.690 align:middle line:90%
Office, which manages--

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:18.480 align:middle line:84%
officially manages all spy
satellites that we have,

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:22.890 align:middle line:84%
and which was a felony
for a member of Congress

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:25.320 align:middle line:84%
to mention for over 30
years until it was finally

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.090 align:middle line:90%
outed in the 1990s.

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:28.650 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:31.170 align:middle line:84%
So that's the history of the
American classified world--

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:34.770 align:middle line:84%
is that we have entire
departments that have existed

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:37.680 align:middle line:84%
in total secrecy without
people even knowing

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.490 align:middle line:90%
about their existence.

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:42.720 align:middle line:84%
So now when you're looking
at the UFO situation

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.370 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking
about disclosure,

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:48.070 align:middle line:84%
it's a really fair
question to ask,

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:52.990 align:middle line:84%
who has got the
information to disclose?

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:57.190 align:middle line:84%
We have multiple stories of
even American presidents being

00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:01.990 align:middle line:84%
unable to get access to
the relevant information

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:05.560 align:middle line:84%
that they could then
disclose to the public.

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:09.310 align:middle line:84%
I heard this twice relating to
the presidency of Bill Clinton,

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:11.170 align:middle line:90%
where he was just not able.

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And he tried, apparently, to
get to the root of the UFO issue

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:20.380 align:middle line:84%
and just failed and said this
to one person that I personally

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:27.190 align:middle line:84%
know privately during his
second term in 1997 or '98

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:30.820 align:middle line:84%
and was just not able to do
it and had given up because it

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:33.220 align:middle line:90%
just couldn't be done.

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.240 align:middle line:90%
This is a real problem.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And every indication--
when we have individuals

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:41.440 align:middle line:84%
who look into this
world of secrecy,

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.890 align:middle line:84%
they all conclude
the same thing,

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:46.150 align:middle line:84%
which is that this is a problem
that has moved beyond that

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:47.800 align:middle line:90%
of the United States president.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And the question that we ask is,
who's got the power over this?

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is I
don't know anyone

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:58.180 align:middle line:84%
who really has the full
answer to that question.

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:00.430 align:middle line:90%
Who's got the real power?

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:03.072 align:middle line:90%
Who's got the real knowledge?

00:15:03.072 --> 00:15:05.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, now we're getting into
some very important questions,

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:08.720 align:middle line:84%
like, who are the most
powerful, knowledgeable people

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.520 align:middle line:90%
in the world?

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:10.937 align:middle line:84%
Is it the United
States president,

00:15:10.937 --> 00:15:14.050 align:middle line:84%
or is it anyone
who is beyond that?

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:16.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think we're
looking at the latter.

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:19.450 align:middle line:84%
There are groups and people
beyond the United States

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:20.583 align:middle line:90%
president.

00:15:20.583 --> 00:15:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And there's even
another obstacle,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.600 align:middle line:84%
which is simply that there
is no conceivable motivation

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.290 align:middle line:84%
that those people who have
full possession of this secret

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:31.840 align:middle line:84%
would ever want to
reveal it to the world.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.260 align:middle line:84%
By having sole knowledge of all
of the implications of the UFO

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.390 align:middle line:84%
phenomenon, including
the technology,

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:41.020 align:middle line:84%
they are truly holding
the future in their hands.

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:45.310 align:middle line:84%
They are holding an enormous
amount of profit and money

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:47.710 align:middle line:84%
and wealth and power
in their hands.

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:50.560 align:middle line:84%
After all, a study
of this technology

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:54.760 align:middle line:84%
means that they, and they alone,
have the best ground floor

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.340 align:middle line:84%
opportunities for investment
for new technology.

00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:59.290 align:middle line:84%
Why would they want to
give that advantage up?

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And also, they have advantages
in terms of weapons technology

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:08.770 align:middle line:84%
development that would put them
far ahead of other competitors,

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:09.903 align:middle line:90%
it would seem.

00:16:09.903 --> 00:16:11.320 align:middle line:84%
There's really not
a lot of reason

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.930 align:middle line:84%
why anyone in possession
of this secret

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:16.630 align:middle line:84%
would really want to give
it up for the benefit

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:18.130 align:middle line:90%
of the rest of humanity.

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:20.290 align:middle line:84%
As wonderful as
that sounds to us--

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:22.900 align:middle line:84%
doesn't sound quite as
wonderful, most likely,

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:24.820 align:middle line:84%
to those people
who've got the secret.

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:29.620 align:middle line:84%
They want to keep that advantage
for as long as possible.

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And yet with all
of that, with all

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:36.910 align:middle line:84%
of these obstacles
in the way, I do

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:41.260 align:middle line:84%
believe that the
end of UFO secrecy

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.650 align:middle line:90%
will be an inevitability.

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:47.980 align:middle line:84%
History is filled
with ruling groups

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:52.990 align:middle line:84%
that seek to maintain their
grip on power forever.

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:56.120 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is that
nothing lasts forever.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And even the most entrenched
of lies that any society can

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:05.650 align:middle line:84%
possibly have, that any society
can possibly live underneath,

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:08.230 align:middle line:90%
cannot last forever.

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:11.589 align:middle line:90%
Ultimately, we learn the truth.

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And the truth on
the subject of UFOs

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:16.040 align:middle line:84%
has been with us
for a long time.

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.160 align:middle line:90%
And it's not a declining truth.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.710 align:middle line:90%
It is a growing truth.

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:24.550 align:middle line:84%
There are lots of forces on
both sides of this fence that

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:26.470 align:middle line:90%
are seeking to win this battle.

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:28.270 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
there are definitely

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:31.300 align:middle line:84%
forces on the side of
secrecy and propaganda

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.990 align:middle line:84%
and disinformation that have
continued every step of the way

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:36.890 align:middle line:90%
to keep their advantage.

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:39.970 align:middle line:84%
But even so, they're not
winning because the forces

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:45.910 align:middle line:84%
on the other side is the force
of greater and greater freedom

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:48.850 align:middle line:84%
of communication and
transference of knowledge.

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:51.820 align:middle line:90%
And the thing is this.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Once this information
comes out, it's

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.270 align:middle line:90%
not going back into the bottle.

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:00.490 align:middle line:90%
It's out.

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And over the last
several decades,

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:06.590 align:middle line:84%
and even in the
last several years,

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:09.640 align:middle line:84%
we have been learning
new and very important

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:14.590 align:middle line:84%
things about this phenomenon
that are now never going away.

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:17.710 align:middle line:84%
Increasingly in our era,
it's easier and easier

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:20.770 align:middle line:84%
for people genuinely
to talk about UFOs,

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:24.100 align:middle line:84%
even if they have to change the
phrase and call them "UAP"--

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:26.390 align:middle line:90%
still the same thing.

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:30.190 align:middle line:84%
But we're able to talk about
it more and more easily,

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:32.330 align:middle line:90%
and that's a really good thing.

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And I don't foresee that this
door is now going to slam,

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.420 align:middle line:90%
at least not completely.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:42.310 align:middle line:90%
There's always a back-and-forth.

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:45.110 align:middle line:90%
There's always an ebb and flow.

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:48.850 align:middle line:84%
But I really believe
that the end of secrecy

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:51.790 align:middle line:84%
is truly the right
side of history.

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:53.830 align:middle line:90%
No secret can last forever.

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Every secret has got
an expiration date.

00:18:57.130 --> 00:19:01.300 align:middle line:84%
Our world right now is in
such flux, such a state

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:04.990 align:middle line:84%
of dramatic, radical
social, technological change

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:07.390 align:middle line:84%
in every way that
one can imagine,

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:09.550 align:middle line:84%
that's an unstable
situation that

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:14.620 align:middle line:84%
is a perfect stew for
some new revelation

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.050 align:middle line:84%
to come out that
really will shake

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:21.520 align:middle line:84%
the foundations of the
walls of UFO secrecy.

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:25.660 align:middle line:10%
Now, when that happens, when
the big revelation happens,

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:29.560 align:middle line:10%
the great admission
happens, the real question

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:31.730 align:middle line:10%
of what happens next--

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:35.290 align:middle line:10%
well, that's a whole other
series of explorations

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:37.300 align:middle line:10%
that we can look into.

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:40.360 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that the
end of UFO secrecy

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:45.820 align:middle line:84%
will probably turn out
to be among the greatest

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:50.680 align:middle line:84%
transformations in the
history of our species.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.420 align:middle line:10%
We're in the process of some
very dramatic transformations

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:54.220 align:middle line:10%
right now.

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And even so, the
knowledge that we

00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:58.900 align:middle line:84%
are not alone, the
knowledge that there

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:03.820 align:middle line:84%
has been a concealment of that
presence for a long time--

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:08.170 align:middle line:84%
all of these are going to
have monumental changes.

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:10.360 align:middle line:10%
All of these will bring
monumental changes

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.400 align:middle line:10%
to our society in
ways that we really

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.890 align:middle line:10%
can't truly predict, even
though I tried once in a book

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:16.690 align:middle line:10%
to predict it.

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:20.230 align:middle line:10%
But it's a tough game
looking into the future.

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:23.730 align:middle line:84%
What we can see is that
change is inevitable,

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:27.870 align:middle line:84%
and the current system that
we have is going to change.

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:33.150 align:middle line:84%
I would say the coming years
will require a lot of bravery,

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:36.540 align:middle line:84%
a lot of fortitude,
a lot of persistence.

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:39.490 align:middle line:90%
But in the end, truth will win.

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:42.360 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to say one more
thing about disclosure.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And whereas I am a
great believer in it,

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:52.092 align:middle line:84%
I'm a great believer that it's
not our lot to be spoon-fed BS

00:20:52.092 --> 00:20:53.550 align:middle line:84%
and lies for the
rest of our lives,

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:55.590 align:middle line:84%
as if we're
five-year-old children--

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:59.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that that's
appropriate for this stage

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.660 align:middle line:90%
of human civilization anymore.

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.368 align:middle line:84%
I think we can do a
lot better than that.

00:21:02.368 --> 00:21:05.580 align:middle line:84%
But I also don't think that
a disclosure will necessarily

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:08.580 align:middle line:90%
be full or be completely true.

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:12.540 align:middle line:84%
We have to realize that
lies and spin and propaganda

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:14.440 align:middle line:90%
are the way of the world.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And when new information
is presented to us,

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:23.100 align:middle line:84%
we have got to look at
that with a critical eye.

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:26.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, I wouldn't say a
knee-jerk, reflexive claim

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:28.530 align:middle line:90%
that that's disinformation.

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:30.540 align:middle line:84%
I think that's also
equally foolish.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.520 align:middle line:84%
But I do think that
what we need to do

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:35.760 align:middle line:84%
is look at all information
with a critical eye

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:39.970 align:middle line:84%
and base it upon available
evidence that we have.

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:42.150 align:middle line:84%
So we need to bring
a critical mind

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:45.960 align:middle line:84%
to any kind of future
disclosure and recognize

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:50.100 align:middle line:84%
that there is a potential
mountain of information

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:52.200 align:middle line:84%
on this subject and--
is very possibly

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:56.430 align:middle line:84%
that we're being given only the
smallest sliver, a sliver that

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:59.580 align:middle line:84%
may very well be politically
beneficial to whoever's

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:02.190 align:middle line:90%
doing the dishing out.

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:04.140 align:middle line:84%
It's an old saying
that the best way

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:07.030 align:middle line:84%
to keep a secret is to
pretend to share it.

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:09.270 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to be
careful about that,

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:13.650 align:middle line:84%
and we want to be careful
about a false disclosure that

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:15.498 align:middle line:90%
really isn't a disclosure.

00:22:15.498 --> 00:22:17.790 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe that we are
moving further and further

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:21.780 align:middle line:84%
down this road where more
information on the UFO subject

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:22.800 align:middle line:90%
is coming out.

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And it will be
inevitable that there

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:28.490 align:middle line:90%
will be a big revelation--

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:33.480 align:middle line:84%
I believe this-- where
denying it any longer

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:36.070 align:middle line:90%
will be an exercise in futility.

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing we know, it
could be a very rapid series

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:42.930 align:middle line:84%
of events by which our
foundation, our world,

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:45.360 align:middle line:84%
is simply rocked by
this new information

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:48.390 align:middle line:84%
that we are not alone and
that there are others who

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:50.520 align:middle line:84%
are here and, very
likely, have been here

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:51.820 align:middle line:90%
with us for a long time.

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And when that
happens, well, just

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:55.770 align:middle line:84%
open up the doors
because there's

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:58.350 align:middle line:84%
going to be a lot of
change coming up ahead.

00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:02.880 align:middle line:84%
The moment of disclosure is not
the end of the fight for truth.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.130 align:middle line:84%
It's really the
beginning of a new phase

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:06.300 align:middle line:90%
for the fight for truth.

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:07.470 align:middle line:90%
That never ends.

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:10.980 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe that in
the end, truth will win out.

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:14.330 align:middle line:90%
