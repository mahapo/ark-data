00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.710 align:middle line:10%
>> In history of the UFO, a
lot was going on in the summer

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.740 align:middle line:10%
of 1948.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Everyone talks about
Roswell in 1947,

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.620 align:middle line:84%
but the following
summer, 1948, there

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.390 align:middle line:84%
was a lot happening in
the whole story of UFOs.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.410 align:middle line:10%
And one of the things
that, to me, is just

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.800 align:middle line:10%
an amazing development
that you really never hear

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.280 align:middle line:10%
anyone talking about
is the fact that we

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.960 align:middle line:10%
know that President
Harry Truman began

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.970 align:middle line:10%
receiving quarterly
briefings on UFOs,

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.520 align:middle line:10%
and those quarterly
briefings lasted

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.770 align:middle line:10%
for the rest of his entire
presidency, which lasted,

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.890 align:middle line:10%
by the way, until January 1953.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.560 align:middle line:84%
We're talking four
and a half years.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.260 align:middle line:84%
Quarterly briefings for
four and a half years,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.362 align:middle line:84%
by my calculation, that's
about 18 briefings,

00:01:10.362 --> 00:01:11.820 align:middle line:84%
and wouldn't you
loved to have been

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.520 align:middle line:90%
a fly on the wall for those.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, how do we know
that this happened?

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.130 align:middle line:90%
That's a good question.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, back in 1974, there
was an Air Force general

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.320 align:middle line:84%
who was being
interviewed as part

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.980 align:middle line:84%
of what was called an oral
history interview project out

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.820 align:middle line:90%
of the University of California.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.650 align:middle line:10%
And this general's name
was Robert B. Landry.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.350 align:middle line:10%
Turns out that Robert
Landry, back in 1948,

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.080 align:middle line:10%
was a Colonel for
the US Air Force

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.950 align:middle line:10%
and was selected to be Harry
Truman, President Harry

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.700 align:middle line:10%
Truman's Air Force liaison.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And basically, that
meant that Landry

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.310 align:middle line:84%
would talk to the Air
Force on behalf of Truman,

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.440 align:middle line:84%
get information for
Truman from the Air Force,

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.520 align:middle line:90%
and that type of thing.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.620 align:middle line:84%
So in the summer of
1948, during the period

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.370 align:middle line:84%
of the infamous Estimate
of the Situation

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.180 align:middle line:84%
when that was being written,
when Air Force analysts are

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.250 align:middle line:84%
talking about this
whole phenomenon

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.700 align:middle line:84%
being potentially
interplanetary, all of that

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.590 align:middle line:90%
was going on.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.150 align:middle line:10%
And Landry is summoned
to Harry Truman's office

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.140 align:middle line:10%
in the summer of 1948.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And what was the
situation there?

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.250 align:middle line:90%
The situation was UFOs.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.840 align:middle line:90%
What did Harry Truman want?

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.220 align:middle line:84%
Harry Truman directed
Colonel Landry

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.430 align:middle line:84%
to coordinate with
Central Intelligence, that

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:49.600 align:middle line:84%
is the CIA, to get and analyze
UFO reports for Harry Truman's

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.980 align:middle line:90%
benefit.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Wow, Harry Truman was a
busy guy back in 1948.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.850 align:middle line:84%
He was a busy guy
in 1949 and in 1950

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.560 align:middle line:84%
when the Korean War
broke out, and all

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.230 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of his
presidency, and yet he's

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.770 align:middle line:84%
taking the time out
of that busy schedule

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:13.840 align:middle line:84%
to be formally briefed on
UFOs every three months.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm just like wow.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.820 align:middle line:90%
That's a wow moment.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to read to you what
Landry actually said here,

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.680 align:middle line:84%
and by the way, during this
oral history interview,

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.400 align:middle line:84%
most of this interview that
this interviewer was conducting

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.230 align:middle line:84%
was not just standard
types of stuff

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.140 align:middle line:84%
like what was Landry doing
during the Great Berlin

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.890 align:middle line:84%
airlift of 1948, and what was
Landry doing during this thing

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:36.880 align:middle line:90%
and during that thing.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And then at the very
end of the interview,

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.510 align:middle line:84%
this interviewer says, hey, what
about flying saucers and UFOs?

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.640 align:middle line:84%
You ever get anything
to do with that?

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And you can really see that
this catches Landry off guard,

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.130 align:middle line:90%
but he talks about it.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.710 align:middle line:90%
And this is what he says.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.820 align:middle line:84%
I was called one afternoon
to come to the Oval Office.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.010 align:middle line:90%
The president wanted to see me.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.710 align:middle line:84%
We talked about UFO
reports, and what

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.170 align:middle line:84%
might be the meaning
for all these

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.720 align:middle line:84%
rather way-out
reports of sightings,

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.000 align:middle line:90%
and the subject in general.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.480 align:middle line:10%
The president said he hadn't
given much serious thought

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.149 align:middle line:10%
to all these reports,
but at the same time,

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:19.540 align:middle line:10%
he said, if there was any
evidence of a strategic threat

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.320 align:middle line:10%
to the National Security,
the collection and evaluation

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.920 align:middle line:10%
of UFO data by Central
Intelligence warranted

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.910 align:middle line:10%
more intense study and attention
at the highest government

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:31.990 align:middle line:10%
level.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.270 align:middle line:84%
I was directed to
report quarterly

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.150 align:middle line:84%
to the president after
consulting with Central

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.970 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence people
as to whether or not

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.210 align:middle line:84%
any UFO incidents
received by them

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.620 align:middle line:84%
could be considered as having
any strategic threatening

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.390 align:middle line:90%
implications at all.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.770 align:middle line:84%
The report was to be made orally
by me, unless it was considered

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.210 align:middle line:84%
by intelligence to be so serious
or alarming as to warrant

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.240 align:middle line:84%
a more detailed
report in writing.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.000 align:middle line:84%
During the four and a
half years in office

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.090 align:middle line:84%
there, all reports
were made orally.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.300 align:middle line:84%
Nothing of substance considered
credible or threatening

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.815 align:middle line:84%
to the country was ever
received from intelligence.

00:05:14.815 --> 00:05:16.690 align:middle line:84%
So a couple of things
to take away from this.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.940 align:middle line:84%
One, Landry is
trying to downplay

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.920 align:middle line:90%
the significance of all this.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.980 align:middle line:84%
But, A, let's just stick
to the fundamentals here.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.110 align:middle line:84%
First of all, he's giving
quarterly briefings

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.210 align:middle line:84%
on UFOs to President
Harry Truman.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.250 align:middle line:84%
Something that doesn't
appear anywhere

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.770 align:middle line:84%
in Truman's two volumes
of memoirs if you go

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.000 align:middle line:90%
bother to read through that.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.740 align:middle line:84%
No flying saucers
in those books.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.960 align:middle line:84%
No flying saucer references in
any biography of Harry Truman.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.280 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.920 align:middle line:84%
How is it not interesting
that Harry Truman

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.380 align:middle line:84%
is getting UFO briefings every
three months from his Air Force

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.180 align:middle line:90%
liaison?

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.350 align:middle line:90%
You tell me.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.660 align:middle line:90%
That's very interesting.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.990 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, here's what
Landry is saying:

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.400 align:middle line:84%
he's working with
the CIA to analyze

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.310 align:middle line:90%
UFO reports for the president.

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.830 align:middle line:84%
Back in the 40s and
50s, there were claims

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.010 align:middle line:84%
that the CIA was
involved in UFO reports,

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.370 align:middle line:84%
but the CIA denied it for
years and years and years.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.450 align:middle line:84%
But here we have a very, very
strong statement that, oh, yes,

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:20.380 align:middle line:84%
CIA definitely was collecting
UFO reports in 1948.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.920 align:middle line:90%
How about that?

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing that
Landry said that I always

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.080 align:middle line:84%
thought was interesting
is he was like, well,

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.100 align:middle line:84%
these were not important enough
so all the reports were oral.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.590 align:middle line:10%
Well, there was an old
statement by a former director

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.750 align:middle line:10%
of the CIA, Richard Helms.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.760 align:middle line:10%
Helms always said
the best way to keep

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.520 align:middle line:10%
a secret is nothing on paper.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.610 align:middle line:10%
When I look at all of
these factors put together,

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.270 align:middle line:10%
it seems to me that we've
got some really significant

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:47.650 align:middle line:10%
information here.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:51.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, at the time Landry
gave his interview in 1974,

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Harry Truman had
passed on already,

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.820 align:middle line:84%
and he wasn't around
for anyone to follow up

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.180 align:middle line:84%
with any other questions
about his UFO briefings.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.362 align:middle line:90%
That's too bad.

00:07:00.362 --> 00:07:02.570 align:middle line:84%
We surely would have liked
to have gotten a statement

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:04.790 align:middle line:84%
from the former
president on that,

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.370 align:middle line:84%
although I have a feeling he
probably wouldn't have been

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.620 align:middle line:90%
talking very much about it.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.740 align:middle line:84%
One thing that's
very obvious is this

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.280 align:middle line:84%
is not a subject that
presidents are really

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.240 align:middle line:84%
meant to be talking
openly and candidly about.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.250 align:middle line:84%
If presidents were
allowed to talk about it,

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.333 align:middle line:84%
well, then Truman probably
would have mentioned it

00:07:24.333 --> 00:07:25.820 align:middle line:90%
in his memoirs, wouldn't he?

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:26.930 align:middle line:90%
But he didn't.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:31.790 align:middle line:84%
It's a huge omission
in the story of one

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:34.700 align:middle line:84%
of the most important presidents
in recent American history.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Harry Truman was very important
for many of the things

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:42.410 align:middle line:84%
that he did, and it's
just like this missing

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:44.990 align:middle line:90%
part of our history.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:47.000 align:middle line:90%
It's this big gap.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.480 align:middle line:84%
You've got this significant
phenomenon going on.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Everyone at the top
wanted to know about it,

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.990 align:middle line:90%
and no one writes about it.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:01.130 align:middle line:84%
When you consider that Landry
is saying nothing of importance

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:03.990 align:middle line:84%
was said in all those
four and a half years,

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:06.230 align:middle line:84%
I really have to
wonder about that.

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:12.830 align:middle line:84%
UFO researchers have found
numerous incredible sightings

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:17.690 align:middle line:84%
of unknown objects over
very sensitive places

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:22.460 align:middle line:84%
throughout that entire four
and a half year period.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.040 align:middle line:84%
There's no way that Landry
would have just said,

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.110 align:middle line:84%
oh, no, nothing to
this at all, boss.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:28.500 align:middle line:90%
Are you kidding me?

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:36.440 align:middle line:84%
There were sightings in 1948, in
'49 over nuclear installations.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.240 align:middle line:84%
Places like Oak
Ridge, Tennessee,

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.600 align:middle line:84%
or the Hanford Nuclear Plant
in the state of Washington

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.710 align:middle line:84%
in 1950, or many
sightings over Los Alamos

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:47.990 align:middle line:90%
in the late 40s and early 50s.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:53.360 align:middle line:84%
All of which-- all of which
got very serious attention

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:57.860 align:middle line:84%
and concern by local
military commanders,

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:02.840 align:middle line:84%
by military scientists who
had these long, extended

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:08.920 align:middle line:84%
conferences in the case of Los
Alamos over what was going on.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.910 align:middle line:84%
In the case of sightings
over the Hanford Nuclear

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:18.070 align:middle line:84%
facility in summer of
1950, there is a memo

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:22.360 align:middle line:84%
that we now have that said
local commanders are perturbed

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.900 align:middle line:84%
by the implications
of the sighting.

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:29.590 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the sighting of round
objects, numerous round

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:34.480 align:middle line:84%
objects, hanging out over
the Hanford plant in 1950

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.800 align:middle line:84%
while Air Force interceptors
attempted in vain

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.540 align:middle line:84%
to go after these
things and to get them.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:44.590 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't keep up with them
where squadrons were on alert,

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:46.720 align:middle line:84%
anti-aircraft
battalions were alerted.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:52.480 align:middle line:84%
All of this going on in
1950 and in 1951 and in 1952

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.600 align:middle line:84%
where you've got UFOs
over the capital.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.770 align:middle line:84%
A situation in which Landry
spoke to Captain Edward

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:02.650 align:middle line:90%
Ruppelt of Project Blue Book.

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:05.110 align:middle line:10%
And Ruppelt, in
his memoirs, later

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:06.940 align:middle line:10%
said, oh, yes, I
learned that Truman

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.370 align:middle line:10%
was on the line listening
to the conversation.

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:15.430 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot going on here
with Harry Truman and these UFO

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:18.085 align:middle line:84%
reports that he was
getting from Landry.

00:10:18.085 --> 00:10:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's just always
been one of those things

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.980 align:middle line:84%
where I just would love to be
able to get my own little time

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:29.680 align:middle line:84%
machine, go back, and just
listen in on what were probably

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:36.310 align:middle line:84%
some fascinating, oral briefings
made by Colonel Robert B.

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Landry, later General
Robert B. Landry,

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:44.770 align:middle line:84%
to the President of the United
States, Harry S. Truman.

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:48.310 align:middle line:84%
A missing part of our history
that shouldn't be missing.

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:51.660 align:middle line:90%
