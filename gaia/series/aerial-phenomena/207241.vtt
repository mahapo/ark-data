00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.810 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the interesting
subtexts of the UFO subject is

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.590 align:middle line:10%
this idea, this question is, are
there beings who look just like

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.770 align:middle line:10%
us who are walking among us, but
they're not us, they're alien?

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.690 align:middle line:84%
Over the years I've
encountered a number

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.660 align:middle line:84%
of individuals who've told
me personal stories that

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.930 align:middle line:90%
are kind of amazing.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And I can't prove
one way or another

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.310 align:middle line:84%
whether these are true stories
or accurately recalled.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.550 align:middle line:84%
But I will say that
in a few of the cases,

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.310 align:middle line:90%
the people struck me as very--

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.490 align:middle line:84%
extremely meticulous,
reliable, and I

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.500 align:middle line:84%
guess I have to say
that I believe them.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.020 align:middle line:84%
So I'll recount two of
them here and they're

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.750 align:middle line:84%
two that have really
stayed with me.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.650 align:middle line:84%
One I was in Western
Pennsylvania,

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.550 align:middle line:84%
and I was at an event where
a woman and her husband

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.810 align:middle line:90%
approached me.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And this particular woman was
I would say about 60 years old

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.260 align:middle line:84%
at the time, and
she was recounting

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.630 align:middle line:84%
to me something that happened
to her back in the year 1965,

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.210 align:middle line:84%
when she would have been
about 15 years of age.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.430 align:middle line:10%
So back in her part of
Pennsylvania, in her small town

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.190 align:middle line:10%
as she said, everyone
knew everyone.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.810 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a large town.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And everyone knew everyone,
especially in church,

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.770 align:middle line:84%
which is where she was on
this one particular Sunday

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.570 align:middle line:90%
morning with her mother.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.080 align:middle line:84%
So she's in Sunday
Catholic mass,

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.160 align:middle line:84%
and she's sitting down in
a row with her mother, next

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.030 align:middle line:90%
to her mom.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And she said sitting
down in front of her

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.890 align:middle line:84%
was this absolutely, stunningly
beautiful blond couple, male

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.890 align:middle line:90%
and female, wearing the most--

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.120 align:middle line:84%
she said perfect blue
clothing that she

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.680 align:middle line:90%
could have ever imagined.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.729 align:middle line:84%
They sat down and she seems
to have been kind of awestruck

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.250 align:middle line:84%
by them, frankly,
and she's looking

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.050 align:middle line:84%
at their clothing,
which she just

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.140 align:middle line:84%
thought was the most incredible
fabric she had ever seen.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.230 align:middle line:84%
She's really fixated
on all of this.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And, as the mass
is going on, she's

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.240 align:middle line:84%
noticing that this
couple really did not

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.750 align:middle line:84%
fit in with the rest
of the community.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.727 align:middle line:84%
In a Catholic mass, which
I grew up in as well,

00:02:34.727 --> 00:02:36.310 align:middle line:84%
there are certain
things that you just

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.230 align:middle line:84%
know to do-- when to
sit, when to kneel,

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.000 align:middle line:84%
when to make the sign of
the cross, and so forth.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And this couple didn't seem
to have all of those details

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.630 align:middle line:90%
down very well.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And this young woman
is noticing that.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And she's also noticing
something even more bizarre.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.660 align:middle line:84%
She's noticing that
she seems to be

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.090 align:middle line:84%
the only person in this
church that's even really

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.490 align:middle line:90%
aware of this couple.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's striking to
her because this couple,

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.850 align:middle line:84%
as she described it, were
just absolutely movie

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.370 align:middle line:84%
star beautiful good
looks, both of them.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And she just kept thinking,
why does no one else

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.360 align:middle line:90%
notice these two?

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.930 align:middle line:84%
They've never been here before,
they're incredibly beautiful,

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.500 align:middle line:84%
they don't fit in, they're
obviously not from around here,

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.930 align:middle line:90%
and no one's looking at them.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.290 align:middle line:84%
This struck her as a very
bizarre thing indeed.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.340 align:middle line:84%
So as she's thinking about
all of this, the woman

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.280 align:middle line:84%
all these years later
says to me, that's

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.050 align:middle line:90%
when I heard them in my mind.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.550 align:middle line:84%
I asked her, well,
what do you mean?

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, this
is exactly what happened.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.950 align:middle line:84%
I heard them, one of them
thinking to the other,

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.797 align:middle line:84%
well, it appears that we're
fitting in rather well here.

00:03:50.797 --> 00:03:52.380 align:middle line:84%
I said, really,
that's what you heard?

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.700 align:middle line:90%
She said, yes, pretty much.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:59.430 align:middle line:84%
That's what the message was
that I heard in my mind.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And she couldn't tell if it
was from the man or the woman.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.030 align:middle line:84%
But then she heard
a second message,

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.680 align:middle line:84%
which was, yes, except for
the girl behind us who's

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.570 align:middle line:90%
able to hear us.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.600 align:middle line:84%
At that point, this
young girl, probably

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.220 align:middle line:84%
her eyebrows I'm imagining
went up into her forehead,

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.175 align:middle line:84%
she was probably quite
surprised by that.

00:04:20.175 --> 00:04:26.860 align:middle line:84%
That was the last thing that she
heard from them telepathically.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.225 align:middle line:84%
And you might imagine if this
is a real telepathic thing,

00:04:30.225 --> 00:04:31.600 align:middle line:84%
maybe they just
figured out a way

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.110 align:middle line:84%
to shut it down so that she
couldn't hear them anymore.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.990 align:middle line:84%
The mass continues,
it goes on to the end,

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.690 align:middle line:84%
and at the very end of
the services, this couple,

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.850 align:middle line:84%
they're sitting around in
the middle of the church,

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.905 align:middle line:84%
they get up very quickly
and they are gone.

00:04:49.905 --> 00:04:51.280 align:middle line:84%
They're walking
through the crowd

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.160 align:middle line:84%
very quickly to get out of
that church and to leave.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.530 align:middle line:90%
So here's the moment of destiny.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.200 align:middle line:84%
This girl decides, I'm
going to follow them.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And I just love
hearing this from her

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.550 align:middle line:84%
because it was almost
humorous the way she told me.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.580 align:middle line:84%
She gets up and she
starts through the crowd,

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.410 align:middle line:84%
hearing her mother calling
after her, young lady,

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.780 align:middle line:84%
get back here, where do
you think you're going?

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Because, as we all know,
parents are usually

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.660 align:middle line:84%
utterly oblivious to the
drama that their children are

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:21.470 align:middle line:90%
going through.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.420 align:middle line:84%
She's working her way
through the crowd trying

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.230 align:middle line:84%
to catch up to this beautiful
blond, Nordic, supermodel

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.930 align:middle line:84%
couple that she could
hear telepathically.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.020 align:middle line:10%
They go out the front
door and they're

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.320 align:middle line:10%
going across this parking
lot, and she gets out

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.430 align:middle line:10%
and she sees them.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And past the parking lot,
there's a little hill,

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.940 align:middle line:84%
like a grassy hill, and
they go down that hill.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.410 align:middle line:84%
So she hustles as fast as she
can across the parking lot.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:49.430 align:middle line:90%
She's looking for them.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.070 align:middle line:84%
She gets up to the
hill and she sees them.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.140 align:middle line:90%
They've gone down this hill.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And there's like a lower area
and there's a wooded area

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.340 align:middle line:84%
that they're walking
towards, she sees them.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.500 align:middle line:84%
So she immediately goes,
starts going down the hill,

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.360 align:middle line:90%
and then she stops.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.790 align:middle line:84%
She stops dead in her
tracks because she

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.430 align:middle line:90%
sees a third person.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:19.040 align:middle line:84%
At the woods she sees him and
at this point she said to me,

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.540 align:middle line:84%
you remember the character Lurch
from "The Addams Family" TV

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:22.340 align:middle line:90%
show?

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.240 align:middle line:90%
I said, oh yes.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.560 align:middle line:84%
She said, he looked
just like that guy.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:31.080 align:middle line:84%
So he was tall, kind of
scary, kind of creepy looking,

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.440 align:middle line:90%
black suit, like a man in black.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.170 align:middle line:84%
That's really, that
was her description.

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:39.990 align:middle line:84%
He had a black hat,
black suit, apparently

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.320 align:middle line:84%
some kind of white shirt,
and he was very, very tall.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.830 align:middle line:84%
That intimidated her enough
that she just decided

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to stop right here.

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And she watched this
beautiful blond couple walk up

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.550 align:middle line:84%
to the tall man in
black, into the woods.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.120 align:middle line:84%
He turned around, he
walked into the woods,

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.580 align:middle line:84%
and that was the
end of her story.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.080 align:middle line:90%
She never got any closure on it.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.900 align:middle line:90%
There's no UFO sightings here.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.010 align:middle line:90%
There's no landed craft.

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:09.450 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing like that.

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:13.850 align:middle line:84%
There's just this
utterly bizarre story

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.330 align:middle line:84%
of this mysterious
blond couple that

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.420 align:middle line:84%
didn't belong in that
church, but there they

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.460 align:middle line:84%
were with a
telepathic connection

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.310 align:middle line:84%
that she insisted was
real, and which puzzled her

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:26.568 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of her life.

00:07:26.568 --> 00:07:28.110 align:middle line:84%
Now that story is
interesting enough.

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.320 align:middle line:84%
But then I ran into
a husband and wife

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.040 align:middle line:84%
who gave me another story
from the opposite side

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.150 align:middle line:84%
of the country that struck
me as remarkably similar.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.930 align:middle line:84%
In Las Vegas, I met with a
retired United States Air Force

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:46.110 align:middle line:84%
Colonel, a man with
a PhD, and his wife.

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And this particular man had done
a great deal of classified work

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.880 align:middle line:90%
on some very exotic projects.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.090 align:middle line:84%
This is also a man with a
very strong and interesting

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:58.850 align:middle line:84%
background in the
subject of UFOs,

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:02.600 align:middle line:84%
and that includes professionally
in his time in the Air Force.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.420 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting
story here has

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:09.830 align:middle line:84%
to do with a personal encounter
that this man and his wife

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:13.010 align:middle line:84%
and another friend of theirs
had while they were just

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:17.780 align:middle line:84%
having some fun downtime at
a Las Vegas casino hotel.

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.310 align:middle line:90%
Here's the story.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:22.340 align:middle line:84%
The three of them are
out walking around

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:27.950 align:middle line:84%
on the second floor of a
major Las Vegas casino hotel,

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:33.559 align:middle line:84%
and they are walking together,
and the friend of theirs,

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:36.890 align:middle line:84%
who the colonel said
to me was psychic,

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:41.690 align:middle line:84%
some kind of psychic friend of
theirs, grabs him by the arm

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:43.640 align:middle line:90%
and said, stop.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.570 align:middle line:84%
That woman over
there is not human.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And they all look
in the direction

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:52.310 align:middle line:84%
of this very
beautiful, blond woman

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:55.810 align:middle line:84%
who's wearing a very
beautiful, blue outfit.

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:57.710 align:middle line:84%
Now of course, it's
Las Vegas and there's

00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:59.430 align:middle line:84%
a lot of beautiful
people in Las Vegas.

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:03.050 align:middle line:10%
So that by itself is not
particularly unusual.

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:07.430 align:middle line:84%
Even so, the woman and
the man's wife got nervous

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:11.030 align:middle line:84%
and they both went down
an escalator to get away.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Colonel lingered for
a moment and he's

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:15.530 align:middle line:84%
looking in the direction
of this woman, who's

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:17.930 align:middle line:90%
maybe 30 feet away from him.

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And she's turned away
from him, but then she

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.813 align:middle line:90%
turns slightly toward him.

00:09:27.813 --> 00:09:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And at this point
the colonel said

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:33.940 align:middle line:84%
to me, that's when I
heard her in my mind.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And what he heard in
his mind was something

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:41.590 align:middle line:84%
like, go about your business,
there's nothing to see here,

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:44.500 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing here
for you, just leave,

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.150 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:48.560 align:middle line:90%
It was startling to him.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.200 align:middle line:84%
He thought, wait, what
just happened here?

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.160 align:middle line:84%
At that moment, this
woman was joined

00:09:55.160 --> 00:10:01.790 align:middle line:84%
by a equally beautiful man,
blond, in blue clothing,

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:04.280 align:middle line:84%
who comes up to her
and he joins her.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, I keep thinking
to myself, this is Las Vegas.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:10.430 align:middle line:84%
This is what you
see in Las Vegas.

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:13.280 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're acrobats
of some sort, who knows?

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.500 align:middle line:84%
But according to
the colonel, they're

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:19.790 align:middle line:84%
conferring with
each other and then

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:23.090 align:middle line:84%
they begin to walk toward the
escalator where he is standing.

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And he thinks,
great, perfect, I'm

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:27.050 align:middle line:90%
going to talk to these people.

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:28.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to say something.

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:29.270 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
it's going to be,

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:31.070 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to say
something to them.

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And they come up to the
escalator where he is

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.720 align:middle line:84%
and instead of this
colonel saying anything,

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.190 align:middle line:90%
he says absolutely nothing.

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:41.690 align:middle line:84%
They get on the
escalator and they

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:43.790 align:middle line:90%
begin going down the stairs.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:47.810 align:middle line:84%
So he gets behind
them on the escalator

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:50.030 align:middle line:90%
and he's following them.

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:55.165 align:middle line:84%
And he's, again, he is
hearing them in his mind.

00:10:55.165 --> 00:10:56.990 align:middle line:84%
Now at this point he's
telling me the story

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:58.730 align:middle line:84%
and I said, well,
stop right there.

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Like how certain
are you that you're

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:05.840 align:middle line:84%
hearing them in your mind as
opposed to them just talking?

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:06.980 align:middle line:90%
He said, fair question.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.350 align:middle line:90%
He says, I'm completely certain.

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:10.640 align:middle line:90%
I heard them in my mind.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.550 align:middle line:90%
They were not talking.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:14.780 align:middle line:90%
But I heard them thinking.

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And what they were thinking,
according to this colonel,

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:22.280 align:middle line:84%
was, yes, he can hear
us, yes, he's aware,

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.010 align:middle line:84%
no worries about him,
he's not important.

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And the colonel believed
he had heard the thought,

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:32.150 align:middle line:90%
he's not part of the program.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:33.650 align:middle line:84%
So they're going
down the escalator.

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And incidentally, at
this point in the story,

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:39.200 align:middle line:84%
the colonel's wife interjected
and said, oh my goodness, I

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.400 align:middle line:90%
remember this so well.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.220 align:middle line:84%
My friend and I
were so afraid, we

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:47.540 align:middle line:84%
were hiding behind a
slot machine peeking out

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:54.120 align:middle line:84%
like this, looking at them
all coming down the escalator.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.140 align:middle line:84%
So this part of the story ends
where the couple gets down

00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:02.260 align:middle line:84%
to the bottom and instead of
anyone talking to them at all,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.770 align:middle line:84%
they just go about their
way and they're gone.

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:07.660 align:middle line:90%
But the story is not over here.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.500 align:middle line:84%
So the three of them,
the colonel, his wife,

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:14.550 align:middle line:84%
and their friend, are talking
about this experience.

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And the colonel is
saying, I could hear them,

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.090 align:middle line:90%
I could hear them in my mind.

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And so the psychic
friend also turned out

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.220 align:middle line:90%
to be a hypnotherapist.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And this friend says,
well, you know what?

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:30.120 align:middle line:84%
We can try to do maybe
a regression of you

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.650 align:middle line:84%
and maybe you'll
be able to remember

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:35.610 align:middle line:84%
these thoughts and
this whole scenario

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:36.995 align:middle line:90%
even with greater clarity.

00:12:36.995 --> 00:12:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And the colonel says, you
know, that's a good idea.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.300 align:middle line:90%
We'll do that.

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:44.940 align:middle line:84%
So a few days later, he's
at the home of their friend

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:47.670 align:middle line:90%
and she's about to regress him.

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:51.150 align:middle line:84%
Now she apparently lived in
a very quiet neighborhood,

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:54.420 align:middle line:84%
a cul-de-sac where there's not
a lot of traffic or activity

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.690 align:middle line:90%
going on.

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:58.410 align:middle line:84%
So as he's lying
down or sitting down,

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:03.240 align:middle line:84%
he's getting into his kind of
regressed state, as it were.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.880 align:middle line:84%
They begin hearing
construction noise

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:10.440 align:middle line:84%
outside the house, jackhammers
and machinery and motors.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And they go out to look and
they can't see anything.

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:17.310 align:middle line:90%
This happens several times.

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:19.620 align:middle line:84%
Every time she's
about to regress him,

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:23.310 align:middle line:84%
they hear loud
machinery and noise.

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:26.490 align:middle line:90%
And they give up.

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:29.260 align:middle line:84%
The colonel says, look, this
is obviously not going to work.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.580 align:middle line:84%
How about I'll be back
in town in about a month

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:33.960 align:middle line:90%
and we can give it a try then?

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.205 align:middle line:90%
And she says, sounds good.

00:13:35.205 --> 00:13:36.450 align:middle line:90%
Good plan.

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:38.370 align:middle line:84%
A month goes by and
he's about to visit her,

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:42.190 align:middle line:84%
so he calls her on
the phone and says,

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:44.190 align:middle line:84%
hey, I'm going to
be in town soon,

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:47.280 align:middle line:84%
how about we set up an
appointment so that I

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.830 align:middle line:90%
can do a regression with you?

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:52.260 align:middle line:84%
Her response is, what
are you talking about?

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.060 align:middle line:90%
What regression?

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And he says, you
know, from last month

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:59.280 align:middle line:84%
when we had our
experience in the casino

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.980 align:middle line:90%
with that blond couple.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:03.720 align:middle line:84%
Her answer is,
what blond couple?

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.980 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking about?

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And it occurred to the colonel
in talking with his friend

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:13.890 align:middle line:84%
that she had no memory
of that entire encounter.

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:18.420 align:middle line:84%
So in the space of a
month, it is as if someone,

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:21.780 align:middle line:84%
something wiped her memory
of the entire incident.

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And he never did get that
regression from this person.

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:27.930 align:middle line:84%
That's the entire story from
the colonel and his wife.

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:34.380 align:middle line:84%
Now I'll just simply say there
are a number of other stories

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:38.460 align:middle line:84%
that are comparable
to these two.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, in many of
them, the strange couples

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:47.200 align:middle line:84%
or the strange people are not
all blond, Nordic, supermodel

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.000 align:middle line:90%
types.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.380 align:middle line:90%
They're not all like that.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.600 align:middle line:90%
Some are, but others are not.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.450 align:middle line:84%
I had a conversation
with an individual who

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:58.200 align:middle line:84%
lived in the town of
Thunder Bay in Canada

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.050 align:middle line:84%
on the north shore of
Lake Superior, who told me

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:05.370 align:middle line:84%
of a very, very tall
man who she apparently

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:08.550 align:middle line:84%
had a very similar kind
of telepathic encounter

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:12.510 align:middle line:84%
with very briefly
before he walked away.

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And there are a number
of these other stories.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:19.260 align:middle line:10%
The UK author/researcher
Timothy Good

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:23.010 align:middle line:10%
has told of his
apparent encounter

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:26.430 align:middle line:10%
with someone who had this
type of telepathic ability

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:31.560 align:middle line:10%
that he ended up believing
was probably not one of us.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.240 align:middle line:90%
These stories are out there.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.250 align:middle line:84%
There's more than
one would imagine.

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And the question is, when
you get a story coming to you

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:41.460 align:middle line:84%
like that, when I get
a story coming to me

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:43.410 align:middle line:84%
is, what do you do
with a story like that?

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:45.750 align:middle line:90%
What do you do with that?

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:50.130 align:middle line:84%
You can't really--
there's no way

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:53.670 align:middle line:84%
of measuring the truth
or falsity of that other

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:57.360 align:middle line:84%
than just you get the story
and you do your best to assess

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.730 align:middle line:90%
the person telling it to you.

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:04.860 align:middle line:84%
In the case of the woman and the
man from Western Pennsylvania,

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.730 align:middle line:84%
I had a very good
sense about them.

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:09.480 align:middle line:84%
I had a very good
feeling about them,

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:12.000 align:middle line:84%
particularly the woman who
was telling me this story.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.340 align:middle line:84%
They seemed like
good, honest people.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And in the case of the
colonel and his wife,

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:18.000 align:middle line:90%
I would say the same.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.830 align:middle line:84%
These were good people who
are intelligent and honest.

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's all that
you have to go on.
