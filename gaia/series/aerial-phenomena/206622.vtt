00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.550 align:middle line:10%
>> The phenomenon of UFOs in
all likelihood goes way back

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.090 align:middle line:10%
in our history.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.550 align:middle line:10%
The thing is, we
don't really know

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.210 align:middle line:10%
exactly what to make of a
lot of those early stories,

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.210 align:middle line:10%
because they're stories.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.477 align:middle line:90%
They're not reports.

00:00:24.477 --> 00:00:26.060 align:middle line:84%
They come down to
us through the ages.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.320 align:middle line:90%
And they're very interesting.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.570 align:middle line:84%
But we start getting reports,
like, detailed analytical

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:39.200 align:middle line:84%
observations by very particular,
very meticulous people,

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.050 align:middle line:84%
in many cases, starting
around the 1940s.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.970 align:middle line:90%
It started to get our attention.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.460 align:middle line:84%
When you really step back and
think about this whole thing,

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.530 align:middle line:84%
you'd have to ask
yourself, why is there even

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.140 align:middle line:90%
secrecy about this phenomenon?

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.220 align:middle line:90%
Like, what's the big deal?

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.080 align:middle line:10%
Why do the powers that be,
the governments of the world,

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.970 align:middle line:10%
the United States
government in particular,

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.080 align:middle line:10%
why do they feel
the need to hide

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.675 align:middle line:10%
this apparent reality, this
extraordinary thing, whatever

00:01:08.675 --> 00:01:11.330 align:middle line:10%
it represents,
these objects that

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.030 align:middle line:10%
have been observed
to travel at speeds

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.700 align:middle line:10%
that we don't really
understand how they can

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.400 align:middle line:10%
go the speeds that they go--
we don't understand how they

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.390 align:middle line:10%
can move the way they do, stop
on a dime, take off instantly.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.760 align:middle line:90%
Why the secrecy?

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.000 align:middle line:84%
Is it that we just
can't handle the truth?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, I want to
rewind the clock.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.770 align:middle line:10%
And I want to try to recreate
why I think UFO secrecy began

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.647 align:middle line:10%
and why it has maintained
itself over these many years.

00:01:39.647 --> 00:01:41.480 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about it,
the most common thing

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.330 align:middle line:84%
that you often hear is, hey,
the public can handle it.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.320 align:middle line:90%
I can handle it.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.190 align:middle line:90%
We can take it.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.870 align:middle line:90%
We can take this truth.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.060 align:middle line:90%
And that's probably true.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.310 align:middle line:90%
Like, you can handle it.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And maybe most of your
relatives and family and friends

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.360 align:middle line:90%
can handle it too.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.010 align:middle line:90%
But what else is going on here?

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.170 align:middle line:90%
So if you go back in time--

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.130 align:middle line:90%
go back to, say, 1947.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And you pretend that you are the
President of the United States.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.390 align:middle line:90%
And your name is Harry Truman.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And World War II had
just recently ended.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.880 align:middle line:84%
The entire world is
basically lying on its back,

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.560 align:middle line:84%
millions of people
homeless, millions of people

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.210 align:middle line:84%
going hungry, a lot of
global tension happening.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.930 align:middle line:84%
It was a very, very strange
time in human history.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly you become aware
through your top generals,

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.510 align:middle line:84%
through your top scientists,
that this phenomenon, this

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.740 align:middle line:84%
isn't just a temporary thing
that some people noticed

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.620 align:middle line:84%
during the Second World War,
but that it was actually real.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And that-- let's talk
about Roswell for a second.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.176 align:middle line:84%
What if something like
Roswell really did happen?

00:02:58.176 --> 00:02:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And I say, what
if, but I believe

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.760 align:middle line:84%
Roswell did happen in the
sense that an exotic non-human

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.770 align:middle line:84%
technology was acquired in the
deserts of New Mexico in 1947.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're the
president and this information

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.280 align:middle line:84%
is brought to you,
you have a general

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.340 align:middle line:84%
that says, sir, we have
recovered technology

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.360 align:middle line:84%
that we don't believe is from
our civilization, and oh yes,

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.510 align:middle line:90%
a couple of bodies too--

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.670 align:middle line:84%
like, that's a
heavy thing to take.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.120 align:middle line:90%
And what do you do with it?

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.850 align:middle line:90%
Do you tell the world?

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.190 align:middle line:90%
That's the question.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think the instinct
for most of us would be,

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.310 align:middle line:84%
yes, absolutely we're
going to tell the world.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it was Truman's
instinct too initially.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.860 align:middle line:84%
But what if he had generals
and other high-level people

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.270 align:middle line:84%
that said, no, no,
no, no, bad idea.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And well, why is
this a bad idea?

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's a bad idea, sir,
because, A, we don't know

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.260 align:middle line:90%
who these other beings are.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.050 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how bad
public panic might be.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.570 align:middle line:84%
We don't understand this
technology which, by the way,

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.790 align:middle line:90%
we've recovered.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And do we really want
to share this technology

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.380 align:middle line:90%
with the rest of the world?

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.380 align:middle line:10%
To put some perspective
on this, back in 1947,

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.390 align:middle line:10%
the United States still had a
monopoly of atomic technology.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.180 align:middle line:84%
No other country in the
world had nuclear bombs, only

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.110 align:middle line:90%
the United States.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And that was a big
deal back then.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.680 align:middle line:84%
The United Nations
wanted the United States

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.070 align:middle line:84%
to have all of that
nuclear information

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.470 align:middle line:90%
under international control.

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And America's answer
was, no, thank you.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.000 align:middle line:90%
We'll keep this to ourselves.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.527 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:04:39.527 --> 00:04:41.610 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want the
Russians to get access to it.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.950 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want anyone
else to get access to this.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.770 align:middle line:84%
So if America did not want
to share atomic technology,

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.370 align:middle line:84%
why on Earth would they want
to share something as exotic

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.110 align:middle line:90%
as alien technology?

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is, there
is no reason whatsoever.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.660 align:middle line:84%
I think what happened
was Harry Truman,

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.660 align:middle line:84%
on the advice of his
top people, said,

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.670 align:middle line:90%
all right, let's review this.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.440 align:middle line:90%
And we'll have our team.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be in
charge of the media.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.250 align:middle line:84%
You'll be in charge of
talking to the scientists

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.180 align:middle line:90%
and understanding this.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.847 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be in
charge of understanding

00:05:13.847 --> 00:05:17.810 align:middle line:84%
the military implications of
this, and so on and so on.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.670 align:middle line:10%
And maybe after a
certain period of time,

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.335 align:middle line:10%
we will review this and
decide if and when we're

00:05:22.335 --> 00:05:23.960 align:middle line:10%
going to let the
world know about this,

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.580 align:middle line:10%
but that if, that
when never happened.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And it never happened
for a number of reasons.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.770 align:middle line:84%
Reason number one is it's
entirely likely that they never

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.160 align:middle line:84%
got to a point where
they really understood

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.300 align:middle line:84%
what the intention of
these other beings was.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.030 align:middle line:90%
I mean, maybe they did.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.170 align:middle line:84%
But there is a really good
chance that they didn't.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you do not know what
these other beings are about,

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.453 align:middle line:84%
how do you possibly
think you're going

00:05:54.453 --> 00:05:56.870 align:middle line:84%
to tell the world about it
when you don't have any answers

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.760 align:middle line:90%
yourself?

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.340 align:middle line:84%
But there is something even
more important than this.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.770 align:middle line:84%
Whatever these objects are using
to go from point A to point B,

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:12.500 align:middle line:84%
to go from here to here
in the snap of a finger,

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.690 align:middle line:84%
it probably wouldn't
be petroleum.

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.540 align:middle line:84%
It probably wouldn't be
high-octane gasoline.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.420 align:middle line:84%
In all likelihood,
the energy source

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.750 align:middle line:84%
and the system of propulsion
would be radically

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.870 align:middle line:84%
beyond anything that
we on Planet Earth

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.780 align:middle line:84%
were using in the
1940s or even today.

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is the true
secret of the UFO phenomenon

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:42.440 align:middle line:84%
implies a revolution in our
global energy infrastructure.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And to change that as radically
as this phenomenon would

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.490 align:middle line:84%
very likely change it, that's
a big thing to consider.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:54.230 align:middle line:84%
In terms of US power,
well, all of US power,

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.560 align:middle line:84%
all of global power
was based on oil.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:02.600 align:middle line:84%
And it was based on controlling
the locations of that oil

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:08.660 align:middle line:84%
to extract that oil, to sell
that oil for a lot of money.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:15.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's entirely possible that
this phenomenon of these flying

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:20.850 align:middle line:84%
saucers, these UFOs, they might
not need that type of a system.

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And once that gets out,
you are transforming

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.830 align:middle line:90%
the entire global system.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And that might be
great for you and me,

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:33.650 align:middle line:84%
but it's very disruptive
for a power elite that,

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:37.100 align:middle line:84%
particularly in the 1940s, and
right up until our own day,

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.230 align:middle line:84%
wants to control
that source of power.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:41.580 align:middle line:90%
So that would be a problem.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And there is other problems
that President Harry Truman

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:47.330 align:middle line:84%
might have had with telling
the world about these UFOs.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:51.030 align:middle line:84%
For example, can you
weaponize the technology?

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:54.890 align:middle line:84%
If you are studying this
exotic technology that

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:58.010 align:middle line:84%
seems to be eons and eons
ahead of us, but could

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:01.010 align:middle line:84%
it nevertheless give
you some good ideas

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:03.380 align:middle line:90%
on new forms of weaponry--

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:04.370 align:middle line:90%
entirely possible.

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And would you want
to trust the rest

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:07.220 align:middle line:90%
of the nations of the world?

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.470 align:middle line:84%
Would you want to trust the
other nations of the world

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:13.340 align:middle line:84%
not to develop weapons
technology based on this?

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:14.188 align:middle line:90%
No, you wouldn't.

00:08:14.188 --> 00:08:15.980 align:middle line:84%
And there is a lot of
things going on here.

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And you know back
in 1947, '48, '49,

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.570 align:middle line:84%
it just seemed like
there was enough oil

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:26.390 align:middle line:84%
to last for centuries
and centuries

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:29.180 align:middle line:84%
based on production
and consumption

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.240 align:middle line:90%
levels of that time.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they just
thought, no big deal.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:33.860 align:middle line:90%
We don't need to rock the boat.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.429 align:middle line:90%
Let's keep this secret.

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:38.620 align:middle line:90%
Let's work this secret.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And here is the
thing with secrecy.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.539 align:middle line:90%
It develops its own momentum.

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:45.820 align:middle line:90%
It develops its own profit.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:49.280 align:middle line:84%
It develops its
own reason to be.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And what happened in the case
of the secrecy of the UFO

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:56.870 align:middle line:84%
phenomenon is, I
believe, it became not

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.570 align:middle line:84%
simply deeply embedded
within the government

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:02.500 align:middle line:84%
system of the United
States black budget world,

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.700 align:middle line:84%
but it became privatized,
that the privatization,

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:12.090 align:middle line:84%
the deep, deep, deep
hiding of that secret

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:14.850 align:middle line:84%
has gotten to a point
now in our world where

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:18.110 align:middle line:84%
this is going to be a very
difficult one to get out.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:20.610 align:middle line:84%
It will require changing laws
not only in the United States,

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:22.290 align:middle line:84%
but in many other
nations if we're going

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:23.910 align:middle line:90%
to get to the bottom of this.

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:28.770 align:middle line:84%
UFO secrecy matters
because, fundamentally, it's

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:33.150 align:middle line:84%
a betrayal of any kind
of democratic system

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.580 align:middle line:90%
of government.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:39.480 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about an
important phenomenon that

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:45.300 align:middle line:84%
has revolutionary implications
that you and I are

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.340 align:middle line:90%
denied access to.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.440 align:middle line:84%
It's been going for
over 70 years like this

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.100 align:middle line:90%
that we know of.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:55.110 align:middle line:84%
We know that there is at least
70 years plus of a secrecy

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:58.830 align:middle line:84%
infrastructure that
exists to manage,

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:02.700 align:middle line:84%
to control this
phenomenon, the information

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:06.420 align:middle line:84%
about this phenomenon,
to keep it to themselves.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, we just
go about our lives.

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.760 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me that we
can do better than this.

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.000 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me that this
is a fundamental betrayal

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.665 align:middle line:84%
of everything that free
people like to tell themselves

00:10:17.665 --> 00:10:20.040 align:middle line:84%
about their government, that
the governments are supposed

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.800 align:middle line:90%
to respond to us, not otherwise.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.300 align:middle line:84%
The government are supposed
to be responsible to us.

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And when they're not responsible
to us, that's a problem.

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:32.640 align:middle line:10%
This is not to say that
governments don't have a right

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.770 align:middle line:10%
to manage certain
information for the safety

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.190 align:middle line:10%
and for the public good.

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:39.720 align:middle line:10%
But when you go for
70 years with a secret

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:44.300 align:middle line:10%
of such profound implications,
and to the extent

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.450 align:middle line:10%
that we are not even
able to talk about this

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:50.720 align:middle line:10%
in a public manner with
any kind of intelligence,

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.980 align:middle line:10%
that's a problem.

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's a problem
because someone is making

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:57.320 align:middle line:90%
money off of this secret.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:00.760 align:middle line:84%
It's a problem because
in all likelihood,

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:04.230 align:middle line:84%
the public is paying a lot
of money to fund this secret.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.580 align:middle line:90%
What do I mean by that?

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.460 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.960 align:middle line:84%
A number of years ago, I had a
very interesting conversation

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.275 align:middle line:84%
with a scientist who had
some very high clearances.

00:11:15.275 --> 00:11:16.150 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's funny.

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:19.000 align:middle line:84%
In a lot of those
circles, those individuals

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.150 align:middle line:84%
don't have a problem talking
about the UFO reality.

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:24.280 align:middle line:84%
Get them in public,
it's a little different.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:28.300 align:middle line:84%
But privately, no, they'll
talk about it all you want.

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.070 align:middle line:84%
This one particular
scientist was talking

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:33.160 align:middle line:90%
about the cost of secrecy.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.380 align:middle line:10%
And he just let loose
a very casual statement

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:40.510 align:middle line:10%
which was that the
security of maintaining

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:44.800 align:middle line:10%
the secrecy of the UFO
problem was seven to eight

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.190 align:middle line:10%
times that of the scientific
research and development.

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And he implied it
was a lot of money.

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:51.460 align:middle line:90%
How much money?

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:55.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's a really
good question to ask.

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:58.510 align:middle line:84%
But if you're going to
control the media, if you're

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:02.560 align:middle line:84%
going to create secret
scientific infrastructure

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.410 align:middle line:84%
to study this highly
exotic phenomenon,

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:08.500 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to have all
kinds of security involved

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.140 align:middle line:84%
in this, this could be
a lot of money, indeed.

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.870 align:middle line:90%
And we are paying for that.

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:16.060 align:middle line:84%
We deserve to find
out just what we're

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:17.860 align:middle line:90%
paying for, in my opinion.

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And the last thing I suppose
I'll say here is, for how long

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:25.390 align:middle line:84%
are we going to be spoon fed
fake information like we're

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:27.130 align:middle line:90%
little children?

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:32.380 align:middle line:84%
How long are we going to just
sit back and accept the bland

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:35.770 align:middle line:84%
statement of, oh well, maybe
there is something out there.

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:39.460 align:middle line:84%
No evidence that there
is, but who knows?

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.470 align:middle line:90%
How long is that going to go on?

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:44.770 align:middle line:84%
How long are we
just going to say,

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:48.760 align:middle line:84%
we'll let you decide for
us what the truth is?

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:53.440 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of researchers
out there right now who

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.500 align:middle line:84%
are digging deep into this,
but you wouldn't know it

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.840 align:middle line:84%
if you were just to
read your newspapers,

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:05.015 align:middle line:84%
catch your news online, all
manicured now, all curated.

00:13:05.015 --> 00:13:06.640 align:middle line:84%
I think what we need
to understand here

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.920 align:middle line:84%
with UFO secrecy is
that it's not about you.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.850 align:middle line:84%
It's about the entire
infrastructure of the world.

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:18.160 align:middle line:84%
UFO secrecy, this isn't
being kept because the powers

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.930 align:middle line:84%
that be are afraid
of you running

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:23.350 align:middle line:84%
around in panic thinking,
oh my God, it's aliens.

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:25.460 align:middle line:84%
No, I don't think
that's the concern.

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:27.940 align:middle line:84%
The concern is the
implications of what

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:34.000 align:middle line:84%
happens once this secrecy
ends, once it ends,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.723 align:middle line:84%
especially the longer
this secrecy has gone now.

00:13:36.723 --> 00:13:38.890 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's one thing
to end it after five years.

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:40.930 align:middle line:84%
We've been going for an
entire human lifetime.

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:46.117 align:middle line:84%
And the implications for
this are really profound.

00:13:46.117 --> 00:13:47.950 align:middle line:84%
Once this comes out--
and it will come out--

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:51.160 align:middle line:84%
there will be a number of very
difficult follow-up questions.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.112 align:middle line:84%
One will be, who are
these other beings?

00:13:54.112 --> 00:13:55.570 align:middle line:84%
Do we have anything
to worry about?

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:57.400 align:middle line:84%
Another is going to
be, how have you kept

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.620 align:middle line:90%
this secret for all this time?

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:02.560 align:middle line:10%
And that question,
that's the question

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.010 align:middle line:10%
that's going to cause
a lot of concern

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:07.510 align:middle line:10%
to those people who have had
this secret, because it's going

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:13.090 align:middle line:10%
to rip open an entire
infrastructure of illegal,

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:17.080 align:middle line:10%
and I would probably say,
criminal levels of secrecy

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.000 align:middle line:10%
that's been going
very, very long.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.790 align:middle line:84%
I think those people
who've got this secret, who

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:27.097 align:middle line:84%
know it the best, do not
ever want this to come out.

00:14:27.097 --> 00:14:29.680 align:middle line:84%
The good news for us is, they're
not the only players involved

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:30.680 align:middle line:90%
in this.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.490 align:middle line:84%
There is a lot of factors
going on, the main one being,

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:35.140 align:middle line:84%
we are in a world
right now that's

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:39.850 align:middle line:84%
moving very fast, pedal to
the metal, into the future.

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And no one, no one
person, no one group

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.240 align:middle line:90%
is able to control that process.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.010 align:middle line:90%
This is happening.

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:49.240 align:middle line:90%
So buckle up.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.600 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be a wild ride.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:56.000 align:middle line:90%
