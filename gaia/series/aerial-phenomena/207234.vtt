00:00:11.784 --> 00:00:15.430 align:middle line:10%
- If you want evidence
that our highest

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.060 align:middle line:10%
level political
leadership is locked out

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.050 align:middle line:10%
of looking into the
UFO UAP reality,

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.470 align:middle line:10%
look no further than the story
of US Senator Barry Goldwater.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.920 align:middle line:10%
Barry Goldwater was a five-term
United States Senator.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.920 align:middle line:10%
He once had the Republican
nomination for president.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.580 align:middle line:84%
He ran in 1964
for the presidency

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.990 align:middle line:90%
against Lyndon Johnson.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.310 align:middle line:90%
He lost.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.375 align:middle line:10%
He was an Air Force
general reservist.

00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:46.750 align:middle line:10%
He actually had
attained the rank

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.230 align:middle line:10%
of Major General in the United
States Air Force reserves.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.410 align:middle line:10%
He was inducted into the
National Aviation Hall of Fame,

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.240 align:middle line:10%
and he was really close friends
with one of the top Air Force

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.810 align:middle line:10%
legends of all time, that
is, Air Force General Curtis

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.629 align:middle line:10%
LeMay, who was Chief of
Staff of the US Air Force,

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.000 align:middle line:10%
chomping those
cigars all the way.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.030 align:middle line:10%
Goldwater was about as
military friendly a politician

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.220 align:middle line:10%
as you could ask for.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.870 align:middle line:90%
He loved the military.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.370 align:middle line:90%
The military loved him.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.340 align:middle line:84%
And he was extremely
knowledgeable

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.240 align:middle line:84%
about all aspects of military
technology and particularly

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.770 align:middle line:90%
aviation technology.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.510 align:middle line:84%
He was a very knowledgeable
man in that regard.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.610 align:middle line:10%
So that makes this encounter
he had all the more

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.380 align:middle line:10%
interesting in my view.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And Goldwater, like
anyone who walked

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.010 align:middle line:84%
in the circles of the
military and in the top realms

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.030 align:middle line:84%
of political power, he
became aware of UFO stories.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.730 align:middle line:84%
He was quite interested
in them, knew about them.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And he had heard
all of the rumors

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.620 align:middle line:84%
about alien bodies being taken
to Wright-Patterson Air Force

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.420 align:middle line:90%
Base.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.720 align:middle line:84%
That's the headquarters of
the United States Air Force.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.010 align:middle line:84%
He had heard rumors about
alien disks being taken

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.040 align:middle line:90%
to Wright-Pat and all of this.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.980 align:middle line:10%
So on one occasion, he brings
this matter up with his friend

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.830 align:middle line:10%
Curtis LeMay, the general.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that
Goldwater actually talked

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.990 align:middle line:90%
about on a number of occasions.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.920 align:middle line:84%
I think the
government does know.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.560 align:middle line:84%
I can't back that
up, but I think

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.460 align:middle line:84%
that Wright-Patterson
Field, if you

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.070 align:middle line:84%
could get into
certain places, you'd

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.500 align:middle line:84%
find out what the Air
Force and the government

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.360 align:middle line:90%
knows about UFOs.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.400 align:middle line:90%
Reportedly, a spaceship landed.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.500 align:middle line:90%
It was all hushed up, quieted.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And nobody ever-- have never
heard about much of it.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.890 align:middle line:84%
I called Curtis LeMay,
and I said, "General,

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.570 align:middle line:84%
I know we have a room at
Wright-Patterson where

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.300 align:middle line:90%
you put all this secret stuff.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.580 align:middle line:90%
Can I go in there?"

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.795 align:middle line:84%
I've never heard him get mad,
but he got madder than hell

00:03:08.795 --> 00:03:11.990 align:middle line:84%
at me, cussed me out,
and said, "Don't ever

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.280 align:middle line:90%
ask me that question again."

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
was this was the one

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.620 align:middle line:84%
time in their long,
long friendship

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.810 align:middle line:84%
that Goldwater said that he
was cussed out by his friend.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And what it came down to was
that Goldwater said, "Can you

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.930 align:middle line:84%
ever perhaps get me access
to the so-called Blue Room

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.430 align:middle line:84%
at Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base?"

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And the Blue Room,
this was the room

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.000 align:middle line:84%
where it was rumored that alien
bodies and technology were

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.800 align:middle line:90%
kept.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And this was the one time in
which Lemay yelled at him,

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:55.620 align:middle line:84%
swore at him, and said, "Don't
ever ask me that again."

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.090 align:middle line:90%
And that was the end of that.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.070 align:middle line:84%
Now Goldwater wrote letters
about this in 1975, 1979,

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.660 align:middle line:84%
and then another one in 1981,
all to various constituents

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.810 align:middle line:84%
who had inquired
with him about UFOs.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.850 align:middle line:90%
And you know, he just--

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.100 align:middle line:90%
he'd had enough after a while.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.730 align:middle line:84%
You know, his last letter on
the subject to a constituent

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.800 align:middle line:84%
was, in effect,
look, you know, we've

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.410 align:middle line:84%
gone as far as we're
going to get on this.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.500 align:middle line:10%
The fact is, even though
some information has come out

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.560 align:middle line:10%
by now through the Freedom
of Information Act,

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.960 align:middle line:10%
he said there's
still a lot of this

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.230 align:middle line:10%
that's never going to come out.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:36.810 align:middle line:90%
That's Goldwater on this.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.060 align:middle line:84%
Now you know, I asked myself, if
you have someone of this level

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.040 align:middle line:84%
of stature who clearly knew
enough to ask the right

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.070 align:middle line:84%
questions, who had
heard the rumors,

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:55.410 align:middle line:84%
but as one of the leading
members of the elected

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.720 align:middle line:84%
representatives of government--
and he was still unable even

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.350 align:middle line:84%
to get an inch forward
on this matter,

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.220 align:middle line:84%
stopped dead in his tracks by
a good friend of his, no less--

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.475 align:middle line:84%
then how is it that any
elected public official

00:05:11.475 --> 00:05:15.420 align:middle line:84%
is going to get any information
on the matter of UFOs at all?

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.330 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to deny
this to Barry Goldwater,

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.120 align:middle line:84%
you're pretty much denying
this to all other elected

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.290 align:middle line:90%
representatives.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.810 align:middle line:84%
Except maybe, what,
the president?

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:30.210 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a couple of people
around the president, perhaps?

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.620 align:middle line:84%
We don't even know if
that's the case anymore.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.070 align:middle line:10%
But certainly, leading
members of Congress

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.490 align:middle line:10%
and the Senate you
would think should

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.630 align:middle line:10%
be briefed on a matter of
such a level of importance

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.010 align:middle line:10%
to not only national security
but, my goodness, to the world.

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And here's Barry Goldwater,
just totally locked out.

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.760 align:middle line:84%
Now there's a very
interesting follow up

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.150 align:middle line:84%
to this story on
LeMay's side of it.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.770 align:middle line:84%
A few years ago, I met
a ham radio aficionado.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.300 align:middle line:90%
We'll call him Jim.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.390 align:middle line:84%
I have his actual
information available,

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.492 align:middle line:84%
but he wants to
remain anonymous.

00:06:08.492 --> 00:06:10.200 align:middle line:84%
This gentleman told
me about an encounter

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.970 align:middle line:84%
he had with Curtis LeMay
over ham radio airwaves back

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.270 align:middle line:90%
in October 1987.

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.940 align:middle line:90%
Lemay lived until 1990.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.130 align:middle line:84%
He was in Newport
Beach, California.

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.370 align:middle line:84%
So this gentleman Jim
struck up a conversation

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.880 align:middle line:84%
with the person who
turned out to be Lemay.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.130 align:middle line:84%
They were just talking
about their mutual interest

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.410 align:middle line:90%
in aircraft.

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And then he learned
that they had

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.110 align:middle line:84%
a mutual interest in a
particular old jazz group

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.970 align:middle line:90%
called Tex Beneke.

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And they kind of got
along on the ham airwaves.

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.400 align:middle line:84%
He heard the operator refer
to this person as "General,"

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.620 align:middle line:84%
and that prompted him
to look up the call

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.540 align:middle line:90%
sign of this individual.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And he discovered, yes, this
was General Curtis E LeMay.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.330 align:middle line:84%
So they had a few
other conversations

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.700 align:middle line:90%
over the ham airwaves--

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.860 align:middle line:90%
very friendly, very cordial.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And this person Jim decided
to drive to Newport Beach

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:16.050 align:middle line:84%
to LeMay's house to knock
on his door and say hello.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.920 align:middle line:90%
Kind of a bold move.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.920 align:middle line:90%
He goes, he does it.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.270 align:middle line:90%
There's a security gate.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:24.180 align:middle line:90%
He rings the bell there.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.250 align:middle line:84%
He speaks into an
intercom and says

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:31.170 align:middle line:84%
that he is LeMay's friend
over the ham airwaves.

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:36.720 align:middle line:84%
LeMay's wife named Helen says
something like, "Oh, Curt, this

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.080 align:middle line:84%
is your friend from
the ham radio."

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.760 align:middle line:90%
He's let in.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:46.830 align:middle line:84%
He describes in LeMay's house
a four-foot bust of the general

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:48.910 align:middle line:90%
was apparently right there.

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.610 align:middle line:90%
And he's greeted by Lemay.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:52.410 align:middle line:90%
And they chat.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:53.210 align:middle line:90%
It's very friendly.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:54.870 align:middle line:90%
It's very cordial.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:56.520 align:middle line:90%
They talk about aircraft.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.310 align:middle line:90%
They talk about Tex Beneke.

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And then while they're sitting
on the couch, this person Jim

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:09.090 align:middle line:84%
says, "General, can I ask
you about the 1947 crash

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:12.210 align:middle line:84%
of an object at
Roswell, New Mexico?

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:13.710 align:middle line:90%
Was that a UFO?

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:15.750 align:middle line:90%
Did that happen?"

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And according to Jim, Lemay
didn't say a word except to nod

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:25.740 align:middle line:84%
up and down, very,
very definitely.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.360 align:middle line:90%
It's all he would do.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.690 align:middle line:90%
Meanwhile, the phone rang.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:34.440 align:middle line:10%
And this was another general
named Butch Griswold,

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.330 align:middle line:10%
who was a good friend of Lemay.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.000 align:middle line:10%
And Griswold also was
a ham radio operator.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.090 align:middle line:10%
And Griswold also
was someone who

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:45.930 align:middle line:10%
was aware of this
person Jim, at least

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:47.850 align:middle line:10%
through their
previous conversation.

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And Jim overhears Helen
talking on the phone,

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.730 align:middle line:84%
saying, "Butch, you would
not believe what Curt

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:55.910 align:middle line:90%
is talking about right now."

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.160 align:middle line:84%
Lemay then was asked
to take the phone

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.230 align:middle line:90%
call to speak to Griswold.

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:02.325 align:middle line:84%
At that time, Jim
takes his leave,

00:09:02.325 --> 00:09:03.450 align:middle line:90%
says, "Thank you very much.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:04.700 align:middle line:90%
It was very nice meeting you."

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.190 align:middle line:90%
And he starts driving home.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:10.700 align:middle line:90%
His head is just swimming.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:15.740 align:middle line:84%
He gets on to the ham radio
and hears Butch Griswold's call

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:20.600 align:middle line:84%
sign say, "Well, we figured
out who the mystery guest was."

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:27.320 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, he was none too pleased
that this strange, completely

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.440 align:middle line:84%
anonymous person was able
to get into LeMay's house

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:34.670 align:middle line:84%
and ask questions about
Roswell of all things.

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:37.212 align:middle line:84%
Now you hear a story like this,
and you ask yourself, well,

00:09:37.212 --> 00:09:38.420 align:middle line:90%
should I believe this or not?

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.700 align:middle line:10%
And I totally get that.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:44.180 align:middle line:10%
For my part, meeting with this
person, knowing who he is,

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:48.080 align:middle line:10%
seeing his identification,
seeing his ham radio license,

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.760 align:middle line:10%
I have no problem believing him.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.240 align:middle line:84%
I think he's telling
me the truth.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.490 align:middle line:90%
And now here I am telling you.

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And you just have to decide,
do I believe this or not.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:00.440 align:middle line:84%
But when I look at
LeMay's situation in 1987,

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.890 align:middle line:84%
I see a man toward
the end of his life

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:06.290 align:middle line:84%
maybe caught a little
off guard, maybe

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:10.400 align:middle line:84%
not expecting to talk about
these matters of UFOs,

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:14.307 align:middle line:84%
and aliens, and so on, and
maybe thinking on this occasion,

00:10:14.307 --> 00:10:15.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to just
make this admission.

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm just going to say yes.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.810 align:middle line:84%
You know, when people get
toward the end of their lives,

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:23.330 align:middle line:84%
maybe different thought
processes take over.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.430 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they start thinking
a little differently

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:26.960 align:middle line:90%
about certain matters.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:32.330 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the secrecy gets a little
bit loosened from time to time.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And I don't see it as
impossible that this

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:40.970 align:middle line:84%
was the case with Curtis LeMay
on this one occasion in 1987,

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:43.490 align:middle line:84%
toward the later
years of his life,

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:46.190 align:middle line:84%
where he let his guard
down just a little bit

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:51.080 align:middle line:84%
to a very friendly stranger
on the matter of UFOs.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.600 align:middle line:90%
The thing about UFO secrecy--

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.630 align:middle line:84%
and really, you can say this
about secrecy in general,

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:57.980 align:middle line:90%
I would think--

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.560 align:middle line:90%
is it's never fully complete.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.360 align:middle line:90%
It never can be fully complete.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.430 align:middle line:90%
There are always leaks.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:06.350 align:middle line:90%
There are always openings.

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:11.330 align:middle line:84%
It's like you take a wall,
and to cover what's on it,

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:12.980 align:middle line:90%
you take black paint.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And you just dump that
paint, throw it on the wall

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.180 align:middle line:90%
to cover everything up.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.160 align:middle line:84%
But there's little areas
that the paint misses.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And those are the areas that
UFO researchers are looking at

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:27.627 align:middle line:84%
to try to figure out clues
of what is under that paint.

00:11:27.627 --> 00:11:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And every now and then, you
get a statement from someone

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.110 align:middle line:84%
like Barry Goldwater or
someone like Curtis LeMay.

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:36.680 align:middle line:84%
That allows us to scratch a
little bit of that paint off,

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.020 align:middle line:84%
to give us a little
bit more of what's

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:42.090 align:middle line:84%
behind so that the more
and more we do this,

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:45.590 align:middle line:84%
the more of a picture emerges
and is a picture, frankly,

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:50.540 align:middle line:84%
in which the official
political leadership is just

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:56.790 align:middle line:84%
locked out of any kind of proper
oversight over this issue.

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And some people might say,
well that's for the best

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:01.580 align:middle line:84%
because who trusts our
politicians anyway.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.680 align:middle line:84%
But I would say
it's a real problem.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.410 align:middle line:84%
Look, as bad as the
politicians are--

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:08.220 align:middle line:84%
and we all know
they're pretty bad--

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:10.400 align:middle line:84%
they still are supposed
to belong to us.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.780 align:middle line:90%
We're the ones who elect them.

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And by law, they are supposed
to be responsible to us.

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:18.500 align:middle line:84%
It's our job as citizens
of whatever country

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.950 align:middle line:84%
we live in to make sure that the
people that we elect to office

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:25.310 align:middle line:84%
are beholden to us
and not the reverse.

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And when they don't get
access to information

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:32.270 align:middle line:84%
that is necessary for the
proper functioning of any kind

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:36.360 align:middle line:84%
of governing body or any kind of
society, then we got a problem.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:40.640 align:middle line:84%
So look, they say democracy is
the worst form of government

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.950 align:middle line:84%
except for every other
form of government.

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And democracy is only
going to work if we

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.200 align:middle line:90%
are willing to work for it.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not easy, but
that's the responsibility

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:51.690 align:middle line:90%
of living in a free society.

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:52.820 align:middle line:90%
You've got to do the work.

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's our job to make sure
that politicians actually

00:12:56.150 --> 00:13:00.080 align:middle line:84%
have the information available
so that we citizens can make

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.300 align:middle line:84%
the proper decisions
about what to do

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:04.610 align:middle line:90%
and how to govern our society.

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:06.050 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's all about.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:07.790 align:middle line:84%
The fact that this
isn't happening

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:09.650 align:middle line:84%
is a tragedy that
we need to correct.

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:12.400 align:middle line:90%
