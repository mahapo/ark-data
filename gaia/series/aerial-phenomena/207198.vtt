00:00:11.155 --> 00:00:13.620 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been studying UFOs
a pretty long time now,

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.340 align:middle line:90%
more than 25 years.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.070 align:middle line:10%
One of the first individuals
to really grab my attention

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.460 align:middle line:10%
in this subject is someone
who's kind of forgotten

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.180 align:middle line:10%
by most of the public,
most of the world

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.860 align:middle line:10%
but he's very important
in this subject.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.380 align:middle line:10%
And his name is
Roscoe Hillenkoetter.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.160 align:middle line:10%
Roscoe Hillenkoetter
was a US Navy Admiral,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.120 align:middle line:10%
but he's probably most
well-known as the first

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.890 align:middle line:10%
director of the CIA--

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.620 align:middle line:10%
Central Intelligence
Agency-- in 1947

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.220 align:middle line:10%
when that agency was created.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.470 align:middle line:90%
So he's an interesting person.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.780 align:middle line:84%
He ran the CIA
from 1947 to 1950.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.360 align:middle line:84%
When the Korean War
broke out that year,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.990 align:middle line:84%
he was replaced at
the CIA, probably

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.360 align:middle line:84%
being blamed for not
getting enough intelligence

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.260 align:middle line:84%
to warn on the impending
attack by the North Koreans.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.020 align:middle line:84%
Be that as it may,
that happens to people

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.168 align:middle line:90%
in government service.

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:09.960 align:middle line:84%
Hillenkoetter was there
for the first three

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.190 align:middle line:84%
years of the CIA's existence
and he had a lot of prestige.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.160 align:middle line:84%
But here's the thing
about Hillenkoetter

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.120 align:middle line:84%
that you never hear
historians talk about,

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.580 align:middle line:84%
which is that this man
was deeply involved

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.950 align:middle line:90%
in the UFO subject.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.600 align:middle line:84%
Like that's a fascinating
thing, that's an amazing thing.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.280 align:middle line:84%
First director of the
CIA was a board member

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.660 align:middle line:84%
of the first and most
prominent civilian-based UFO

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.880 align:middle line:90%
organization ever, really.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.710 align:middle line:84%
That organization
was called NICAP--

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.400 align:middle line:84%
National Investigation
Committee on Aerial Phenomena.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.120 align:middle line:10%
It was founded in 1956,
and by early 1957,

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.650 align:middle line:10%
NICAP was being run by Donald
Keyhoe, a retired Marine Corps

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.900 align:middle line:10%
major who was really the
most prominent UFO journalist

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.520 align:middle line:10%
in the world at that time.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And now, here's
Keyhoe directing NICAP

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.610 align:middle line:90%
based out of Washington DC.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.540 align:middle line:84%
The whole point of NICAP as
under Keyhoe's leadership

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.470 align:middle line:84%
was to try to achieve
disclosure of UFOs.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.810 align:middle line:84%
They didn't use that word
disclosure back then,

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.300 align:middle line:84%
but that's really
what NICAP was about.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.340 align:middle line:84%
They also had a
really involved group

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.530 align:middle line:90%
of civilian investigators.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.090 align:middle line:90%
They collected UFO reports.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.860 align:middle line:84%
They did all of
that, but there was

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.580 align:middle line:84%
this very intensely
political element

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.340 align:middle line:90%
to what NICAP was doing.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And it was all based on this
idea that was very, very

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.910 align:middle line:84%
strongly held in
the 1950s, an idea

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.050 align:middle line:84%
that citizens controlled
their government,

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.480 align:middle line:84%
and that members of Congress
were the proper elected body

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.190 align:middle line:84%
to work with to try to get
a UFO disclosure to happen.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.420 align:middle line:84%
Like that was a really wonderful
era in which citizens believed

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.660 align:middle line:84%
that they could affect
their government's actions

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.340 align:middle line:90%
and do all of this.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.100 align:middle line:84%
We look back on that
era and think, well,

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.370 align:middle line:84%
it's nice that you thought that,
didn't really work that way.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.130 align:middle line:84%
But there was a strong belief,
it was a powerful belief

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.920 align:middle line:84%
that Americans had in
their government back then.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.760 align:middle line:84%
So Keyhoe was running
NICAP, and on the board

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.400 align:middle line:84%
was his classmate way back
in their days at Annapolis.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.050 align:middle line:90%
And that's Roscoe Hillenkoetter.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.750 align:middle line:84%
In other words, Keyhoe and
Hillenkoetter were friends.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And it just so happened
that Hillenkoetter

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.380 align:middle line:84%
had been director of the
CIA a few years before that,

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.890 align:middle line:84%
and Keyhoe gets Hillenkoetter
on the board of NICAP

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.000 align:middle line:84%
in 1957 and for the
next five years.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.310 align:middle line:84%
When I first started
looking into that,

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.330 align:middle line:84%
I thought, there must be
some scholarly monograph,

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.270 align:middle line:84%
somewhere dealing with
Hillenkoetter's interest

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.300 align:middle line:90%
in UFOs, and there is nothing.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.450 align:middle line:10%
This is just a big black
hole of scholarship.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.890 align:middle line:10%
Shame on the academic community
for letting this one slide by,

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.460 align:middle line:10%
like asking the obvious
question why would this man

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.560 align:middle line:10%
be so interested in UFOs?

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.589 align:middle line:10%
Now, we've got
Keyhoe's various books

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:22.180 align:middle line:10%
where he talks about
his interactions

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.380 align:middle line:10%
with Hillenkoetter.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite
interesting because what

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.950 align:middle line:84%
you see is that Hillenkoetter
was used frequently

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.970 align:middle line:84%
by Keyhoe to help
promote the UFO cause,

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.730 align:middle line:84%
you could say, vis-a-vis
members of Congress.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And Hillenkoetter seemed
quite willing to do that.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.870 align:middle line:84%
He was very supportive
of NICAP's efforts

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.650 align:middle line:90%
to end UFO secrecy.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.320 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of an amazing thing.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.710 align:middle line:84%
This included a couple
of public statements

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.078 align:middle line:90%
that Hillenkoetter made.

00:04:52.078 --> 00:04:54.370 align:middle line:84%
Aside from private encouragement
that he was constantly

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.040 align:middle line:84%
giving to Keyhoe, advice,
and that sort of thing,

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.380 align:middle line:84%
he made public
statements as well.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.280 align:middle line:84%
One was from February
27, 1960 where

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.770 align:middle line:84%
he makes a public
statement about UFOs

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.440 align:middle line:84%
which was then quoted
in the Sunday New York

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.060 align:middle line:90%
Times the very next day.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to read this to you.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.550 align:middle line:84%
"It is time for the
truth to be brought out

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.100 align:middle line:90%
in open congressional hearings.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.000 align:middle line:84%
Behind the scenes,
high-ranking Air Force officers

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.150 align:middle line:84%
are soberly
concerned about UFOs.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.060 align:middle line:10%
But through official
secrecy and ridicule,

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.240 align:middle line:10%
many citizens are led to
believe the unknown flying

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.520 align:middle line:10%
objects are nonsense.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.660 align:middle line:10%
To hide the facts, the Air
Force has silenced its personnel

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.660 align:middle line:10%
through the issuance
of a regulation."

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.220 align:middle line:84%
That's a really
important statement

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.950 align:middle line:84%
for such a prestigious
person to make,

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.170 align:middle line:84%
and it was quoted within
the New York Times.

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.990 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of amazing too when
you look at the history of how

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.110 align:middle line:84%
the New York Times really
worked hand in glove with the US

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.640 align:middle line:84%
government and the intelligence
community to dismiss UFOs

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.330 align:middle line:84%
but they put in Hillenkoetter's
quote on this occasion.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.480 align:middle line:84%
So you've got, again,
a former director

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.980 align:middle line:84%
of the CIA stating
that UFOs actually

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.910 align:middle line:84%
are a serious matter
that the government was

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.540 align:middle line:84%
trying to make the public
believe was nonsense.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.460 align:middle line:90%
What is going on with that?

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And could you
imagine what it would

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.620 align:middle line:84%
be like if we had
similarly today

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.100 align:middle line:84%
a former CIA director
say the same thing?

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.120 align:middle line:84%
I think it would be considered
a genuine bombshell for sure.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, things really heated up
for Keyhoe and Hillenkoetter

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.380 align:middle line:90%
and NICAP through the year 1961.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
through 1961 into 1962

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.700 align:middle line:84%
that matters come to a
climax, to a conclusion.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.220 align:middle line:84%
Throughout 1961, Keyhoe
and Hillenkoetter

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.410 align:middle line:84%
are meeting with
members of Congress

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.950 align:middle line:84%
privately to try to
open up the possibility

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:57.610 align:middle line:84%
for genuine congressional
hearings on UFOs.

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:58.940 align:middle line:90%
This had never happened before.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.610 align:middle line:84%
This is really going
to be a big deal

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:02.590 align:middle line:90%
if they can make it happen.

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:06.940 align:middle line:84%
They met with a man, congressman
named Overton Brooks who

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.330 align:middle line:84%
seemed very sympathetic to
the whole idea of trying

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.460 align:middle line:90%
to get these hearings happen.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is
something that Keyhoe

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.780 align:middle line:84%
had tried for several
times previously,

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.660 align:middle line:84%
and it had often looked like
they were going to succeed,

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:21.540 align:middle line:90%
it could happen.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And then at the last
minute, the whole thing

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.980 align:middle line:84%
just goes away
and didn't happen.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:29.120 align:middle line:84%
But on this occasion, they
got a little bit farther.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And it was during
this time that one

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:37.180 align:middle line:84%
of Hillenkoetter's statements
again made it out to the media.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:42.460 align:middle line:84%
On August 22, 1961,
NICAP issued a statement

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.100 align:middle line:84%
that was signed by
Hillenkoetter that

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.070 align:middle line:84%
really brought this matter
to the public attention

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:49.010 align:middle line:90%
once again.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:53.530 align:middle line:84%
The issue was always
NICAP felt, look,

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:56.470 align:middle line:84%
these UFO sightings are a
matter of national security

00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:00.310 align:middle line:90%
if for no other reason than--

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:02.590 align:middle line:84%
if the Air Force isn't
taking them seriously,

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:06.070 align:middle line:84%
what if there's a UFO
sighting that they

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:10.150 align:middle line:90%
mistake for a Soviet missile?

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:13.420 align:middle line:84%
That could trigger World
War III accidentally.

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And this was the kind
of thing that they

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:19.240 align:middle line:84%
kept saying over and
over again to get

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.760 align:middle line:84%
congressional attention
on UFOs and get

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.710 align:middle line:90%
some kind of recognition.

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.000 align:middle line:84%
In retrospect, when
I look back on this,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.360 align:middle line:84%
I think that's not really
necessarily the case.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just because the Air
Force says they don't take UFOs

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:35.110 align:middle line:84%
seriously, doesn't
mean that they really

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:37.090 align:middle line:90%
don't take UFOs seriously.

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:39.280 align:middle line:84%
But from the public point
of view, they didn't.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And so this was NICAP's tactic
to Congress on August 22, 1961.

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:49.630 align:middle line:84%
Acting with the majority of
the NICAP board of governors,

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.180 align:middle line:84%
I urge immediate
congressional action

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.610 align:middle line:84%
to reduce the
dangers from secrecy

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:57.010 align:middle line:84%
about unidentified
flying objects.

00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:00.160 align:middle line:84%
Two dangers are
steadily increasing.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:05.290 align:middle line:84%
One, the risk of accidental war
from mistaking UFO formations

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:07.690 align:middle line:90%
for a Soviet surprise attack.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And two, the danger that
the Soviet government may,

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:15.790 align:middle line:84%
in a critical moment,
falsely claim the UFOs

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:18.730 align:middle line:84%
as secret Russian
weapons against which

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:21.730 align:middle line:90%
our defenses are helpless.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:27.220 align:middle line:84%
So again, the idea was we need
to have openness about UFOs

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:32.230 align:middle line:84%
so that our military is on a
level of preparedness vis-a-vis

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:35.243 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is the
Soviets are up to.

00:09:35.243 --> 00:09:37.410 align:middle line:84%
Again, I'm not sure that's
the strongest of argument

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:40.590 align:middle line:84%
that you can make at the
time but it was their tactic.

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And here, you have
Hillenkoetter putting himself

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.680 align:middle line:84%
right out there, right out
there before the world,

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:51.510 align:middle line:84%
talking about the need for
some transparency on the truly

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.180 align:middle line:90%
real phenomenon of UFOs.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.100 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of an amazing thing.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:00.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, through the
fall of 1961 there

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.400 align:middle line:84%
were ups and downs
in NICAP's attempts

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.030 align:middle line:84%
to move this whole issue forward
for congressional hearings.

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:10.050 align:middle line:84%
But it looked like
in early 1962,

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:11.880 align:middle line:90%
that thing might just happen.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Keyhoe was able to meet with
Hillenkoetter personally

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.600 align:middle line:84%
and it looked like
things were moving ahead,

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.020 align:middle line:90%
everything was a go.

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And then out of the
blue in February 1962,

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:26.160 align:middle line:84%
Keyhoe gets a letter from his
friend Roscoe Hillenkoetter

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.480 align:middle line:90%
saying just the opposite.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:31.710 align:middle line:84%
Hillenkoetter now is
saying, you know what,

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:33.480 align:middle line:90%
this is really a bad idea.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to participate
in these hearings.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:39.150 align:middle line:84%
I think the Air Force is doing
everything that they can do.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And as a matter of fact,
I'm resigning from the board

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:45.160 align:middle line:90%
of NICAP effective immediately.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.150 align:middle line:84%
I think we need to just give
the Air Force a breathing space

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:50.100 align:middle line:90%
and let them do their thing.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.780 align:middle line:90%
Keyhoe is absolutely floored.

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:52.860 align:middle line:90%
He was stunned.

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.020 align:middle line:84%
He tried to get an explanation
out of Hillenkoetter

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.400 align:middle line:90%
but he wasn't able to.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And that really was the
end of their friendship.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.860 align:middle line:84%
That was the end
of their dealings

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:03.660 align:middle line:84%
with each other in
a professional way

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.430 align:middle line:90%
as far as anyone could see.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:08.040 align:middle line:84%
Keyhoe always
believed that someone

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.440 align:middle line:84%
had gotten to Hillenkoetter
at the last minute,

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.440 align:middle line:84%
threatened him with his career
or threatened with something,

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.030 align:middle line:90%
and that that had worked.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And really, when you look at
the grand scheme of things,

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.480 align:middle line:84%
the big picture of
what was going on

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.550 align:middle line:84%
at that particular
time, I personally

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:26.040 align:middle line:84%
think that that's the
best interpretation.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.860 align:middle line:84%
Hillenkoetter received
some professional pressure

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.770 align:middle line:84%
from his associates
within the military,

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:33.420 align:middle line:84%
within the
intelligence community

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.810 align:middle line:84%
that made it very clear that
moving ahead on this matter

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:39.520 align:middle line:90%
any further was a bad idea.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.530 align:middle line:90%
Don't do it.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like he
listened to that advice.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:48.390 align:middle line:84%
He did an exact 180
from where he had been.

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, again, this is
just a very interesting story,

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:57.900 align:middle line:84%
isn't it, where you've got
the first director of the CIA

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:02.070 align:middle line:84%
with an obvious interest in
UFOs who, for five years,

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:04.410 align:middle line:84%
is the most prominent
member of the most

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:09.180 align:middle line:84%
prominent civilian organization
dealing with UFOs who makes

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:13.770 align:middle line:84%
several public statements
about the reality of UFOs

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:16.890 align:middle line:84%
and how there was an
intentional government program

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:21.840 align:middle line:84%
to minimize it and make it
seem like nonsense, who talked

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:27.600 align:middle line:84%
about the importance of bringing
this up openly within Congress,

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.860 align:middle line:84%
and who, at the last
minute, before all of this

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:38.760 align:middle line:84%
seemed ready to move forward,
bails out with no explanation.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a story
for the archivists.

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:46.230 align:middle line:84%
That's a story for intelligence
community historians

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:51.270 align:middle line:84%
who really want to dig into
a juicy, interesting story

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.580 align:middle line:90%
of our hidden history.

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.950 align:middle line:84%
What we have right
now is every reason

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:58.380 align:middle line:84%
to think that Roscoe
Hillenkoetter was

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:03.480 align:middle line:90%
pressured into silence on UFOs.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:07.140 align:middle line:84%
You never thought, did you, that
a former director of the CIA

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:10.320 align:middle line:84%
could go so far on this
issue in the public?

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was a long time ago
and we've gone a long distance

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.850 align:middle line:90%
since those days.

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:21.720 align:middle line:84%
But I like to believe it
is not impossible for more

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.740 align:middle line:84%
high-level government officials
to keep that tradition going

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.990 align:middle line:84%
and to release
information that they know

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.690 align:middle line:90%
relating to the UFO phenomenon.

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Because honestly, it's one of
the best things that we can do,

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.780 align:middle line:84%
is to get people who are in the
know to come out in the public

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.930 align:middle line:84%
and talk about what they
have known to be the case.

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:47.160 align:middle line:10%
Genuine verifiable
whistleblowers whose background

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.220 align:middle line:10%
can be verified, whose
information can be checked,

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:51.190 align:middle line:10%
and so forth.

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:52.290 align:middle line:90%
That's what we need.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And Hillenkoetter was I think
one that we could consider

00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:00.030 align:middle line:84%
to be a whistleblower,
and one who

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:02.580 align:middle line:84%
had a very important position
within the government

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:03.870 align:middle line:90%
in this day.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:06.040 align:middle line:84%
Despite all the
failures of the past,

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.860 align:middle line:90%
there's always room for victory.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.750 align:middle line:84%
There's always room
for more people

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:12.810 align:middle line:84%
to step up and provide the
public with the information

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.250 align:middle line:90%
that we need to hear.
