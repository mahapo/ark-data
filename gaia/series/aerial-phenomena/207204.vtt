00:00:03.367 --> 00:00:11.544 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:14.310 align:middle line:10%
>> There sure is a lot of
variety when you get into all

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.710 align:middle line:10%
of the different stories of
our interaction with apparent

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.420 align:middle line:10%
aliens and UFOs.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.265 align:middle line:84%
They're not all, you
know, gray aliens

00:00:20.265 --> 00:00:22.950 align:middle line:84%
who come into your bedroom,
take you out, do things

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.720 align:middle line:84%
to your body, and
then drop you back off

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.095 align:middle line:84%
into the bed with your clothes
backwards and all of that.

00:00:27.095 --> 00:00:29.190 align:middle line:90%
They're not all like that.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.660 align:middle line:84%
There's quite a bit of variety,
including waving back and forth

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.070 align:middle line:90%
to friendly aliens.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.020 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that, too.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.550 align:middle line:84%
One of the stories
I've never been

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.430 align:middle line:84%
able to shake, I've never
been able to explain away

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.290 align:middle line:84%
is from 1959, from
Papua, New Guinea.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.550 align:middle line:84%
It took place over
two evenings--

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.190 align:middle line:84%
late afternoon,
early evening type

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.860 align:middle line:84%
of a thing, June 26
and June 27 in 1959.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.200 align:middle line:84%
The main witness was a man named
Reverend William Booth Gill.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.160 align:middle line:90%
He was a missionary.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.560 align:middle line:84%
So he's out of New Guinea,
and he's been living there

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.340 align:middle line:90%
for some time.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.950 align:middle line:90%
And this is what happens.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.720 align:middle line:90%
This is really, really strange.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.160 align:middle line:90%
It's bizarre.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.690 align:middle line:90%
But there's a lot of witnesses.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.560 align:middle line:84%
So on the first
night, it's about 6:45

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.070 align:middle line:84%
in the evening of June 26,
people come in and say,

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.270 align:middle line:90%
Reverend, please come out.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.490 align:middle line:84%
You have to see what's
going on out here.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.420 align:middle line:90%
He comes out.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.420 align:middle line:84%
There's a total of 38
witnesses for this.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.220 align:middle line:90%
And they look up.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.455 align:middle line:10%
And really only 300 maybe
400 feet above them--

00:01:33.455 --> 00:01:36.270 align:middle line:10%
it's very low, very low--

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.840 align:middle line:10%
they see a circular craft, like
a disk-shaped circular craft

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.440 align:middle line:10%
with a blue beam of
light coming up--

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.720 align:middle line:10%
going up to the sky.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.970 align:middle line:84%
They see little legs out
of the craft, four legs.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And they see people
on the outside of it.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, this is just
an astonishing thing.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.650 align:middle line:90%
They're all kind of amazed.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.550 align:middle line:84%
The craft is there for a
certain period of time.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.950 align:middle line:84%
It starts getting dark,
and then it's gone.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.110 align:middle line:90%
It comes back the next night.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.800 align:middle line:84%
This is around 6 o'clock in the
late afternoon at this point,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.330 align:middle line:90%
still very light out.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And once again,
you've got this craft,

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.860 align:middle line:84%
and there's another
craft that they noticed.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.350 align:middle line:10%
So there's two UFOs, you
could say, that are in the sky

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.730 align:middle line:10%
visible to the people.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.045 align:middle line:84%
You have an equally large crowd
of people looking up at this.

00:02:36.045 --> 00:02:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And at this point, now they're
really getting energized.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And they want to communicate
with the beings in this craft

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.240 align:middle line:84%
because, once again, they see
people, at least four beings,

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.910 align:middle line:84%
or people, on this craft walking
around, doing things, looking

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.515 align:middle line:90%
like maybe they're working.

00:02:55.515 --> 00:02:58.530 align:middle line:10%
It was very low in the sky.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.070 align:middle line:90%
And so they start waving.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And to their shock, the
people up on the craft just

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.730 align:middle line:90%
start waving back.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.380 align:middle line:84%
One woman gets very
excited, and she

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.620 align:middle line:84%
starts waving both of her arms
up and down, back and forth.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And one of the beings or one
of the people on the craft

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.690 align:middle line:90%
start doing the same.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.180 align:middle line:90%
They have a flashlight.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.090 align:middle line:84%
They're shining the
flashlight at this.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.700 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of this mutual
gesturing and apparent goodwill

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.330 align:middle line:84%
going back and forth
between the people

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.280 align:middle line:90%
and whoever is on this craft.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And once again, the craft
is there until it gets dark.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.480 align:middle line:90%
And at some point, it's gone.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.460 align:middle line:84%
So Gill actually wrote
an 11-page-typed report

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.260 align:middle line:84%
about this encounter to his
supervisor, a Reverend Norman

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.280 align:middle line:90%
Cruttwell.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.390 align:middle line:84%
So Gill gives this whole
report to Cruttwell.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.730 align:middle line:84%
It's basically like an
affidavit essentially,

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.920 align:middle line:90%
where it's got his statement.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And he is supported by dozens
of the islanders who live here.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.500 align:middle line:84%
All of them saw the
same thing apparently.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.550 align:middle line:84%
They were all
adamant about this.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:14.350 align:middle line:90%
It's a funny thing.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.110 align:middle line:90%
Cruttwell totally believed Gill.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:17.519 align:middle line:90%
He knew him.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.149 align:middle line:84%
He had every confidence in his
honesty and his truthfulness.

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:24.990 align:middle line:84%
In fact, everyone who's ever met
Gill has said the same thing.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.870 align:middle line:10%
A number of years
later, J. Allen Hynek

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.690 align:middle line:10%
interviewed William Booth
Gill and said the same thing.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.800 align:middle line:10%
He's like, this guy is
absolutely rock solid.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.030 align:middle line:10%
I totally believe him, have
no doubt about his integrity

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.950 align:middle line:10%
and honesty whatsoever.

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.550 align:middle line:84%
This seems to be the universal
response people had with Gill.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, you
do have skeptics.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.075 align:middle line:10%
So back then the primary
skeptic in the world,

00:04:47.075 --> 00:04:48.450 align:middle line:10%
who had published
a lot of books,

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.380 align:middle line:10%
was Donald Menzel of
Harvard University.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.300 align:middle line:10%
Menzel didn't want to call Gill
a liar, but he just said, look,

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.650 align:middle line:10%
Gill got a little bit confused
by astronomical things.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.060 align:middle line:90%
It was a bright--

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.480 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was Venus, give
some kind of lame, really

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.780 align:middle line:84%
lame-- sorry, Menzel, but
this lame, astronomical excuse

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.570 align:middle line:84%
for what Gill and
the islanders saw.

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And then in what really is an
absolutely racist statement

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.430 align:middle line:84%
says, yeah, the
natives just wanted

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.610 align:middle line:84%
to impress "the
great white father."

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.010 align:middle line:90%
He actually said this.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And they just wanted to go along
with anything that he said.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.580 align:middle line:90%
Like seriously, Donald Menzel.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.630 align:middle line:84%
The thing about
Menzel, by the way,

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.760 align:middle line:84%
is that he was a very
famous Harvard astronomer.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.770 align:middle line:10%
But he also-- and
this is something

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.710 align:middle line:10%
no one knew at the time
until long after his death,

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.840 align:middle line:10%
Menzel was working with
the National Security

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.710 align:middle line:10%
Agency, the NSA.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:52.050 align:middle line:10%
And he was high-level NSA
working within the intelligence

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.490 align:middle line:10%
field for many, many years.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.620 align:middle line:84%
He was a very capable
cryptographer,

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.360 align:middle line:90%
code maker, code breaker.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And that was his secret life,
and no one knew about it.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.010 align:middle line:84%
So here you have the world's
most famous prominent debunker

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.960 align:middle line:90%
secretly working for the NSA.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.940 align:middle line:84%
Sure, that doesn't look
bad at all, does it?

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.900 align:middle line:10%
The other main skeptic of
the era, Philip J. Klass,

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.720 align:middle line:10%
also wrote about this case.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.820 align:middle line:10%
And true to Klass'
personality, he

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.445 align:middle line:10%
did impugn Gill's
integrity and honesty.

00:06:20.445 --> 00:06:22.680 align:middle line:84%
This is what Klass
did all the time.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.820 align:middle line:84%
He basically just said Gill
was creating a fanciful story

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.000 align:middle line:90%
to impress his boss.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.070 align:middle line:84%
So Klass actually
essentially accused

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.830 align:middle line:84%
Gill of making this
whole thing up.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:35.910 align:middle line:90%
What about the natives?

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.100 align:middle line:84%
You've got 38
other people there.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.540 align:middle line:90%
They have no will of their own?

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.700 align:middle line:84%
They have no ability to
make up their own mind?

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, according to Klass
and Menzel, apparently not.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.130 align:middle line:90%
But that's not how it went down.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And the people who
lived on the island

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.907 align:middle line:84%
weren't these backward,
illiterate people.

00:06:51.907 --> 00:06:53.490 align:middle line:84%
They were living in
Papua, New Guinea,

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.580 align:middle line:84%
maybe in a slightly
more traditional type

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.620 align:middle line:84%
of society than Westerners,
but they certainly

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.420 align:middle line:90%
were intelligent.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.060 align:middle line:84%
They certainly were
able to observe and make

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.370 align:middle line:84%
their own determination
of what they saw.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:09.970 align:middle line:84%
They all agreed that they
saw two craft on one occasion

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:11.670 align:middle line:90%
and one craft on another.

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.730 align:middle line:84%
They all agree that they
saw people or beings

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:17.850 align:middle line:90%
on those craft waving at them.

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.230 align:middle line:90%
Amazing story.

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:20.850 align:middle line:10%
And one thing about
it that's actually

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:26.310 align:middle line:10%
really quite interesting to me
is it's in line with some much

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:32.820 align:middle line:10%
earlier UFO cases from long
before the era of flying

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:33.690 align:middle line:10%
saucers.

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:36.790 align:middle line:84%
If you go back to the early
parts of the 20th century,

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.320 align:middle line:84%
people were seeing
mysterious airships.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.050 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people know
about the famous airship

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:48.960 align:middle line:84%
wave that took place in the
United States in 1896 and 1897.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:49.770 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And there were a number
of cases where witnesses

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.780 align:middle line:84%
said that they saw
people in the airships

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.690 align:middle line:84%
and tried to communicate back
and forth with the people.

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.910 align:middle line:84%
There are some alleged cases
of actual communication

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:01.710 align:middle line:90%
with those people.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And, by the way, they're
all human beings,

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.820 align:middle line:84%
no aliens in any of
those airship sightings.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.500 align:middle line:84%
But there's also
airship sightings

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.630 align:middle line:84%
that took place in
the early 20th century

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:11.160 align:middle line:90%
in different parts of the world.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.230 align:middle line:84%
To me, most notably
were the cases

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:17.280 align:middle line:84%
that took place in
New Zealand in 1909,

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.200 align:middle line:90%
and quite a few of them.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.600 align:middle line:90%
Hard to explain away to me.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.070 align:middle line:90%
There were no airships.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:26.280 align:middle line:84%
There were no aircraft in
New Zealand at that time.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.480 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely, no way.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:32.700 align:middle line:84%
But people were seeing these
often very low aircraft,

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.250 align:middle line:84%
sometimes with people
associated with them.

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:38.909 align:middle line:84%
You get the same thing
in the United States,

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:41.370 align:middle line:84%
these airships in the
early 20th century,

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:45.240 align:middle line:84%
that were very
advanced, maneuvering

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.160 align:middle line:84%
in ways that were very
advanced for the time,

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.490 align:middle line:84%
didn't seem like they were
ordinary blimps or airships

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:54.270 align:middle line:84%
whatsoever, where there would be
interaction with the occupants

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:56.370 align:middle line:90%
of those craft.

00:08:56.370 --> 00:09:06.120 align:middle line:84%
All of these were human beings
that were seen on the airships,

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.080 align:middle line:84%
just like what really seemed
to be the case with the Gill

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.360 align:middle line:90%
sighting of 1959.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.080 align:middle line:84%
It really does seem like
they're describing just people.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.580 align:middle line:84%
They didn't really
get close enough,

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.880 align:middle line:84%
but that's the impression
that they certainly had.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.445 align:middle line:84%
So it really makes you
wonder, what was that

00:09:23.445 --> 00:09:24.550 align:middle line:90%
that they were seeing?

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:29.310 align:middle line:84%
Are we talking about some very
secret infrastructure, totally

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:34.620 align:middle line:84%
human, totally secret that
had flying saucer technology,

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.770 align:middle line:84%
that was just flying
around the world in 1959

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.180 align:middle line:90%
doing God knows what?

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.890 align:middle line:84%
For what purpose,
we have no idea.

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:45.210 align:middle line:84%
It's one of these things
where, once again,

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:51.510 align:middle line:84%
the UFO subject, it comes
at us in a way that doesn't

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.210 align:middle line:90%
make enough sense to us.

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And yet, it's not like we
can just easily dismiss it.

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.030 align:middle line:84%
Once these stories
come to your attention,

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:03.390 align:middle line:84%
once you get into the
details, you start to think,

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:05.220 align:middle line:84%
these people are
telling the truth.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And they certainly seem like
they're in their right mind.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.690 align:middle line:84%
So what do you do
with the story?

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:12.130 align:middle line:90%
What do you do with it?

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:13.860 align:middle line:84%
Well it's hard to
make sense out of it,

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.170 align:middle line:84%
but it's equally hard
to toss it aside.

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's a big part
of the UFO mystery.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:25.290 align:middle line:84%
In Gill's detailed 11-page note
he said, "Two of the figures

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:29.520 align:middle line:84%
seem to be doing something
near the center of the deck.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:33.630 align:middle line:84%
They were occasionally bending
over and raising their arms,

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:37.740 align:middle line:84%
as though adjusting or setting
up something not visible.

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:42.090 align:middle line:84%
One figure seemed to be
standing, looking down at us."

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:47.880 align:middle line:84%
This statement by Gill was
signed by over 25 witnesses.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:52.350 align:middle line:84%
These witnesses were
clearly very engaged in

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:53.700 align:middle line:90%
what had happened.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.130 align:middle line:84%
There's no question
for any of them

00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:01.950 align:middle line:84%
that they saw a flying
saucer with people on it.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:06.750 align:middle line:84%
It had little eggs that had a
blue beam of light shining up

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:07.980 align:middle line:90%
into the sky.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.200 align:middle line:84%
Even now, it's not clear
that we have officially

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.300 align:middle line:84%
any kind of technology that
could do that sort of thing.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.090 align:middle line:90%
But at least we can conceive it.

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:18.570 align:middle line:84%
Back in 1959, I have
a very hard time

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:21.930 align:middle line:84%
envisioning how
any society would

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:24.480 align:middle line:84%
have been able to create
a functioning flying

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:28.170 align:middle line:84%
saucer that could do the things
that this craft was described

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:29.130 align:middle line:90%
as doing.

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we're talking
about actual human beings.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.350 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
not aliens, we're

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:37.800 align:middle line:84%
talking about people
on a flying saucer.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.540 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
conflicting things

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.550 align:middle line:84%
that we get with
these UFO reports.

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:44.790 align:middle line:84%
We want them to be consistent,
but they're not consistent.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:47.640 align:middle line:84%
That's part of the problem
with this phenomenon.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.870 align:middle line:84%
We want a consistent,
single kind of answer

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:53.940 align:middle line:90%
to make it easy for us.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:57.180 align:middle line:84%
We don't want a situation
where sometimes it's

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:59.070 align:middle line:84%
aliens in the craft
and sometimes it's

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:00.570 align:middle line:90%
humans in the craft.

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Let's have all of one
or all the other, right?

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:06.630 align:middle line:84%
But nope, it doesn't
work that simple.

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:09.330 align:middle line:84%
Occasionally I've wondered,
is it possible to have both?

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, there have
been cases where

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:13.925 align:middle line:84%
there have been both on a
craft, the Travis Walton case

00:12:13.925 --> 00:12:15.940 align:middle line:84%
is maybe the most
famous example.

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.670 align:middle line:84%
But there are
others in which you

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:20.430 align:middle line:84%
have cases of humans
and non-humans

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:21.750 align:middle line:90%
operating this technology.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And maybe one answer is
that in ancient times,

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:28.980 align:middle line:84%
these aliens stole a couple of
thousand human beings living

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.590 align:middle line:84%
in some traditional
society and raised and bred

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:34.590 align:middle line:84%
their own humans
to work for them.

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:36.990 align:middle line:84%
Hey, stranger things
might have happened.

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:41.040 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be that human
beings created the aliens.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:41.910 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:43.470 align:middle line:84%
We don't really have
answers on this.

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:49.350 align:middle line:84%
But we do have a number of
cases of human beings operating

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:50.980 align:middle line:90%
these flying saucers.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:53.430 align:middle line:90%
So that's part of the UFO story.

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:56.780 align:middle line:90%
