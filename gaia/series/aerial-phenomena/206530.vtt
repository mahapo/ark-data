00:00:03.402 --> 00:00:11.670 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.078 align:middle line:10%
>> Folks ask all the time,
where's the proof of UFOs--

00:00:15.078 --> 00:00:16.620 align:middle line:10%
give me the proof,
give me the proof.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.360 align:middle line:90%
How about evidence?

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.730 align:middle line:84%
What I like to do is, I
like to look at documents.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.860 align:middle line:84%
I like to look at
military documents

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.820 align:middle line:84%
in particular that show
an interest in these UFOs.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
important, because when

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.240 align:middle line:84%
you look at enough of these
military documents that

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:39.270 align:middle line:84%
show a very particular interest
in these unidentified flying

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.790 align:middle line:84%
objects doing things that are
not supposed to be possible,

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.710 align:middle line:84%
and they're noted
again and again

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.010 align:middle line:84%
and again in the military
documents that we have

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.680 align:middle line:84%
available, then you have
to think, all right,

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.110 align:middle line:84%
there's something going
on here, there's something

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.220 align:middle line:90%
that I need to look at.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.637 align:middle line:10%
That may not be
proof that they're

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:57.030 align:middle line:10%
extraterrestrial or alien,
but it's pretty interesting,

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.860 align:middle line:10%
you have to agree.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.320 align:middle line:10%
To me, one of the most
interesting documents

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.860 align:middle line:10%
that we have available
to us in this regard

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.310 align:middle line:10%
is a September 23, 1947, memo
by an American general named

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.810 align:middle line:10%
Nathan Twining.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.600 align:middle line:10%
And Nathan Twining was
very, very big deal

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.980 align:middle line:10%
within the United
States Air Force.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.370 align:middle line:84%
He, in fact, later went on
to be a four-star general.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.280 align:middle line:90%
In 1947, he had three stars.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And he became the Chief of Staff
of the United States Air Force

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.040 align:middle line:90%
during the 1950s.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.810 align:middle line:90%
Powerful man.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.580 align:middle line:84%
In 1947, these flying
saucers were being seen

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.720 align:middle line:90%
all over the United States.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.820 align:middle line:84%
They were being written
about in newspapers.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of military people
were reporting these objects.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.240 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just something
that civilians were seeing.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And so, there was a general
named Charles Schulgen

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.100 align:middle line:90%
who wrote to Twining.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And he just wanted
to know, is this

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.890 align:middle line:84%
a thing that I need to
be dealing with or not?

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And on September 23,
1947, Nathan Twining

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.870 align:middle line:84%
wrote back to Charles Schulgen,
and he made a very particular

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:04.830 align:middle line:90%
statement--

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.240 align:middle line:84%
in three pages, typed
memo to this general

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.260 align:middle line:84%
where he made an
astonishing statement.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.620 align:middle line:84%
He said this phenomenon is real,
not visionary or fictitious.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, right off the
bat, that's kind

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.730 align:middle line:84%
of an important thing,
because in 1947,

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.700 align:middle line:84%
and '48, and '49, and
all through the '50s,

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.150 align:middle line:84%
all through the '60s and beyond,
the United States government

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.820 align:middle line:84%
has always told the
public that these flying

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.010 align:middle line:84%
saucers, these UFOs are
not real, are visionary,

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.180 align:middle line:90%
are fictitious.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.460 align:middle line:84%
But here is, in a
classified memo,

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.110 align:middle line:84%
Twining is telling another
general exactly the opposite.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I first read
that, many years ago, I

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.630 align:middle line:84%
thought, that's interesting,
I want to know more.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, indeed, in this memo,
Twining gives you a lot more.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.540 align:middle line:10%
He writes a number
of specific qualities

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.100 align:middle line:10%
that these objects had that
military personnel were noting.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.500 align:middle line:84%
It's a very meticulous,
very exact list.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.160 align:middle line:10%
He writes, "The reported
operating characteristics such

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.730 align:middle line:10%
as extreme rates of
climb, maneuverability--

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.560 align:middle line:10%
particularly in roll--

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.880 align:middle line:10%
and action which must be
considered evasive when sighted

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.840 align:middle line:10%
lend belief to the possibility
that some of the objects

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.970 align:middle line:10%
are controlled either manually,
automatically or remotely."

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.680 align:middle line:84%
Twining then went
on to list some

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.470 align:middle line:84%
of the other specific
characteristics

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.240 align:middle line:90%
of these objects.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.140 align:middle line:84%
One, metallic or
light-reflecting surface.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.280 align:middle line:84%
Two, absence of trail,
except in a few instances

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.650 align:middle line:84%
when the object,
apparently, was operating

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.110 align:middle line:84%
under high-performance
conditions.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.870 align:middle line:90%
Three-- my personal favorite--

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.770 align:middle line:84%
circular or elliptical
in shape, flat on bottom

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.190 align:middle line:90%
and domed on top.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.120 align:middle line:84%
He goes on to talk about several
well-kept formations of flight

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.170 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.240 align:middle line:90%
oh, yes-- silence.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.730 align:middle line:90%
They don't make any sound.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.650 align:middle line:84%
This is a really
amazing thing here,

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.700 align:middle line:84%
to be telling this specific
statement to another general

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.570 align:middle line:90%
who's inquiring.

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.445 align:middle line:84%
Now, a couple of other
things about this memo

00:04:17.445 --> 00:04:18.570 align:middle line:90%
are interesting.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.400 align:middle line:84%
UFO skeptics have pointed
out that Twining explicitly

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.790 align:middle line:84%
said, well, we don't have any
of these that we've acquired,

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.820 align:middle line:84%
so there must not have
been any crash retrieval--

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.425 align:middle line:84%
and that would seem to rule
out Roswell, for example.

00:04:32.425 --> 00:04:34.050 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to be
careful before you

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.610 align:middle line:90%
make that conclusion.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.820 align:middle line:84%
Keep in mind, Twining's writing
to another general who probably

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.510 align:middle line:84%
didn't have a full need to
know, who had a lower rank,

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.570 align:middle line:84%
and who was just simply
making an inquiry.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.570 align:middle line:84%
Assuming something like
Roswell did happen and was real

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.610 align:middle line:84%
and that Twining
knew about it, he

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.480 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't be allowed just to tell
any other general willy-nilly

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.520 align:middle line:84%
what had happened
at Roswell, so it

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.300 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't be able to come out.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.350 align:middle line:84%
But one thing Twining did say
in this memo is that it did not

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.520 align:middle line:84%
appear to be any kind of
secret American project, which

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.890 align:middle line:84%
was, in all likelihood,
one of the things

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.140 align:middle line:84%
Charles Schulgen was
expecting to hear--

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.960 align:middle line:90%
and he didn't hear it.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Twining did not say that
this was an American project.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.470 align:middle line:84%
All other evidence
that we have of 1947,

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.230 align:middle line:84%
all the other conversations
going on within the Air Force

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.040 align:middle line:84%
and within Air Force
scientists lend further support

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.500 align:middle line:84%
to the fact that these
were not secret projects.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.030 align:middle line:84%
No one knew who
they belonged to,

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.100 align:middle line:90%
no one knew who they were from.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And Twining is basically
saying the same thing here.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.790 align:middle line:84%
What you have in this
memo, fundamentally--

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.000 align:middle line:84%
let's keep our eyes on the
main point here-- in this memo,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.530 align:middle line:84%
you've got a senior US general
saying that these flying

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.160 align:middle line:90%
disks are real.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.840 align:middle line:84%
He's not shouting it
from the rooftops,

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.360 align:middle line:84%
he's just telling one other
general in a classified

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.683 align:middle line:90%
statement at the time.

00:05:54.683 --> 00:05:57.350 align:middle line:84%
You know, if it were not for the
Freedom of Information Act that

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.190 align:middle line:84%
was passed in the
US during the 1970s,

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.130 align:middle line:84%
we really wouldn't have most
of these types of documents

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.902 align:middle line:90%
that have come down to us.

00:06:05.902 --> 00:06:07.610 align:middle line:84%
The people who wrote
these documents back

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.000 align:middle line:84%
in the '40s and '50s
had no expectation ever

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.480 align:middle line:84%
that these documents would
ever see the light of day.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.580 align:middle line:84%
It took decades before most
of these were available,

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.730 align:middle line:84%
and even now we
have a smattering,

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.400 align:middle line:84%
but there's still a lot
that are not available.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.950 align:middle line:84%
The Twining memo, though,
was an important one.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And UFO researchers are
pretty well aware of it,

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.220 align:middle line:84%
but even now, it seems
to me astonishing

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.900 align:middle line:84%
that most of the general public
just doesn't know about it.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.800 align:middle line:84%
It's not proof that
UFOs are alien-- no,

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.300 align:middle line:90%
I would never say that--

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.200 align:middle line:84%
but it sure as heck is
proof that the flying saucer

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.130 align:middle line:84%
phenomenon of the 1940s was
being taken very seriously--

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.570 align:middle line:90%
very seriously--

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:54.020 align:middle line:84%
by top generals in the United
States command structure.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And hey, that's a good place
to start, don't you think?

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.380 align:middle line:84%
I want to stop and talk about
some of these characteristics,

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.770 align:middle line:84%
like flat on bottom,
domed on top.

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.760 align:middle line:84%
Just stop for a moment
and think about this.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.830 align:middle line:84%
What aircraft, in
1947 no less, could

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.470 align:middle line:90%
be described in that manner?

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is
absolutely none.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.780 align:middle line:84%
There was no
aircraft in the world

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:25.040 align:middle line:84%
that could be described as
flat on bottom, domed on top--

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.710 align:middle line:84%
at least nothing that we,
officially, know about.

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:31.050 align:middle line:84%
Maybe if you've got secret
German saucers zipping around.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.840 align:middle line:84%
But we'd still have to
prove that one as well,

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.510 align:middle line:90%
and that would be a big deal.

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:40.130 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the answer is,
it's a big, big deal here.

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:44.000 align:middle line:10%
Twining was going off
of many military reports

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.370 align:middle line:10%
that were already circulating.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:49.500 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't just making
this up out of thin air.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:54.920 align:middle line:84%
So metallic-looking objects
that were of high performance,

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:59.480 align:middle line:84%
that were silent, that had
exceptional maneuverability,

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.870 align:middle line:84%
that were flat on bottom
and domed on top--

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:04.280 align:middle line:90%
what is this all about?

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.580 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine what would
the reaction of the world

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:14.210 align:middle line:84%
be if that particular memo had
been made public at that time?

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:16.020 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't really take
a lot of imagination

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.650 align:middle line:84%
to realize that would have
a transformative effect

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.420 align:middle line:84%
on public opinion
and people would

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.390 align:middle line:84%
be pounding at the White
House door, probably the very

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:27.690 align:middle line:90%
next day, demanding answers.

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:29.430 align:middle line:84%
But of course, it
was a secret memo,

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:36.450 align:middle line:84%
and the funny thing is, when it
finally saw the light of day,

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:40.690 align:middle line:84%
when it finally was really
publicized in the late 1970s,

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:44.100 align:middle line:84%
it was almost as if it
just dropped down a little

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:48.780 align:middle line:84%
into a little black hole and
hardly anyone commented on it.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.700 align:middle line:90%
So an astonishing thing.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.850 align:middle line:84%
This is a document
that's a true bombshell.

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And when you read it,
you can recognize it.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
story of UFO research

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.370 align:middle line:90%
for years and years and years.

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:05.220 align:middle line:84%
You've got these amazing
documents that are staring you

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.220 align:middle line:84%
in the face telling you
this incredible story,

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.190 align:middle line:84%
and the response from
the major media, response

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:14.250 align:middle line:84%
from the political institutions,
the response from academia

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:17.070 align:middle line:90%
is one big, extended yawn.

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:19.710 align:middle line:84%
Like they just don't
care, I suppose.

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:20.683 align:middle line:90%
Well, I care.

00:09:20.683 --> 00:09:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And I have a feeling
if you get to study

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:26.010 align:middle line:84%
these types of documents,
you're going to care too.

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:27.540 align:middle line:90%
I would like to know--

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.720 align:middle line:84%
what the heck was Nathan
Twining talking about?

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.210 align:middle line:90%
He clearly had a clue.

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And the question is,
what was he driving at?

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And most importantly, who
and what were behind those

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:48.180 align:middle line:84%
reports that military
personnel were seeing?

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.713 align:middle line:90%
Who's driving those things?

00:09:50.713 --> 00:09:52.380 align:middle line:84%
These are the great
unanswered questions

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.910 align:middle line:90%
of the UFO phenomenon.

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Someone, something is
in control of them.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:01.800 align:middle line:84%
And this Twining
memo is just one

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:06.150 align:middle line:84%
of many important
documents that exist,

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:08.370 align:middle line:90%
that attest to that reality.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:10.740 align:middle line:90%
Let's not forget that.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.470 align:middle line:10%
Nathan Twining moved
in the highest circles

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:16.320 align:middle line:10%
of the American national
security community.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:21.010 align:middle line:84%
He knew everyone,
everyone knew him.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:24.630 align:middle line:84%
He went on to be Chief of Staff
of the United States Air Force.

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:27.270 align:middle line:84%
He was in the perfect
position to know the things

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:28.800 align:middle line:90%
that he was talking about.

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.020 align:middle line:84%
One of the other interesting
things about this memo

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.630 align:middle line:84%
is that this, really,
is the origin--

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:37.380 align:middle line:84%
the true origin-- of what would
later become Project Blue Book.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:40.500 align:middle line:84%
That is the Air
Force's official office

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:44.880 align:middle line:90%
to study the UFO reports.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.180 align:middle line:84%
Out of it became the
predecessor of Blue Book,

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.860 align:middle line:90%
which was called Project Sign.

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.970 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things that
Twining mentioned in this memo

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:57.570 align:middle line:84%
was that the more
important UFO reports

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:00.960 align:middle line:84%
should be sent to various
places within the US

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.180 align:middle line:84%
military and scientific
command structure.

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:06.120 align:middle line:84%
One of those places, by the
way, was the Atomic Energy

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.640 align:middle line:90%
Commission.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And the AEC, as it
was called, was really

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:16.390 align:middle line:84%
one of the lesser-known
but very important

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:20.890 align:middle line:84%
repositories for UFO
reports that, to this day,

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:23.830 align:middle line:90%
have almost no oversight.

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:26.290 align:middle line:84%
But this memo of
Twining's really

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:27.970 align:middle line:84%
got the whole ball
started, in terms

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:34.990 align:middle line:84%
of a formal, bureaucratic
response within the Air Force

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:37.240 align:middle line:90%
to the UFO phenomenon.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, in all likelihood,
these reports

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:43.600 align:middle line:84%
were being monitored
by higher-ups.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:49.210 align:middle line:84%
But Twining's memo began a
series of events that ended up

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:52.180 align:middle line:84%
in the creation of Project Blue
Book a couple of years later,

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.280 align:middle line:90%
and that's kind of interesting.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.630 align:middle line:90%
