>> No UFO history would be
complete without its own

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.070 align:middle line:10%
mysteries and lore
of missing documents,

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.580 align:middle line:10%
and probably the most famous
of these legendary missing

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.240 align:middle line:10%
documents is The Estimate
of the Situation.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, we'll talk a
little bit about this.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Back in 1948, the whole UFO
mystery, these flying saucer

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.800 align:middle line:84%
mystery, was still a very new
thing in the Western world

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.970 align:middle line:90%
and actually worldwide.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.590 align:middle line:84%
People were learning
all about it.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.880 align:middle line:84%
In the summer of 1948, in July,
was a famous sighting by two

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.270 align:middle line:84%
Eastern Airlines' pilots in
which they were flying over

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.710 align:middle line:84%
a part of Alabama, confronted by
an object that was shaped like

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.270 align:middle line:84%
an elongated cigar or rocket
that zoomed by their aircraft.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.482 align:middle line:84%
Scared them to
death, and they both

00:00:57.482 --> 00:00:58.690 align:middle line:90%
got a really good look at it.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.240 align:middle line:84%
Their descriptions were
identical to each other.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.780 align:middle line:84%
This particular sighting got the
attention of the United States

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.910 align:middle line:90%
Air Force in a big way.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And at this time, there
was this new Project Sign

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.600 align:middle line:90%
that was underway.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.570 align:middle line:84%
It was the predecessor
of Project Blue Book,

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.300 align:middle line:84%
in which the US Air
Force had analysts

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.580 align:middle line:84%
who were taking in
these UFO reports,

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.170 align:middle line:84%
studying them, and trying to
understand what this really

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.970 align:middle line:90%
was.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.595 align:middle line:84%
And the big question
back in those days

00:01:26.595 --> 00:01:28.270 align:middle line:90%
is, who's making these things?

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.460 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't are they
make believe or real.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.070 align:middle line:84%
Everyone was assuming
these were real,

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.460 align:middle line:84%
but the question is, were they
Russian, were they American,

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.050 align:middle line:90%
or were they--

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.660 align:middle line:90%
wait for it-- interplanetary?

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.240 align:middle line:84%
That was the phrase that
people were using back then

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.810 align:middle line:84%
for extraterrestrial,
and there was definitely

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.380 align:middle line:84%
a number of scientists
in Project Sign that

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.700 align:middle line:84%
believed that these objects
just might be interplanetary,

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.860 align:middle line:84%
because they couldn't
figure out how

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.100 align:middle line:84%
the Russians or the Americans
were able to create aircraft

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.680 align:middle line:84%
that could move in
the incredible ways

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.300 align:middle line:84%
that these so-called flying
saucers were being seen

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.100 align:middle line:90%
to move.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.370 align:middle line:84%
So now, here comes the
Eastern Airlines' sighting,

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:15.010 align:middle line:84%
and this was dramatic enough
that the team at Project Sign

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.190 align:middle line:84%
wrote a report which they called
The Estimate of the Situation.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.800 align:middle line:10%
Now, the fact is
there are no existing

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.180 align:middle line:10%
copies that we have of The
Estimate of the Situation.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.350 align:middle line:84%
I'll get to that
in just a second.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.160 align:middle line:84%
But what did they
apparently write?

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, their estimate was
that this phenomenon was real

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.630 align:middle line:84%
and that it was
interplanetary, and they

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.510 align:middle line:84%
wrote a detailed
report indicating

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.280 align:middle line:84%
that what it looked like was
that another group of beings,

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.750 align:middle line:84%
people from outer space, were
surveilling planet Earth right

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.040 align:middle line:84%
now for reasons unknown,
but that they were here.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And this goes up
the chain of command

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.140 align:middle line:84%
all the way to the top of
the Air Force hierarchy.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.920 align:middle line:10%
Air Force Chief of
Staff Hoyt Vandenberg.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.110 align:middle line:84%
1948, this report lands on
his desk, whereby we are

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.000 align:middle line:90%
told Vandenberg rejected it.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.970 align:middle line:90%
He said, give me another answer.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.010 align:middle line:84%
He ended up breaking
up the team,

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.560 align:middle line:84%
dispersing the members
to different departments,

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.350 align:middle line:84%
and that was the
end of Project Sign.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, why do we believe
this document exists when

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.060 align:middle line:90%
we don't have a copy of it?

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.610 align:middle line:10%
Well, Captain
Edward Ruppelt, who

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.530 align:middle line:10%
ran Project Blue
Book in 1952 and '53,

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.290 align:middle line:10%
stated in his own writings
that he personally

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.800 align:middle line:10%
had seen The Estimate
and that he had read it.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.620 align:middle line:84%
One of his Air Force
colleagues, Major Dewey Fournet,

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.750 align:middle line:84%
also claimed to
have seen and read

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.790 align:middle line:90%
The Estimate of the Situation.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.550 align:middle line:84%
According to Ruppelt,
after Vandenberg

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:01.570 align:middle line:84%
rejected this conclusion, he had
all copies burned and destroyed

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.110 align:middle line:84%
in a manner that doesn't
appear to be standard Air Force

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.670 align:middle line:84%
procedure for destroying
documents, by the way.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.120 align:middle line:84%
But this is what Ruppelt
told us in his book.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.570 align:middle line:84%
So what's the deal with The
Estimate of the Situation?

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.580 align:middle line:90%
Did it really exist or not?

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.360 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me, it's a better
bet than not that it did exist.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.100 align:middle line:90%
I think it probably did exist.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.980 align:middle line:10%
Ruppelt's talked
about this quite a bit

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.880 align:middle line:10%
during the 1950s, and
one conversation with UFO

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.870 align:middle line:10%
researcher, Donald Keyhoe,
he said, what were we

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.537 align:middle line:10%
supposed to do with this?

00:04:33.537 --> 00:04:35.620 align:middle line:10%
What was the president
supposed to tell the public

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.780 align:middle line:10%
when we ourselves
didn't really know

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.400 align:middle line:10%
what their intentions were?

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.590 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what the
intentions of these beings

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.360 align:middle line:90%
happened to be?

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.520 align:middle line:84%
So it was a very
upfront statement

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.580 align:middle line:84%
that he was making
here, and it seems

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.150 align:middle line:84%
to me that Ruppelt more likely
than not was telling the truth.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.970 align:middle line:10%
Particularly, when you have
another witness, Dewey Fournet,

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.170 align:middle line:10%
who says the exact same thing.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.710 align:middle line:10%
By the way, Dewey Fournet,
in the late 1950s,

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.960 align:middle line:10%
signed an affidavit
to the effect

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.420 align:middle line:10%
of the existence of The
Estimate of the Situation.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.120 align:middle line:84%
So what you have
here is a situation

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.430 align:middle line:84%
where this happens
time and again

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.800 align:middle line:90%
in the early history of UFOs.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.540 align:middle line:84%
That is the United
States Air Force

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.960 align:middle line:84%
has a group of people
studying this phenomenon,

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:24.940 align:middle line:84%
and there's always this group
that concludes, wow, it's real,

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.530 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't seem
to belong to us,

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.650 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't seem to
belong to the Russians.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.570 align:middle line:84%
This happened again and again,
and it happened in 1948 early

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:35.590 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:36.850 align:middle line:90%
Public had no idea.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.800 align:middle line:84%
No one was telling the ordinary
folks on the street about this.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.050 align:middle line:84%
I think they would
have liked to know.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.705 align:middle line:84%
I think people in the academic
world would have liked to know.

00:05:46.705 --> 00:05:49.330 align:middle line:10%
I think people in the political
world would have liked to know.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.060 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of folks
would have liked to know,

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.120 align:middle line:90%
but no one was told about this.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.160 align:middle line:84%
It did come out
a few years later

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.660 align:middle line:84%
in Ruppelt's book in the
50s, but again, UFO book.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:02.680 align:middle line:90%
A few people read it.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.020 align:middle line:84%
Most people didn't, and
it just kind of gets

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.070 align:middle line:90%
pushed to the sidelines.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.730 align:middle line:84%
But think about the
implications of this.

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.930 align:middle line:84%
You've got right out of
the gate in the 1940s

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.140 align:middle line:84%
the first detailed
Air Force study

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.470 align:middle line:84%
that we know of
that studied UFOs

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:27.100 align:middle line:84%
appears to have concluded that
it was real and interplanetary.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.450 align:middle line:84%
So according to
Ruppelt, the estimate

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:36.130 align:middle line:84%
stated that it looked like
aliens or extraterrestrials

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:37.900 align:middle line:90%
were visiting the Earth.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.420 align:middle line:84%
They were surveilling
the Earth in some way,

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.210 align:middle line:84%
that it did not appear that
an attack was imminent,

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.020 align:middle line:84%
but that the Air
Force and the military

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.490 align:middle line:84%
really should have more time
to analyze the situation

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.360 align:middle line:84%
and figure out
what was going on.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.160 align:middle line:90%
This sort of thing.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And then he said that
all but a few copies

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.510 align:middle line:84%
were ordered to be destroyed
and particularly burned.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.330 align:middle line:84%
This is according to General
Vandenberg's directive

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:08.590 align:middle line:90%
apparently.

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:11.500 align:middle line:84%
That, by the way, is
not Air Force procedure

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.850 align:middle line:84%
to destroy the documents
in that particular manner.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.060 align:middle line:84%
So we don't really
know what happened,

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.370 align:middle line:84%
but this is what
Ruppelt has told us.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:22.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we do
know is as a result

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:28.570 align:middle line:84%
of this decision by Vandenberg
to reject the conclusions

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:34.510 align:middle line:84%
that the extraterrestrial
hypothesis went very much

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:38.110 align:middle line:84%
out of favor within
the Air Force.

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.770 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the explanation
that these flying saucers could

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:45.160 align:middle line:84%
be from another
planet, that went away,

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.300 align:middle line:84%
and it became very, very clear
that if anyone within the Air

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.210 align:middle line:84%
Force or within the US
military for that matter

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.060 align:middle line:84%
were going to start talking
about these so-called flying

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.730 align:middle line:84%
saucers, better
not talk about them

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.970 align:middle line:84%
as if they were interplanetary
or extraterrestrial.

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:02.440 align:middle line:90%
That's right out.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.970 align:middle line:90%
No longer acceptable.

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:08.830 align:middle line:84%
Not that it really ever was,
but this made it very clear.

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:10.040 align:middle line:90%
You do not go there.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And what that really
meant ever after was

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:19.990 align:middle line:84%
at any time you get a study by
the US military on these flying

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:23.710 align:middle line:84%
saucers, all the analysts are
doing these mental gymnastics

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:28.210 align:middle line:84%
to avoid the obvious
conclusion that someone

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:32.440 align:middle line:84%
not of our civilization
is behind this phenomenon.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.289 align:middle line:84%
They had to go through
every single other type

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:39.708 align:middle line:84%
of explanation before they ever
get to the obvious one, which

00:08:39.708 --> 00:08:41.500 align:middle line:84%
they would never get
to because they're not

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.090 align:middle line:90%
allowed to go there.

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:47.230 align:middle line:84%
So the rejection by
Vandenberg of The Estimate

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:51.970 align:middle line:84%
of the Situation really
formally resulted

00:08:51.970 --> 00:09:00.220 align:middle line:84%
in this institutionalized
self-deception on UFOs

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:01.780 align:middle line:90%
within the Air Force.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, really for
the rest of the US society

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:10.280 align:middle line:84%
and really the
rest of the world.

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:12.160 align:middle line:84%
This was where the
decision really

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.840 align:middle line:90%
crystallized right there.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And incidentally,
in the aftermath

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:18.610 align:middle line:84%
of The Estimate
of the Situation,

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:22.210 align:middle line:84%
there was another study
done on the UFO situation.

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:24.880 align:middle line:84%
This was prepared by US
Air Force Intelligence,

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.340 align:middle line:84%
and it was called
Analysis of Flying Object

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.890 align:middle line:90%
Incidents in the United States.

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes nicknamed The Ghost
of the Estimate, because it's

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:35.560 align:middle line:84%
considered to be a watered-down
version of The Estimate

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:36.760 align:middle line:90%
of the Situation.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:40.030 align:middle line:84%
But really, they're
totally separate documents.

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:43.450 align:middle line:84%
What you have is
a long situation

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:48.130 align:middle line:84%
following Vandenberg's
rejection of the conclusions

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:53.290 align:middle line:84%
of the true estimate of the
situation in which talking

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:57.460 align:middle line:84%
about UFOs as interplanetary
was absolutely off limits.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:01.540 align:middle line:84%
My take on this ultimately is
that what Vandenberg was doing

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:05.470 align:middle line:84%
was reacting a little
bit out of fear

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:07.570 align:middle line:84%
that the lower levels
of the Air Force

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:11.020 align:middle line:84%
were stirring the pot just
a little bit too much.

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think what he's saying
to them is, you cool it.

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:18.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't need you to be
involved in this answer.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:21.397 align:middle line:84%
We already know
what this is about.

00:10:21.397 --> 00:10:23.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't think these
analysts at Project Sign

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:25.750 align:middle line:84%
were ever meant to get to
the truth on this phenomenon.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.070 align:middle line:90%
That's my own opinion.

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:30.730 align:middle line:84%
I think what it was
about was more busy work

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:31.550 align:middle line:90%
than anything else.

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And when they get too
close, break them up

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.620 align:middle line:84%
and have them move
on to other things.

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.970 align:middle line:90%
