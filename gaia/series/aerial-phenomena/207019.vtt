00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.980 align:middle line:10%
>> Now I'm going to tell you
one of the most astonishing UFO

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.480 align:middle line:10%
stories that exists anywhere.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.270 align:middle line:10%
And it's incredible, and it's so
little-known it still blows me

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.720 align:middle line:10%
away when I think about it.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.240 align:middle line:10%
And this is the incredible
story of a man named Dr. Eric

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.590 align:middle line:10%
Walker and his confirmation
of the existence of the group

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.310 align:middle line:10%
known as MJ-12, that is
the legendary elite group

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.480 align:middle line:10%
of individuals responsible for
covering up the UFO reality,

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.902 align:middle line:10%
that MJ-12.

00:00:41.902 --> 00:00:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Before we get to
Eric Walker, we've

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.980 align:middle line:84%
got to do a little
bit of back story,

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.890 align:middle line:84%
and this back story goes
back a couple of decades.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.220 align:middle line:84%
Way back in 1950, there was a
Canadian government official

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.350 align:middle line:90%
by the name of Wilbert Smith.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.020 align:middle line:84%
Wilbert Smith was part of
the Canadian Department

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.970 align:middle line:84%
of Transportation,
and he happened

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.240 align:middle line:84%
to be really interested
in these flying

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.680 align:middle line:84%
saucers that were
being discussed

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.870 align:middle line:90%
in the news, these UFOs.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.130 align:middle line:84%
It was a big interest of his,
and in September of 1950,

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.780 align:middle line:84%
Wilbert Smith had the occasion
to go to the Canadian Embassy

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.130 align:middle line:84%
in Washington DC in the United
States doing some work there.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.310 align:middle line:10%
While he was in
Washington, Wilbert Smith

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.640 align:middle line:10%
was able to meet with an
American scientist, a very

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.580 align:middle line:10%
prominent and powerful
American scientist,

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.410 align:middle line:10%
and they had a long conversation
about these flying saucers.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.870 align:middle line:84%
In this conversation,
the scientist

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.050 align:middle line:84%
told Smith, oh, yes,
this is totally real.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Yes, this entire subject is the
highest security classification

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.040 align:middle line:84%
in the United States
government, rating

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.340 align:middle line:84%
higher even than
the hydrogen bomb.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.010 align:middle line:84%
Keep in mind, in 1950,
the hydrogen bomb

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.170 align:middle line:84%
was, by far, the most prominent
military weapon being developed

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.570 align:middle line:84%
in the world, and
it was absolutely

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.550 align:middle line:84%
subject to the highest
levels of secrecy.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And here's this scientist
telling Wilbert Smith, no, no,

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.960 align:middle line:84%
flying saucers, all of that
is rated much more secret

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.150 align:middle line:90%
even than that project.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.540 align:middle line:84%
Smith gets all of
this information

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.500 align:middle line:84%
and then writes a
classified memorandum

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.220 align:middle line:84%
to his supervisors in
the Canadian government,

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.690 align:middle line:84%
and this document wasn't
revealed for several decades.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Smith himself died in 1962,
and this memo that he wrote

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.710 align:middle line:84%
was released during
the late 1970s.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's pretty amazing on its
own merits, without a doubt,

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.340 align:middle line:90%
but wait, there's more.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.250 align:middle line:10%
Sometime after Smith died,
another Canadian researcher

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.830 align:middle line:10%
by the name of
Arthur Bray was going

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.530 align:middle line:10%
through Smith's old
papers in Ottawa

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.780 align:middle line:10%
and found the original
handwritten notes

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.580 align:middle line:10%
that Wilbert Smith had written
during that 1950 conversation,

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.690 align:middle line:10%
and as a result, was able to
get the name of the scientist

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.730 align:middle line:10%
Smith had been talking to,
and that scientist's name was

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.740 align:middle line:10%
Robert Sarbacher.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.590 align:middle line:10%
It just so happened that
Robert Sarbacher was still

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.220 align:middle line:10%
alive in the early 1980s
when his name leaked out

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.550 align:middle line:10%
to a couple of American
UFO researchers.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.460 align:middle line:84%
One of them was Stanton
Friedman and another

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.230 align:middle line:90%
was William Steinman.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.570 align:middle line:84%
Both of these men, at the
time, were very active

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.240 align:middle line:84%
in the idea of UFO
crash retrievals.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.240 align:middle line:84%
And they thought, this is a
really interesting lead for us

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.100 align:middle line:90%
to follow up.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.760 align:middle line:10%
So Stanton Friedman was
able to speak with Sarbacher

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.310 align:middle line:10%
and did get a confirmation
that Sarbacher

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.280 align:middle line:10%
had this particular
meeting with Wilbert Smith.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.220 align:middle line:84%
But it was William Steinman
who actually hit true pay

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.780 align:middle line:90%
dirt with his meeting.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.760 align:middle line:84%
Sarbacher wrote a two-page
typed letter to Steinman

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.660 align:middle line:84%
not only confirming his
meeting with Wilbert Smith

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.940 align:middle line:84%
but stating that,
yes, this is all true.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.240 align:middle line:84%
We had been talking about
crash retrievals of UFOs

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.970 align:middle line:84%
even back in the 1950s, that
he had heard from discussions

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.000 align:middle line:84%
of his colleagues that
these beings were believed

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.480 align:middle line:84%
to be constructed something
like insects, all of this

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.420 align:middle line:84%
in this letter to Steinman,
which very quickly,

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.450 align:middle line:84%
as you can imagine, made the
rounds among a lot of other UFO

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.670 align:middle line:90%
researchers and beyond.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.227 align:middle line:84%
People in the
aerospace community

00:04:27.227 --> 00:04:28.310 align:middle line:90%
learned about this letter.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.435 align:middle line:84%
People within government
learned about this letter.

00:04:30.435 --> 00:04:32.840 align:middle line:90%
It kind of went everywhere.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.080 align:middle line:84%
So Sarbacher was a really
interesting connection

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.260 align:middle line:84%
through this whole
Wilbert Smith thing.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And in conversations with
Sarbacher, Steinman--

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.300 align:middle line:84%
shortly before
Sarbacher died in 1984,

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.900 align:middle line:84%
Steinman learned that
there was someone

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:59.170 align:middle line:84%
who probably had better direct
knowledge of the whole UFO

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.090 align:middle line:90%
crash retrieval scenario.

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.050 align:middle line:84%
When Sarbacher was talking
with Stanton Friedman in 1983,

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.400 align:middle line:84%
he said that he knew of one
scientist, at least, who

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.460 align:middle line:84%
had definitely attended meetings
at Wright-Patterson Air Force

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.880 align:middle line:84%
Base concerning crashed and
retrieved flying saucers,

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.680 align:middle line:84%
but he couldn't
remember the name.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.200 align:middle line:84%
About a year later, not
long before he died,

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.080 align:middle line:84%
he had a similar conversation
with William Steinman.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.910 align:middle line:84%
But in this case,
the two of them

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.800 align:middle line:84%
figured out that that
man was Dr. Eric Walker.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, Eric Walker was
a very well-known man.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.200 align:middle line:84%
He was probably most well-known
for having been the president

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.270 align:middle line:90%
of Penn State University.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.320 align:middle line:10%
But he was also head of one
of the most prominent military

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.580 align:middle line:10%
think tanks in the United
States, an organization known

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.950 align:middle line:10%
as the Institute for
Defense Analyses.

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.250 align:middle line:84%
But it was in his
capacity back in 1950-51

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.160 align:middle line:84%
as the executive secretary
of the military Research

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.030 align:middle line:84%
and Development Board where
Walker attended the meetings

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.360 align:middle line:84%
at Wright-Patterson Air Force
Base concerning crashed UFOs

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.190 align:middle line:90%
and flying saucers.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And this was a connection
that had to be followed up on.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.410 align:middle line:84%
Both Stanton Friedman
and William Steinman

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.350 align:middle line:84%
followed up with Walker
pretty much immediately.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.950 align:middle line:84%
This is 1984 where they
wanted to inquire about this,

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.890 align:middle line:84%
and they both just
completely got the brush-off.

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.530 align:middle line:10%
In fact, Steinman had his
letter sent back to him

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.110 align:middle line:10%
with a typed message
at the bottom saying,

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:28.780 align:middle line:10%
stop, don't try to find
me, in capital letters.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.080 align:middle line:84%
The two of them dropped
the matter from this point

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.650 align:middle line:84%
for a few years,
but then in 1987,

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.360 align:middle line:84%
the MJ-12 controversy arose
within the UFO community.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And this, of course, was
the alleged leaked documents

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.020 align:middle line:84%
pertaining to an
organization known

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.400 align:middle line:84%
as MJ-12 that got a lot
of researchers up in arms

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.200 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.000 align:middle line:90%
Is this true?

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.040 align:middle line:90%
Is this not true?

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.680 align:middle line:90%
What's the story with MJ-12?

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.680 align:middle line:84%
Steinman, at this time,
decided, you know,

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go find Eric Walker
again and see what happens.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Now that MJ-12 is out, let's
see if he wants to talk to me.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.660 align:middle line:90%
And he finds Eric Walker again.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.940 align:middle line:84%
This time, he calls
him on the phone.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.800 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of an amazing
situation happening here.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And to Steinman's
shock, when he's

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.130 align:middle line:84%
asking him all of
these questions,

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.520 align:middle line:84%
Walker is just
totally nonchalant.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.710 align:middle line:10%
Steinman says, look,
I'm calling concerning

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:26.310 align:middle line:10%
meetings that I believe you had
around 1950 at Wright-Patterson

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:30.480 align:middle line:10%
Air Force Base concerning
crashed UFOs and alien bodies

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.830 align:middle line:10%
and so forth.

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And Walker's answer actually
really astonished Steinman.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:39.660 align:middle line:84%
It was, yes, I attended those
meetings you're asking about.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:40.650 align:middle line:90%
What's the big deal?

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:43.290 align:middle line:84%
What are you getting
so excited about?

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:45.137 align:middle line:84%
Steinman continues
and he says, well,

00:07:45.137 --> 00:07:46.470 align:middle line:90%
what am I getting excited about?

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:48.165 align:middle line:90%
This is about flying saucers.

00:07:48.165 --> 00:07:49.290 align:middle line:90%
This is about alien bodies.

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:51.990 align:middle line:84%
This is the story
of the century.

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:53.470 align:middle line:90%
I think this is very important.

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:55.890 align:middle line:84%
I think the public has a
right to know about it.

00:07:55.890 --> 00:08:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And Walker says, look, you're
tilting at windmills here, pal.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:05.520 align:middle line:84%
This is way deeper than you have
any idea about, and the best

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.740 align:middle line:84%
advice I can give
you is just drop this

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.300 align:middle line:90%
and walk away from it.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.770 align:middle line:84%
Steinman's just blown away
by this whole response.

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.400 align:middle line:84%
A, here's Walker
confirming it to him,

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.340 align:middle line:84%
but he's doing it in
such a high-handed manner

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.650 align:middle line:84%
that you could see
Steinman really was

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:20.940 align:middle line:90%
getting a little bit annoyed.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.982 align:middle line:84%
I think they were getting
annoyed with each other

00:08:22.982 --> 00:08:25.380 align:middle line:84%
on the phone, but the
conversation continued.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:28.650 align:middle line:84%
Steinman actually
asked about MJ-12.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:31.110 align:middle line:84%
He said, have you heard of
this organization MJ-12?

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And Walker says, yes, I've
known about MJ-12 for 40 years.

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:38.280 align:middle line:84%
Keep in mind, it's
1987 when they're

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.679 align:middle line:84%
having this conversation,
so that would take it back

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:42.210 align:middle line:90%
to the late 1940s.

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:44.280 align:middle line:84%
He says, I've known
about this for 40 years.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.970 align:middle line:84%
Again, what are you
getting so worked up about?

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:51.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm not here to
satisfy your curiosity.

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:53.700 align:middle line:90%
This is way beyond your ability.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.630 align:middle line:84%
Best advice, just
drop it and walk away.

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Steinman says, I'm not
going to walk away.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And Eric Walker, presumably,
is like, yeah, fine,

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.000 align:middle line:90%
whatever, conversation ends.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.580 align:middle line:84%
That's the first
conversation, kind of amazing.

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:09.330 align:middle line:84%
So let's just pause
here at this moment.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Eric Walker was not part
of the conversation at all.

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:17.520 align:middle line:84%
This was all about Wilbert Smith
leading to Robert Sarbacher.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.990 align:middle line:84%
Conversations with Sarbacher
confirm the whole UFO scenario

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:23.100 align:middle line:90%
of the 1950s.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.860 align:middle line:84%
Sarbacher then gives up
the name Eric Walker.

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.480 align:middle line:90%
Sarbacher dies.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.830 align:middle line:90%
Researchers find Walker.

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And boom, here he is confirming
the reality of crashed UFOs,

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:38.760 align:middle line:90%
alien bodies, and so forth.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.030 align:middle line:90%
He didn't do it right away.

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:44.130 align:middle line:84%
Remember, back in 1984, he
was like, don't talk to me,

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:47.680 align:middle line:84%
and all of that, but
then he breaks in 1987.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:52.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, we don't really know, why
did Eric Walker start talking

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.420 align:middle line:90%
even a little bit in 1987?

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And I've often asked
myself this question.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:57.690 align:middle line:90%
No one really knows.

00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:59.730 align:middle line:84%
Walker has been dead
for many years now.

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:05.790 align:middle line:84%
But it could very well be
that, with the leak in 1987

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:09.030 align:middle line:84%
of the MJ-12 documents,
maybe it's possible

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:10.680 align:middle line:84%
that Walker was just
caught off guard.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.420 align:middle line:84%
Maybe he thought,
well, it's out.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:16.200 align:middle line:84%
I'll talk about this to this
random person on the phone.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.052 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:10:17.052 --> 00:10:19.260 align:middle line:84%
We don't really know what
was going through his mind.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.690 align:middle line:10%
What we do know is that
Steinman continued to follow up,

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:25.740 align:middle line:10%
but each time, he got less and
less information out of Walker.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.810 align:middle line:10%
He dropped out of
the investigation

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:30.840 align:middle line:10%
and other researchers
like Grant Cameron,

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:34.830 align:middle line:10%
who is still a very active UFO
researcher today, was involved.

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:38.370 align:middle line:84%
His associate, T. Scott
Crain, also was involved.

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:41.430 align:middle line:84%
The two of them tried following
up, getting information

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:46.180 align:middle line:84%
from Walker, and getting these
little hints here and there,

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:50.610 align:middle line:84%
but not really getting
the direct confirmation

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:52.080 align:middle line:90%
that they were asking.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.310 align:middle line:84%
Another individual got
involved around 1990,

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:58.680 align:middle line:84%
a man who went by different
names, Armen Victorian

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.860 align:middle line:84%
and Henry Azadehdel,
among others,

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:05.550 align:middle line:84%
who had a long series of
conversations with Walker

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:06.510 align:middle line:90%
about this.

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:10.230 align:middle line:84%
We've got the transcript
of this that he provided.

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And in a couple of
their conversations,

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:16.260 align:middle line:84%
he's talking to Walker about
the reality of this phenomenon.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.870 align:middle line:84%
Walker's saying,
look, unless you

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:21.780 align:middle line:84%
have incredibly advanced
mathematics skills

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:25.350 align:middle line:84%
or deep knowledge
of psi phenomena--

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.420 align:middle line:84%
that is psi, P-S-I, that
is psychic phenomenon.

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:31.360 align:middle line:84%
He said, unless you have
a high level of skill

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.030 align:middle line:84%
in either of those,
no one's going

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:35.710 align:middle line:90%
to want you for this program.

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:37.850 align:middle line:90%
You have nothing to offer.

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:40.180 align:middle line:84%
So he made that
much of an admission

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:42.220 align:middle line:84%
and made additional
confirmations

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:46.030 align:middle line:84%
of the reality of an
MJ-12-type group and a cover

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:48.940 align:middle line:84%
up and so forth, indicating
that it was international,

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:52.590 align:middle line:84%
not simply US, and things like
that, but that was about it.

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:53.390 align:middle line:90%
That was about it.

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And by the end of 1990 or
so, it was very obvious

00:11:56.650 --> 00:12:00.820 align:middle line:84%
that Eric Walker was not going
to be talking to anyone anymore

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:01.990 align:middle line:90%
about this subject.

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:04.660 align:middle line:84%
He pretty much shut it down
from that point onward.

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.030 align:middle line:90%
Eric Walker died in 1995.

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:10.690 align:middle line:84%
His papers, the ones that
are available at least,

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:14.440 align:middle line:84%
don't have anything to do
with UFOs, MJ-12, or anything

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.380 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:18.190 align:middle line:84%
But we do have these
interesting admissions, indeed.

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:20.230 align:middle line:84%
I myself spoke with
William Steinman

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:24.460 align:middle line:84%
some years ago about this and
other areas of his research.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:28.180 align:middle line:84%
Steinman was a very dedicated,
very motivated UFO researcher

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:29.830 align:middle line:90%
for a number of years.

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And even in my conversation
with him many years later,

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.590 align:middle line:84%
he remained quite passionate
about the subject,

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:40.630 align:middle line:84%
quite adamant about his
conversation with Eric Walker.

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:44.500 align:middle line:84%
So I like this story of Eric
Walker for a lot of reasons,

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:49.900 align:middle line:84%
but it's just this fascinating
journey, an almost convoluted

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:52.990 align:middle line:84%
journey where you go from
one point to another point

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:55.690 align:middle line:84%
to another point to another
point, and each of them,

00:12:55.690 --> 00:13:00.910 align:middle line:84%
along the way, provides
an unlikely but genuine

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:07.510 align:middle line:84%
confirmation of not only the
UFO reality but of the reality

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:14.650 align:middle line:84%
of retrieval of crashed UFOs
and the study of alien beings

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:19.330 align:middle line:84%
and bodies along with it,
including the existence

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:23.020 align:middle line:84%
of a group like MJ-12
that would be charged

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.660 align:middle line:84%
with managing the
whole situation

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.040 align:middle line:84%
from an international
point of view.

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.820 align:middle line:84%
It's all there in the
Eric Walker story.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:32.420 align:middle line:84%
A few people have
written about it.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.240 align:middle line:84%
I wrote about it in
a couple of my books.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:38.260 align:middle line:84%
Other people have provided a
pretty detailed story of it,

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:44.410 align:middle line:84%
but it's still one of these
all too little-known stories.

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:47.830 align:middle line:84%
It should be much better-known
than it is, in my opinion.

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:49.770 align:middle line:90%
Heck of a story.

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:54.000 align:middle line:90%
