00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:11.760 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.790 align:middle line:10%
>> I honestly feel that
we usually forget just how

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.060 align:middle line:10%
unbelievable nuclear
technology happens to be.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.310 align:middle line:10%
But the fact that
human beings have

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.880 align:middle line:10%
been able to unlock the secret
of this tiny, little thing

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.180 align:middle line:10%
called the atom
and to utilize it

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.414 align:middle line:10%
in such a way as to generate
incredible amounts of energy,

00:00:32.414 --> 00:00:35.700 align:middle line:10%
an energy that can do
all kinds of things

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.030 align:middle line:10%
as well as generate a lot
of dangerous toxic waste,

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.870 align:middle line:10%
of course.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.890 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that
we human beings

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.960 align:middle line:84%
have been able to unlock
the atom in such a manner

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.730 align:middle line:84%
as to get all of
this energy out--

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.152 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just
incredible to me

00:00:53.152 --> 00:00:54.360 align:middle line:90%
when you just stop and think.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.010 align:middle line:90%
And we just go about our days.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And you don't even
think about it.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.880 align:middle line:84%
But it's really
quite significant.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And in context with the whole
situation of UAP or UFOs,

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.550 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a lot
of importance here.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.840 align:middle line:90%
A lot.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.970 align:middle line:84%
It's during the
Second World War,

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.790 align:middle line:84%
1945, when the first atomic
bomb is detonated in history.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.850 align:middle line:90%
We've never done this before.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.660 align:middle line:84%
When the scientists at
Los Alamos in 1945--

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.360 align:middle line:84%
before they detonated
that bomb, they actually

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.290 align:middle line:84%
had no idea if this was going to
destroy the entire world, if it

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.460 align:middle line:84%
would set off a chain
reaction that would engulf us

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.220 align:middle line:90%
all in catastrophic hellfire.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And the crazy thing
is they did it anyway.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.130 align:middle line:90%
Good for us that didn't happen.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.090 align:middle line:84%
But unlocking the
secret to the atom

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.110 align:middle line:84%
is an absolutely critical
moment in human history.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And right out of the
gate in the 1940s, when

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.700 align:middle line:84%
we started noticing these
so-called flying saucers,

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.280 align:middle line:84%
a lot of speculation
followed that,

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.120 align:middle line:84%
are these beings
interested in us,

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.729 align:middle line:84%
because they see
that we have unlocked

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.250 align:middle line:84%
this incredible secret,
this major universal secret,

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.210 align:middle line:84%
that of the atom and
nuclear technology?

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of reason to think

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.730 align:middle line:90%
that this is actually true.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.510 align:middle line:84%
It's not that there weren't
UFOs in ancient times.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.210 align:middle line:84%
It's not that there
weren't anomalous events

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.580 align:middle line:84%
that people of the
distant past encountered.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.780 align:middle line:90%
They probably did.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.730 align:middle line:84%
There's enough
interesting reports

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.440 align:middle line:90%
that suggest that in my view.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.880 align:middle line:84%
But it definitely looks to
me that things absolutely

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.280 align:middle line:90%
picked up in the post-1945 era.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.180 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of the
key UFO sightings,

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.800 align:middle line:10%
particularly the
military UFO sightings,

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.270 align:middle line:10%
had a strong connection
to nuclear technology--

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.460 align:middle line:10%
atomic testing sites,
uranium mines, missile

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.750 align:middle line:10%
silos with nuclear weapons,
and nuclear technology labs,

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.340 align:middle line:10%
and so forth.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.750 align:middle line:84%
In a way, that is far
beyond just chance.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.110 align:middle line:84%
So there's a very
strong correlation

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:22.280 align:middle line:84%
with UFOs or UAP and these
particular types of facilities.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to talk about
just a few of them here.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.060 align:middle line:10%
One of the interesting sites
where a lot of this activity

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.500 align:middle line:10%
happened was the Hanford Site.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.430 align:middle line:84%
That's the Hanford Atomic
Energy Commission plant,

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.673 align:middle line:90%
which is now decommissioned.

00:03:33.673 --> 00:03:34.590 align:middle line:90%
It's not in operation.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.430 align:middle line:90%
It was very toxic.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.950 align:middle line:84%
This is in the
state of Washington,

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.058 align:middle line:84%
off the Pacific Coast
in northwestern US.

00:03:41.058 --> 00:03:42.600 align:middle line:84%
But this is a really
important place.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.640 align:middle line:90%
So it was created in 1943.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.900 align:middle line:84%
It was the first ever
plutonium production plant

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.970 align:middle line:90%
in the world, the Hanford Site.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And there were UFOs being
seen there on a regular basis.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.745 align:middle line:84%
There are probably so
many of these encounters

00:03:58.745 --> 00:04:00.120 align:middle line:84%
that we'll never
even know about.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.000 align:middle line:84%
We get a smattering
of them that have

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.700 align:middle line:84%
come through Freedom of
Information Act, and just

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.490 align:middle line:84%
general military leaks, and
so forth, not nearly enough

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:10.290 align:middle line:90%
in my view.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.250 align:middle line:84%
But there's a few
that we know about.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.760 align:middle line:84%
In the late 1940s,
early 1950s, there

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.760 align:middle line:84%
were lot of UFOs being
seen over the Hanford Site.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.880 align:middle line:90%
One was from May 21, 1949.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.920 align:middle line:84%
You have an F-82
fighter aircraft

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.380 align:middle line:90%
being vectored in to the area.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Because an unusual
object had been seen,

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.540 align:middle line:90%
believed to be a UFO.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.400 align:middle line:84%
Back at this particular
time, one thing

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.800 align:middle line:84%
that really doesn't
get discussed anymore

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.490 align:middle line:84%
is how American aircraft,
American fighter

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.780 align:middle line:84%
planes were regularly
being scrambled

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.560 align:middle line:84%
to investigate and
intercept unknown objects

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.650 align:middle line:90%
over sensitive American bases.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.350 align:middle line:10%
Now, when you look at the
map of the United States,

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.520 align:middle line:10%
you can really ask yourself,
what nation could possibly

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.520 align:middle line:10%
be sending their
secret aircraft over

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.090 align:middle line:10%
to spy on the United States?

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.890 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:02.820 align:middle line:90%
Canada?

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.230 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.710 align:middle line:84%
The Russians were also not
really good candidates.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.410 align:middle line:84%
Because particularly
in the late '40s,

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.100 align:middle line:84%
it's not like they had
long-range spy planes that

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.320 align:middle line:84%
could maneuver the
way that UFOs could,

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.300 align:middle line:84%
to just hang around over places
like the Hanford plant, or Los

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.240 align:middle line:84%
Alamos, or Oak Ridge, or
any of these other places.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.140 align:middle line:90%
Not really.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.057 align:middle line:84%
And there's no evidence
that the Russians ever

00:05:27.057 --> 00:05:29.520 align:middle line:84%
were engaged in this as
far as anyone can tell.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:35.700 align:middle line:84%
But on May 21, 1949, you have an
F-82 fighter plane vectored in

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.670 align:middle line:90%
to investigate the Hanford area.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.220 align:middle line:84%
This disc head been
seen maneuvering

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.790 align:middle line:84%
at speeds much greater
than that of a fighter jet.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:45.970 align:middle line:90%
Much greater.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.270 align:middle line:84%
So by the time the
F-82 gets there,

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.350 align:middle line:90%
that disc is just long gone.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.310 align:middle line:84%
It's just one of many of
these types of incidents that

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.410 align:middle line:90%
occurred over the Hanford Site.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.990 align:middle line:84%
One of the most interesting
of these documents

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.710 align:middle line:84%
about the Hanford Site
was dated August 4, 1950.

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.320 align:middle line:84%
It was written by
a Major Carlen.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And let me just
read this to you.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:07.620 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.970 align:middle line:84%
"Since 30 July 1950,
objects round in form

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.120 align:middle line:84%
have been sighted over
the Hanford AEC Plant.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.800 align:middle line:84%
These objects reportedly were
above 15,000 feet in altitude.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Air Force jets
attempted interception

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.050 align:middle line:90%
with negative results.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.440 align:middle line:84%
All units, including the
anti-aircraft battalion,

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.800 align:middle line:84%
radar units, Air Force
fighter squadrons,

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.320 align:middle line:84%
and the Federal Bureau
of Investigation

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.800 align:middle line:84%
have been alerted for
further observation.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.100 align:middle line:84%
The Atomic Energy Commission
states that the investigation

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.800 align:middle line:84%
is continuing, and
complete details

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.660 align:middle line:90%
will be forwarded later."

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.690 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot to unpack in
that brief, little statement,

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.320 align:middle line:90%
in that brief, little memo.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.550 align:middle line:90%
I mean, objects round in form.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:57.810 align:middle line:84%
OK, so they're not able to
identify these as anything

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:58.890 align:middle line:90%
specific, whatsoever.

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:01.110 align:middle line:84%
And they certainly
don't look like any kind

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.310 align:middle line:84%
of ordinary aircraft
with fuselage, and wings,

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.110 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:05.190 align:middle line:90%
Round in form.

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.560 align:middle line:84%
What can be in the air
that's round in form?

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.210 align:middle line:90%
Well, balloons.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:10.620 align:middle line:90%
OK, sure.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:15.150 align:middle line:84%
But then, why wouldn't
balloons be easily taken down

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.480 align:middle line:84%
by any old aircraft
going up to get them?

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.720 align:middle line:84%
They state that aircraft
attempt to intercept

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.680 align:middle line:84%
these things with negative
results, so that doesn't work.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, balloons or
any other kind of round,

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:31.350 align:middle line:84%
harmless objects are not
going to be the cause

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:34.380 align:middle line:84%
to alert anti-aircraft
battalions

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:38.880 align:middle line:84%
and alerting all of these
agencies, including the FBI.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, the
Atomic Energy Commission,

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.760 align:middle line:84%
which was in charge of
all nuclear technology,

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.970 align:middle line:84%
is an organization
of extreme levels

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:51.750 align:middle line:84%
of secrecy and protection from
public inquiry to this day.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And they were definitely
involved, definitely

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.250 align:middle line:90%
concerned about this.

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.750 align:middle line:84%
Another interesting
thing about that

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:59.460 align:middle line:84%
is the last
statement, which just

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:02.400 align:middle line:84%
said the investigation is
continuing and we'll keep you

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.840 align:middle line:90%
posted on further results--

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.860 align:middle line:84%
well, no one has found out what
those further results happen

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:07.660 align:middle line:90%
to be.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:11.910 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what any of that
investigation developed into.

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:14.160 align:middle line:84%
Because, well,
that's not something

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.383 align:middle line:90%
that we have access to.

00:08:15.383 --> 00:08:16.800 align:middle line:84%
But it's a very
interesting thing.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:23.370 align:middle line:84%
So you've got these objects
over a critically important area

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:26.550 align:middle line:84%
of nuclear technology
in the United States,

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:27.750 align:middle line:90%
part of the Cold War.

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And we have no idea
what these things were

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.700 align:middle line:90%
or what they could have been.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.419 align:middle line:84%
Now, in addition to that,
there was a significant number

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:40.590 align:middle line:84%
of sightings over the Oak
Ridge nuclear facility

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:42.659 align:middle line:90%
in the state of Tennessee.

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:45.780 align:middle line:84%
This is another of the
very important sites

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.490 align:middle line:84%
where the United
States developed

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:51.510 align:middle line:84%
its atomic technology, and
nuclear science, and so forth.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And like Los Alamos, which
I covered in another program

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.400 align:middle line:84%
in this series, and like
Hanford, which I just

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:02.370 align:middle line:84%
talked about, Oak Ridge also was
the scene, since 1947 onward,

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:05.070 align:middle line:84%
of a large number
of UFO sightings.

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:06.690 align:middle line:90%
Large numbers.

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:10.410 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one goes
back to June of 1947,

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:15.540 align:middle line:84%
a month before Roswell, probably
even before the famous sighting

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:19.200 align:middle line:84%
by flyer Kenneth Arnold
of the so-called flying

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.810 align:middle line:84%
saucers out on the
West Coast of the US.

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:25.920 align:middle line:84%
In 1947, nuclear technology
was absolutely cutting edge.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, flying over a
nuclear installation was

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.500 align:middle line:90%
a very serious matter, indeed.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:36.420 align:middle line:84%
Yet, something highly unusual
was over the Oak Ridge facility

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.430 align:middle line:90%
in June of 1947.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And we know about this
in a 1949 FBI memorandum

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.548 align:middle line:90%
which talked about it.

00:09:44.548 --> 00:09:46.590 align:middle line:84%
What was incredible is
that there were apparently

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:51.270 align:middle line:84%
visual observation and radar
tracking of this object.

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And someone took a
photograph of it.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:10:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And there were apparently 24
copies made of that photograph.

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:02.193 align:middle line:90%
24 copies.

00:10:02.193 --> 00:10:04.110 align:middle line:84%
That sounds like an
interesting picture to me.

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:06.213 align:middle line:84%
We have no idea what
the thing looked like,

00:10:06.213 --> 00:10:08.130 align:middle line:84%
because the pictures
have never been released.

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:09.930 align:middle line:84%
But I assume that
someone thought

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.190 align:middle line:90%
it was pretty interesting.

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:15.360 align:middle line:84%
By 1948, '49, 1950, UFO
sightings over Oak Ridge

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.570 align:middle line:84%
were tracked with such
frequency that there

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:20.880 align:middle line:84%
were FBI memos that listed
a whole bunch of them

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.140 align:middle line:90%
in chronological order.

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:26.280 align:middle line:84%
We're talking dozens of them
in a very short period of time.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.440 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, Oak Ridge was
definitely the scene

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.660 align:middle line:84%
of a lot of very
unusual activity.

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Something seemed to have
been snooping around there.

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:36.030 align:middle line:84%
To me, the most interesting
of the Oak Ridge cases

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:41.340 align:middle line:84%
is from July of 1953 where
an employee at Oak Ridge

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:47.610 align:middle line:84%
noticed an F-86 fighter
aircraft circling over the area

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:49.860 align:middle line:84%
couple of times
and then flying off

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.020 align:middle line:90%
in the direction of Knoxville.

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:55.560 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, he
sees a black object

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:59.280 align:middle line:84%
come out of a very
high cloud and start

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.630 align:middle line:84%
doing maneuvers that
are, frankly, impossible

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:04.920 align:middle line:90%
for us to understand.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.960 align:middle line:90%
Let me read this memo to you.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.980 align:middle line:84%
"At approximately 3:00
PM on July 19, 1953,

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:14.760 align:middle line:84%
an F-86 aircraft was observed
flying over the Oak Ridge

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.810 align:middle line:84%
residential area, making circles
at what appeared to the writer

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:22.680 align:middle line:84%
to be approximately
2,500 or 3,500 feet.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:27.030 align:middle line:84%
The F-86 flew over the area in
this manner for approximately

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:28.690 align:middle line:90%
10 or 15 minutes.

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:30.270 align:middle line:84%
The writer, together
with his wife,

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:34.560 align:middle line:84%
observed the aircraft through a
pair of 6-power field glasses.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.540 align:middle line:84%
After the aircraft
flew in what appeared

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.450 align:middle line:84%
to be the direction of
Knoxville, Tennessee,

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.420 align:middle line:84%
a black object moved out
of a high white cloud

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:45.930 align:middle line:84%
directly over the area
the F-86 had been flying.

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:50.130 align:middle line:84%
This object began to travel
at a tremendous speed

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:51.960 align:middle line:90%
in a large circle.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.180 align:middle line:84%
The action on the part
of the unknown object

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.580 align:middle line:84%
continued for at
least five minutes.

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.290 align:middle line:84%
During the circle
of this object,

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:01.710 align:middle line:84%
it appeared at times to
be in the shape of a cigar

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:04.050 align:middle line:90%
and at other times round.

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:07.170 align:middle line:84%
This object was
extremely black in color,

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:10.050 align:middle line:84%
having an appearance
of a deep black metal

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:12.660 align:middle line:90%
exterior with a fine gloss.

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.970 align:middle line:84%
It did not leave a
vapor trail or were

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:17.280 align:middle line:84%
there are any lights
of shine noticed.

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.930 align:middle line:90%
No sound was heard.

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:21.570 align:middle line:84%
The object flew east
at a tremendous speed

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:24.240 align:middle line:84%
for what appeared to be
approximately three miles where

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.650 align:middle line:90%
it stopped.

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:30.390 align:middle line:84%
The object was then joined by
two more of these same objects.

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:33.930 align:middle line:84%
A formation similar to
a spread V was formed.

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And the objects, at
a tremendous speed,

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.623 align:middle line:90%
flew in an eastward direction."

00:12:38.623 --> 00:12:40.290 align:middle line:84%
You read reports like
that, and you just

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:44.520 align:middle line:84%
go, wow, where was freedom
of information back in 1953?

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.800 align:middle line:84%
Could you imagine what
the public reaction

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.930 align:middle line:84%
might have been if
a report like that

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:52.183 align:middle line:84%
had been able to get out to
the general public at the time?

00:12:52.183 --> 00:12:53.850 align:middle line:84%
As it stands, we
didn't learn about this

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:56.850 align:middle line:84%
until many, many decades
later when, who knows?

00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:58.470 align:middle line:90%
Did people just stop caring?

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:00.990 align:middle line:84%
Report comes out, drops
into the memory hole,

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:03.120 align:middle line:84%
and is completely
forgotten thereafter.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.670 align:middle line:90%
But that's an amazing case.

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:07.260 align:middle line:90%
And what could this have been?

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.170 align:middle line:84%
What can fly at a
tremendous speed,

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:13.170 align:middle line:84%
and then stop, and
then to be joined

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:16.020 align:middle line:84%
by two other similar
objects, whereupon

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:19.860 align:middle line:84%
they take off at a tremendous
speed and they're gone?

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Something very unusual
has been going on

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.090 align:middle line:90%
at these nuclear facilities.

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:25.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes, indeed.

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:28.938 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, not only
within the United States.

00:13:28.938 --> 00:13:31.230 align:middle line:84%
There's one other report I
want to share with you here,

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:34.950 align:middle line:84%
about a really
extraordinary UFO being seen

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:37.950 align:middle line:84%
over a uranium mine
in what was then

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:40.770 align:middle line:90%
the Belgian Congo in Africa.

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:46.020 align:middle line:84%
This incident is from a
report from March of 1952,

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:48.540 align:middle line:84%
over the southern part
of the Belgian Congo,

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:51.120 align:middle line:84%
near a place called
the Luapula River where

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:55.480 align:middle line:84%
there was an active uranium
mine in operation at the time.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And you have a
number of witnesses

00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:02.430 align:middle line:84%
on the ground seeing several
very, very interesting UFOs.

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:05.430 align:middle line:84%
These were described
as fiery disks

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:10.020 align:middle line:84%
flying in what was described
as elegant curves in the area,

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:13.260 align:middle line:84%
making incredible maneuvers,
incredible speeds, stopping,

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:17.370 align:middle line:84%
zigzagging, and things that
just no one knew how to explain.

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:20.670 align:middle line:84%
So at that point, they scramble
a fighter plane to investigate.

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:23.580 align:middle line:84%
The name of the pilot
was a Commander Pierre.

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.630 align:middle line:90%
He gets into his fighter plane.

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:30.900 align:middle line:84%
He gets to within, he says,
about 100 or so meters from one

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.447 align:middle line:84%
of the objects,
really quite close.

00:14:33.447 --> 00:14:34.530 align:middle line:90%
He gets a good look at it.

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:36.360 align:middle line:84%
I want to read from
the report here.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:40.230 align:middle line:84%
"On his first approach, he came
within about 120 meters of one

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:41.220 align:middle line:90%
of the discs.

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:43.710 align:middle line:84%
According to the
estimates, the saucer

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:48.870 align:middle line:84%
had a diameter from 12 to 15
meters and was discus shaped.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:52.300 align:middle line:84%
The inner core remained
absolutely still.

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And a knob coming
out of the center

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:58.830 align:middle line:84%
and several small openings
could plainly be seen.

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:02.310 align:middle line:84%
The outer rim was
completely veiled in fire

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:05.670 align:middle line:84%
and must have had an
enormous speed of rotation.

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:09.780 align:middle line:84%
The color of the metal was
similar to that of aluminum."

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Commander Pierre tried
for about 15 minutes

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.440 align:middle line:90%
to engage with these discs.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was completely
unable to do anything.

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:20.100 align:middle line:84%
The speeds were beyond
anything that he could achieve.

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.540 align:middle line:84%
The maneuverability--
these things

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:24.900 align:middle line:84%
could seemingly stop
and start and move

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:28.443 align:middle line:84%
in ways that would kill
any kind of human being

00:15:28.443 --> 00:15:29.860 align:middle line:84%
that would be
inside these things.

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And his conclusion is that they
probably weren't even manned.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:36.240 align:middle line:84%
He didn't see how it
could be possible.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.860 align:middle line:84%
After about 15 minutes, he
just had to give up the chase.

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:41.130 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing that
he could do about them.

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, here again,
so we've got UFOs

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:47.160 align:middle line:84%
being seen over an
active place having

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.670 align:middle line:84%
to do with nuclear technology
and nuclear production.

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:52.650 align:middle line:84%
I think that they're
interested in our nukes.

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:55.260 align:middle line:84%
I think they're interested
in our atomic energy.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.140 align:middle line:84%
This is something that is of
a high level of significance.

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And whoever is behind these
objects, these UAP, these UFOs,

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:06.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't think this is an
American secret project.

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:08.190 align:middle line:84%
It certainly doesn't
seem like it would be.

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And if it's Russian,
the Russians

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.730 align:middle line:84%
are certainly going about that
in a very bizarre way, indeed.

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:17.730 align:middle line:84%
If they want to study
and spy on a uranium

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:20.160 align:middle line:84%
mine in Belgian Congo,
you'd think that they'd

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.930 align:middle line:90%
have better ways of doing it.

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Whatever this object
was, is nothing

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.240 align:middle line:84%
that we had ever been
able to identify.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.390 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:30.330 align:middle line:84%
These stories are
just scratching

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:32.100 align:middle line:84%
the surface, frankly,
of the connection

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.720 align:middle line:90%
between UFOs and nukes.

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.300 align:middle line:90%
There's just so much there.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.310 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me that
none of this is

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:44.160 align:middle line:84%
an accident, that our technology
in this particular area

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:48.930 align:middle line:84%
is of definite interest
to other people,

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:53.640 align:middle line:84%
to other beings who are taking
a look at us and wondering,

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.770 align:middle line:90%
what are these humans up to now?

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:59.120 align:middle line:90%
