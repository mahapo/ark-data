00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.520 align:middle line:10%
>> There are very few subjects
as messy as UFOs and within

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.900 align:middle line:10%
the UFO field, there's
probably no area as messy

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.760 align:middle line:10%
as the phenomenon of apparent
or alleged alien abduction

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.250 align:middle line:10%
or contact with non-human
extraterrestrial beings.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And I say messy because it's
a situation where you've

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.030 align:middle line:84%
got a lot of stories
that have come

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.630 align:middle line:84%
from many different people,
and really believable, credible

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:41.800 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.370 align:middle line:84%
At the same time as the
fact that the stories

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.050 align:middle line:84%
themselves seem just very
difficult for most people

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.990 align:middle line:90%
to swallow, to accept.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And then it's also messy because
within those massive stories,

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.140 align:middle line:84%
you get a very wide
range of encounters

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.400 align:middle line:90%
that people have described.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.210 align:middle line:84%
So all of this gives
you a very wide array

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.150 align:middle line:84%
of encounters or apparent
encounters, let's say,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.650 align:middle line:84%
that people have with what seems
to be non-human intelligences.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.590 align:middle line:84%
On top of that, you get
what I would almost call

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.760 align:middle line:90%
a kind of ideological divide.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.000 align:middle line:84%
You almost call it
a political divide

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.040 align:middle line:84%
between people who look at this
in a very, very positive way

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.070 align:middle line:84%
and people who tend to look
at this type of encounter

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.190 align:middle line:90%
in a predominantly negative way.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.330 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like liberal versus
conservative in a lot of ways.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.370 align:middle line:84%
That really does
seem to come through.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying
that that reflects

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.620 align:middle line:84%
in the political
viewpoints of those people.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.420 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.580 align:middle line:84%
We should do a study
on that one, right?

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.940 align:middle line:84%
But there's definitely
an ideological breakdown

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.990 align:middle line:84%
in how these other
beings are perceived.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.980 align:middle line:90%
Are they good guys?

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.690 align:middle line:90%
Or are they not good guys?

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.740 align:middle line:90%
Are they bad guys?

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.610 align:middle line:84%
So what we can definitely
say is that there

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.590 align:middle line:84%
are distinguishing
characteristics

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.050 align:middle line:84%
between these types
of encounters.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.960 align:middle line:84%
So on the positive side, you
can say a few things here.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.660 align:middle line:84%
One is that stories of
positive interaction

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.050 align:middle line:84%
go back frankly
through the centuries.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.220 align:middle line:84%
They go back even before
we had this idea of flying

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.620 align:middle line:90%
saucers and extraterrestrials.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.480 align:middle line:84%
They go back through
the ages, if you

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.580 align:middle line:84%
want to include encounters
that people have

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.100 align:middle line:84%
with apparent
spiritual entities,

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.860 align:middle line:84%
even stories out of the
Bible, encounters with angels,

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.520 align:middle line:84%
encounters with entities
providing messages

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.940 align:middle line:90%
of all different types.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.540 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
goes all the way back

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.990 align:middle line:90%
through recorded human history.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.330 align:middle line:84%
By and large, those encounters
are described as awe-inspiring

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.460 align:middle line:84%
and I would say more positive
than negative overall.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.340 align:middle line:84%
We might choose to
include those in terms

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.130 align:middle line:90%
of the long history of contact.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.310 align:middle line:84%
When you get more
recent in our history,

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.830 align:middle line:84%
in the 19th and
early 20th century,

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.700 align:middle line:84%
there are also a number of
really interesting stories

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.385 align:middle line:84%
of people who've had
encounters with other beings.

00:03:14.385 --> 00:03:16.010 align:middle line:84%
Often, these other
beings are described

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.050 align:middle line:84%
as totally human-looking
but there's

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.700 align:middle line:90%
something different about them.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.760 align:middle line:10%
Over the 20th century,
a lot of UFO researchers

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.230 align:middle line:10%
were able to pull out many
early accounts of contact

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.180 align:middle line:10%
with these types of beings.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.520 align:middle line:84%
You know, back in
the 1920s and '30s,

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.020 align:middle line:84%
there'd be people remembering
their childhood encounter

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.240 align:middle line:84%
with the land and craft and
totally human-looking beings

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.330 align:middle line:84%
who are operating
those craft but somehow

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.750 align:middle line:84%
seem a little different
than ordinary human beings.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.080 align:middle line:84%
Implication, the
assumption is that they

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.820 align:middle line:84%
were dealing with
extraterrestrials who look just

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.990 align:middle line:84%
like us and who were on a
mission for a brief period

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.410 align:middle line:84%
of time here on Earth doing
their thing and then they left.

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:01.970 align:middle line:84%
There's a number of
these encounters,

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.870 align:middle line:90%
it's more than you'd expect.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.580 align:middle line:84%
So what to make of that
is a whole other question,

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.800 align:middle line:90%
but that's part of the history.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.850 align:middle line:84%
As you go further
into the 1950s, 1960s,

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.350 align:middle line:84%
you get the whole story of the
contactees dealing with, again,

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.720 align:middle line:84%
very human-looking beings
in landed spaceships.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And by this time,
people were reporting

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.630 align:middle line:84%
messages coming from these
other beings about humanity's

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.760 align:middle line:84%
got to get its act
together, there's

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.540 align:middle line:84%
the threat of nuclear
war, we're concerned

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.090 align:middle line:84%
about your atomic weapons
and this type of thing

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.230 align:middle line:90%
was very common.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.650 align:middle line:10%
People like George Adamski
and George Hunt Williamson

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.900 align:middle line:10%
and Truman Bethurum, and
many, many, many others

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.670 align:middle line:10%
have had these
types of encounters,

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.110 align:middle line:10%
these types of stories.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.720 align:middle line:84%
They've been accused of
being fakers and hoaxers,

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.020 align:middle line:84%
and other people have strongly
believed their account.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And that disagreement
goes down to this day.

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.380 align:middle line:84%
But it's definitely
true that there

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.970 align:middle line:84%
have been all of these accounts,
and these claims of very

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.540 align:middle line:84%
positive encounters with
wonderful beings who

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.310 align:middle line:90%
are here to help us.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.790 align:middle line:84%
Back in the '50s, they were
said to be from the planet Venus

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.430 align:middle line:84%
and they had
beautiful blonde hair,

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.410 align:middle line:84%
and they were just
absolutely perfect

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.720 align:middle line:90%
physical human specimens.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.200 align:middle line:84%
But they were just more advanced
psychologically and mentally,

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.070 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.640 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays, you hear that they're
not from Venus because Venus

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:32.780 align:middle line:90%
is ridiculously hot.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:33.800 align:middle line:90%
We now know this.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.350 align:middle line:84%
But they'll be from places like
the Pleiades or some other area

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.990 align:middle line:84%
that we haven't been
able to investigate yet.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.320 align:middle line:84%
The idea of contact
with benevolent beings

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.000 align:middle line:84%
sort of morphed quite a bit
through the 1970s and '80s

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.080 align:middle line:90%
and '90s and beyond.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And it went from
predominantly talking

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.020 align:middle line:84%
about contact with
physical beings

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.580 align:middle line:84%
to kind of a spiritual
contact with these very

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.050 align:middle line:90%
same types of beings.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Rise of channeling
really happens

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.180 align:middle line:90%
during the '70s and '80s.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual downloads,
you could say,

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.420 align:middle line:90%
become more and more common.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And this transformation really
coincides almost exactly

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.120 align:middle line:84%
with the rise of, you
might say, the New Age

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.680 align:middle line:84%
movement in Western society
starting in the 1970s.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.620 align:middle line:84%
I would assume that there
is a relationship there,

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.880 align:middle line:90%
makes sense to me.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.250 align:middle line:84%
With a greater and greater
prevalence of people

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.020 align:middle line:84%
doing work like
channeling, you're

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.720 align:middle line:84%
going to get some of
them who are claiming

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.010 align:middle line:84%
to channel extraterrestrial
intelligence,

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:42.190 align:middle line:84%
and that's exactly what ended
up happening from the 1980s

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:42.990 align:middle line:90%
onward.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.380 align:middle line:84%
We get a lot of that and
that continues to this day.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, all of that is
generally very positive.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.210 align:middle line:84%
It's about achieving greater
spiritual elevation, greater

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.870 align:middle line:84%
levels of consciousness, raising
your frequency, your vibration,

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.320 align:middle line:84%
and so forth so that you
can then get yourself

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.320 align:middle line:84%
to a level of being
able to communicate

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.560 align:middle line:84%
and being worthy actually
of joining this greater

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.855 align:middle line:90%
galactic community.

00:07:08.855 --> 00:07:10.980 align:middle line:84%
That's the message that we
get over and over again.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:15.520 align:middle line:84%
Stop being aggressive,
stopping violent, and so on.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.130 align:middle line:10%
Now, in the whole
other side of it,

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:21.700 align:middle line:10%
you have the phenomenon
of abduction.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, this
too is something

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:28.950 align:middle line:84%
that arguably goes
back centuries.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:32.808 align:middle line:84%
There are stories
that don't explicitly

00:07:32.808 --> 00:07:34.350 align:middle line:84%
involve extraterrestrials
but they'll

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:37.350 align:middle line:84%
involve fairy folk,
for example, going back

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:38.820 align:middle line:90%
many, many, many centuries.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.570 align:middle line:10%
People who will have claimed
way back then that they

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.360 align:middle line:10%
had an encounter with
the little people or with

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.700 align:middle line:10%
fairies, and were
taken, and were gone

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.650 align:middle line:10%
for a certain period of time.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And in those stories,
it's very interesting.

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Time often perceives at a
different rate in their world

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:01.050 align:middle line:90%
than in our world.

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:04.920 align:middle line:84%
Time goes much
more slowly there.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:11.160 align:middle line:84%
You could live many, many years
in the dimension of the fairies

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.200 align:middle line:84%
and then when you
come back, it's

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.990 align:middle line:84%
almost as if nothing
has gone by here.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:19.710 align:middle line:84%
Or sometimes in some of the
lore, it could be the reverse.

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:24.090 align:middle line:84%
Time goes very fast
there and very slow here

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:26.170 align:middle line:90%
but it moves differently.

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:28.120 align:middle line:90%
So what is that all about?

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:32.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's hard for us to gauge
any of those ancient stories,

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:35.610 align:middle line:90%
truthfully.

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:38.429 align:middle line:84%
Those people aren't alive
for us to investigate

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:41.010 align:middle line:84%
and to interrogate
unfortunately.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:43.950 align:middle line:84%
We are left with stories
that are written down

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:46.090 align:middle line:90%
over many, many centuries.

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's about all that
I feel we can do with them.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, what you have in
the contemporary era

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:57.510 align:middle line:84%
are stories and
claims of abduction.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And these types of
abduction concern non-human,

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.620 align:middle line:90%
presumably alien entities.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, the manner in which
stories of alien abduction

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.780 align:middle line:84%
come out today is often
very different than how

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:13.320 align:middle line:84%
stories of fairy abduction
happened centuries ago,

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.700 align:middle line:90%
at least as far as we can tell.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:19.400 align:middle line:84%
At least insofar as with the
phenomenon of alien abduction,

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:23.150 align:middle line:84%
many of the people who
have it don't immediately

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.540 align:middle line:90%
remember that they've had it.

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:30.410 align:middle line:84%
There's something
blocking their memory.

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And it only comes out
by bits and pieces.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And until someone might
choose to go in for a hypnotic

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:43.580 align:middle line:84%
regression session, say with
a hypnotherapist who can then

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.598 align:middle line:90%
help them unpack the memories.

00:09:46.598 --> 00:09:48.140 align:middle line:84%
It's a really tricky
area and there's

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.600 align:middle line:90%
a lot of argument about it.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.600 align:middle line:10%
Is hypnotic regression
an effective tool?

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Or is it not an effective tool
for unlocking these memories?

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Does hypnotic regression simply
help create false memories?

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:02.630 align:middle line:90%
And some people argue this.

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:06.080 align:middle line:84%
Others say absolutely not, it
doesn't create false memories.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.780 align:middle line:84%
If it's done well,
it can absolutely

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.670 align:middle line:90%
help to unlock a memory.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:13.910 align:middle line:84%
When I look at this and
I will fully admit to you

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:18.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a psychologist and
I'm not a practicing hypnotist

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:22.490 align:middle line:84%
either, but I have tried
to look into this myself.

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And when I think about human
memory and the blocks that

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:30.920 align:middle line:84%
all of us have to so many
memories in our lives--

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, after all,
who can really

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.590 align:middle line:84%
remember every bit of
their childhood perfectly?

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:38.210 align:middle line:90%
Very few people can.

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:40.100 align:middle line:84%
There are things that
happen over time that

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.390 align:middle line:90%
cause us to lose our memory.

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:44.570 align:middle line:84%
But we've all also
had the experience

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:51.260 align:middle line:84%
of remembering something that
we had previously forgotten.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.640 align:middle line:84%
Remembering things
from our distant past,

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:57.260 align:middle line:84%
for example, that we might not
have thought about for 10 or 20

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.340 align:middle line:90%
or 30 or more years.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:02.510 align:middle line:90%
So that can happen.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:06.960 align:middle line:84%
To me, that says we
do have the ability

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.500 align:middle line:90%
to retrieve lost memories.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And very likely the
best way to do it

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:15.330 align:middle line:84%
would be through a
form of hypnosis.

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And really, what is hypnosis
other than just a form

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:27.900 align:middle line:84%
of deep relaxation of
your mind and in a focus--

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:32.400 align:middle line:84%
relaxation and focus at
the same time in your mind

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.310 align:middle line:84%
so that you are
basically allowing

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:38.610 align:middle line:84%
yourself to remember certain
things that are forgotten.

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's really 90%-plus of
what goes on when people are

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.330 align:middle line:84%
going through
hypnotic regression.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.360 align:middle line:84%
It's simply a state
of deep relaxation.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And when I think about
that, it seems to me

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:55.500 align:middle line:84%
that that can indeed be a
very effective way to unlock

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:56.400 align:middle line:90%
memories.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.930 align:middle line:84%
It also seems to me that someone
who's leading that regression

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:04.110 align:middle line:84%
has got to be really
careful not to lead

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:07.140 align:middle line:84%
the person into a
certain direction

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.210 align:middle line:90%
that they want them to go.

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:12.150 align:middle line:84%
I think personally that there
are people in the UFO field

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:15.660 align:middle line:84%
who've done a very good job at
that and others who have not

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.200 align:middle line:90%
done a very good job at that.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:22.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's very important to
be kind of hands-off when

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:25.840 align:middle line:90%
you are leading that procedure.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.990 align:middle line:84%
Having said all of
that, seems to me

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:30.420 align:middle line:84%
that there had been a number,
a large number of cases

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:33.150 align:middle line:84%
that people have gone
through hypnotic regression

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:36.210 align:middle line:84%
to look for alien
abduction possibilities,

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:37.780 align:middle line:90%
and they found it.

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
there does seem

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:49.800 align:middle line:84%
to be an incredible consistency
across a broad range

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:54.090 align:middle line:84%
of individuals who have gone
through hypnotic regression

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:57.150 align:middle line:84%
dealing with possible
alien abduction,

00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:01.770 align:middle line:84%
and they are coming up with
a very consistent series

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:03.310 align:middle line:90%
of events.

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:06.810 align:middle line:84%
So what can we attribute
this consistency to?

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:10.500 align:middle line:84%
Is it that the various people
doing the regressions all

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.100 align:middle line:84%
have a direction
that they want to go?

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:15.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't think
that that's the case.

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.400 align:middle line:10%
I studied the work
of Budd Hopkins,

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.840 align:middle line:10%
David Jacobs, John Mack--

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.260 align:middle line:10%
I knew all of those
gentlemen-- and it seems to me

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.340 align:middle line:10%
that that's not what
they were about.

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:26.700 align:middle line:84%
But I definitely believe
that their methodology

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:33.120 align:middle line:84%
was very, very hands off and
really not designed ultimately

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:36.017 align:middle line:84%
to push into a
certain direction.

00:13:36.017 --> 00:13:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a
lot of other people

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.740 align:middle line:84%
who have continued to
do hypnotic regression

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:43.350 align:middle line:90%
on possible abductees.

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think overall
within the United States,

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:50.550 align:middle line:84%
particularly where there's more
of these folks in operation,

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:56.820 align:middle line:84%
that I would say that I think
they do a good job of not

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.770 align:middle line:90%
pushing a particular agenda.

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:03.420 align:middle line:84%
So we're left with a very
consistent tale of people

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:07.860 align:middle line:84%
who claim that in the middle of
the night, when they are most

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:12.690 align:middle line:84%
vulnerable, beings enter
their home, enter their room,

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:16.920 align:middle line:84%
take them for a couple of
hours, have some ability

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:21.570 align:middle line:84%
to prevent the
mind from creating

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:25.440 align:middle line:84%
active memories of the event,
or at least for the most part.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.110 align:middle line:84%
They have them do whatever
they want them to do,

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:31.440 align:middle line:84%
whether it's biological
testing that they

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.580 align:middle line:90%
have performed on them.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:36.450 align:middle line:10%
Or in the case of a lot of the
research of people like David

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:39.660 align:middle line:10%
Jacobs, these are
humans who are now

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:45.390 align:middle line:10%
training alien-human hybrids
basic tasks about how

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:48.660 align:middle line:10%
to function in human
society in preparation

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:53.670 align:middle line:10%
for, well, further integration
and maybe even a takeover

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:56.560 align:middle line:10%
by these other beings.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:59.970 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot here
that shockingly

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:03.690 align:middle line:84%
is consistent in what
these people are saying.

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:06.390 align:middle line:84%
It's disturbing but
it's consistent.

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And the question
that we have to ask

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:13.140 align:middle line:84%
is, are we looking at a case
where a hypnotherapist is

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:17.070 align:middle line:84%
planting these suggestions
where the abductee is

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:22.530 align:middle line:84%
themself creating a fantasy
that they want to believe?

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:25.740 align:middle line:84%
Or is it a case that
they're actually

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:29.070 align:middle line:84%
remembering something that
actually genuinely happened?

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:30.510 align:middle line:84%
It definitely seems
to be the case

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:34.620 align:middle line:84%
at these various abductees
don't like the fact that they're

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.210 align:middle line:90%
being taken.

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:40.740 align:middle line:84%
You don't really get the sense
that they want to be abductees.

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.920 align:middle line:84%
So we're in a really difficult
situation here looking

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.280 align:middle line:84%
at these different
types of experiences--

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:53.560 align:middle line:84%
abduction versus encounter,
abduction versus contact.

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:54.900 align:middle line:90%
Are they different?

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Are we dealing with
different species?

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:01.650 align:middle line:84%
You know, good guys
versus bad guys.

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:03.690 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible
that the human race

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:08.210 align:middle line:84%
is encountering a multiplicity
of intelligences that are here

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:11.240 align:middle line:90%
with differing agendas?

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:14.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, fact is that this
field, this phenomena,

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:19.300 align:middle line:84%
is so confusing at times that
it's very easy for researchers

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:21.050 align:middle line:84%
to come to that
conclusion that we're just

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:23.630 align:middle line:84%
dealing with a lot of
different intelligences

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:26.780 align:middle line:84%
that are here with
different agendas.

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:28.423 align:middle line:90%
But is that the case?

00:16:28.423 --> 00:16:29.840 align:middle line:84%
Or is it simply
that we're dealing

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:33.110 align:middle line:84%
with something that
is really confusing

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:35.480 align:middle line:84%
and we still haven't
figured it out?

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.610 align:middle line:84%
I would be first in line
for those people who

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:40.440 align:middle line:84%
want a definite answer to
these types of questions.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.320 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not going
to lie to you, I

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.920 align:middle line:90%
don't have the answers on this.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what the
fundamental truth is.

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:49.250 align:middle line:84%
I do think we're
dealing with something

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:51.120 align:middle line:90%
that's really important.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.480 align:middle line:84%
We're dealing with something
that affects people

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:57.650 align:middle line:84%
in a deep psychological way,
either in terms of trauma

00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:00.350 align:middle line:90%
or in terms of transformation.

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:02.240 align:middle line:90%
It can go both ways.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.240 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, it's
affecting people deeply,

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.750 align:middle line:90%
and it's important.

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And I would say
one definite thing

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.359 align:middle line:84%
that we can do to
help a situation is

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:15.740 align:middle line:84%
take these accounts with a
very strong amount of empathy,

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:18.770 align:middle line:84%
and care, and consideration
for those people who've

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:21.890 align:middle line:84%
got these encounters to
discuss, because the fact is

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:26.150 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people go through their
lives with these experiences

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:28.310 align:middle line:90%
and they don't tell anybody.

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:33.560 align:middle line:84%
They walk through life with
these experiences in their head

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.390 align:middle line:90%
and no one else knows.

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And the only way
sometimes that people

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:39.950 align:middle line:84%
can deal with it is
you take this most

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:43.460 align:middle line:84%
awe-inspiring incredible thing
that's ever happened to you

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:47.750 align:middle line:84%
and you just tuck it away in
a little corner of your brain

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:51.260 align:middle line:84%
where you never deal with it,
you just push it to the side.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.120 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's a good survival
mechanism for all I know.

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:59.570 align:middle line:84%
But it seems to me that
it's also fundamentally

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:01.430 align:middle line:84%
a case where we're
lying to ourselves

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:03.740 align:middle line:90%
and we're lying to our society.

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:05.343 align:middle line:84%
Something important
is happening.

00:18:05.343 --> 00:18:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And one more thing I would say
in context with all of this

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:14.270 align:middle line:84%
is that any phenomenon in which
an intelligence is operating

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:20.160 align:middle line:84%
with people in a one-on-one
manner that is secretive

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:24.480 align:middle line:84%
and which it's done
when no one's around,

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.450 align:middle line:84%
and people are dealing with
this in an atomized isolated

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:30.580 align:middle line:90%
way, that can't be good.

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:32.640 align:middle line:84%
It can't be a good
thing that we deal

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.610 align:middle line:84%
with these encounters
separate without having

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:38.370 align:middle line:84%
the ability to talk
to other people

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:41.490 align:middle line:84%
so that we can compare notes,
so that we can ultimately

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:44.550 align:middle line:84%
learn from each other,
and as a society,

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:49.470 align:middle line:84%
talk about this in open positive
way so that maybe one day,

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:52.110 align:middle line:90%
we can do something about it.

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:54.060 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, for
good or for ill,

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:55.570 align:middle line:90%
these encounters are important.

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And the last thing we should
be doing is ignore them.
