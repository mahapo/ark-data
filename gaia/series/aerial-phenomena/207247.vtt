00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.440 align:middle line:10%
>> Bodies need bones,
history needs facts.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.740 align:middle line:10%
Same thing.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.800 align:middle line:10%
It's one thing for
people in the UFO field

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.890 align:middle line:10%
to say I know that the
government's got information

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.320 align:middle line:10%
they're covering up and I
know that the Air Force has

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.450 align:middle line:10%
this information, the CIA
has got that information,

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:30.613 align:middle line:10%
and the Navy's got this.

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:32.780 align:middle line:84%
It's great to say all of
that, but it doesn't really

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.660 align:middle line:84%
get you very far if you
don't have documentation

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.520 align:middle line:90%
to back your claim up.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And the problem that researchers
had and UFO advocates had

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.840 align:middle line:84%
for many, many years, we're
talking in the 1950s, 1960s,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.420 align:middle line:84%
and most of the 1970s, is
that they didn't really

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.230 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of documentation
to say, aha, here,

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.880 align:middle line:90%
this is our proof.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.710 align:middle line:84%
What you had
instead was a number

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.050 align:middle line:84%
of people who would get some
inside information, leaks, here

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.850 align:middle line:90%
and there.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.830 align:middle line:84%
Believable leaks,
yeah, but not proof.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.349 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, all the
government agencies

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:07.810 align:middle line:84%
in the United States would
say, look, we don't really

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:08.950 align:middle line:90%
investigate UFOs.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.720 align:middle line:90%
It's not a thing that we do.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.010 align:middle line:84%
We just don't have any evidence
to show that this is serious.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.980 align:middle line:84%
You folks are just creating
a subject out of nothing.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.648 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing here for you.

00:01:19.648 --> 00:01:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And this went on
for years and years,

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.470 align:middle line:84%
and it was a back
and forth argument.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.840 align:middle line:84%
And UFO researchers
didn't really

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:33.730 align:middle line:84%
have a way to get past that
roadblock, until they did.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And that thing that got
them past the roadblock

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.330 align:middle line:84%
was the significant
strengthening

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.420 align:middle line:84%
of the Freedom of
Information Act.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, the FOIA,
Freedom of Information

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.920 align:middle line:84%
was passed originally
in the 1960s.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.020 align:middle line:90%
But it didn't really get teeth--

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.150 align:middle line:84%
like for real teeth--
for researchers

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:58.510 align:middle line:84%
to use to dig into until 1974
after Watergate, after Vietnam,

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.110 align:middle line:84%
after the United
States really went

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.360 align:middle line:84%
through its own political
trials and crises.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
results of that was

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.760 align:middle line:84%
to strengthen the
laws allowing citizens

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.380 align:middle line:84%
to petition their
government for government

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.830 align:middle line:84%
documents of public interest,
to put it quite simply.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And that was a really major
win for the people, by the way.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.630 align:middle line:84%
Other nations now have FOIA
laws on the books as well,

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.660 align:middle line:84%
but when the US put
this through in 1974

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.550 align:middle line:84%
it was a really
important moment.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think to the surprise
of a lot of pundits and people

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.540 align:middle line:84%
like observing all this
was how right away the most

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:50.200 align:middle line:84%
significant topic that
was requested was UFOs.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.010 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.840 align:middle line:90%
That just blew everyone away.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.850 align:middle line:84%
You got all of these
UFO researchers

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.650 align:middle line:84%
coming out of the
woodwork petitioning

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.660 align:middle line:84%
the FBI for
documents, petitioning

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.940 align:middle line:84%
the CIA for
documents, petitioning

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.020 align:middle line:84%
the Army and the Navy and all
the military branches, the Air

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Force, all of them
for documents.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.140 align:middle line:90%
Even the NSA.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.470 align:middle line:84%
The NSA in the late '70s
was subject to a lawsuit

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.840 align:middle line:90%
by a citizen UFO group.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.690 align:middle line:84%
A true David versus
Goliath situation

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.610 align:middle line:90%
if there ever was one.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, the NSA
never released almost even

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.060 align:middle line:84%
a single word on it that
wasn't just blacked out.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.930 align:middle line:84%
In fact, all of the
NSA documents for years

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.390 align:middle line:90%
were completely unavailable.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.150 align:middle line:10%
And the only thing that was
available to researchers

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.930 align:middle line:10%
was the judge's ruling
as to why the NSA didn't

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.430 align:middle line:10%
have to release any documents.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And most of that
ruling was blacked out.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.420 align:middle line:90%
It was insane.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.690 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, amidst
all those difficulties,

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.540 align:middle line:84%
thousands upon thousands of
pages of declassified documents

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.570 align:middle line:84%
came to light on
the matter of UFOs.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.380 align:middle line:84%
Documents that had formerly
been classified, and now

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.790 align:middle line:90%
were available for the public.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.280 align:middle line:84%
All in the late '70s
and in the early '80s,

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.650 align:middle line:90%
it just came out like a flood.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.980 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't a lot of really
good journalistic newspaper

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.870 align:middle line:90%
coverage on this unfortunately.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.940 align:middle line:84%
Of course, who's
surprised by that?

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.370 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, the
information came out.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And it made a very big
impact among those people

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.050 align:middle line:90%
who were researching UFOs.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.690 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
what it exposed was

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.860 align:middle line:84%
a major lie, a series of
lies by all the government

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.400 align:middle line:84%
agencies that had said,
well, we don't research UFOs.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.580 align:middle line:84%
Government agencies like
the CIA, like the FBI,

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.590 align:middle line:84%
like the Navy and all the
other branches of the services.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.940 align:middle line:84%
Turns out, oh yeah, they studied
UFOs and were very concerned

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:44.740 align:middle line:90%
about them.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.670 align:middle line:84%
It was during the late '70s
that we learned about all

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.460 align:middle line:84%
of these violations
of sensitive airspace

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.730 align:middle line:84%
by these unknown objects
doing the impossible.

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.360 align:middle line:84%
Unknown objects shaped like
discs, shaped like spheres,

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.980 align:middle line:84%
shaped like triangles sometimes
coming in over sensitive areas,

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.900 align:middle line:90%
hanging out for a while.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And then easily evading
jet and aircraft

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.460 align:middle line:84%
interceptors when they
go in to investigate.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.130 align:middle line:84%
Like happened over
and over again,

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.800 align:middle line:84%
and we learned about all of
this finally in the late 1970s.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.460 align:middle line:84%
It didn't prove that UFOs
were extraterrestrial.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.110 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't any one document
that said, hey, boss,

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.120 align:middle line:90%
the aliens have just landed.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.810 align:middle line:84%
However, when you take the top
10, the top 20, the top 50,

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.260 align:middle line:84%
the top 100 of these
documents and you

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.530 align:middle line:84%
read them one after the
next, what you do get

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.170 align:middle line:90%
is proof, absolute proof.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Not maybe, not a little bit,
not sort of, but proof that

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:54.880 align:middle line:84%
the UFO phenomenon during
those years of the Cold War,

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.320 align:middle line:84%
1940s and '50s and '60s and
'70s, that the UFO phenomenon

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:05.630 align:middle line:84%
was taken very seriously by
the United States military.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And also by militaries
of other nations,

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.920 align:middle line:84%
because some of those
reports came out

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.380 align:middle line:90%
through America's FOIA.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.660 align:middle line:84%
We learned that
jets were regularly

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.270 align:middle line:90%
scrambled to investigate.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.980 align:middle line:10%
One of the more
shocking documents

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.030 align:middle line:10%
was a short one from
the summer of 1950

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:29.920 align:middle line:10%
detailing airspace violations
over the Hanford Nuclear

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.690 align:middle line:10%
Facility in the
state of Washington.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, Hanford turned
out to become

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.750 align:middle line:84%
one of the most toxic,
polluted nuclear sites

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.400 align:middle line:90%
in the entire United States.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:45.130 align:middle line:84%
But in 1950, it was going
full on as a nuclear plant.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.790 align:middle line:10%
And it turns out that
summer, according

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.880 align:middle line:10%
to this, just one of many
of these FOIA documents,

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.380 align:middle line:10%
this one details how
objects round in form

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.650 align:middle line:10%
have been seen over
the Hanford plant.

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.710 align:middle line:84%
It talks about how Air Force
fighters attempted interception

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:04.630 align:middle line:90%
with negative results.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:09.460 align:middle line:84%
It talks about how anti-aircraft
battalions have been alerted.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.270 align:middle line:84%
It talks about how all
of these other agencies

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:14.830 align:middle line:90%
have been alerted to it.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:19.930 align:middle line:84%
How local commanders are quote
"perturbed" by implications

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.210 align:middle line:90%
of the phenomena.

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:26.710 align:middle line:84%
It talks about how the
investigation is continuing,

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:29.320 align:middle line:84%
although we don't
get any conclusion as

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.290 align:middle line:84%
to what that investigation
actually told us.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.800 align:middle line:84%
Can you just imagine
what the public reaction

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:42.010 align:middle line:84%
would have been in 1950 if
that one memo had been released

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.732 align:middle line:90%
to the public at the time?

00:07:44.732 --> 00:07:46.690 align:middle line:84%
But the public didn't
know about it at the time

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.360 align:middle line:90%
because it was all being denied.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:54.160 align:middle line:84%
The government, the military
was lying year in year

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.920 align:middle line:84%
out to the public on
the matter of UFOs.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.360 align:middle line:90%
And that is undeniable.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.260 align:middle line:84%
That's not hypothesis,
that's fact.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And it was only
in the late 1970s

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:12.300 align:middle line:84%
that memos like that one
were released to the public

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.390 align:middle line:84%
long after all the
excitement had died down.

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, it came out
and just dropped silently

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:24.692 align:middle line:84%
into the bucket like all
the other ones have done.

00:08:24.692 --> 00:08:26.900 align:middle line:84%
It's an amazing thing like
when I look back and think

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:30.980 align:middle line:90%
of the power of these reports.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.159 align:middle line:90%
But it really is possible.

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:35.120 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that
it's really possible

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:40.159 align:middle line:84%
to keep this whole thing under
wraps as long as you just

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:43.650 align:middle line:84%
keep the reports hidden for
a long enough period of time.

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And when the truth
comes out, like you

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.470 align:middle line:84%
would think that the
public would get really

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:51.210 align:middle line:84%
worked up about having been
lied to after all these years.

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:55.320 align:middle line:84%
But once again, there
really was no reaction.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.560 align:middle line:84%
But there are so many of
these types of reports.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Another one describes an
object seen over the Oak Ridge

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:06.830 align:middle line:84%
facility in Tennessee, another
key atomic nuclear site where

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:09.740 align:middle line:84%
an engineer at Oak Ridge
sees a fighter aircraft high

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.500 align:middle line:90%
up in the sky circling around.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And then later
sees a black object

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:19.040 align:middle line:84%
in the area where
the jet had been.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And this object then zooms
across the sky incredibly fast

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.390 align:middle line:90%
and stops.

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And then is joined by
2 more similar objects.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And then they zoom off to
the east instantaneously

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:36.080 align:middle line:90%
and they're gone.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.150 align:middle line:90%
Like that was 1953.

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:40.190 align:middle line:90%
What does that?

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:42.170 align:middle line:10%
These are the types of
reports that came out

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:43.580 align:middle line:10%
through Freedom of Information.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And again,
individually, they don't

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:49.040 align:middle line:84%
prove that all UFOs
are extraterrestrial.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:52.130 align:middle line:84%
But they're really
difficult to explain away.

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:56.090 align:middle line:84%
You know, you get many of
these reports describing

00:09:56.090 --> 00:10:00.110 align:middle line:84%
visual plus radar
sightings of objects.

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:02.660 align:middle line:84%
You get many reports
describing objects

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:05.690 align:middle line:84%
with a particular interest
in nuclear technology,

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:10.950 align:middle line:84%
and an interest in sensitive
military installations

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:11.750 align:middle line:90%
in general.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:14.900 align:middle line:84%
That's what these military
reports are all about.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:17.840 align:middle line:84%
I find the military reports to
be particularly interesting,

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.600 align:middle line:84%
not because they're
intrinsically better

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.710 align:middle line:84%
than a report by an ordinary
person or a citizen.

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:26.090 align:middle line:90%
They're really not.

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:30.650 align:middle line:84%
But I find them interesting
because with a military report,

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:32.540 align:middle line:90%
they can leave a paper trail.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And also, a military
report means

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.414 align:middle line:84%
that the military that you
pay for with your tax dollars

00:10:40.414 --> 00:10:44.540 align:middle line:84%
is responsible for
dealing with this

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.840 align:middle line:84%
as a potential national
security issue.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And when you have a government
that is telling you year

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.300 align:middle line:84%
after year that there's
nothing to these UFOs,

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.940 align:middle line:84%
but a branch of the government,
that is the military,

00:10:55.940 --> 00:11:00.170 align:middle line:84%
is responding to these UFOs,
well, then we have a problem,

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:01.090 align:middle line:90%
don't we?

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:03.230 align:middle line:90%
We've got a discrepancy.

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:06.800 align:middle line:84%
So all of these Freedom
of Information Act reports

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.120 align:middle line:84%
are important to us,
not because they prove

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.530 align:middle line:90%
all UFOs are extraterrestrial.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:16.560 align:middle line:90%
We need to get past that.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they suggest it
perhaps, you can argue that.

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.310 align:middle line:10%
But the reason that they're
really important to us

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:25.400 align:middle line:10%
is because they do prove
that the United States

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:31.910 align:middle line:10%
government has lied for
years about its supposed

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:35.360 align:middle line:10%
lack of interest in UFOs.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.450 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays, we're kind
of getting the idea

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:40.910 align:middle line:84%
through a lot of statements
recently from the United States

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:44.510 align:middle line:84%
Navy and elsewhere that, well,
the government and the military

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:47.720 align:middle line:84%
are maybe interested
in these UFOs or UAPs

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.580 align:middle line:90%
as they call them now.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:53.030 align:middle line:84%
But it's easy to forget for
decades and decades and decades

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:56.360 align:middle line:84%
the government
categorically denied it.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.120 align:middle line:90%
And even now they're still--

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.550 align:middle line:84%
they've got a long
way to go before we

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:04.940 align:middle line:84%
come to any amount of openness
and honesty about the subject.

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:07.970 align:middle line:84%
But it's through FOIA,
it's through the documents

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:13.923 align:middle line:84%
that citizens really
can make a case.

00:12:13.923 --> 00:12:15.590 align:middle line:84%
When you're discussing
this with friends

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:18.350 align:middle line:84%
who may be skeptical
about the subject,

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:21.590 align:middle line:84%
the important thing
always is to refer to it

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:23.420 align:middle line:90%
as factually demonstrable.

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately for people
who follow the UFO subject,

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:32.660 align:middle line:84%
there is more than enough
in the released documents

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.730 align:middle line:90%
from their very government.

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:37.040 align:middle line:84%
The United States
government and military

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.560 align:middle line:84%
have thousands of
pages of documents

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:42.260 align:middle line:84%
attesting to the reality
of this phenomenon.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:46.250 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is,
whoever it belongs to,

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:52.920 align:middle line:84%
it clearly is something very
significant, very powerful.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:57.230 align:middle line:84%
I would say revolutionary in its
implications for our society.

00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:00.580 align:middle line:90%
