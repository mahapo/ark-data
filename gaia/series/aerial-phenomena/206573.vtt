00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.379 align:middle line:84%
>> 14 years before the death
of American President John F.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.400 align:middle line:10%
Kennedy, another famous American
died under very suspicious

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.270 align:middle line:10%
circumstances in a way that
we've really never grappled

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.830 align:middle line:10%
with openly in our society today
but still has really important

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.270 align:middle line:10%
implications, and I'm talking
about the death of the first

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.330 align:middle line:10%
Secretary of Defense of the
United States of America.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.630 align:middle line:10%
A man named James Forrestal.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.880 align:middle line:10%
Forrestal died on May 21
going into May 22, 1949,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.000 align:middle line:10%
and his death out of the
Bethesda Naval Hospital

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.590 align:middle line:10%
in Maryland really constitutes
a mystery, a tragedy,

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.670 align:middle line:10%
but a mystery, and
something that we really

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.840 align:middle line:10%
would do well to study
even at this late date here

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.850 align:middle line:10%
in the 21st century.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.560 align:middle line:84%
Forrestal was a very,
very capable Secretary

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.910 align:middle line:90%
of War and Secretary of Defense.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And in 1947, he was one of
the top people in the defense

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.280 align:middle line:84%
establishment when flying
saucers were being reported

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.350 align:middle line:84%
throughout the
United States, and he

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.660 align:middle line:84%
was the man who became the
first Secretary of Defense

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.190 align:middle line:84%
in September of 1947 when
the entire US military went

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.600 align:middle line:84%
through a reorganization to
go from the War Department

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.730 align:middle line:84%
to the Defense Department
and all of that.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.540 align:middle line:84%
Forrestal was the guy who was at
the top of that, so his job was

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.620 align:middle line:84%
to manage the Army, the
Air Force, and the Navy,

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.110 align:middle line:84%
and a way to make them all
behave and work together

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.640 align:middle line:90%
under his leadership.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.930 align:middle line:84%
He was the first
one to get that job.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.910 align:middle line:10%
So the president
was Harry Truman,

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.040 align:middle line:10%
and here's Forrestal
trying to make it all

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.310 align:middle line:10%
work while all these UFO
reports are happening,

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.169 align:middle line:10%
and a lot of other
things are happening too.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.870 align:middle line:84%
The early Cold War is
going on with the Russians,

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.800 align:middle line:84%
that is the Soviet
Union, and so much more.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.060 align:middle line:84%
In the summer of
1948, a lot of people

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.620 align:middle line:84%
did not think that Harry Truman
was going to win re-election.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.188 align:middle line:84%
It was very typical to say,
oh, he's going to lose,

00:02:28.188 --> 00:02:29.730 align:middle line:84%
and the Republicans
are going to win.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Thomas Dewey was the
Republican nominee,

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.910 align:middle line:84%
and Forrestal was rooting
actually for Dewey

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.160 align:middle line:90%
if you want to know the truth.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.970 align:middle line:84%
He worked for Truman, but he
was basically a Republican,

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.010 align:middle line:84%
and he was hoping
that Dewey would win.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.580 align:middle line:84%
He actually met secretly
with Dewey a couple of times

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.940 align:middle line:90%
during the campaign.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.010 align:middle line:84%
Something that Truman would
not forgive him for after he

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.570 align:middle line:90%
won his reelection.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.740 align:middle line:90%
So here's the thing though.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.250 align:middle line:84%
All of this plays
into what ends up

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.710 align:middle line:90%
happening to James Forrestal.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.060 align:middle line:84%
Friends start noticing
that Forrestal's developing

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.220 align:middle line:90%
these nervous behaviors.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.210 align:middle line:84%
He starts talking about
foreign-looking men following

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.090 align:middle line:90%
him, he said.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.440 align:middle line:90%
Some people believe him.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.690 align:middle line:90%
Some people don't believe him.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.930 align:middle line:84%
He develops this nervous
habit in meetings

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.540 align:middle line:84%
of putting his fingers
in a glass of water

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.840 align:middle line:90%
and constantly wetting his lips.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.420 align:middle line:84%
He didn't seem like
himself as 1948 developed

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.210 align:middle line:84%
all through that year, and
no one really knew why,

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.690 align:middle line:84%
but some people thought
this guy's just losing it.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.920 align:middle line:84%
Then Truman gets his
reelection in November

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.580 align:middle line:84%
of 1948 to the shock of
everyone and definitely

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.010 align:middle line:90%
to the shock of Forrestal.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And in January of 1949,
Truman brings Forrestal

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.270 align:middle line:84%
into his office and
says, I'm replacing you

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.220 align:middle line:90%
as Secretary of Defense.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.600 align:middle line:90%
You're out.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.660 align:middle line:84%
We're going to give you
a nice going away party

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.493 align:middle line:84%
in a couple of months
so don't complain.

00:04:05.493 --> 00:04:07.410 align:middle line:84%
You can go off, have
your life, but you're not

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.240 align:middle line:84%
part of my
administration anymore.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.260 align:middle line:84%
Basically, Truman had lost all
trust and Forrestal's ability

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.990 align:middle line:84%
to do the job he
needed him to do.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And there were a lot
of things that Truman

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.198 align:middle line:84%
wanted that were
kind of difficult.

00:04:18.198 --> 00:04:20.970 align:middle line:84%
Truman wanted a totally
balanced budget,

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.160 align:middle line:84%
and he wanted to cut
military spending.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.470 align:middle line:90%
Imagine that in today's world.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.140 align:middle line:84%
Truman actually wanted massive
cuts to the US military,

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.220 align:middle line:84%
and he was putting Forrestal
in charge of doing that.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And Forrestal didn't really
have the ability or authority

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.440 align:middle line:84%
to force the military
services back in those days

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.290 align:middle line:90%
to agree to those cuts.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.410 align:middle line:84%
It's different today, but back
then, he didn't have the power.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.820 align:middle line:90%
He was in a tough position.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.510 align:middle line:90%
No question about it.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.670 align:middle line:84%
So in January 11, 1949,
Truman brings Forrestal

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.470 align:middle line:84%
into his office and
says, I'm firing you

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:56.685 align:middle line:90%
as Secretary of Defense.

00:04:56.685 --> 00:04:58.560 align:middle line:84%
You can be here for
another couple of months.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.143 align:middle line:84%
We'll give you a nice party at
the end of it, but you're gone.

00:05:01.143 --> 00:05:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough,
Forrestal starts

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.070 align:middle line:84%
seeing even more of these
foreign-looking men,

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.900 align:middle line:90%
he says, following him.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.620 align:middle line:84%
He gets really paranoid and
suspicious, and by the way,

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.100 align:middle line:84%
someone is following him to
the extent of feeding stories

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.390 align:middle line:90%
about him to journalists.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.780 align:middle line:84%
There was a famous
journalist back in those days

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.120 align:middle line:84%
named Drew Pearson,
and he was writing

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.560 align:middle line:90%
stories about Forrestal.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.830 align:middle line:84%
Forrestal had a real enemy in
the secretory of the Air Force.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.040 align:middle line:90%
A man named Stuart Symington.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.440 align:middle line:84%
It's unclear even
today why they were

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.600 align:middle line:84%
such deep, personal
enemies, but this

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.710 align:middle line:90%
was a really serious problem.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.600 align:middle line:84%
So it looks like Symington was
feeding stories about Forrestal

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.820 align:middle line:84%
to Drew Pearson, and
they were getting

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.580 align:middle line:90%
picked up by the newspapers.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.800 align:middle line:84%
All through the
early spring of 1949,

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Forrestal's just a lame
duck Secretary of Defense.

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.600 align:middle line:84%
He's waiting to leave,
and at the end of March,

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.370 align:middle line:84%
they give him a
nice big ceremony.

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:58.500 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for your service.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.330 align:middle line:90%
Have a good life.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And here's where it
gets really interesting.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.360 align:middle line:10%
Stuart Symington, his
mortal political enemy,

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.140 align:middle line:10%
says there's a couple of things
I want to talk to you about,

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:14.580 align:middle line:10%
and they get into a limo on the
way back to Forrestal's office.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And no one really
knows what Symington

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:22.350 align:middle line:84%
said or did to Forrestal
during that limo ride,

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.750 align:middle line:84%
but what we do know
is that Forrestal

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.870 align:middle line:84%
gets out, goes into his
office, and disappears

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:28.800 align:middle line:90%
for several hours.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.230 align:middle line:84%
People wondering what's
going on with Forrestal?

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Someone opens the door, and
they see James Forrestal sitting

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.760 align:middle line:84%
at his desk, ramrod
straight, staring

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.140 align:middle line:84%
at a blank wall repeating one
sentence over and over again.

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.660 align:middle line:90%
You are a loyal fellow.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.625 align:middle line:90%
You are a loyal fellow.

00:06:47.625 --> 00:06:50.290 align:middle line:90%


00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.180 align:middle line:84%
People look at him
thinking he has lost it.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.000 align:middle line:90%
So a couple of phone calls.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.560 align:middle line:84%
They take him home, and
the next thing you know,

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.460 align:middle line:84%
a bunch of high-level
national security people

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.010 align:middle line:84%
fly James Forrestal
down to a place

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.740 align:middle line:90%
called Hobe Sound in Florida.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.540 align:middle line:84%
He goes to see a
friend of his who

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:11.520 align:middle line:84%
becomes a future Secretary of
Defense himself, Robert Lovett.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.300 align:middle line:10%
The first thing Forrestal
says to Lovett is, Bob,

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.070 align:middle line:10%
they're after me.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.162 align:middle line:10%
Who's they?

00:07:18.162 --> 00:07:19.110 align:middle line:90%
What do they want?

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.870 align:middle line:90%
Well, these are more mysteries.

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.860 align:middle line:84%
He stays in Hobe Sound
for a couple of days.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.960 align:middle line:10%
He's being looked
at by psychologists,

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.170 align:middle line:10%
and they bring in
a very famous army

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:34.650 align:middle line:10%
psychologist named William
Menninger of the Menninger

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:36.060 align:middle line:10%
Institute.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.810 align:middle line:10%
It was said that Forrestal
had tried to commit suicide

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:43.140 align:middle line:10%
when he was there
by hanging himself,

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.480 align:middle line:10%
but the belt broke,
although there

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.240 align:middle line:10%
was no evidence of any broken
belt that anyone could see.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.240 align:middle line:84%
There was no clear evidence
that Forrestal actually

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.320 align:middle line:90%
tried to kill himself.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.260 align:middle line:90%
The fact is we don't know.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.810 align:middle line:84%
But there was a lot
going on here clearly,

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:01.290 align:middle line:84%
and he's in Hobe
Sound for a few days,

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:06.270 align:middle line:84%
and then they fly him back up
to Washington on April 2, 1949.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:10.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, the idea is they're going
to hospitalize him for a while

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.950 align:middle line:84%
and keep him under lock and
key, and the real question is,

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:17.490 align:middle line:84%
what has happened
to James Forrestal?

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:21.060 align:middle line:84%
Like what happened
to this brilliant,

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:26.640 align:middle line:84%
together, absolutely on top of
his game Secretary of Defense

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.870 align:middle line:84%
that he's just losing it to
the extent where they're now

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:34.630 align:middle line:84%
taking him to the
Bethesda Naval Hospital

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:38.211 align:middle line:84%
up to the 16th VIP
floor, and they're

00:08:38.211 --> 00:08:39.669 align:middle line:84%
going to institutionalize
him there

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:40.929 align:middle line:90%
for the next month and a half.

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And by the way,
what we do know is

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.970 align:middle line:84%
that on the ride
to the hospital,

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:47.650 align:middle line:84%
from the airport
to the hospital,

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:51.640 align:middle line:84%
Forrestal several times tried to
get out of that moving vehicle.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.650 align:middle line:84%
They weren't letting
him do that of course.

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:55.360 align:middle line:90%
What was going on here?

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.620 align:middle line:90%
Was he afraid of something?

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.660 align:middle line:90%
Well, I think he was, yes.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:00.730 align:middle line:84%
So they check him
into the hospital

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:03.970 align:middle line:84%
against all of the advice
of the attending physicians

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:06.700 align:middle line:84%
that he should be
on the bottom floor.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:10.030 align:middle line:84%
Because if he's being
spoken of as suicidal,

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:12.250 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to put
a suicidal person up

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:15.220 align:middle line:90%
on the 16th floor of a building.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:16.870 align:middle line:90%
But that's where he was put.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:20.320 align:middle line:10%
And so for the next seven
weeks, James Forrestal

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:24.250 align:middle line:10%
lived on the 16th floor of
the Bethesda Naval Hospital

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:26.150 align:middle line:10%
in Maryland.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:29.110 align:middle line:10%
He was allowed
almost no visitors.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:33.880 align:middle line:10%
In fact, he was sedated
for several weeks

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.440 align:middle line:10%
while he was there.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:40.570 align:middle line:84%
Basically, put in a complete
state of just sleeping it off.

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:43.780 align:middle line:84%
As soon as he's checked into
the hospital, by the way,

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:48.040 align:middle line:84%
his 3,000 pages of diaries were
taken by Harry Truman's people

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:52.180 align:middle line:84%
under the pretext that
they said Forrestal wanted

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.970 align:middle line:90%
Truman to take his diaries.

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:56.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's just think
about that for a second.

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:58.360 align:middle line:90%
So yes, 3,000 pages.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:02.710 align:middle line:84%
A lot, a lot of stuff was
written in those diaries.

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:05.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, Forrestal and Truman had
really become, essentially,

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:10.780 align:middle line:84%
political enemies by this time,
and it's frankly preposterous

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:14.290 align:middle line:84%
to think that Forrestal
would want Truman

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:16.990 align:middle line:84%
to take his diaries,
but this was the excuse

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:19.820 align:middle line:84%
that Truman's people
had given for that.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.330 align:middle line:90%
So they take his diaries.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.390 align:middle line:84%
They want to make sure that
they scrub those things clean

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:30.610 align:middle line:84%
before any of that stuff would
be released in published form

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:33.400 align:middle line:84%
a couple of years
later, which they were

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.100 align:middle line:90%
in very, very sanitized form.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.290 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, Forrestal's
taken up to the 16th floor.

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:40.600 align:middle line:84%
They put him into a state
which they call narcosis,

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:45.250 align:middle line:84%
basically meaning putting him
to sleep for like several weeks.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:49.240 align:middle line:84%
He's finally allowed to wake up
and have a waking consciousness

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.020 align:middle line:84%
where he starts to get a
few visitors, very few.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:57.160 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to see his brother,
Henry, was denied that.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:02.200 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to see his chaplain,
a man named Maurice Sheehan.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.120 align:middle line:90%
That was denied to him.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.560 align:middle line:90%
He had a couple of visitors.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.150 align:middle line:90%
One was his estranged wife.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:08.620 align:middle line:84%
They did not get
along very well.

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:09.820 align:middle line:90%
She visited him once.

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.560 align:middle line:90%
Harry Truman visited him once.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.000 align:middle line:10%
A man named Sidney Souers of
the National Security Council

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.070 align:middle line:10%
and alleged MJ-12
member visited him once.

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:23.230 align:middle line:84%
His replacement as a
Secretary of Defense,

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:26.140 align:middle line:84%
a man named Louis
Johnson, visited him once.

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:30.100 align:middle line:10%
And a Congressman by the
name of Lyndon Baines Johnson

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:33.130 align:middle line:10%
visited Forrestal once.

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:35.230 align:middle line:10%
Very interesting.

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:36.640 align:middle line:84%
But Forrestal,
for the most part,

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:41.440 align:middle line:84%
was kept off limits
to almost everyone.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.050 align:middle line:84%
He was kept under the
care of a Navy captain.

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:48.460 align:middle line:84%
Doctor named George
Raines, and Raines

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.140 align:middle line:84%
would write these
reports every week

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:55.720 align:middle line:84%
and talk about how Forrestal's
condition was and so forth.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, the
visitors and Raines

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.700 align:middle line:84%
were all agreeing that
through the month of May,

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:08.440 align:middle line:84%
1949, Forrestals'
condition was improving,

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.143 align:middle line:90%
and he was clean shaven.

00:12:10.143 --> 00:12:11.560 align:middle line:84%
He'd put on a
little bit of weight

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:16.750 align:middle line:84%
again which he needed to do,
and he was in good spirits.

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:18.820 align:middle line:90%
One of the security guards--

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.700 align:middle line:84%
they had three guards
in eight-hour shifts,

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.820 align:middle line:84%
and one of them he had
become very friendly with

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.830 align:middle line:84%
and had said to this
young man, he said,

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:31.480 align:middle line:84%
look, when I get out of here,
I'll hire you as a secretary.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.100 align:middle line:84%
I think you're a
great young man.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.110 align:middle line:84%
We're going to work
together, and so he

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:39.260 align:middle line:84%
was talking about getting
out of the hospital.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, his brother,
Henry Forrestal,

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.760 align:middle line:84%
had been unable
to see his brother

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.650 align:middle line:84%
and was getting very
upset about this.

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:48.940 align:middle line:90%
Started to complain.

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:52.880 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he wrote to the
hospital, called the hospital.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.080 align:middle line:84%
He said, if you do not allow
me to see my brother like now,

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put this story
out to the newspapers.

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And which, by the
way, Forrestal's stay

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:05.650 align:middle line:84%
in the hospital, this was
very highly-publicized thing.

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:08.290 align:middle line:84%
Forrestal was kind
of a celebrity

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:11.680 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of ways in a way
that government officials

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.970 align:middle line:90%
very seldom are.

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:16.540 align:middle line:84%
Back then, he hung out
with a lot of movie stars.

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:19.990 align:middle line:84%
He himself had this kind of
nice, chiseled Hollywood look

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:21.070 align:middle line:90%
about him.

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:23.320 align:middle line:84%
Forrestal was this
glamorous figure,

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.530 align:middle line:84%
and so his hospitalization
at the time

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:30.160 align:middle line:84%
was very, very
widely publicized,

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.820 align:middle line:84%
and Henry Forrestal is basically
saying to the hospital,

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.722 align:middle line:84%
you better let me see
my brother right now,

00:13:35.722 --> 00:13:37.430 align:middle line:84%
or I'm going to make
a big wave about it.

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:42.650 align:middle line:10%
And Henry did eventually get to
see his brother several times

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:45.560 align:middle line:10%
before the fateful
night of May 21.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And according to Henry, his
brother was doing great.

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:51.170 align:middle line:90%
His brother was fine.

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:54.500 align:middle line:84%
There was no reason to
keep James Forrestal

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:57.050 align:middle line:90%
in that hospital in his opinion.

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Henry Forrestal really
wanted his brother out

00:13:59.100 --> 00:13:59.900 align:middle line:90%
of that hospital.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:01.525 align:middle line:84%
He was getting very
annoyed by the fact

00:14:01.525 --> 00:14:03.980 align:middle line:84%
that they were keeping
him in there for so long.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:05.510 align:middle line:90%
It was nearly two months.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:08.540 align:middle line:84%
A long time where they've
got this man in there,

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:11.090 align:middle line:84%
and Henry, who had been
able to visit him finally,

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:13.520 align:middle line:84%
knew that his brother
James was doing just fine,

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.530 align:middle line:84%
and he wanted to
take him back home

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:18.590 align:middle line:84%
where they could
continue his brother's

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:20.570 align:middle line:90%
care in a private manner.

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:22.100 align:middle line:90%
Totally reasonable.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:24.380 align:middle line:84%
So he gets a room
at a nearby hotel,

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.250 align:middle line:84%
and he informs the
hospital, he says,

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:29.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm coming Sunday, May 22.

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:31.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get my
brother out of there.

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And if you try to stop
me, see how far you get.

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:36.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make a
big thing out of this,

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:39.200 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to get
him out of there so.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:43.190 align:middle line:84%
They were well aware
that on Sunday, May 22,

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:45.710 align:middle line:84%
Henry Forrestal was going to
walk right into that hospital

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:47.540 align:middle line:90%
and demand to get brother.

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:50.630 align:middle line:84%
So the night before is
when everything happens.

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:53.390 align:middle line:84%
Another odd thing was that
just a couple of days earlier,

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Captain George Raines, who was
Forrestal's physician here,

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.740 align:middle line:84%
looks at him on
May 14, and says,

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:04.040 align:middle line:84%
oh, you know, I'm going to go
to a conference in a few days,

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.522 align:middle line:84%
and I think you're
getting much better.

00:15:06.522 --> 00:15:08.480 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to need
me for a little while.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.647 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be out of town.

00:15:09.647 --> 00:15:11.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to leave on May 18.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:13.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go out to
a clinical psychiatric

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:14.680 align:middle line:90%
conference.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.480 align:middle line:90%
You'll be fine.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.355 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about it.

00:15:16.355 --> 00:15:18.380 align:middle line:90%
So Raines leaves on the 18th.

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:21.800 align:middle line:84%
He's gone, and there's a
back-up physician who's there,

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.120 align:middle line:90%
but Raines is gone.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.730 align:middle line:84%
Henry Forrestal makes
his announcement

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:28.160 align:middle line:84%
that he's going to demand
to take his brother out

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.250 align:middle line:84%
of the hospital
on Sunday, May 22.

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And on the night of
the 21st, that Saturday

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:37.670 align:middle line:84%
night, this is when
everything happens.

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:40.100 align:middle line:84%
One thing is that
Forrestal's guard,

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:43.850 align:middle line:84%
the guy that he was really
close with, was gone that night.

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:45.020 align:middle line:90%
He was replaced.

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.870 align:middle line:84%
They said that he was absent
without official leave,

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:51.110 align:middle line:84%
that he'd been out drinking or
some kind of excuse was made,

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:54.680 align:middle line:90%
and he was not on duty.

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:59.480 align:middle line:84%
A new person was brought in by
the name of Robert Harrison.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, we don't really know
much about this person,

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:08.150 align:middle line:84%
but it was his first shift
guarding Secretary Forrestal.

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And all that we know is
Harrison's testimony,

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.730 align:middle line:90%
and this is what Harrison said.

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:20.410 align:middle line:84%
On 1:30 in the morning, he
checked on James Forrestal

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:23.410 align:middle line:90%
who he said was sleeping.

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:26.080 align:middle line:84%
At 1:45, he checked
on him again,

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:30.130 align:middle line:84%
and he saw Forrestal
awake in his bed

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:33.340 align:middle line:84%
reading and transcribing
something on his notes,

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.980 align:middle line:84%
and he asked him if
you'd like a sedative,

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:38.030 align:middle line:90%
and Forrestal says, no.

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And Harrison then left the room,
according to his own testimony,

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:50.980 align:middle line:84%
after which Forrestal left the
room, went out into a hallway,

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:55.030 align:middle line:84%
opened a small window
that was in the hallway

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:59.260 align:middle line:84%
above a radiator, took
his bathrobe cord,

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:05.170 align:middle line:84%
tied it tightly around his neck,
tied the other end of the cord

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:10.599 align:middle line:84%
to the radiator, and then jumped
out the window in an attempt

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:13.900 align:middle line:90%
to hang himself.

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.750 align:middle line:84%
But the cord slipped
off the radiator,

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:22.180 align:middle line:84%
and Forrestal fell 16
floors to his death.

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:24.190 align:middle line:90%
That's the official story.

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:29.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of problems
with this story.

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:32.220 align:middle line:84%
First of all, Forrestal
was supposedly awake,

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.980 align:middle line:90%
and he's writing in his--

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.825 align:middle line:84%
he's writing from an
anthology of poetry.

00:17:37.825 --> 00:17:41.910 align:middle line:10%
A play of Sophocles
called Ajax, and he's

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:47.220 align:middle line:10%
writing out a kind of
lamentation death scene,

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:51.990 align:middle line:10%
and apparently, stops in
the middle of one word

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:55.380 align:middle line:10%
and decides that he's going
to kill himself immediately

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.050 align:middle line:10%
according to this story.

00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:00.003 align:middle line:84%
This seems really, really
difficult to accept.

00:18:00.003 --> 00:18:02.670 align:middle line:84%
When if he really wanted to hang
himself, by the way, there were

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:05.970 align:middle line:84%
places in his own hospital room
that he could have done that.

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:08.430 align:middle line:84%
There were definitely
strong supports in there

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:11.130 align:middle line:84%
where it would have been
possible to hang yourself

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:15.090 align:middle line:84%
in the manner that is
being suggested here.

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:18.930 align:middle line:10%
No one really is aware
of any successful attempt

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:23.130 align:middle line:10%
at doing a hanging in
that manner whatsoever.

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:26.280 align:middle line:10%
What seems much more likely is
that someone grabbed Forrestal,

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.900 align:middle line:10%
took him out of
the room, and tried

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.440 align:middle line:10%
throwing him out the window.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
something happened

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.910 align:middle line:84%
because there were
scuff marks that

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:37.260 align:middle line:84%
were seen on the outside
of that windowsill.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:40.380 align:middle line:84%
So the official explanation
of those scuff marks

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.170 align:middle line:84%
was that, well, maybe
Forrestal changed his mind

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:46.380 align:middle line:84%
after he tried to kill himself
and tried to crawl back in.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:49.380 align:middle line:84%
But it seems a little
bit more likely

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.960 align:middle line:84%
that those scuff marks would
be caused by someone trying

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.050 align:middle line:84%
to stop himself from going
out the window altogether

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:56.280 align:middle line:90%
after being pushed out.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And furthermore, who's
going to tie a cord tightly

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:03.970 align:middle line:84%
to their neck and not very
tightly to the radiator.

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:06.430 align:middle line:84%
It's much more likely that
you tie a cord tightly

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:09.640 align:middle line:84%
around someone's neck to prevent
them from screaming and making

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:13.510 align:middle line:84%
a loud noise while you are then
disabling them and throwing

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:15.880 align:middle line:90%
them out a window.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:21.880 align:middle line:84%
There was broken glass
found on Forrestal's floor

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.970 align:middle line:84%
the next morning during
an investigation of it.

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:27.550 align:middle line:90%
Photographs were taken.

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:31.360 align:middle line:84%
These did not make it out to
the public for many, many years.

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:32.590 align:middle line:90%
It's very odd though.

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:38.710 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot of strange things
about Forrestal's scene there.

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:40.780 align:middle line:10%
What we do know is
that the Navy, which

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:44.500 align:middle line:10%
was in charge of this-- it was
Navy property-- immediately

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:48.130 align:middle line:10%
declared that this
had been a suicide

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:51.310 align:middle line:10%
before any medical
officer or coroner was

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:54.070 align:middle line:10%
able to make a determination as
to what happened to the body.

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:55.840 align:middle line:90%
Before any examination.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.220 align:middle line:90%
Before any autopsy.

00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:58.960 align:middle line:90%
None of that was done.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:03.730 align:middle line:84%
The Navy just makes a
statement, and that's that.

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:07.270 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is 14 years before
the Kennedy assassination.

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:11.410 align:middle line:84%
This is an era where
people believe every word

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:13.340 align:middle line:90%
that the military told them.

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:15.460 align:middle line:84%
So if the Navy said
it was a suicide,

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:20.380 align:middle line:84%
then that's the end of that,
and that's what we're left with.

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:26.050 align:middle line:84%
But Forrestal's death is a
very, very odd thing indeed,

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:30.640 align:middle line:84%
and in terms of
actual suicide, really

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.560 align:middle line:84%
is not a credible
statement whatsoever

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.390 align:middle line:90%
that it was a suicide.

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:37.660 align:middle line:84%
The odd thing about this is that
the room was clearly sanitized.

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.620 align:middle line:84%
When there were photographs
that were taken,

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:44.050 align:middle line:84%
you can see this room was
completely cleaned up.

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:46.000 align:middle line:84%
There are photographs
that exist from this,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.550 align:middle line:84%
and it's obvious the
bed was even made.

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:50.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everything
was cleaned up

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:54.010 align:middle line:84%
and put away for the official
photographs to be taken.

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:56.950 align:middle line:84%
Like what kind of
investigation is that?

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:58.360 align:middle line:84%
But there was
something that they

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.400 align:middle line:84%
missed when they were
doing their cleanup,

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:04.600 align:middle line:84%
and there was some little bits
of broken glass on the floor

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.070 align:middle line:90%
that are clearly visible.

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:09.100 align:middle line:84%
There's some oddness going
on with Forrestal's scene.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:12.730 align:middle line:84%
Another thing is the
note itself that he

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:14.710 align:middle line:84%
was said to have been
writing that stops

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:19.730 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of a word, that
doesn't look like Forrestal's

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:20.530 align:middle line:90%
handwriting.

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:21.363 align:middle line:90%
It's very different.

00:21:21.363 --> 00:21:25.453 align:middle line:84%
Now, maybe at 1:30, 1:45 in the
morning, maybe his handwriting

00:21:25.453 --> 00:21:26.870 align:middle line:84%
might look a little
bit different,

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:30.130 align:middle line:84%
but this was not Forrestal's
standard handwriting.

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:31.730 align:middle line:90%
It's definitely different.

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:34.990 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's very easy to
understand the possibility

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:41.980 align:middle line:10%
that this was all a setup,
that Forrestal was suicided.

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And really, how difficult is
it for us to believe that now?

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:49.270 align:middle line:84%
The Russians were
doing it at the time.

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:52.270 align:middle line:84%
The Americans knew how to
do this as well by the way.

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:55.330 align:middle line:84%
They were on both
sides of the Cold War.

00:21:55.330 --> 00:22:00.610 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of this type
of activity that was happening.

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:04.820 align:middle line:84%
Deaths that were blamed on
other parties and so forth.

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:08.170 align:middle line:84%
So in Forrestal's case, we've
got a very, very suspicious

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:09.350 align:middle line:90%
series of events.

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And by the way,
Henry always believed

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:16.210 align:middle line:84%
that his brother was
murdered, and there's

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:18.310 align:middle line:84%
a little interesting story
about Father Sheehan.

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:19.420 align:middle line:90%
This is Maurice Sheehan.

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:22.630 align:middle line:84%
The man who Forrestal
had wanted to see

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:28.900 align:middle line:84%
who was denied six or seven
times to see James Forrestal.

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, on the morning
of Forrestal's death,

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.240 align:middle line:84%
there's a huge crowd
at the hospital,

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.310 align:middle line:84%
and Sheehan is working
his way through.

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:39.460 align:middle line:84%
He's trying to get
in to talk to anyone,

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:43.780 align:middle line:84%
and a Navy corpsman, a
lower-level Navy corpsman who

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:48.400 align:middle line:84%
apparently knew the Father,
goes up to him in this crowd

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:54.572 align:middle line:84%
and says, you know, Father,
this wasn't a suicide, right?

00:22:54.572 --> 00:22:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And before Sheehan had a
chance to say anything else,

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:58.488 align:middle line:84%
this corpsman was gone
through the crowd,

00:22:58.488 --> 00:23:00.540 align:middle line:90%
and that was the end of it.

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:03.050 align:middle line:84%
But there is a lot of suspicion
about Forrestal's death.

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:05.210 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:08.150 align:middle line:84%
The investigation that
was done in the aftermath

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:13.220 align:middle line:90%
was shockingly threadbare.

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:14.960 align:middle line:90%
Harrison was interrogated.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:18.230 align:middle line:84%
If you read the testimony
in the aftermath--

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:19.700 align:middle line:84%
it's all there
available to read,

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:21.410 align:middle line:84%
what's called the
Willcutts Report--

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Harrison is interrogated
for, what seems to me,

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:26.870 align:middle line:90%
about 10 minutes tops.

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's it, and
then he's free to go.

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:31.910 align:middle line:84%
There was really
no investigation

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:35.810 align:middle line:84%
done of this that anyone would
call a proper investigation.

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:37.490 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:39.630 align:middle line:90%
So Forrestal was killed.

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:42.320 align:middle line:84%
I think that's clear, and the
question that we have to ask

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.210 align:middle line:90%
is, why?

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:46.250 align:middle line:90%
Why was he killed?

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, we're getting into
some speculative questions

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:52.310 align:middle line:84%
here, and we may not really
get the full answer to it,

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:55.070 align:middle line:84%
but why would I talk
about Forrestal's death,

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:58.370 align:middle line:84%
and particularly, why
would I want to connect it

00:23:58.370 --> 00:23:59.810 align:middle line:90%
to the context of UFOs?

00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:01.250 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'll tell you why.

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:03.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that Forrestal
was killed in connection

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:06.290 align:middle line:84%
with the UFO
mystery, but I think

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:08.120 align:middle line:90%
we should never rule this out.

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.680 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:13.850 align:middle line:84%
UFOs in the late 1940s were
the elephant in the living

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:14.900 align:middle line:90%
room, so to speak.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:17.880 align:middle line:84%
It was a subject that
no one could talk about,

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:20.060 align:middle line:90%
but that was ever present.

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:23.330 align:middle line:84%
It was everywhere at the highest
levels of the National Security

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:24.500 align:middle line:90%
establishment.

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.420 align:middle line:90%
Everyone was concerned about it.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:28.280 align:middle line:84%
Truman was getting
briefings on it.

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:31.190 align:middle line:84%
The highest level generals
were concerned about it.

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:35.150 align:middle line:84%
Airspace violations all
across major US bases

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:37.040 align:middle line:84%
were happening by
these unknown objects.

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.650 align:middle line:84%
This was a very big
deal in the late 1940s,

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:42.650 align:middle line:84%
and Forrestal was a
guy on the spot who

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:45.560 align:middle line:84%
would have known everything
that there was to know.

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:49.340 align:middle line:84%
He was head of the
Department of Defense,

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:56.410 align:middle line:84%
and he had, well, become
unreliable to the president.

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:59.500 align:middle line:90%
He had become a problem.

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:03.820 align:middle line:84%
He'd become perhaps--
maybe he was becoming

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:05.620 align:middle line:90%
a little bit unraveled.

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:10.210 align:middle line:84%
Maybe he was being
considered a security risk.

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:12.340 align:middle line:84%
If he was going to come
out of the hospital

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:16.180 align:middle line:84%
in a few days or weeks
or whenever, what then?

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:18.820 align:middle line:84%
Would Forrestal still be
considered a reliable team

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:20.380 align:middle line:90%
player or not?

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:24.480 align:middle line:84%
All of these questions are
legitimate questions to ask.

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think what it looks
like to me is someone

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:30.240 align:middle line:84%
decided this guy is not
going to be reliable.

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.890 align:middle line:90%
We have to deal with this.

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:33.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, there was
suspicion back then

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:38.600 align:middle line:84%
that communist infiltrators
had killed him.

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And the reason given was
that Forrestal was maybe

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:44.590 align:middle line:84%
the strongest anti-communist
in Truman's administration

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:47.620 align:middle line:84%
of anyone there,
and the thought was

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:50.500 align:middle line:84%
he might have pursued
investigations

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:54.490 align:middle line:84%
into communist infiltration at
the time in the US government.

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:57.490 align:middle line:84%
This was widely
discussed among people

00:25:57.490 --> 00:25:59.680 align:middle line:90%
who thought he was murdered.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe, you
never know, but I

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:07.180 align:middle line:84%
think it's just as likely that
the UFO angle is relevant here.

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:10.240 align:middle line:84%
Again, because UFOs
were so important.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Never to be talked
about, however.

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:14.770 align:middle line:84%
Was this something
that Forrestal

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:16.210 align:middle line:90%
was going to talk about?

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, the fact is we're
never going to know.

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:22.480 align:middle line:84%
This event is now so
far back in history,

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.850 align:middle line:84%
more than seven
decades now, and I

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:27.820 align:middle line:84%
think it's very unlikely that
we'll ever get full closure

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.650 align:middle line:90%
on the death of this man.

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:34.870 align:middle line:84%
But I think that we need to
consider the real possibility,

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:38.680 align:middle line:84%
likelihood, in fact, that
America's first Secretary

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:42.530 align:middle line:84%
of Defense didn't
commit suicide, no.

00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:45.250 align:middle line:84%
But he was thrown out
a window, murdered,

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:49.570 align:middle line:84%
because he had become a
security risk, and very likely

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:53.740 align:middle line:84%
because of what he
knew about UFOs.

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:56.650 align:middle line:84%
But he actually
said, I don't expect

00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:58.000 align:middle line:90%
to leave this hospital alive.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.350 align:middle line:90%
