00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Awakening to our highest
human potential is no longer

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.620 align:middle line:84%
about competition, but
about surviving and thriving

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.130 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.440 align:middle line:84%
Let's explore what human
potential looks like

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.610 align:middle line:90%
on a global scale.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:34.550 align:middle line:90%


00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.080 align:middle line:10%
Welcome back to "Limitless."

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.440 align:middle line:10%
Today we're talking
about the big picture.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.530 align:middle line:10%
And Julianna Margulies
said, "Small gestures

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.610 align:middle line:10%
can have a big impact."

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't think we can
put that into words as good

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.130 align:middle line:90%
as we can put that into images.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.520 align:middle line:10%
There's this YouTube video
titled "Orangutan Tries

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.870 align:middle line:10%
to Fight Bulldozer."

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.020 align:middle line:90%


00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.090 align:middle line:10%
It was an orangutan fighting
off a bulldozer that

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.275 align:middle line:10%
was destroying its habitat.

00:01:01.275 --> 00:01:06.030 align:middle line:90%


00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.710 align:middle line:84%
Since 1978, we have
effectively, as a species,

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.260 align:middle line:84%
destroyed nearly 300,000 square
miles of the Amazon rainforest

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.270 align:middle line:84%
alone, one of the most important
biologically diverse ecosystems

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.920 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.450 align:middle line:84%
That's about the size of
Malaysia and Sweden combined,

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.840 align:middle line:84%
or the entire country
of Argentina combined,

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.470 align:middle line:84%
just from the Amazon
rainforest alone.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.850 align:middle line:84%
75% of genetic diversity
in agricultural crops

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.790 align:middle line:84%
have been lost, meaning
that we are not eating,

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.340 align:middle line:84%
smelling, tasting,
or even living

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.610 align:middle line:84%
amongst the biodiversity,
the wild nature

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.280 align:middle line:90%
that our ancestors once did.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.900 align:middle line:10%
There is another
statistic saying

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.230 align:middle line:10%
that 70% of all
life on this planet

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.380 align:middle line:10%
will go extinct if the
global temperature rises

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.190 align:middle line:10%
by 3.5 degrees Celsius.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.760 align:middle line:84%
Here's just a few more facts
about what humans as a species

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.490 align:middle line:90%
are doing on this planet.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.300 align:middle line:84%
18 million acres of
deforestation a year--

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.720 align:middle line:84%
land that's filled with wildlife
an important diversity--

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.480 align:middle line:84%
is being destroyed
by human activities.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.200 align:middle line:84%
8 million tons of garbage
is dumped into the oceans

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.580 align:middle line:90%
each year.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.680 align:middle line:84%
A quarter of coral
reefs are damaged

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.230 align:middle line:84%
beyond repair, which are home
to a quarter of aquatic life.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.350 align:middle line:84%
So what this is really saying
is that since humans have come

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.460 align:middle line:84%
online, if you will-- modern
humans walking this Earth--

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.760 align:middle line:84%
in that 150,000
to 200,000 years,

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.240 align:middle line:84%
it has only been in a
fraction of 1% of that time

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.770 align:middle line:84%
that we've created over 99%
of the ecological destruction

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.300 align:middle line:90%
that we see today.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.630 align:middle line:84%
Put another way, in
the past 25 years,

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.200 align:middle line:84%
we have destroyed 1/10 of the
wilderness on this planet.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.500 align:middle line:84%
How long can we
survive this trend?

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.373 align:middle line:84%
Is it going to keep
going in this direction?

00:03:05.373 --> 00:03:06.790 align:middle line:84%
There's some big
questions we need

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.950 align:middle line:90%
to ask ourselves as a species.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.790 align:middle line:90%
What are we doing here?

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.480 align:middle line:84%
Why are we doing things the
way that we are doing them?

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's take a look at
this show called "Well-Being"

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.660 align:middle line:84%
interviewing Dr. David Hufford
in an episode called "Mysticism

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.460 align:middle line:90%
and Religious Beliefs."

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.580 align:middle line:10%
>> How we got here--

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.680 align:middle line:10%
you can look at that in
a lot of different ways,

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.010 align:middle line:10%
but the primary way
has been the discovery

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.310 align:middle line:10%
of cheap energy
sources coming from

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.560 align:middle line:10%
outside our natural systems.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.860 align:middle line:84%
So that's primarily
fossil fuels.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Prior to that, the
only people who

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.130 align:middle line:84%
could managed to live a truly
unhealthy life of the kind

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.770 align:middle line:84%
that we have now
we're very rich people

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.490 align:middle line:84%
who could concentrate the
labor of a lot of serfs,

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.440 align:middle line:90%
or enslaved people.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.340 align:middle line:84%
They could eat white
bread and kill themselves

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.020 align:middle line:90%
on lots of meat every day.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.792 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the
rest of the society

00:04:03.792 --> 00:04:05.750 align:middle line:84%
was also suffering, but
in the other direction.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.100 align:middle line:84%
They didn't suffer from the
effect of refined flour.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.630 align:middle line:84%
They suffered from the
effects of starvation.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.050 align:middle line:84%
So I don't have a romantic
view of that time.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.149 align:middle line:10%
But when you get into
the industrialization

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:19.190 align:middle line:10%
and the discovery
of fossil fuels,

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.730 align:middle line:10%
there's an ecological
principle that when

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.790 align:middle line:10%
you add a great deal
of energy from outside

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.330 align:middle line:10%
into a living system,
you change the balance.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.220 align:middle line:84%
You change the homeostasis
of that system.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at what happens
in most natural systems,

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.610 align:middle line:84%
it's not a change that most
things living in that system

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.820 align:middle line:90%
can even survive.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.300 align:middle line:84%
So we're living on a planet
where one tiny little effect

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.060 align:middle line:84%
can ripple out through
many different systems.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.310 align:middle line:84%
This could be seen as
the butterfly effect.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.940 align:middle line:84%
The flapping of a butterfly's
wings on the prairie in the US

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.880 align:middle line:84%
could affect a typhoon on
the other side of the planet.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.190 align:middle line:90%
There's actually a theory--

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.800 align:middle line:84%
dynamic systems theory-- meaning
the little things do add up.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And they affect our lives and
the lives of others in ways

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.130 align:middle line:84%
that maybe we can't
conceive of because these

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.160 align:middle line:84%
are dynamic systems changing
in very unique ways.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.870 align:middle line:84%
In fact, a single human being
is a very dynamic system.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.690 align:middle line:84%
Think of the trillions
of cells that we

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.510 align:middle line:84%
have in our body that
are our own, and then

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.160 align:middle line:84%
the trillions of cells that we
have in our body that are not

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.960 align:middle line:90%
our own--

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.820 align:middle line:90%
the bacterial and fungal cells.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Think of all the different
operating systems

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.290 align:middle line:84%
and all the
communication methods

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.990 align:middle line:84%
that they have
between each other.

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.270 align:middle line:84%
This isn't even taking
into consideration

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.850 align:middle line:84%
all the environmental
impacts upon our decision

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.700 align:middle line:90%
making and who and what we are.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.260 align:middle line:84%
So one human being is a
very, very dynamic system.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.850 align:middle line:90%
So then explode this out.

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:52.640 align:middle line:10%
We're talking about the entire
species, the big picture--

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.000 align:middle line:10%
So roughly 7 billion
people on this planet.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.690 align:middle line:84%
It's got to be mind-boggling how
dynamic that system truly is.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:05.020 align:middle line:84%
If one human being is so
dynamic, what about 7 billion?

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.510 align:middle line:84%
Can we even wrap
our heads around it?

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, according to dynamic
systems theory, yes.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.280 align:middle line:84%
In fact, macroscopic
dynamic systems

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.910 align:middle line:84%
are easier to predict
than microscopic.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.800 align:middle line:90%
Take, for instance, the seasons.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.460 align:middle line:84%
You pretty much know when summer
is going to turn into autumn,

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.390 align:middle line:84%
autumn will turn into winter,
and winter into spring.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.250 align:middle line:84%
But you can never
really tell what

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.650 align:middle line:84%
the weather is going to
be like three years, three

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.310 align:middle line:84%
months, three days, and
three hours from now.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:37.630 align:middle line:90%
What about in a child?

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.460 align:middle line:84%
In child development,
you can pretty much

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.940 align:middle line:84%
guess when their brain
will be fully developed,

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.510 align:middle line:84%
when they will hit puberty,
and when they'll hit 21.

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.380 align:middle line:84%
But you cannot tell what kind
of a behavior a child will bring

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.660 align:middle line:84%
to a specific day
many years from now.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.200 align:middle line:84%
So it actually seems
like we can predict

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.110 align:middle line:84%
large-scale dynamic
systems more than we

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.440 align:middle line:84%
can the smaller scale or the
microscopic dynamic systems.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.020 align:middle line:90%


00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.920 align:middle line:84%
Today we're living in a
very interconnected society.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:13.030 align:middle line:84%
Thanks to the internet, we
can share ideas in real time

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.730 align:middle line:84%
across the globe
in high definition.

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:17.950 align:middle line:10%
It's almost like
the Tower of Babel,

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.290 align:middle line:10%
one singular language,
because truly,

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:22.690 align:middle line:10%
any idea, concept,
or web page can

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.620 align:middle line:10%
be translated
instantaneously so we can all

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.700 align:middle line:10%
speak this universal language.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.990 align:middle line:84%
Ideas, concepts, things that
are very radical and very new

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:39.160 align:middle line:84%
can be shared instantaneously
like never before in history

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.310 align:middle line:90%
thanks to the internet.

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:44.440 align:middle line:84%
R. Buckminster Fuller
noted that there's

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.770 align:middle line:84%
this knowledge-doubling curve
that seems to happen over time.

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:54.290 align:middle line:10%
Over time, we double our
universal or global knowledge.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:56.080 align:middle line:84%
Let's say all the
way down to 1900s,

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.930 align:middle line:90%
it was once every 100 years.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.850 align:middle line:84%
But nowadays, we've
hit that bell curve.

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is we are
roughly doubling our knowledge

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:07.210 align:middle line:90%
every 13 hours.

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:10.430 align:middle line:84%
Almost twice a day, we're
doubling our knowledge,

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:14.770 align:middle line:84%
when all the way up into 1900,
it would take a century for us

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:16.390 align:middle line:90%
to get to that point.

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.220 align:middle line:90%
That's truly incredible.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:22.090 align:middle line:10%
And because of this, because of
all the amazing technological

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:25.730 align:middle line:10%
advancements-- the compounding
of intelligence in our society

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:28.630 align:middle line:10%
and in our global
state of affairs--

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:31.780 align:middle line:10%
we have the technology
for me to be speaking now

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:35.110 align:middle line:10%
and you later to have me in
the comfort of your own home

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:38.330 align:middle line:10%
at your own convenience
on your computer screen

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:39.669 align:middle line:10%
speaking to you.

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:44.260 align:middle line:84%
Our human potential here
with this technology is huge.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.920 align:middle line:84%
But all this advance
in technology--

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.490 align:middle line:84%
it's doubling itself so
rapidly that we really

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:55.120 align:middle line:84%
need to bring in a sustainable
and healthy direction for all

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.570 align:middle line:90%
of it to be working towards.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:01.260 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look at
how some of the experts

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.240 align:middle line:90%
think about this.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.300 align:middle line:84%
In a film called "Art Meets
Science and Spirituality

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.360 align:middle line:90%
in a Changing Economy."

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.460 align:middle line:10%
>> I'll be talking about
global interdependence,

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.920 align:middle line:10%
global partnership, or I'll
be talking about global

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.630 align:middle line:10%
exploitation.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:20.040 align:middle line:10%
And most economic policies and
most business policies today,

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.440 align:middle line:10%
as we know, are more
in the direction

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.990 align:middle line:10%
of global exploitation
than global partnership.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.300 align:middle line:10%
So there needs to
be a shift in values

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.130 align:middle line:10%
together with the
shift in thinking.

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.460 align:middle line:10%
If the thinking shifts
to global awareness

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:35.910 align:middle line:10%
with the purpose of
exploiting the natural world

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.550 align:middle line:10%
and the peoples of the
world as it is today,

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:40.800 align:middle line:10%
then globalization is a curse.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.670 align:middle line:10%
But if it shifts to the
values of global partnership

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:47.860 align:middle line:10%
and global interdependence,
then it's a blessing.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:52.710 align:middle line:10%
But growth in the living world
doesn't mean just expansion.

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:57.510 align:middle line:10%
It means, say, in a human
being, development to maturity.

00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:59.310 align:middle line:10%
It means also "inner growth."

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:01.980 align:middle line:10%
so growth needs to be qualified.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.800 align:middle line:10%
So Exxon made a huge
profit from that oil spill.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.900 align:middle line:10%
The GNP of Alaska rose
sharply after the oil spill.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.470 align:middle line:10%
But that's not
sustainable growth.

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:14.750 align:middle line:10%
That's destructive growth.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>> In my humble opinion, the
best way to reach the most

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:22.020 align:middle line:84%
amount of people and truly
influence their way of life,

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:25.460 align:middle line:84%
their value systems, the way
they look at the world is

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:26.870 align:middle line:90%
through art.

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:29.600 align:middle line:84%
All the different
mediums of art forms

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.860 align:middle line:90%
can truly impact people's lives.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.910 align:middle line:84%
In fact, thanks to
technology, if it's digital,

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.530 align:middle line:84%
you can replicate it an
infinite amount of times.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's how many
people you can reach.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:43.890 align:middle line:90%
Now that's real human potential.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:46.260 align:middle line:90%
Let me give an example.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Former President Barack
Obama, in his time in office,

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.100 align:middle line:90%
authored three books.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And in those three books,
he sold roughly four million

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:56.960 align:middle line:90%
copies.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.410 align:middle line:84%
Now let's take it to
a no-named artist.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.200 align:middle line:10%
He put out a piece of
work called "Zeitgeist,"

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.310 align:middle line:10%
anonymous free online,
and it instantly

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:11.360 align:middle line:10%
started getting 20
million views a month.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:16.070 align:middle line:84%
This no-named artist who
now we know as Peter Joseph,

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:18.770 align:middle line:84%
made a piece of art
that was reaching

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:22.890 align:middle line:84%
roughly 100 million people
in less than half a year.

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:25.280 align:middle line:10%
This means you don't
have to be the president

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.653 align:middle line:10%
to truly change the world.

00:11:28.653 --> 00:11:30.070 align:middle line:84%
So this was beautiful
because what

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:33.970 align:middle line:84%
it felt like to the audience, at
least what it felt like to me,

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:35.650 align:middle line:90%
was very authentic.

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:37.260 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't saying, stop.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.700 align:middle line:84%
First, we need to take
care of some money.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Or first, you need
to know my name.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.800 align:middle line:84%
He didn't seem like he was
actually looking for anything.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.470 align:middle line:90%
He just wanted us to wake up.

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Joan Cooney said "There is a
young and impressionable mind

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.920 align:middle line:84%
out there that is
hungry for information.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.810 align:middle line:84%
It is latched onto an electronic
tube as its main source

00:11:57.810 --> 00:11:59.748 align:middle line:90%
of nourishment."

00:11:59.748 --> 00:12:01.290 align:middle line:84%
So the question that
we have to start

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:05.230 align:middle line:84%
asking ourselves is, what
kind of information, ideas,

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:08.960 align:middle line:84%
and concepts are we
feeding our youth?

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And what's that going to
do to these generations

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:15.350 align:middle line:84%
as they grow up into
our future society?

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:18.850 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at a beautiful
film called "Discover the Gift"

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:19.780 align:middle line:90%
right here on Gaia.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:23.510 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:27.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And now realizing that I
do have an extraordinary gift,

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.470 align:middle line:90%
I want to share it.

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:32.750 align:middle line:90%
I want to make a difference.

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:35.290 align:middle line:10%
We're guided not
by the work, but we

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:37.040 align:middle line:10%
were guided by our heart.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:42.260 align:middle line:10%
We're guided by our
soul's desire to unfold.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>> We all have very
different abilities.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:45.640 align:middle line:90%
We have very different talents.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.320 align:middle line:90%
We have very different gifts.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And most school systems are
designed to ignore them.

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:54.070 align:middle line:10%
But the problem is with
the education system

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:55.670 align:middle line:10%
is that it's a system.

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:57.670 align:middle line:10%
And it's a system that's
based on the principles

00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:00.010 align:middle line:10%
of manufacturing
and industrialism.

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:01.720 align:middle line:84%
The idea is if you
keep with the program

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.100 align:middle line:84%
and you do everything
that's required of your,

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:05.550 align:middle line:84%
you'll pop out the far end,
and you'll be qualified.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And you can carry on
and lead a life that

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:09.760 align:middle line:90%
will be profitable and secure.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.990 align:middle line:90%
And none of that is true.

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:14.890 align:middle line:10%
And it's not true because
human life is not linear.

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:17.020 align:middle line:10%
Human life is organic.

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.000 align:middle line:10%
And human life is
not standardized,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.020 align:middle line:10%
and it's not conformist.

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:23.855 align:middle line:10%
It's diverse and extraordinarily
rich and various.

00:13:23.855 --> 00:13:25.480 align:middle line:84%
But for all kinds of
reasons, not least

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:29.148 align:middle line:84%
of which is education,
we're socialized

00:13:29.148 --> 00:13:30.940 align:middle line:84%
into thinking that
certain types of ability

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:33.190 align:middle line:84%
are more important than
all other sorts of ability.

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:34.565 align:middle line:84%
And it's why so
many people think

00:13:34.565 --> 00:13:37.050 align:middle line:84%
they don't have any-- because
they don't discover them.

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:40.990 align:middle line:90%


00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:43.480 align:middle line:90%
>> So that's the impact.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.820 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
doing with our youth.

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:49.060 align:middle line:84%
When we teach them
things, we tell them

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:50.800 align:middle line:90%
about who and what they are.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.380 align:middle line:84%
We have categories for them
to fit themselves into.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't fit,
sorry about your luck.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.980 align:middle line:84%
That's at least the way it
feels to most people going

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:02.890 align:middle line:90%
through the educational system.

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:05.550 align:middle line:84%
But what does it
mean to educate?

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:09.240 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the original
root word "educare,"

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:13.290 align:middle line:84%
it actually means to lead
out or to draw out the innate

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:17.880 align:middle line:84%
capacities of man, meaning
that learning is really just

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.430 align:middle line:84%
the drawing out of
our innate knowledge--

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:22.240 align:middle line:90%
things that we already know--

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.390 align:middle line:84%
so we can step into
our power more.

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:27.440 align:middle line:90%


00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.340 align:middle line:84%
This is truly what
education could be--

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.670 align:middle line:84%
teaching children how to
think, how to critically

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:37.240 align:middle line:84%
think, how to use the tools that
they already have inside them

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.760 align:middle line:90%
rather than what to think.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.040 align:middle line:90%


00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:45.790 align:middle line:84%
At times, it feels like
the educational system

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:50.440 align:middle line:84%
is molding and crafting our
youth to fit into a society

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.800 align:middle line:90%
that we already have going--

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.650 align:middle line:84%
a structure, an
economic, a societal,

00:14:55.650 --> 00:15:00.370 align:middle line:84%
a cultural system that's already
running, meaning these children

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:04.190 align:middle line:84%
are turning into cogs
to run that machine.

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:07.120 align:middle line:84%
It's just a way of saying--
it may or may not be true.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.740 align:middle line:90%
It's up to you.

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.400 align:middle line:84%
Here's what that same
gentleman, Peter Joseph,

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.880 align:middle line:84%
has to say in a book of his
called "The New Human Rights."

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:19.040 align:middle line:84%
"Efficiency, abundance,
and sustainability

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.790 align:middle line:84%
are enemies of our
economic structure,

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:24.670 align:middle line:84%
for they are inverse to
the mechanisms required

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:29.470 align:middle line:84%
to perpetuate consumption,"
meaning the system today

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:32.838 align:middle line:84%
is not meant for
efficiency and abundance.

00:15:32.838 --> 00:15:34.630 align:middle line:84%
One of the things he
brings up in this book

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:37.510 align:middle line:84%
is planned obsolescence
with technology

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:39.400 align:middle line:84%
because if one
piece of technology

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.850 align:middle line:84%
could last us a lifetime,
then we'll only buy one--

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:46.100 align:middle line:90%
not so good for their profits.

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.400 align:middle line:84%
So there's planned
obsolescence, where

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.820 align:middle line:84%
you have this phone or this
tablet or this computer

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:54.590 align:middle line:84%
and it'll truly only
last you a few years.

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:56.180 align:middle line:90%
And this is the point.

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:57.970 align:middle line:84%
It may not break
down structurally.

00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:00.730 align:middle line:84%
It just may not work with
the new software and all

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:03.110 align:middle line:90%
the updates that are happening.

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:05.830 align:middle line:84%
Now Peter Joseph
goes on to say, "You

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:08.440 align:middle line:84%
begin to see that the one
billion people currently

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:12.850 align:middle line:84%
starving on this planet, the
endless slums of the poor,

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:16.480 align:middle line:84%
and all the horrors of a culture
due to poverty and depravity

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:20.410 align:middle line:84%
are not natural phenomena due
to some natural human order

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:23.230 align:middle line:90%
or lack of earthly resources.

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Rather, they are products of
the creation, perpetuation,

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:33.560 align:middle line:84%
and preservation of artificial
scarcity and inefficiency."

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:36.430 align:middle line:84%
So if that is true
even to a small degree,

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:39.480 align:middle line:84%
then we really need to take a
look at the bigger picture--

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:43.090 align:middle line:90%
the system that we conform to--

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:44.740 align:middle line:84%
because there are
always outliers,

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:47.860 align:middle line:84%
there are always outcasts, there
are always the Peter Josephs

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.130 align:middle line:90%
showing these little flaws.

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't mean that
we need to throw away society

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.630 align:middle line:84%
as it is, but it
does mean there are

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:58.090 align:middle line:84%
real updates, real
corrections that

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:01.390 align:middle line:84%
need to be made for us to
step into our full potential

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:03.190 align:middle line:90%
as a species.

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:05.829 align:middle line:84%
So there actually
is a prophecy--

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:11.349 align:middle line:84%
a Hopi prophecy inscripted onto
a sandstone cliff in Arizona.

00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:13.540 align:middle line:84%
This very time that
we are living in--

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:15.849 align:middle line:90%
right here, right now--

00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:19.000 align:middle line:84%
all the topsy-turvy and
unpredictable nature

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.630 align:middle line:84%
of what's going on this
planet might be inscribed

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:25.310 align:middle line:90%
in this old petroglyph.

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:27.520 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to hand
it over to Gregg Braden

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:30.160 align:middle line:84%
because he's actually
spoken with the elders

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.950 align:middle line:84%
and asked them what
this petroglyphs truly

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:34.370 align:middle line:84%
means about this
time we're living

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:38.650 align:middle line:84%
in an episode of "Missing Links"
titled, "Ensuring Humanity's

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:39.610 align:middle line:90%
Continuation."

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:42.310 align:middle line:90%


00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:47.080 align:middle line:10%
>> We are now living this moment
in the map of time the point

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:50.570 align:middle line:10%
of no return that,
while in the past,

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:52.990 align:middle line:10%
it's always been possible
to choose between the upper

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:54.580 align:middle line:10%
and the lower path--

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:56.890 align:middle line:10%
and truthfully, we
can always choose.

00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:01.330 align:middle line:10%
From 1998 on, it becomes much
more difficult to choose.

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And on the lower
path, what you see

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:10.600 align:middle line:84%
are three circles that
straddle this lower path.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.300 align:middle line:10%
The first one on
the left is what

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:18.580 align:middle line:10%
the Hopi call "the first
great shaking of the Earth."

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:21.580 align:middle line:10%
They said between the time of
the last 5,000-year cycle--

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:23.440 align:middle line:10%
beginning and when it end--

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.840 align:middle line:10%
the people of the Earth
will go through these three

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.100 align:middle line:10%
great shakings.

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.400 align:middle line:10%
And the first shaking they
say is the First World War.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.370 align:middle line:10%
It's already happened.

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:35.490 align:middle line:10%
The second shaking you
see right next to that--

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:36.900 align:middle line:10%
you probably can guess--

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.160 align:middle line:10%
is the Second World War.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.760 align:middle line:10%
Then we see the vertical
line-- the point of no return.

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:48.982 align:middle line:10%
And to the right of 1998, we
see the third great shaking.

00:18:48.982 --> 00:18:50.940 align:middle line:10%
And on this image-- it's
a little bit different

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:52.540 align:middle line:10%
perspective--

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:56.430 align:middle line:10%
you can see where the upper path
ends abruptly and goes nowhere.

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:59.190 align:middle line:84%
You can also see-- and this is
where the elder has traced out

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:00.960 align:middle line:90%
the images with the chalk.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.320 align:middle line:10%
The lower image--
it reaches a corner

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.950 align:middle line:10%
which is the edge of the
rock, but it doesn't stop.

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:08.790 align:middle line:10%
It continues.

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:12.360 align:middle line:10%
It goes around that
edge, and it keeps going.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:16.230 align:middle line:84%
They tell us that that edge
is our time of extremes.

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:19.380 align:middle line:84%
That edge is where
we are right now

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:23.310 align:middle line:84%
and that the path that will
carry us gracefully and allow

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:27.810 align:middle line:84%
us to thrive with food into
advanced age across that path

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:29.100 align:middle line:90%
is the lower path.

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:32.340 align:middle line:10%
The qualities of both of
these paths-- the upper path--

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:35.550 align:middle line:10%
he said the people that
walked the upper path--

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:40.140 align:middle line:10%
they live in the world of
comfort, greed, and profit.

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:42.420 align:middle line:10%
He said, this is
the kind of profit

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:45.150 align:middle line:10%
where one person or
a group of people

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:50.250 align:middle line:10%
benefit at the expense and
the suffering of another.

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:54.480 align:middle line:10%
Whenever we do better at the
expense of someone else hurting

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:58.050 align:middle line:10%
or doing worse, that's
the kind of profit

00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:00.540 align:middle line:10%
that is on the path
that leads nowhere.

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.460 align:middle line:10%
It's the path that
ends abruptly.

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:05.640 align:middle line:10%
It's a path that cannot possibly
carry us through our time

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:09.240 align:middle line:10%
of extremes because it is
not a sustainable path.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.520 align:middle line:10%
And I said, well, what is
this lower path all about?

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.880 align:middle line:10%
What are the qualities
of the lower path?

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.690 align:middle line:10%
The lower path, and probably
as no surprise to you,

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:21.030 align:middle line:10%
is based upon a different
kind of quality--

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:24.270 align:middle line:10%
love, strength, and balance--

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:26.460 align:middle line:10%
love, strength, and balance.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:30.060 align:middle line:10%
And if you look closely at
each of these qualities,

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:33.520 align:middle line:10%
what you'll find is that
comfort, greed, profit--

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.760 align:middle line:10%
Those are things that
we do in the world.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.930 align:middle line:10%
Love, strength, and balance--

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:40.305 align:middle line:10%
those are things that
we become in our lives.

00:20:40.305 --> 00:20:43.360 align:middle line:90%


00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:46.750 align:middle line:84%
>> So why a show about
human potential am I ending

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:49.950 align:middle line:90%
on the global state of affairs?

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:54.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, truthfully, it's because
this is a dynamic system.

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:56.910 align:middle line:84%
This whole planet
is truly dynamic.

00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:59.910 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this dynamic
system of the planet

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:03.510 align:middle line:84%
fits into an even more dynamic
system of the entire universe.

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:08.050 align:middle line:90%


00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:11.890 align:middle line:84%
This entire universe
is our extended body.

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:14.740 align:middle line:84%
We are entangled
with it somehow.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:18.580 align:middle line:84%
If there truly was a big bang,
then we are entangled with all

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:22.120 align:middle line:84%
that there is, meaning
we can influence somehow.

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.190 align:middle line:84%
We can tap into it,
we can change it,

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:28.350 align:middle line:84%
and we can change
the direction of it.

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:31.760 align:middle line:84%
This is important because this
is saying that you are not just

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:32.600 align:middle line:90%
you.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.280 align:middle line:84%
You are not the flesh
and blood that you

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.590 align:middle line:90%
see before you in the mirror.

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:41.060 align:middle line:84%
You are the total impact you
have upon the world and others.

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:44.010 align:middle line:84%
See how we do influence
the world around us.

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:47.960 align:middle line:84%
This is how we will truly get
to our deepest human potential--

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:51.920 align:middle line:84%
the real purpose as to why
we're here on this planet.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:56.090 align:middle line:84%
The question is, are
we mining that resource

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:59.330 align:middle line:84%
of our human potential so we
can truly bring some good down

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:00.780 align:middle line:90%
here?

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.050 align:middle line:90%
So this is what I'm asking you--

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:08.090 align:middle line:84%
to go be who you're
meant to be; go seek who

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:11.270 align:middle line:84%
and what that might be; what
your purpose, what your plan,

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:14.710 align:middle line:84%
what your path is
on this planet.

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:18.730 align:middle line:84%
Ask those relevant questions,
and listen for the responses.

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:21.010 align:middle line:90%
Be honest with yourself.

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And remember, the root
of the word "question"

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:28.120 align:middle line:84%
is "quest" because every time
you have a question in mind,

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:31.750 align:middle line:84%
when it's no longer an answer,
and it's not all figured out,

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:35.830 align:middle line:84%
and it becomes something
that you have to ponder,

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:39.190 align:middle line:84%
then we have the quest
after that answer.

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And what we'll find as we
peer deep through the darkness

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:47.330 align:middle line:90%
is ourselves staring back at us.

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:48.710 align:middle line:90%
This is unity.

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:50.510 align:middle line:84%
This is what we're
working towards.

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:54.260 align:middle line:84%
This is our highest and
truest human potential.

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:59.910 align:middle line:90%


00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:03.750 align:middle line:84%
I'll leave you with a quote from
Carl Sagan that I believe sums

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:06.610 align:middle line:90%
it up better than I ever could.

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:11.570 align:middle line:84%
"Who are we, if not measured
by our impact on others?

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:13.295 align:middle line:90%
That's who we are.

00:23:13.295 --> 00:23:15.470 align:middle line:90%
We are not who we say we are.

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:17.840 align:middle line:90%
We're not who we want to be.

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:22.130 align:middle line:84%
We are sum of the influence
and impact that we have

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:27.310 align:middle line:90%
in our lives and on others."

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:32.980 align:middle line:84%
Walk soft, live light,
let go, but hold tight.

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:35.410 align:middle line:84%
This is truly a long
roller coaster of soul

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:39.880 align:middle line:84%
that we are all on until
the clock ticks last for us.

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And I hope you find what you're
looking for before that time.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.810 align:middle line:90%


00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:48.530 align:middle line:10%
I want to thank you all
very deeply for joining me

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:51.380 align:middle line:10%
on this very first
series of "Limitless--

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.740 align:middle line:10%
Unlocking Your
Hidden Potential."

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:55.640 align:middle line:84%
It's very near and
dear to my heart,

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.440 align:middle line:90%
and I hope you took it that way.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.930 align:middle line:84%
I hope you can take some
of these lessons deeply

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:03.200 align:middle line:84%
into your life and
share it with others.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'll see you
on the other side.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:10.987 align:middle line:90%
