00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.505 align:middle line:84%
>> How can we hack our
history to change our future?

00:00:13.505 --> 00:00:25.440 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.280 align:middle line:10%
So I'm going to start you
with a quote from Socrates.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.000 align:middle line:10%
He said, "The secret of change
is to focus all of your energy

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.500 align:middle line:10%
not on fighting the old,
but on building the new."

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.020 align:middle line:84%
So our eyes are set
towards the future

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.170 align:middle line:84%
and not focused on all
the obstacles of the past.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.810 align:middle line:84%
We've been told
by modern science

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.390 align:middle line:84%
that the brain that
you have at birth

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.820 align:middle line:84%
is going to be very similar
to the brain you have

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.900 align:middle line:90%
when you die.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.840 align:middle line:10%
At a certain age, it
stops building itself

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.730 align:middle line:10%
new brain cells
stop being created,

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.570 align:middle line:10%
and if you have an issue
or an injury in your brain,

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.070 align:middle line:10%
it's permanent.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.990 align:middle line:84%
So we've been told
this for decades,

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.879 align:middle line:90%
and we've believed it--

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.530 align:middle line:90%
up until now.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.830 align:middle line:84%
Now under the new paradigm, the
new science of neuroplasticity.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.460 align:middle line:84%
Neuroplasticity is the
ability for your brain

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.290 align:middle line:84%
to change its structure,
its neuronal connectivity.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.400 align:middle line:10%
And the reason why
this is beautiful,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.250 align:middle line:10%
by changing your
brain, by hacking

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.070 align:middle line:10%
into that process
of neuroplasticity,

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.010 align:middle line:10%
we can literally have
a brand new brain

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.770 align:middle line:10%
that serves us in
the way that we wish

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.990 align:middle line:10%
to move forward in our lives.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.680 align:middle line:84%
Rather than taking all the
baggage with us from our past,

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.510 align:middle line:84%
we can change, we
can move forward,

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.820 align:middle line:90%
we can be a brand new human.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.080 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look at the
history of neuroplasticity.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.050 align:middle line:10%
A German physiologist,
Friedrich Goltz, in the 1800s

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.020 align:middle line:10%
did a hemispherectomy on a dog.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.650 align:middle line:10%
Now a hemispherectomy is
removing an entire hemisphere

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.970 align:middle line:10%
of the brain.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.950 align:middle line:10%
Half of the brain.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.010 align:middle line:10%
What he noticed is,
when the dog recovered,

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.530 align:middle line:10%
that dog was able to
play amongst other dogs.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.160 align:middle line:84%
It almost seemed as if there
was nothing wrong with that dog.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.870 align:middle line:90%
So let me get this straight--

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.110 align:middle line:84%
if you have half a phone,
you have no functionality.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.860 align:middle line:84%
Half a car, half a
computer, half a camera,

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.850 align:middle line:90%
you have no functionality to it.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.820 align:middle line:84%
But if you have
half a brain, you

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.900 align:middle line:84%
can get along in this world
almost exactly the same?

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.420 align:middle line:10%
John Freeman at Johns
Hopkins University.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.520 align:middle line:10%
He's a neuroscientist
that saw many

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.890 align:middle line:10%
of these cases of
hemispherectomies,

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.920 align:middle line:10%
and he's quoted as saying,
"One was a champion

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.040 align:middle line:10%
bowler of her class,
one was a champion chess

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.350 align:middle line:10%
master of his state,
and others are

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.350 align:middle line:10%
in college doing very nicely."

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.960 align:middle line:84%
This boggles the
mind to think about.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.490 align:middle line:84%
That even after having
half the brain removed,

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.180 align:middle line:84%
you can still go to
college, do well,

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.630 align:middle line:84%
become a chess master,
even a champion bowler.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.830 align:middle line:84%
But injury is not required for
neuroplasticity to spark up.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And we will see in this series,
it steps away from the future.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.650 align:middle line:84%
That even people who
have not incurred damage

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.210 align:middle line:84%
still have these
amazing gifts that

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.000 align:middle line:90%
can happen inside their brain.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:25.520 align:middle line:10%
>> I have 377,149,515,625.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Rudiger Gamm isn't autistic,
but he has savant syndrome,

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.420 align:middle line:10%
which has given him the
opportunity to show his

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.108 align:middle line:10%
extraordinary capacities
in calculus on television.

00:03:35.108 --> 00:03:38.820 align:middle line:90%


00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.920 align:middle line:10%
To try to understand
Rudiger's method,

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.470 align:middle line:10%
researchers have used a
very efficient technique

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.290 align:middle line:10%
of neuroimaging.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.630 align:middle line:10%
Positron emission tomography.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.360 align:middle line:10%


00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.080 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.880 align:middle line:10%


00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Thanks to
radioactive markers,

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.680 align:middle line:10%
we can visualize the cerebral
zones that are activated when

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.810 align:middle line:10%
Rudiger does complicated
calculations mentally.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.880 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.780 align:middle line:10%


00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.720 align:middle line:10%
>> Now, let's do the same
experiment with this young

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.210 align:middle line:10%
guinea pig, who isn't a
whiz at math like Rudiger.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.890 align:middle line:90%


00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.720 align:middle line:10%
So, where's the difference?

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.390 align:middle line:10%
The analysis of
the results shows

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.780 align:middle line:10%
that Rudiger uses an
additional memory space--

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.070 align:middle line:10%
his long-term memory.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.600 align:middle line:10%


00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.510 align:middle line:10%
On the contrary, when
we do a calculation,

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.390 align:middle line:10%
we store the intermediate
results of our calculations

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.210 align:middle line:10%
in a small memory
space used for work

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.260 align:middle line:10%
called our short-term memory.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.230 align:middle line:10%
Thus, Rudiger benefits
from a bigger mental pocket

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.690 align:middle line:10%
that has greater storage
capacities, which

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.806 align:middle line:10%
benefits his accomplishments.

00:04:49.806 --> 00:04:53.280 align:middle line:90%


00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.120 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.830 align:middle line:90%


00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.310 align:middle line:10%
>> If you prefer, the mental
calculator has the same brain

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:08.290 align:middle line:10%
as us anatomically, but
he uses it differently.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.730 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think one of the keys in
Rudiger Gamm's case is the fact

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:16.320 align:middle line:84%
that he has the same brain,
the same hardware as any of us,

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.930 align:middle line:84%
but he uses it
slightly differently.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.750 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
some memory games,

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.540 align:middle line:84%
things that we've been told
can boost our brainpower,

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.660 align:middle line:84%
boost our memory and our
cognitive performance.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.270 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Michael Merzenich
said the way

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.290 align:middle line:84%
to actually use these games in a
way that will boost your memory

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.540 align:middle line:84%
and boost your
cognitive performance

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.950 align:middle line:84%
is by upping the
challenge level.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.310 align:middle line:84%
So if your skill
level is here, simply

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.680 align:middle line:84%
by boosting the
challenge level, you'll

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.500 align:middle line:84%
actually begin prompting
neuroplasticity.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.820 align:middle line:84%
So giving yourself a timeline
in a crossword puzzle,

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.850 align:middle line:84%
or trying a challenge that's a
little bit outside your comfort

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.820 align:middle line:84%
zone, this actually
allows for the brain

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.800 align:middle line:90%
to strive for something more.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.760 align:middle line:90%


00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.840 align:middle line:84%
Professor Don Vaughn from
UCLA, along with many

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.920 align:middle line:84%
of his colleagues, created
an app called ChatterBaby.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.860 align:middle line:84%
This app was created for
deaf and blind parents

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.120 align:middle line:84%
that are having trouble
connecting with their child.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.710 align:middle line:84%
So what they found was
that with acute training,

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.400 align:middle line:84%
the deaf parents that could not
hear the nuances of their baby

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.473 align:middle line:84%
crying that gave very rich
and valuable information

00:06:29.473 --> 00:06:30.890 align:middle line:84%
with what's wrong
with their child

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.910 align:middle line:84%
or what their child
needs, they were

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.610 align:middle line:84%
able to focus on what
they were seeing--

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.280 align:middle line:84%
the body language, the
facial expressions.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And in their minds'
ear, if you will,

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:46.240 align:middle line:84%
they were able to hear the
sound that they were missing.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Conversely, the
blind parents that

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.740 align:middle line:84%
weren't able to see
the body language

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.220 align:middle line:84%
but were able to hear
just fine were then

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.070 align:middle line:84%
able to tap into what
they were hearing,

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.740 align:middle line:84%
all the nuances
of it-- the cries,

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.580 align:middle line:84%
the chatter that
their baby displayed.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And in all those
nuances, it would

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:08.150 align:middle line:84%
translate into the visual
cortex of this blind parent.

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.140 align:middle line:84%
So in the mind's eye, they were
able to see, and in this way,

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.500 align:middle line:84%
they were able to connect
with their child in much

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.180 align:middle line:90%
more of a beautiful way.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.310 align:middle line:84%
This is just one of the many
examples of how neuroplasticity

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:25.690 align:middle line:84%
is truly remarkable in
allowing for certain impulses

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:29.500 align:middle line:84%
to translate themselves into
what's missing in our lives.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.210 align:middle line:90%


00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.530 align:middle line:84%
What are the actual conditions
that prompt our brain

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:38.220 align:middle line:90%
to restructure itself?

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.290 align:middle line:90%
The first one is attention.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:43.560 align:middle line:84%
The second one is the
duration of your attention

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.960 align:middle line:90%
and the intensity of it.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.300 align:middle line:84%
How deeply you're
actually focusing on what

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.550 align:middle line:90%
you're looking to focus on.

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:53.070 align:middle line:84%
The next one is
constraint and immersion.

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:56.160 align:middle line:84%
Meaning if you can
constrain your focus

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.500 align:middle line:84%
and leave out all the
distractions, all the things

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.800 align:middle line:84%
that pull your attention
away, constrain your attention

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.780 align:middle line:84%
into what you would
like to focus on

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:07.140 align:middle line:84%
and immerse yourself in
that one little aspect,

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.420 align:middle line:84%
then this is a condition
for neuroplasticity as well.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And the final two are
imitation and visualization.

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:17.550 align:middle line:90%


00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Let's actually give
another example.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.400 align:middle line:84%
Imagine you go to the movies,
because you want simply

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.570 align:middle line:90%
to be entertained.

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:25.940 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to put
any brainpower in,

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.530 align:middle line:84%
you just want to
sit in that seat

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:29.570 align:middle line:90%
and be entertained by the movie.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:32.480 align:middle line:84%
But you're sitting
right next to somebody

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.000 align:middle line:84%
who has come to watch
the movie to study

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.549 align:middle line:90%
the craft of screenwriting.

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:40.909 align:middle line:84%
So they're sitting there from
the same vantage point watching

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:43.580 align:middle line:84%
the same exact movie,
but their brain

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:48.290 align:middle line:84%
will prompt neuroplasticity
because they choose to learn.

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:51.500 align:middle line:84%
They focus their attention
on very unique things

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.810 align:middle line:90%
that they would like to learn.

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:57.050 align:middle line:84%
So they set the framework
for neuroplasticity,

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:59.900 align:middle line:84%
whereas you sitting
in the very next seat

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:06.080 align:middle line:84%
just wish to be entertained,
so no neuroplasticity pops up.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.850 align:middle line:84%
So now I want to
show you an episode

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:09.410 align:middle line:90%
of the "Science of Happiness--

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:13.570 align:middle line:84%
New Neural Pathways
with Ashleigh Sergeant."

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:17.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Your type of mind, my type
of mind used to be able to hide

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:23.320 align:middle line:10%
behind that idea of oh, it's
too late in my life to start

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.898 align:middle line:10%
meditating, or some of my
thought patterns are just

00:09:25.898 --> 00:09:27.940 align:middle line:10%
so deep, there's no way
I'm going to change them.

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:31.637 align:middle line:10%
And actually science used to
kind of go along with that,

00:09:31.637 --> 00:09:34.840 align:middle line:10%
with this idea that after
actually like nine years

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.280 align:middle line:10%
of age, it's kind of downhill.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:40.540 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS] And we're actually
degenerating in the brain.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:43.990 align:middle line:10%
But neuroscience now,
and particularly a branch

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:46.360 align:middle line:10%
of neuroscience called
neuroplasticity,

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.960 align:middle line:10%
shows us that actually,
new neural pathways

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:54.460 align:middle line:10%
are able to be created
throughout our entire life.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.800 align:middle line:10%
That being said, it's
like what we're actually

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:01.930 align:middle line:10%
able to do is to create
new patterns and new habits

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:05.750 align:middle line:10%
of thinking of the way that the
brain works whenever we want.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:08.720 align:middle line:90%


00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:12.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Growing new brain cells is
a process called neurogenesis.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.450 align:middle line:10%
And this is very
important to us,

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:16.430 align:middle line:10%
because many of the
modern lifestyle

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:18.950 align:middle line:10%
stressors, the
pollutants, and the things

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:23.820 align:middle line:10%
that we engage in on a daily
basis damage our brain cells.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:27.650 align:middle line:10%
So if we are now realizing that
we are able to create new brain

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:30.050 align:middle line:10%
cells, that there are
ways that we can actually

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:32.750 align:middle line:10%
generate this new
neural structure,

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:35.930 align:middle line:10%
then we have the power
to completely rebuild

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:38.540 align:middle line:10%
and completely
restructure our brain

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.240 align:middle line:10%
to better serve us moving
forward on this path.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.980 align:middle line:90%


00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:49.940 align:middle line:84%
We know now that novel and
functional forms of movement

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:54.110 align:middle line:84%
prompts neuroplasticity and
neurogenesis later in years,

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:56.280 align:middle line:90%
no matter how old you are.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.270 align:middle line:84%
We know that foods like
blueberries and chocolate,

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:02.810 align:middle line:84%
that high-intensity exercise
and aerobic exercise

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:06.770 align:middle line:84%
can prompt neuroplasticity
and neurogenesis.

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:10.490 align:middle line:84%
There are more, but let's just
stick with functional movement

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:11.540 align:middle line:90%
and novel movement.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.640 align:middle line:84%
Functional means the
biomechanical way

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:18.050 align:middle line:84%
that your body was designed
to move with nature.

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Novel means new-- unique ways
that your body can move--

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:26.090 align:middle line:84%
perhaps was even designed
to move, but it doesn't.

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:27.860 align:middle line:10%
And by doing these
things, that's

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:31.670 align:middle line:10%
when we start to notice
this pickup of neurogenesis

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:34.940 align:middle line:10%
and neuroplasticity
inside the brain.

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:38.360 align:middle line:84%
These things actually
strengthen the mind-body maps.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And what a mind-body
map is is your mind

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.720 align:middle line:84%
being able to know exactly where
your body is in space and time

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.210 align:middle line:84%
and feel confident that
if it gives a command,

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:49.970 align:middle line:84%
your body can execute
that perfectly.

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:54.570 align:middle line:90%


00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:57.990 align:middle line:84%
But to be fair, I want to
balance the conversation here.

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:00.390 align:middle line:84%
Greg Downey, he's
an anthropologist

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:04.570 align:middle line:84%
and the co-author of a popular
blog, "Neuroanthropology."

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:08.160 align:middle line:84%
He says, "I've seen
tremendous exaggeration.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.160 align:middle line:84%
People are so excited
about neuroplasticity

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.870 align:middle line:84%
that they talk themselves
into believing anything."

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.970 align:middle line:90%
So yes, Greg is very right.

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:18.830 align:middle line:84%
This is a natural
human condition for us

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:22.970 align:middle line:84%
to exaggerate, to extrapolate
meaning from what we hear.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:25.970 align:middle line:84%
To go beyond what the
data is showing us.

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And this must be
irritating to some people.

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:32.240 align:middle line:84%
However, I believe this
is also one of our gifts--

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.610 align:middle line:84%
the ability to
speculate, the ability

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:38.630 align:middle line:84%
to go beyond what science
has proven that we can do.

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.300 align:middle line:84%
Because we know that
what they have measured

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.370 align:middle line:84%
is only what we've
done in the past,

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:47.490 align:middle line:84%
but it does not determine
where we can go in the future.

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:51.380 align:middle line:10%
So one example of this is Major
General Albert Stubblebine.

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:54.410 align:middle line:10%
You may have seen the movie
"Men Who Stare at Goats."

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:59.150 align:middle line:10%
The very first scene is this man
trying to walk through a wall

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:02.810 align:middle line:10%
and smacking his face
against the brick wall.

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:05.900 align:middle line:84%
He believed that if he
held that intention,

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:09.170 align:middle line:84%
that he could pass through
that wall unscathed,

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:11.990 align:middle line:84%
that he could dematerialize
and rematerialize

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:15.140 align:middle line:84%
on the other side, that that
intention and that belief

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:16.830 align:middle line:90%
would be enough.

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:17.900 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:19.140 align:middle line:90%
He was wrong.

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:20.730 align:middle line:90%
He failed.

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.580 align:middle line:84%
So to Greg Downey's
point, yes, this

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:27.930 align:middle line:84%
may be overzealousness and
speculation and exaggeration.

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:31.410 align:middle line:84%
However, does that mean that
what Albert Stubblebine was

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:33.840 align:middle line:90%
trying to do was not realistic?

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.190 align:middle line:90%
Impossible?

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:39.210 align:middle line:84%
Or does it simply mean he
didn't do it correctly?

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.208 align:middle line:90%
Something to ponder.

00:13:41.208 --> 00:13:42.750 align:middle line:84%
So let's just stick
with what science

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:46.500 align:middle line:84%
is telling us right now so
we don't exaggerate too much.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.380 align:middle line:10%
There was a study out
of Northwestern Medicine

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:52.350 align:middle line:10%
and the University of
Colorado School of Medicine

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:56.040 align:middle line:10%
that found that high-intensity
exercise for Parkinson's

00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:01.560 align:middle line:10%
patients will actually halt the
progression of their symptoms.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:05.220 align:middle line:84%
There's also another
study from Dr. Ambra Bisio

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.230 align:middle line:84%
from the Department of
Experimental Medicine

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:09.400 align:middle line:90%
at the University of Genoa.

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And she says Alzheimer's
patients are still

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:15.600 align:middle line:84%
able to voluntarily imitate
the movement of an object

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.450 align:middle line:84%
as well as that
of a human being.

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:21.120 align:middle line:84%
If this ability
is still in place,

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.160 align:middle line:84%
a patient could
relearn how to perform

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.100 align:middle line:84%
actions that have become
difficult due to the disease.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:31.300 align:middle line:90%


00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:32.640 align:middle line:90%
So we're back to that word--

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:33.840 align:middle line:90%
imitation.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.720 align:middle line:84%
That's one of those conditions
for neuroplasticity,

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.900 align:middle line:84%
to be able to use the body
to imitate the movement

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:44.880 align:middle line:84%
of an object or another person
is actually a way of reversing

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.640 align:middle line:84%
some of the symptoms
of Alzheimer's.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:52.840 align:middle line:84%
Now Parkinson's and Alzheimer's
are neurodegenerative diseases.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:56.310 align:middle line:84%
So this is very interesting
that the active use of our body

00:14:56.310 --> 00:15:00.280 align:middle line:84%
can halt the symptomology of
a neurodegenerative disease.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:07.180 align:middle line:90%


00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.000 align:middle line:84%
This is why I like to use
a quote from Robert Brault

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.620 align:middle line:84%
that I think sums
this up perfectly.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.550 align:middle line:84%
"There are people who live their
entire lives on their default

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:19.560 align:middle line:84%
settings, never realizing
that you can customize."

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And you truly can customize your
brain and customize your life.

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.060 align:middle line:90%


00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.180 align:middle line:84%
So now let's look at
one more condition

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:30.800 align:middle line:84%
that gives rise to
neuroplasticity,

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.860 align:middle line:90%
the condition of visualization.

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Let's hear from the expert
David Hamilton with "On the Road

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:39.890 align:middle line:90%
with Lilou."

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:43.050 align:middle line:10%
>> So what I often do is just
call it a piece of research.

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:46.460 align:middle line:10%
So for example, if I'm
suggesting to people

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:48.350 align:middle line:10%
that what they
visualize can have

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:50.840 align:middle line:10%
a physical impact in the
body, now mentioning that

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.160 align:middle line:10%
would sound preposterous.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.260 align:middle line:10%
How can I visualize
myself and change my body?

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:58.160 align:middle line:10%
Well, here's one part of
many parts of evidence.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.520 align:middle line:10%
Harvard University that
does a fantastic study

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.880 align:middle line:10%
where they asked volunteers
to play a simple combination

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:05.680 align:middle line:10%
of piano notes.

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.555 align:middle line:10%
They literately went,
sat in front of a piano

00:16:07.555 --> 00:16:11.870 align:middle line:10%
and went [MIMICKING MUSIC NOTES]
repetitively for two hours,

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:14.600 align:middle line:10%
just five-finger muscle
combination repetitively

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.250 align:middle line:10%
for two hours on five
consecutive days.

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:19.340 align:middle line:10%
So Monday through Friday.

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.220 align:middle line:10%
And they had their
brain imaged every day.

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:25.820 align:middle line:10%
And what the scientists found is
the area of the brain connected

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:29.160 align:middle line:10%
to the finger muscles began
to grow like a muscle.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.798 align:middle line:10%
And by the fourth day, it
was substantially larger

00:16:31.798 --> 00:16:33.340 align:middle line:10%
than it was on the
Monday, and that's

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:36.110 align:middle line:10%
a term known as neuroplasticity.

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:37.930 align:middle line:10%
But where it gets
really interesting

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:40.040 align:middle line:10%
is a separate group
of volunteers,

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.250 align:middle line:10%
instead of physically
playing the piano notes--

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:45.060 align:middle line:10%
[MIMICKING MUSIC NOTES],, they
had to do it in their heads.

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:47.210 align:middle line:10%
So they had to just--
without moving their muscles,

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:50.870 align:middle line:10%
they had to imagine going

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:54.020 align:middle line:10%
repetitively for the same
two hours for the same five

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:55.970 align:middle line:10%
consecutive days,
Monday through Friday.

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:59.720 align:middle line:10%
And they had their brain imaged
every day, and incredibly,

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.000 align:middle line:10%
their brain began to
grow like a muscle,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.099 align:middle line:10%
and the area connected
to the finger muscles.

00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:06.619 align:middle line:10%
And if you compare it
on the Friday the brain

00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:10.130 align:middle line:10%
images for those who physically
played the notes with those who

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:12.890 align:middle line:10%
imagined playing the notes, put
the slates beside each other,

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:14.310 align:middle line:10%
you couldn't tell
the difference.

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:15.810 align:middle line:10%
So in other words,
the brain was not

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:18.890 align:middle line:10%
distinguishing between
who actually played piano

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:20.208 align:middle line:10%
and who was imagining it.

00:17:20.208 --> 00:17:22.250 align:middle line:10%
So that's a very, very
powerful piece of evidence

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:25.819 align:middle line:10%
that shows that we have
physically shaped the structure

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:28.319 align:middle line:10%
of the brain by
imagining something,

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:30.740 align:middle line:10%
and if we can do that,
what else can we do?

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:34.810 align:middle line:90%


00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:38.410 align:middle line:84%
>> What I love about what David
Hamilton says there is that

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:44.080 align:middle line:84%
the way you think literally
can restructure your brain.

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.730 align:middle line:84%
But now let's take
it a step further.

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:49.550 align:middle line:84%
We're just talking about
so far neurohacking

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:53.490 align:middle line:84%
our individual mind the
brain mind, if you will.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:57.120 align:middle line:84%
That's the mini-mind, but
what about the super mind?

00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.740 align:middle line:84%
The mind that exists
in between many of us?

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:03.290 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of science
that's coming out nowadays

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:07.010 align:middle line:84%
that shows that our brain may
be a transmitter and a receiver

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:11.540 align:middle line:84%
for intelligence that
exists outside of our brain.

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that this is
what all those anxious movement

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:20.190 align:middle line:84%
modalities of Tai
Chi, Falun Gong, yoga,

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:24.480 align:middle line:84%
shamanic dance, the Whirling
Dervishes, and so on and so

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.280 align:middle line:84%
forth, all of these
movement modalities,

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.120 align:middle line:84%
they're linking the
body with the mind,

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.970 align:middle line:84%
they're silencing the mind
and linking the breath

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:38.310 align:middle line:84%
with very unique movements, and
they do this over much time.

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And this practice is
not simply to help

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.920 align:middle line:84%
with their Parkinson's or
their Alzheimer's, this

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.090 align:middle line:90%
is a spiritual practice.

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:49.290 align:middle line:84%
So there's so much to be said
about these ancient movement

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:53.490 align:middle line:84%
modalities and what they have
to say about our true potential

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:56.100 align:middle line:84%
and how we can reshape
the mind, but go

00:18:56.100 --> 00:19:00.170 align:middle line:84%
beyond the individual
mind into the super mind.

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:02.990 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look at an
episode of "Psychedelica,"

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:06.520 align:middle line:90%
a Gaia original series.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.490 align:middle line:10%
>> The remaining indigenous
of the original tribes carry

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:12.310 align:middle line:10%
on the belief that
regardless of the skepticism,

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:16.710 align:middle line:10%
the prophecy is in motion, and
a revival of shamanic traditions

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:22.150 align:middle line:10%
and interest among even the
Western world is growing.

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And signs of this
shift in consciousness

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:27.310 align:middle line:84%
may also be appearing in pop
cultural trends returning

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:29.260 align:middle line:90%
to nature-based activities.

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.870 align:middle line:84%
Exercise rituals of
just a few decades ago

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:34.390 align:middle line:84%
are being revisioned
in a natural setting,

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:37.840 align:middle line:84%
linking the body and mind
back to these spaces.

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.990 align:middle line:10%
Dietary trends are looking
back into ancestral traditions

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:44.590 align:middle line:10%
that pre-date colonial
grain-based diets.

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:47.410 align:middle line:84%
Workshops are popping up around
the world with catchwords

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:51.580 align:middle line:84%
like re-wilding, primal,
ancestral, and shamanic.

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:53.500 align:middle line:84%
Could this be a
sign of the times?

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.360 align:middle line:84%
That the innate
balancing intelligence

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.690 align:middle line:84%
of the collective senses the
need for uniting with our roots

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:00.770 align:middle line:90%
once more?

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:03.610 align:middle line:10%
And in this way, the
real shamanic medicine

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:05.830 align:middle line:10%
was understood to
be relationships

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:07.480 align:middle line:10%
and the strength of the group--

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:10.120 align:middle line:10%
integrate remembering of
the deeper purposes of life.

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:16.870 align:middle line:90%


00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>> What this is really showing
us is that our community is

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.430 align:middle line:90%
a greater aspect of our mind.

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:27.090 align:middle line:84%
That we tap into it, we
influence one another.

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:30.030 align:middle line:84%
We connect almost
neurologically with the people

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:31.650 align:middle line:90%
in our community.

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:35.310 align:middle line:84%
To such a degree that
Jim Rohn even said,

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:37.350 align:middle line:84%
"You are the average
of the five people

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:39.960 align:middle line:84%
you spend the most
amount of time with."

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.330 align:middle line:84%
This may not be
accurate to the number,

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:44.550 align:middle line:84%
but think of what
this is implying.

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:47.550 align:middle line:84%
That the people you spend
the most amount of time with

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:52.040 align:middle line:84%
are like neurons that fire
together and wire together.

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.320 align:middle line:84%
If you truly are
like the people you

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:57.770 align:middle line:84%
spend the most amount of time
with, then think about it.

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:02.090 align:middle line:84%
Who are you spending the most
amount of your time with?

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And remember that we in
our greater community,

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:08.120 align:middle line:84%
in our society, whether
we truly meet everybody

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:13.610 align:middle line:84%
in this community or not, we
are many people with one voice.

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:16.250 align:middle line:84%
This has been happening
since the beginning of time,

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:20.240 align:middle line:84%
banding together into these
social groups and cliques,

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.910 align:middle line:84%
and influencing the
way we behave based

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:24.800 align:middle line:90%
upon the people around us.

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And then it grew
to entire nations.

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:30.800 align:middle line:84%
So in nations, there was
national pride and groupthink

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:34.880 align:middle line:84%
in such ways that if a nation
agreed with another nation,

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.410 align:middle line:90%
they could become allies.

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:39.710 align:middle line:84%
If they disagreed,
it would mean war.

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And now, with a mass
homogenization, as I call it,

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:46.250 align:middle line:84%
of our mind, what
we're seeing now

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:50.210 align:middle line:84%
is that industry even
supersedes all of the loyalties

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:52.920 align:middle line:84%
to specific countries
and nations.

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.640 align:middle line:84%
That around the world,
these industries

00:21:55.640 --> 00:22:00.530 align:middle line:84%
are banding together many
people, many actions,

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:03.066 align:middle line:90%
but one voice and one direction.

00:22:03.066 --> 00:22:06.880 align:middle line:90%


00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:10.560 align:middle line:84%
But that's just national,
that's just humans.

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:14.580 align:middle line:90%
How far does our mind truly go?

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.560 align:middle line:90%
How all-encompassing is it?

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:19.780 align:middle line:84%
If we take a look
at the universe,

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:26.120 align:middle line:84%
could we see evidence that the
mind exists out there as well?

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:28.150 align:middle line:84%
So I invite you to take
a look at this image.

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:32.310 align:middle line:84%
On the left you will
see an image of neurons.

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And these neurons are
firing and wiring together,

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:38.620 align:middle line:84%
and you can see that there
is a very unique way that it

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:41.110 align:middle line:90%
looks as they're connected.

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:43.570 align:middle line:84%
Now take a look at the
image on the right.

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:45.890 align:middle line:84%
It looks fairly
similar, doesn't it?

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:47.810 align:middle line:84%
But to see the
image on the right,

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:50.930 align:middle line:84%
you would have to use a
telescope, not a microscope,

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:53.770 align:middle line:84%
because what you're
looking at are galaxies,

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:57.820 align:middle line:84%
and those connections between
the galaxies are very real.

00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:00.020 align:middle line:84%
Now you can't see them
with the naked eye.

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:02.080 align:middle line:90%
These are enhanced photos.

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:05.350 align:middle line:84%
So what it's actually showing
is that these connections

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:09.190 align:middle line:84%
have been found through
gravitational arc photography,

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:13.270 align:middle line:84%
meaning that in the
naked darkness of space,

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:16.360 align:middle line:84%
astronomers were noticing
that light was bending itself

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.910 align:middle line:84%
towards these invisible
channels between galaxies.

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:22.300 align:middle line:90%


00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:26.410 align:middle line:84%
Then they came to find
that these are ionic plasma

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:32.140 align:middle line:84%
channels, meaning there is ionic
organized information-sharing

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:33.040 align:middle line:90%
between galaxies.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:37.330 align:middle line:90%


00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:40.260 align:middle line:84%
So I invite you to ponder
what this might mean.

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:44.350 align:middle line:84%
If there is information
sharing between galaxies,

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:46.390 align:middle line:90%
what does this mean for us?

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:49.050 align:middle line:90%
Can we access this information?

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:52.710 align:middle line:84%
Are we a part of
this super mind?

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:54.300 align:middle line:90%
And can we hack it?

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:57.990 align:middle line:84%
Is there a form of
neuroplasticity or neurogenesis

00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:01.210 align:middle line:84%
that happens at
the galactic level?

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:03.730 align:middle line:10%
These are important questions
to ask, because we do not

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:05.770 align:middle line:10%
want to limit where
we think we can

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:09.190 align:middle line:10%
go with all of our potential.

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:11.610 align:middle line:84%
So there's two
types of mindsets.

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:14.400 align:middle line:84%
One is a fixed
mindset, and the other

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.970 align:middle line:84%
is a growth mindset,
and most all of us

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:18.860 align:middle line:90%
fit into one or the other.

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:22.198 align:middle line:90%
A fixed mindset sees a problem.

00:24:22.198 --> 00:24:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And if that problem is
bigger than anything

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:27.080 align:middle line:84%
that we've overcome
before, then we quit.

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:29.730 align:middle line:84%
We dop not believe
we can overcome it.

00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:33.050 align:middle line:84%
We do not look for challenges,
we do not rise to the occasion.

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is distinctly different
than the growth mindset.

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:40.490 align:middle line:84%
The growth mindset
is activated, engaged

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:46.860 align:middle line:84%
by challenges there
is no challenge that

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:48.720 align:middle line:90%
seems too big for us.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:52.020 align:middle line:84%
Maybe too big for us right
now, but the growth mindset

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:56.270 align:middle line:84%
knows we can overcome
any challenge.

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And we love rising
to that occasion

00:24:58.140 --> 00:24:59.520 align:middle line:90%
because we love learning.

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And not just about the outside
world, but what we can truly do

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:middle line:84%
and what we're capable
of in this life.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.370 align:middle line:90%


00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Now I'll leave you
with a challenge

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:13.870 align:middle line:84%
so you can actually employ
what I'm talking about

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:15.490 align:middle line:84%
and feel the changes
in your life.

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:20.510 align:middle line:90%


00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:22.570 align:middle line:84%
There are three components
to this challenge,

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:24.880 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to do
them every single day.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:27.340 align:middle line:84%
The first, try some
crossword puzzles,

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.980 align:middle line:84%
some Sudoku, some
video games, but I

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:34.090 align:middle line:84%
want you to boost the challenge
level so your skill level has

00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:36.100 align:middle line:90%
to rise to the occasion.

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:38.320 align:middle line:84%
You may not be very good at
it, but what you're doing

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:42.070 align:middle line:84%
is you're calling yourself
to a higher standard.

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, I want you to
engage in at least 20 minutes

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:49.330 align:middle line:84%
of high-intensity exercise
or aerobic exercise,

00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:52.210 align:middle line:84%
because we know that this
prompts neuroplasticity

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:53.350 align:middle line:90%
and neurogenesis.

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:56.240 align:middle line:90%


00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And every single
day I would like

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.730 align:middle line:84%
you to add two
things to your diet--

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:03.520 align:middle line:90%
blueberries and chocolate.

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:04.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes, chocolate.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:08.800 align:middle line:84%
These two things also on
their own prompt neurogenesis

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.470 align:middle line:90%
and neuroplasticity.

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And if you do this every
day until I see you next,

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:17.680 align:middle line:84%
you will have effectively
neurohacked your mind

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:21.630 align:middle line:84%
and tasted the immense
power of the super mind.

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:24.390 align:middle line:84%
So I hope to see you next
time around on "Limitless."
