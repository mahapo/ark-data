00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.450 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.100 align:middle line:10%
And today we're talking
about incrementalism.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.330 align:middle line:10%
I'm going start with a
quote by Rick Pitino.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.610 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Make
incremental progress

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.320 align:middle line:84%
because change comes not by
the yard, but by the inch."

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.990 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to share a
personal story with you

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.420 align:middle line:84%
about how I use the
incremental process

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.360 align:middle line:84%
to overcome a fear of
heights that I developed.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.030 align:middle line:84%
When I was younger, I
had no issues jumping off

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.640 align:middle line:90%
of 40 foot cliffs into water.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.600 align:middle line:10%
But later on in life, having not
done that for quite some time,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.860 align:middle line:10%
I was up in Crater Lake, and
I noticed that I couldn't even

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.870 align:middle line:10%
jump off of a 15 foot cliff.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.650 align:middle line:10%
So I tried climbing
down to about 10 feet.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.730 align:middle line:10%
Still couldn't do it.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.260 align:middle line:84%
I never ended up jumping
into Crater Lake,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.580 align:middle line:90%
and this bugged me for a while.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.310 align:middle line:84%
So what I did was
I went back home

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.530 align:middle line:84%
and I practiced on
a different ledge.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.070 align:middle line:84%
It was this ledge that creeped
up a hill into some water.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And I started at
the base floor--

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.480 align:middle line:90%
one foot off the ground.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.280 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.080 align:middle line:90%
It was simple.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.930 align:middle line:90%
But I jumped off.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:34.730 align:middle line:90%
I did it.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:35.950 align:middle line:90%
I managed to do it.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:36.930 align:middle line:90%
I got out.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.290 align:middle line:90%
I went up roughly two feet.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.200 align:middle line:90%
I jumped off.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.000 align:middle line:90%
I did it.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.210 align:middle line:90%
Fine.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And then I kept going in
this incremental process.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And by the time I realized
it, I was at 20 feet

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.330 align:middle line:84%
again, jumping off 20
foot cliffs into the water

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.720 align:middle line:84%
because I approached
it incrementally.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.780 align:middle line:84%
Bit by bit, my comfort
zone was allowed

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.220 align:middle line:90%
to go with me on this journey.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.850 align:middle line:84%
So there's something beautiful
about taking your comfort

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:03.680 align:middle line:90%
with you.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.480 align:middle line:84%
About how the incremental
process allows your body

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.840 align:middle line:84%
to feel more confident in
what its engaged in as well.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.530 align:middle line:84%
So today, we're
solving a riddle.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.480 align:middle line:84%
There's two aspects
to this riddle.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.850 align:middle line:84%
First part is, should I be
the tortoise or the hare.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.058 align:middle line:84%
Second part is, is this
life or is it a race?

00:02:28.058 --> 00:02:29.600 align:middle line:84%
If you're not familiar
with the story

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.040 align:middle line:84%
of the tortoise
and the hare, it's

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.910 align:middle line:84%
basically a turtle and a
rabbit that decide to race.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.200 align:middle line:90%
The race starts.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.160 align:middle line:10%
The rabbit takes off, obviously
much faster than the turtle.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.260 align:middle line:84%
But the turtle is
going incrementally

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.890 align:middle line:90%
towards that goal.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.210 align:middle line:10%
But there's so much ego
and hubris in this rabbit

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.910 align:middle line:10%
that he takes off straight
for the goal line,

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.920 align:middle line:10%
but he stops short.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.650 align:middle line:84%
The rabbit believes he's
going to win this hands down,

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.240 align:middle line:84%
so he decides, I
can even take a nap,

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.170 align:middle line:84%
and I'll still wake up
time to beat this turtle.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.750 align:middle line:10%
But to his great
horror, he wakes up

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.970 align:middle line:10%
and realizes that
the turtle is already

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.830 align:middle line:10%
crossing the finish line.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.870 align:middle line:90%
He was too late.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is just
a parable, but I

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.410 align:middle line:84%
believe the point is that in
our high, fast-paced society,

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.190 align:middle line:84%
we have to ask ourselves,
are we missing the point?

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.380 align:middle line:84%
Is life a journey, or is it
all about that destination?

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Do we really need to be
skyrocketing towards that goal,

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.880 align:middle line:84%
or is there something that
we're missing along the way?

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.940 align:middle line:10%
Let's use the example you need
to get from LA, all the way up

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.250 align:middle line:10%
into the redwoods of
California, and there's

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.850 align:middle line:10%
two ways you can go.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.170 align:middle line:84%
One is by taking a
really fast train.

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.710 align:middle line:84%
Let's say this train
goes 200 miles an hour.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:49.520 align:middle line:84%
It goes so fast that there
is no scenery, really.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.030 align:middle line:90%
It's all just a blur.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.820 align:middle line:84%
So you're not taking
in any of the nature.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.380 align:middle line:84%
You're not taking in
any of the landmarks.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.010 align:middle line:84%
Now you'll get to that
destination far quicker,

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.800 align:middle line:90%
but what have you missed?

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.890 align:middle line:84%
The other option was,
you could take a bicycle

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.640 align:middle line:84%
and ride it up Route 1,
that windy, slow road.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.780 align:middle line:84%
That gorgeous road where the
mountains meet the water,

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.500 align:middle line:84%
where the ocean crashes its
waves against the rocks.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.540 align:middle line:90%
The mist going into the air.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.190 align:middle line:84%
You can see the
rainbow through it.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.019 align:middle line:90%
You can smell the salt water.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And on the other side, you see
all this lush nature, the flora

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.070 align:middle line:90%
and fauna.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.870 align:middle line:90%
You can smell it.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.850 align:middle line:84%
You can hear the
songs on it, and you

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:35.300 align:middle line:84%
can drink in every little nuance
of the path of the journey.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.160 align:middle line:84%
Is our high and fast-paced
society causing us illness?

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.940 align:middle line:84%
As we see, there's far more
stress than in the slower

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.380 align:middle line:90%
paced societies.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.140 align:middle line:10%
And this stress seems
to worsen or increase

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.780 align:middle line:10%
the risk of conditions like
obesity, heart disease,

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.100 align:middle line:10%
Alzheimer's,
diabetes, depression,

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.770 align:middle line:10%
gastrointestinal
problems, and even asthma.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.280 align:middle line:10%
It also lowers the
quality of life.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.160 align:middle line:84%
Just to put it in
perspective, in your life,

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.080 align:middle line:84%
if you live 80 years,
you will likely

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.210 align:middle line:84%
eat 35 tons of food
or 90,000 meals.

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.540 align:middle line:84%
You will likely bend over to
tie your shoes roughly 25,000

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.590 align:middle line:84%
to 50,000 times, or just
bend over in general 50

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.870 align:middle line:90%
to 75,000 times.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And you will likely take
672 million breaths.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.790 align:middle line:84%
If you live to 80, all
of these things add up.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.760 align:middle line:84%
They're either going to
add up to habits that are

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.460 align:middle line:90%
good or bad for your health.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.640 align:middle line:84%
Because take a snapshot of who
and what you are right now--

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.580 align:middle line:84%
your health, your look,
everything about you,

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.510 align:middle line:84%
and you are literally a
snapshot of all the decisions--

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.390 align:middle line:84%
all the decisions that
you made your entire life

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.310 align:middle line:90%
leading up to this point.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.890 align:middle line:90%
Because habits truly matter.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.720 align:middle line:84%
Now there are statistics
showing that roughly 45%

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:04.640 align:middle line:84%
of the population by 2035 will
have one heart-related disease.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.360 align:middle line:84%
Heart disease is the number
one killer in the US,

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.880 align:middle line:84%
but Alzheimer's
is not far behind.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Respiratory issues,
diabetes, cancer,

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.780 align:middle line:84%
and more, even chronic pain,
anxiety, and depression,

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:18.940 align:middle line:90%
they're all on the rise.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.460 align:middle line:90%


00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.040 align:middle line:84%
But they're all
truly manageable.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.745 align:middle line:84%
They're all truly preventable,
through the tortoise approach.

>> There was a Swiss doctor by
the name of Paul Kouchakoff.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.580 align:middle line:10%
He was the first to
show in the 1930s

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.350 align:middle line:10%
that if you ate a diet that
was more than 51% cooked

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.320 align:middle line:10%
food, that your body
would react to the food

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.220 align:middle line:10%
as if it was being invaded
by a foreign organism.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.190 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Kouchakoff was the
first to demonstrate

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:07.120 align:middle line:10%
that if 51% of your
meals were raw,

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.530 align:middle line:10%
that you would have
no leukocytosis,

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.480 align:middle line:10%
or you would actually have
no white blood cell reaction.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.090 align:middle line:10%
So your immune
system would not be

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:17.898 align:middle line:10%
activated with a false alarm.

00:07:17.898 --> 00:07:20.190 align:middle line:10%
Because we're dealing with
so many immune system issues

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:23.430 align:middle line:10%
today, we have to make
sure that at least 51%

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:26.400 align:middle line:10%
of every meal that
we have is raw

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.320 align:middle line:10%
so that we don't overburden that
already burdened immune system.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:02.630 align:middle line:10%
have a cup of tea for
breakfast, and a piece of toast,

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:06.840 align:middle line:10%
a sugary drink for
mid-morning, a donut for lunch,

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.440 align:middle line:10%
and takeaway fried
chicken at night,

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.770 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to be massively
deficient in a whole range

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:13.570 align:middle line:10%
of nutrients.

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:15.160 align:middle line:90%
And that's only one day.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.150 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to need something
in the way of supplements.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:22.500 align:middle line:10%
So the next day, I
eat salad, until it's

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.550 align:middle line:10%
coming out of my ears to
try and make up for it.

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:26.970 align:middle line:84%
But I never ever correct
the deficiency that

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:28.610 align:middle line:90%
occurred from the day before.

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:32.549 align:middle line:84%
There was always going to be
a residual problem somewhere.

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:36.720 align:middle line:10%
So you cannot punish yourselves
without having to pay for it

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:37.559 align:middle line:10%
sooner or later.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:40.100 align:middle line:90%


00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>> So you've heard
this all before.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.490 align:middle line:90%
You are what you eat.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:45.890 align:middle line:84%
But the question we need
to start asking ourselves,

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:48.170 align:middle line:84%
whether it's do I
eat conventional food

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:51.650 align:middle line:84%
with pesticides and
genetically-modified material

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:54.080 align:middle line:90%
or organic food.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.780 align:middle line:90%
Is the excuse really money?

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And how does that
add up over time

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.640 align:middle line:84%
when you balance it
with health care costs?

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Ask yourself, do you
sacrifice very healthy sleep

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:10.970 align:middle line:84%
and lifestyles such as eating
and movement habits for work,

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:14.420 align:middle line:84%
leisure, socializing
with friends?

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.930 align:middle line:84%
All of these are
good when in balance.

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:19.770 align:middle line:90%
But it's not all about diet.

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.130 align:middle line:10%
It's also about
movement, and that's

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:25.970 align:middle line:10%
when I started becoming aware
of this man, Stephen Jepson.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.790 align:middle line:10%
He founded
NeverLeavethePlayground.com.

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And he was showing how balance,
coordination, and challenge

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:36.140 align:middle line:84%
are truly good and
optimal for our health.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:39.530 align:middle line:84%
He started by taking
people over the age of 65

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:41.180 align:middle line:90%
and working with their balance.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And he was doing this
because there's a statistic.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Over the age of
65, people who fall

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.480 align:middle line:84%
have much more of a
chance of actually

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.300 align:middle line:90%
that being a mortal accident.

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:58.340 align:middle line:84%
By 2030, statistics are showing
that roughly 60,000 Americans

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:03.200 align:middle line:84%
over the age of 65
will die from falls.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.220 align:middle line:90%
What's the solution?

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:09.200 align:middle line:84%
The solution is to make
real incremental progress

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.470 align:middle line:90%
towards better health.

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:15.010 align:middle line:84%
The way of doing this, at least
from Steven Jepson's method,

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:19.900 align:middle line:84%
is by working on balance and
working on bilateral training,

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:24.400 align:middle line:84%
such as juggling or using your
less dominant hand in whatever

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.350 align:middle line:90%
task you're employed with.

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Allows for the balancing of
both hemispheres of the body

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:34.536 align:middle line:84%
and more mental acuteness
and more mental clarity.

00:10:34.536 --> 00:10:37.180 align:middle line:10%
And what Stephen started doing
for these elders over the age

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:41.830 align:middle line:10%
of 65 was he would sit them
in a chair, no shoes, and two

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:43.340 align:middle line:10%
buckets in front of them.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.700 align:middle line:10%
One is filled with marbles
and tiny little toys

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:47.170 align:middle line:10%
and the other is empty.

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:50.440 align:middle line:10%
So they would take their toes
to pick up these little toys

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.150 align:middle line:10%
and drop them in
the other bucket.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:55.720 align:middle line:10%
But then, he would bump up
the challenge incrementally.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.530 align:middle line:10%
So he would stand them up.

00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:00.100 align:middle line:10%
So now they didn't have the
chair to hold their balance.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.740 align:middle line:10%
So now it's the same
task, but bumped up

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.660 align:middle line:10%
in its challenge
level a little bit.

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:08.030 align:middle line:10%
So this incremental
process was so incredible

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:10.030 align:middle line:10%
and people were feeling
that they were actually

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:12.550 align:middle line:10%
bouncing back with their
balance far quicker

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:14.120 align:middle line:10%
than they ever imagined.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:17.020 align:middle line:10%
So the incremental
process is not as slow

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.770 align:middle line:10%
as we may think it is.

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:20.530 align:middle line:10%
But one of the most
beautiful things that

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:23.470 align:middle line:10%
started popping up
out of these practices

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:25.510 align:middle line:10%
was many of these
individuals that

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:29.770 align:middle line:10%
had a neurodegenerative disease,
like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:32.290 align:middle line:10%
or dementia, would
actually notice not just

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:35.860 align:middle line:10%
a halting of their
symptoms but a reversal.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:39.490 align:middle line:84%
Because these practices,
linking the body in the mind,

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:42.610 align:middle line:84%
even with very
minute tasks, starts

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:44.830 align:middle line:84%
to strengthen
mind-body maps, which

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:46.960 align:middle line:84%
is the linking of
the mind and the body

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.840 align:middle line:90%
together on those tasks.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.940 align:middle line:84%
So these are the
incremental processes

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.670 align:middle line:84%
that we can start
employing in our lives that

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.930 align:middle line:90%
will add up in a good way.

00:11:56.930 --> 00:12:00.370 align:middle line:84%
But what exactly do they
add up to in regards

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:03.430 align:middle line:84%
to our emotional state, in
regards to our self-confidence,

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:06.240 align:middle line:84%
and what we believe
about ourselves?

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.460 align:middle line:10%
Let's take a look at
what Dr. Joe Dispenza has

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.800 align:middle line:10%
to say on an episode
of "Open Minds,"

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:15.150 align:middle line:10%
called "Deprogramming
Collective Beliefs."

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:16.410 align:middle line:10%
>> Our brain is an artifact.

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:19.410 align:middle line:10%
It's a record of all the things
we've learned and experienced.

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:22.630 align:middle line:10%
Our brain is a reflection
of our external environment.

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:24.698 align:middle line:84%
So if you take a
series of thoughts

00:12:24.698 --> 00:12:26.490 align:middle line:84%
that are connected to
a series of feelings,

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:27.985 align:middle line:84%
you have a thought
that's connected

00:12:27.985 --> 00:12:29.360 align:middle line:84%
to a feeling, a
thought connected

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.902 align:middle line:84%
to a feeling, a thought that's
connected to a feeling, that's

00:12:31.902 --> 00:12:33.060 align:middle line:90%
called an attitude.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:35.660 align:middle line:84%
So attitudes are
shortened states of being.

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:36.730 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:38.970 align:middle line:84%
So if you take an attitude,
an attitude, an attitude,

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:40.770 align:middle line:84%
and you string
attitudes together,

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:42.615 align:middle line:90%
that creates a belief.

00:12:42.615 --> 00:12:44.400 align:middle line:84%
Now a belief is
just the thought you

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.820 align:middle line:84%
keep thinking over and over
again until you hardwire it

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.320 align:middle line:90%
in your brain.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And beliefs are created
from past experiences.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:56.320 align:middle line:84%
So the very boundaries of
our beliefs are how we feel.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.810 align:middle line:84%
So when our beliefs
are challenged,

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.750 align:middle line:90%
it usually doesn't feel right.

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:04.570 align:middle line:84%
So if how you think and how you
feel creates a state of being,

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:06.120 align:middle line:84%
and an attitude is
a state of being,

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:09.150 align:middle line:84%
and you're chunking
different attitudes together,

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:12.510 align:middle line:84%
then a belief is an
extended state of being.

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:13.872 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:13:13.872 --> 00:13:15.330 align:middle line:84%
So if you keep
thinking and feeling

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.840 align:middle line:84%
and feeling and thinking,
as we said in the last show,

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.940 align:middle line:84%
you condition the body to
become the subconscious mind.

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:22.130 align:middle line:90%
The body becomes the mind.

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:24.450 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:26.310 align:middle line:90%


00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's truly fascinating
how Joe Dispenza was mentioning

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:33.560 align:middle line:84%
that the body is the
subconscious mind.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.720 align:middle line:84%
We condition the body to
become the subconscious mind.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.400 align:middle line:84%
So what he's saying there is
that our body, in flesh, blood,

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:45.290 align:middle line:84%
and behavior acts out a
symbolic or a metaphorical link

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:48.410 align:middle line:84%
between the body and
the subconscious mind,

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:51.050 align:middle line:84%
a way of accessing
our subconscious

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:55.130 align:middle line:84%
through the active and
intelligent use of our body.

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:57.130 align:middle line:84%
But the subconscious
mind is truly

00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:00.250 align:middle line:84%
the sleeping driver behind
most of our decisions

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:02.530 align:middle line:90%
and our actions.

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And John Dryden said, "We
first make our habits,

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:09.690 align:middle line:90%
and then our habits make us."

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that's not new.

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:12.780 align:middle line:90%
I didn't come up with this.

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:16.590 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you look back into
the ancient movement modalities

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:21.090 align:middle line:84%
of Tai Chi, martial
arts, yoga, all of these

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:25.080 align:middle line:84%
were taking the incremental
process of sophisticating

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.078 align:middle line:84%
the body movements and
linking it with the mind

00:14:28.078 --> 00:14:29.370 align:middle line:90%
and linking it with the breath.

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:32.180 align:middle line:90%


00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:35.530 align:middle line:84%
But now, let's take a look at
our modern society, the world

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:39.610 align:middle line:84%
that those ancient movement
modalities were not made for.

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:42.280 align:middle line:84%
Are we living in a
quick fix society,

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.850 align:middle line:84%
where all of our ailments,
all of our issues,

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:49.210 align:middle line:84%
all of our inconveniences
should be solved by society,

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:52.220 align:middle line:84%
with little to no
effort on our behalf?

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Is that the world
we're living in?

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:56.590 align:middle line:84%
Where we don't want to have
to rise to the occasion,

00:14:56.590 --> 00:15:00.070 align:middle line:84%
we want it taken care of so we
can focus on leisure and play

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:03.610 align:middle line:84%
and whatever else we might
want to pay attention to.

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:06.610 align:middle line:10%
Well, let's take a look at what
a Tai Chi master, David Dorian

Ross says in his daily
Tai Chi practices

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:12.310 align:middle line:10%
about how to bring
the mind and the body

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:15.640 align:middle line:10%
together through an incremental
and very spiritual practice.

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:42.600 align:middle line:10%
able to calm the mind.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.690 align:middle line:10%
The art of Tai Chi teaches
you to focus the mind

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:48.720 align:middle line:10%
through visualization and
the precise coordination

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:53.670 align:middle line:10%
of the body, torso,
head, arms, and legs.

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:56.700 align:middle line:10%
But most importantly, the
daily practice of the solo

00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:00.930 align:middle line:10%
forms refresh,
replenish, and refine

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:04.140 align:middle line:10%
the circulation of
Chi, the great stream

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:05.340 align:middle line:10%
of the energy of life.

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:08.200 align:middle line:90%


00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>> I love what David
Dorian Ross says there.

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:14.800 align:middle line:84%
First, you have to focus the
mind, and then you can comment.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.850 align:middle line:84%
So there is a sequence to how we
unravel the mind from the knot

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:20.170 align:middle line:90%
that its tied in.

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:22.780 align:middle line:84%
If you were to unravel
those restrictions

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:25.240 align:middle line:84%
from the body and the
mind, we can truly

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:28.280 align:middle line:84%
see the expansion
of consciousness.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And the expansion
of consciousness

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:32.470 align:middle line:84%
is truly what we're
after on this path

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:35.680 align:middle line:84%
of discovering and unlocking
our hidden potential.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:39.280 align:middle line:84%
If we are able to break down
our old habits incrementally

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:44.320 align:middle line:84%
and build up incrementally
these new habits into a new us,

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.990 align:middle line:84%
by taking this
tortoise approach,

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:50.110 align:middle line:84%
we can actually see
that the brain drinks

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:53.920 align:middle line:84%
in all of the nuances of
the process of learning

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.450 align:middle line:90%
that we're on.

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And it prompts
neuroplasticity-- and as we've

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:00.610 align:middle line:84%
seen before on this
program, neuroplasticity

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:04.599 align:middle line:84%
is the ability for the brain to
change its neuronal structure,

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:09.079 align:middle line:84%
to break down old patterns,
and to build up new ones.

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:12.040 align:middle line:84%
This means that the tortoise
approach can literally

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:16.010 align:middle line:84%
change your brain
and change your life.

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:20.140 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm asking of you
is to be that tortoise.

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:21.819 align:middle line:90%
Take that approach.

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And take your life a bit slower
and a bit more incremental.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.650 align:middle line:90%

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:31.070 align:middle line:90%


00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:34.460 align:middle line:84%
So what I have for you today
is a one-week challenge.

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Every single day, we're going to
do something slightly different

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.595 align:middle line:90%
in an incremental process.

00:17:39.595 --> 00:17:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And if you're that
go getter that

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:43.910 align:middle line:84%
wants to go fast with
everything, remember,

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:45.540 align:middle line:90%
that is not the point here.

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.300 align:middle line:90%
The point is to take it slow.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:52.910 align:middle line:84%
So day 1, all you're going to
do is observe your stressors.

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:56.690 align:middle line:84%
Observe what moments
and situations crop up

00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:59.842 align:middle line:84%
that add to your stress
or cause your stress.

00:17:59.842 --> 00:18:01.550 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
do anything about it.

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:03.470 align:middle line:90%
You're just going to take note.

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:06.170 align:middle line:84%
You can either write it down
or keep it in your mind,

00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:09.680 align:middle line:84%
but just take note of
what stresses you out.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:14.300 align:middle line:84%
Day 2, consult with your
list all those things that

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:15.270 align:middle line:90%
stress you out.

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And now what I want you to do
is introduce an interrupter,

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:21.780 align:middle line:84%
and that interrupter is
simply one conscious breath.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.145 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:24.145 --> 00:18:26.990 align:middle line:90%


00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And all that's going to
do on a subconscious level

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:31.990 align:middle line:84%
is introduce a
little bit of a wedge

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:35.320 align:middle line:84%
between the moment that
the stress starts arising

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.120 align:middle line:84%
and the activity that
you have to engage

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.310 align:middle line:90%
in that might be stressful.

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:42.150 align:middle line:84%
Day 3, you're going
to do the same thing.

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:44.440 align:middle line:84%
Introduce that
interrupter, that breath,

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.360 align:middle line:90%
into those moments of stress.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.720 align:middle line:84%
But you're going to extend
it three to five breaths

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.810 align:middle line:90%
and add a smile.

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:56.140 align:middle line:84%
When you smile, this changes
the chemistry inside your body.

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:58.402 align:middle line:90%
Puts you into an altered state.

00:18:58.402 --> 00:19:00.360 align:middle line:84%
So this is all you're
going to do on day three.

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.902 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
notice those moments.

00:19:01.902 --> 00:19:04.690 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
introduce a wider gap.

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:07.630 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
breathe and smile.

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:10.420 align:middle line:90%
Day 4, same thing.

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:14.440 align:middle line:84%
Introduce that conscious
breath, introduce that smile,

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.510 align:middle line:84%
and now you're going
to add an intention.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And the intention is, I
will rise to the occasion.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.960 align:middle line:84%
I will meet this
challenge face to face.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.960 align:middle line:90%
I will overcome it.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:30.280 align:middle line:84%
But I only want you to
focus on this intention 25%.

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:33.010 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to be focusing
more on your interrupt,

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:36.970 align:middle line:84%
more on your breath and your
smile, and just about 25%

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:38.380 align:middle line:90%
on that challenge.

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:40.570 align:middle line:90%
I will rise to the occasion.

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:46.070 align:middle line:84%
Day 5, you're going to ramp up
that intention to about 50%.

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:49.180 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, you're going to spend
equal amount of time focusing

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:51.370 align:middle line:84%
on your intention as you
will with your breath

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:53.260 align:middle line:90%
and your smile.

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:57.910 align:middle line:84%
Day 6, what I want you to
do is add that interrupter,

00:19:57.910 --> 00:19:59.410 align:middle line:90%
but take it with you.

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:02.590 align:middle line:90%
Turn that intention up to 100%.

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:04.000 align:middle line:90%
Today's the day.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.090 align:middle line:84%
You are full bore
rising to the occasion.

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:09.280 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
spend so much time

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:12.550 align:middle line:84%
introducing a larger and
larger gap because you've

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:13.430 align:middle line:90%
done this before.

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:15.710 align:middle line:84%
It's already in your
subconscious mind.

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:18.850 align:middle line:84%
So what I want you to do is
take your breath and your smile

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:21.160 align:middle line:90%
with you into the activity.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:24.490 align:middle line:84%
This will teach you how to
integrate these interrupters

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:26.830 align:middle line:90%
into the moments of our stress.

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:31.900 align:middle line:84%
Day 7, turn the
throttle down to 25%.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, why wouldn't
we go up to 200%?

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.410 align:middle line:90%
500%?

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:37.420 align:middle line:84%
Because that's not
the point of this.

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:39.520 align:middle line:84%
It's already in our
subconscious mind.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:42.350 align:middle line:84%
We're not here to
overload our system.

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:45.700 align:middle line:84%
So on day 7, you're turning
that throttle, that intention,

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:48.760 align:middle line:84%
I will rise to the
occasion, back down to 25%.

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.010 align:middle line:84%
You're still breathing
for your interrupter.

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:54.140 align:middle line:84%
You're still smiling, and
you're bringing it with you,

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:57.370 align:middle line:84%
but you're not trying so
hard to rise to the occasion.

00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I'm
telling you to do this

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:02.030 align:middle line:84%
is not because I want
you to be less effective.

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:06.730 align:middle line:84%
I want you to be more effective,
but not have to try as hard.

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:09.700 align:middle line:84%
You can do this, and you'll
realize that the subconscious

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:13.120 align:middle line:84%
mind actually has these
skills already embedded

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:17.200 align:middle line:84%
within them because this is
the entire weekly practice.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:20.620 align:middle line:84%
On day 7, take that
interrupter with you

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:23.710 align:middle line:84%
and naturally just
rise to the occasion

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:25.180 align:middle line:90%
because you know you can.

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:27.690 align:middle line:90%


00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:30.710 align:middle line:10%
And if you follow this schedule
until the next time I see you,

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:33.160 align:middle line:10%
you will have discovered
your hidden stressors

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:36.340 align:middle line:10%
and applied tortoise
medicine to them.

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:39.790 align:middle line:84%
So go be incremental,
go be limitless,

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:41.290 align:middle line:84%
and I'll see you
next time around.

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:44.640 align:middle line:90%
