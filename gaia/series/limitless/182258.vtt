00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Today we're looking
at the placebo.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.314 align:middle line:84%
Can we use this power
for other purposes?

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.580 align:middle line:10%
So what exactly is
the placebo effect?

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.390 align:middle line:10%
If you look back into some
of the ancient writings,

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.020 align:middle line:10%
let's say the Bible, you'll
see this word placebo comes up

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.370 align:middle line:10%
in Latin.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.730 align:middle line:84%
In Psalms chapter
114, verse 9, it

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.530 align:middle line:84%
says "placebo Domino in
regione vivorum," which means,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.160 align:middle line:84%
"I shall please the Lord
in the land of the living."

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.340 align:middle line:84%
So placebo literally
means I shall please.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.770 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's the ancient world.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.680 align:middle line:84%
When did the modern
Western world get hip

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.870 align:middle line:90%
to the placebo response?

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.930 align:middle line:10%
It all started with an
English physician named

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.170 align:middle line:10%
William Cullen in the 1700s.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.410 align:middle line:10%
He gave fake, or sham,
pills to his patients

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.810 align:middle line:10%
when he had no
other pills to give.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.510 align:middle line:84%
But the peculiar
thing is he started

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.420 align:middle line:84%
to notice that
these pills worked

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.170 align:middle line:84%
because the people believed they
were getting actual medicine.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.580 align:middle line:84%
The placebo is driven by
our belief, by our ideas,

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.370 align:middle line:84%
meaning it is
malleable and we can

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.790 align:middle line:84%
change its meaning,
its effect in our body,

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.820 align:middle line:90%
simply with the mind.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.100 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a deeper look
at the placebo effect.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.230 align:middle line:10%
In an episode of
Inspirations with Lisa

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.020 align:middle line:10%
Garr called "Rewriting
the Genetic Code"

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.718 align:middle line:10%
with Dr. Mario Martinez.

00:01:45.718 --> 00:01:47.260 align:middle line:10%
>>DR. MARIO MARTINEZ:
For example, we

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.840 align:middle line:10%
know that they're
spontaneous healings.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.870 align:middle line:10%
A person believes
something and they actually

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.060 align:middle line:10%
are allowed to heal themselves.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.070 align:middle line:10%
I'll give an example.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.730 align:middle line:10%
There was a reported in
one of psychiatric journals

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.100 align:middle line:10%
in a Catholic
hospital, the priest

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.093 align:middle line:10%
came into the room
for this patient

00:02:05.093 --> 00:02:06.260 align:middle line:10%
to give them the last rites.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.070 align:middle line:10%
He gave him the last rites
and he died in 15 minutes.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.340 align:middle line:10%
The problem is that he
went to the wrong room.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.570 align:middle line:10%
So what happened is that,
in this person's mind,

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.840 align:middle line:10%
two authorities in a context,
a doctor and a priest,

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.120 align:middle line:10%
are telling me that I'm not
going to be around anymore.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.170 align:middle line:84%
They have that nocebo effect
and when you do an autopsy,

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.030 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing wrong
except some kind

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.270 align:middle line:84%
of parasympathetic
stopping of the heart.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.570 align:middle line:84%
But now the person who
was scheduled to die

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.950 align:middle line:84%
waited two days for the
priest to come before he died.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.710 align:middle line:84%
So the mind can
wound and can heal,

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.790 align:middle line:84%
based on the belief
systems that we have.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:44.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Wow.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.110 align:middle line:84%
So you can really
change, I mean,

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.840 align:middle line:84%
the power of changing
your belief system.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.180 align:middle line:10%
And you said to me look
for the signals of health.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.980 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GARR: Not for the
signals of sickness.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:56.733 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Exactly.

00:02:56.733 --> 00:03:02.170 align:middle line:90%


00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.380 align:middle line:84%
>> In the 1960s, researchers
were actually trying

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.190 align:middle line:84%
to differentiate that
terminology from the placebo

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.090 align:middle line:84%
effect into the placebo response
because effect seems like

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.030 align:middle line:84%
there's just this objective
thing that happens once you

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.400 align:middle line:84%
take a pill, but a response is
something that we engage with,

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.810 align:middle line:84%
meaning we are responding to
what we believe we are taking

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:26.980 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.690 align:middle line:84%
So there's a very
unique difference.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.030 align:middle line:84%
It's not about the
object of world.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.550 align:middle line:84%
It's about the subject
of beliefs of those

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.280 align:middle line:90%
who are taking the pill.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.040 align:middle line:84%
I found this article with
the title, "Why don't we

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.280 align:middle line:84%
Exploit the Hell out
of the Placebo effect?"

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And there's this awesome
little part in there

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.650 align:middle line:84%
where they say it's
counterintuitive, mindbending,

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.850 align:middle line:84%
and rather uncomfortable fact
that placebo pills produce

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.210 align:middle line:84%
about 60% to 80% of
the benefit of the best

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:00.580 align:middle line:84%
medications for diseases
with subjective symptoms."

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:06.780 align:middle line:84%
60% to 80% as effective as the
pharmaceuticals on the market.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.340 align:middle line:90%
That's the power of our belief.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.010 align:middle line:84%
So what if we could
turn this into a skill?

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.700 align:middle line:84%
What if we were able to take
this malleable, mind-driven

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.390 align:middle line:84%
placebo response and turn
it into the direction

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.130 align:middle line:90%
that we choose?

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.840 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.242 align:middle line:84%
Is that a skill
that we can develop?

00:04:27.242 --> 00:04:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's take a
look back at the body.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.010 align:middle line:84%
We've said in this series
before that the body is not

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.730 align:middle line:84%
as old as you are, it's
as old as creation.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.680 align:middle line:84%
It goes back, our
genetics, go back

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.810 align:middle line:84%
to the beginning
of our family line.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.530 align:middle line:84%
All that information that it
had there to begin with probably

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.830 align:middle line:84%
came from, let's say, all
the way back to the Big Bang.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.080 align:middle line:84%
So what this is saying to me
is we become what we focus on.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.640 align:middle line:84%
If we were to actually able
to use this skill, to heal

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.130 align:middle line:84%
from a disease by
changing the chemistry,

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.910 align:middle line:84%
stopping all of those
initiators, those things that

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.790 align:middle line:84%
prompt illness
inside the body, then

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.810 align:middle line:84%
from the outside perspective,
it would seem that all we did

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.172 align:middle line:90%
was miraculously heal ourselves.

00:05:13.172 --> 00:05:15.630 align:middle line:10%
There are many people out there
that don't believe anything

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.290 align:middle line:10%
beyond what the science
is already showing us

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.080 align:middle line:10%
and because of this-- this
is a very good quality--

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.440 align:middle line:10%
but when it's taken too
far, or out of balance,

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.620 align:middle line:10%
then anything that we can't
explain is simply magic.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:29.880 align:middle line:90%
It's left for Hollywood.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Don't believe in
it, it's not real.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.590 align:middle line:90%
Stick with the science.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, this seems like it
saying just the opposite.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.350 align:middle line:10%
What we believe, even if it
hasn't been proven by science

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.020 align:middle line:10%
yet, might still be
possible because we

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.240 align:middle line:10%
can restructure our
brain and change

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.180 align:middle line:10%
the chemistry of our
body and heal ourselves

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:53.400 align:middle line:10%
from the inside out, without
outer or any kind of medicine,

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.680 align:middle line:10%
simply with the mind.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.190 align:middle line:84%
So let's take that
word magic because it's

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.280 align:middle line:84%
thrown around a lot, mainly
in Hollywood, and also

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.880 align:middle line:84%
magic tricks, illusions,
tricking people with sleight

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.130 align:middle line:84%
of hand, getting you
to look over here

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.260 align:middle line:84%
while the real thing
is happening over here.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.200 align:middle line:90%
It's just a trick.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.000 align:middle line:90%
It's not real.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.080 align:middle line:90%


00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.660 align:middle line:84%
But ancient forms
of magic, and even

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.410 align:middle line:84%
practical forms of modern
magic, are really nothing more

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.600 align:middle line:90%
than a higher science.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.190 align:middle line:84%
What would magic truly be
other than finding a clever way

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:33.090 align:middle line:84%
to use the natural forces
that are all around us

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.580 align:middle line:84%
to effect the response
that we would like.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's take a
look at what Arthur C.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.330 align:middle line:90%
Clarke has to say about magic.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.960 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Any sufficiently
advanced technology is

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.230 align:middle line:90%
indistinguishable from magic."

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.340 align:middle line:90%
What if this is true?

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.950 align:middle line:84%
What if our wildest
imaginations are within reach?

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.590 align:middle line:84%
What if things that we
thought were completely left

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.850 align:middle line:84%
for Hollywood movies are
well within our reach, simply

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.690 align:middle line:84%
because, once we understand
that they are natural forces,

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.510 align:middle line:84%
there is a science
behind them, a science

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:09.540 align:middle line:84%
that albeit maybe modern
researchers have not

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.780 align:middle line:84%
figured out yet but a science
all the same, it's real,

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.220 align:middle line:90%
it's tangible.

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:19.800 align:middle line:84%
So what if all that we call
magic, what if it is possible?

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.620 align:middle line:84%
Can we use the artist
mind, our creativity,

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.340 align:middle line:84%
our ability to
take abstract ideas

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.000 align:middle line:84%
and bring them down here into
this three dimensional world,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.680 align:middle line:90%
anchor them into real life?

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:37.440 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at how Barbara
Marx Hubbard met her husband.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.740 align:middle line:10%
She tells the story beautifully
on an episode of Inspirations

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.968 align:middle line:10%
with Lisa Garr called
"Co-Creating Change."

00:07:43.968 --> 00:07:46.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BARBARA MARX HUBBARD: I
went to Paris my junior year.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.860 align:middle line:84%
I met my husband in a
little cafe on the left bank

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:51.880 align:middle line:90%
and I asked him my question.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.700 align:middle line:84%
What's the meaning
of our new power?

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.450 align:middle line:10%
What do you think it is?

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:57.840 align:middle line:10%
And he said I'm
an artist and I'm

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.750 align:middle line:10%
seeking a new
story, a new image,

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:02.670 align:middle line:10%
commensurate with our power.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:05.420 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, I'm
going to marry you.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:06.220 align:middle line:10%
And I did.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.262 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA GARR: And you did.

00:08:07.262 --> 00:08:09.510 align:middle line:10%
>>HUBBARD: I got
married on the quest

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:12.750 align:middle line:10%
for what is the story,
what is the direction,

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.640 align:middle line:10%
and how are we going to find it?

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:18.240 align:middle line:10%
And I realized, in a way, it's
an art form because it's not

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.440 align:middle line:10%
written down somewhere.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.670 align:middle line:10%
We have to seek it out.

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:25.150 align:middle line:90%


00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>> So thank you, Barbara, very
beautiful words and also very

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:34.340 align:middle line:84%
telling that when we set out
to solve some kind of riddle,

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.940 align:middle line:84%
when we set out with an idea
in mind and we wish to bring

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:43.700 align:middle line:84%
something abstract into clear
visibility, into this world,

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.640 align:middle line:84%
we are figuring
ourselves out bit by bit,

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.940 align:middle line:84%
discovering what
we are capable of.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.680 align:middle line:84%
What we should truly
be asking ourselves

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:57.470 align:middle line:84%
is what else can we put this
placebo response in service to?

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:58.850 align:middle line:90%
How else can we use it?

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:03.730 align:middle line:84%
Can we merge the artist's mind
with the placebo response?

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:05.470 align:middle line:90%
I believe we can.

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Take a listen to
Corinne Garstin.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.550 align:middle line:84%
She says, "I think
everything in life

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:13.030 align:middle line:84%
is art, what you do,
how you dress, the way

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:16.300 align:middle line:84%
you love someone, your
smile and your personality,

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.910 align:middle line:84%
what you believe in and
all your dreams, the way

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.760 align:middle line:84%
you drink your tea, how
you decorate your home

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:25.960 align:middle line:84%
or party, your grocery list,
the food you make, and the way

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.070 align:middle line:90%
you feel."

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And she ends by saying,
"Life itself is art."

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:35.890 align:middle line:84%
Remember that there are a
myriad amount of choices

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:38.560 align:middle line:84%
that we can set off on,
paths that we can go down

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.640 align:middle line:90%
in our lives.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.810 align:middle line:84%
But if we realize that we
are that decision maker,

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:46.360 align:middle line:84%
we decide what
direction we go in.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.210 align:middle line:84%
We decide whether we
just rest on our laurels,

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:52.150 align:middle line:84%
sit around, and not
work on our potential

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:57.190 align:middle line:84%
or if we set off down that
mysterious road of unlocking

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:59.420 align:middle line:90%
our hidden potential.

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:00.890 align:middle line:90%
We have this power.

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:03.710 align:middle line:84%
I believe that humanity
is really nothing more

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:06.080 align:middle line:90%
than immature magicians.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.970 align:middle line:84%
That's not an insult.
What that's saying

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:12.180 align:middle line:84%
is we have so much power and
we have yet to tap into it.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.740 align:middle line:84%
That's why I implore you
to set off down this path

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:19.520 align:middle line:84%
with the right tools,
remembering this whole thing

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.470 align:middle line:84%
about community and
society and what

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:25.080 align:middle line:84%
we can do with our power
is not just about us.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.550 align:middle line:84%
It's about serving
the greater world.

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:30.220 align:middle line:84%
Here's a quote from
Michael Josephson

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:34.270 align:middle line:84%
saying, "Your life is your
ship and you are the captain.

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Choose your course,
take the wheel firmly,

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.040 align:middle line:90%
and get on your way."

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.872 align:middle line:84%
Yes there are some
unforeseen circumstances.

00:10:41.872 --> 00:10:43.330 align:middle line:84%
There are always
going to be things

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.420 align:middle line:84%
that you could not
conceive of as you're

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:50.030 align:middle line:84%
walking this path of life
towards our human potential,

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:52.060 align:middle line:90%
but this should not deter us.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.760 align:middle line:84%
We should still take
the wheel firmly

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.220 align:middle line:84%
and get on our way
to discovering who

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.440 align:middle line:90%
and what we truly are.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And if we do this,
we will realize

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:03.880 align:middle line:90%
that it's not just about us.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.590 align:middle line:84%
There are others on
this road with us.

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:08.830 align:middle line:90%
There's a whole community.

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:10.960 align:middle line:90%
Who are these others?

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Captain D. Michael
Abrashoff said, "Be there

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.400 align:middle line:90%
for your people.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Find out who they are, recognize
the effects you have on them,

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:24.460 align:middle line:84%
and how you can make
them grow taller."

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.640 align:middle line:84%
Now let's take a look
at the placebo response

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.730 align:middle line:84%
on a national or global
level by watching

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:34.690 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of this film, "Art
Meets Science and Spirituality

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:38.140 align:middle line:90%
in a Changing Economy."

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:40.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, you see, I think
the difficulty is this

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:42.920 align:middle line:10%
fragmentation, first of all.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.920 align:middle line:10%
All thought is
broken up into bits,

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.830 align:middle line:10%
like this nation, this country,
this industry, this profession,

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:51.490 align:middle line:10%
and so on as they can't
meet and it's extremely hard

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:53.210 align:middle line:10%
to break into that.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:56.920 align:middle line:10%
Now, there's the second one
but that comes about primarily

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.650 align:middle line:10%
because thought has developed,
traditionally, in a way such

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:01.810 align:middle line:10%
that it claims not to
be affecting anything

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:04.130 align:middle line:10%
but just telling you
the way things are.

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:06.610 align:middle line:10%
Therefore, people cannot
see that they are creating

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:09.260 align:middle line:10%
a problem and then apparently
trying to solve it.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:14.250 align:middle line:10%
So let's take the problem
like pollution or the ecology.

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:16.090 align:middle line:10%
The ecology is not
in itself a problem.

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:17.560 align:middle line:10%
It works perfectly
well by itself.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.660 align:middle line:10%
It's due to us, right?

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:22.210 align:middle line:10%
That's a problem because we
are thinking in certain way

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:24.670 align:middle line:10%
by breaking everything
up and each person's

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:26.480 align:middle line:10%
doing his own thing.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.180 align:middle line:10%
Now, therefore, the ecological
problem is due to thought,

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:29.980 align:middle line:10%
right?

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.597 align:middle line:10%
But thought thinks it
is a problem out there

00:12:32.597 --> 00:12:33.430 align:middle line:10%
and I must solve it.

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:36.190 align:middle line:10%
Now that doesn't make sense
because simultaneously thought

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:38.350 align:middle line:10%
is doing all the activities
which make the problem

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.267 align:middle line:10%
and then does another
set of activities to try

00:12:40.267 --> 00:12:41.690 align:middle line:10%
to overcome it.

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:43.540 align:middle line:10%
You see, it doesn't
stop doing the things

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.960 align:middle line:10%
which are making the ecological
problem or the national problem

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.620 align:middle line:10%
or whatever the problem is.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.705 align:middle line:10%
>> Buddhists believe the
oneself as the creator.

00:12:52.705 --> 00:12:55.580 align:middle line:10%


00:12:55.580 --> 00:13:02.870 align:middle line:10%
So the future, be good or bad,
entirely depend on present,

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:04.760 align:middle line:10%
or how you say, shoulder.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:11.800 align:middle line:10%
It entirely does depend on
our own present behavior

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.570 align:middle line:10%
or present action.

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:18.140 align:middle line:10%
So you see, in order to
change the external thing,

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:22.810 align:middle line:10%
first must change
within ourself.

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:29.260 align:middle line:10%
If we want something like this,
if you want a beautiful garden,

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:36.250 align:middle line:10%
first in human mind it say
make some kind of blueprint

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:40.030 align:middle line:10%
or the imagination or vision.

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:44.560 align:middle line:10%
And then, according to that
idea, then you see implement.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:49.600 align:middle line:10%
Then the external
things will materialize.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.100 align:middle line:90%


00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:57.180 align:middle line:84%
>> The Dalai Lama saying
visualize first and then it

00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:01.740 align:middle line:84%
will materialize, almost as if
it's saying that all of reality

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:06.660 align:middle line:84%
comes forth from our mind,
not the other way around.

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.200 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.690 align:middle line:84%
Now let's take a look at
the fact that a lot of us

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:12.870 align:middle line:90%
are quite different.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:16.570 align:middle line:84%
We lead different lives, we
come from different backgrounds.

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:19.490 align:middle line:84%
We're, in a sense,
handed different hands

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:21.850 align:middle line:90%
in the poker game of life.

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes these
hands are great,

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:26.620 align:middle line:84%
sometimes the hand
is not so great,

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:30.040 align:middle line:84%
but I implore you to take a look
at it like Randy Pausch says.

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:33.280 align:middle line:84%
He says, "We cannot change
the cards that we are dealt,

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.890 align:middle line:90%
just how we play that hand."

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:37.420 align:middle line:90%
And this is true.

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:41.740 align:middle line:84%
There's many ways we can use
the gifts that we are given,

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:44.230 align:middle line:84%
instead of saying
woe is me, I haven't

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:46.240 align:middle line:84%
been given enough
of an opportunity

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.520 align:middle line:90%
to arrive at my full potential.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.730 align:middle line:10%
It's very easy to get wrapped
into this, this looking

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:54.940 align:middle line:10%
at the bad side
of life but if it

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:57.670 align:middle line:10%
seems too difficult to
see the good side of life,

00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:01.090 align:middle line:10%
I'll just leave you with a
quote that Jimmy Buffett says.

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.970 align:middle line:84%
"It takes no more time to
see the good side of life

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:06.350 align:middle line:90%
than it takes to see the bad."

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:08.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's truly all
about what we choose

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.030 align:middle line:90%
to do with our attention.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:12.650 align:middle line:90%
It's our choice.

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:15.960 align:middle line:90%
It really is all in our hands.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:19.190 align:middle line:84%
So here's what I implore
you to look deeper into.

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:22.220 align:middle line:84%
If you ever heard of the
Bodhisattva or the Path

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.570 align:middle line:84%
of the Bodhisattva,
the Bodhisattva

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:29.030 align:middle line:84%
was the one that could have just
rested in eternity in Nirvana,

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:32.660 align:middle line:84%
complete bliss, having found
all the answers, away from all

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:34.910 align:middle line:90%
the suffering of the world.

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:37.830 align:middle line:84%
But the Bodhisattva
is not in Nirvana.

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:41.810 align:middle line:84%
The Bodhisattva is the one that
arrives at that beautiful gift

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:47.360 align:middle line:84%
of peace and inner equanimity
but enters back into the fray,

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:51.410 align:middle line:84%
back into the suffering,
simply to help those who are

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:56.310 align:middle line:84%
suffering, those who cannot see
into the future and are afraid

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:58.700 align:middle line:90%
about what it might bring them.

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.390 align:middle line:90%
Be the Bodhisattva.

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:03.300 align:middle line:84%
Be there, of service,
for other people.

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:07.260 align:middle line:90%


00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:11.130 align:middle line:10%
Now let's take one more look
at these ancient traditions

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:13.120 align:middle line:10%
on an episode of
With Regina Meredith,

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:18.420 align:middle line:10%
and this episode is called "Alex
Gay on the Art of Humanity."

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:21.870 align:middle line:10%
>> If we want to stay around
for another thousand years

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:29.580 align:middle line:10%
and excel as a species, I think
that we're at that troubled

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:34.440 align:middle line:10%
time of adolescence, not
quite in our 20s yet,

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:40.530 align:middle line:10%
as a species where consumption
and addiction to oil

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:48.380 align:middle line:10%
and a variety of other things
is, there's no moral center,

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:51.520 align:middle line:10%
it doesn't seem to, our actions,
to the way that we treat

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.320 align:middle line:10%
nature.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:56.350 align:middle line:10%
We don't see our
connectedness with everyone

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:57.540 align:middle line:10%
and with everything.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:00.900 align:middle line:10%
We're sitting here
with our broadband

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:04.500 align:middle line:10%
and the technological
advances that

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:08.940 align:middle line:10%
are astonishing and
truly important to making

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:15.000 align:middle line:10%
the global consciousness dawn.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.010 align:middle line:10%
We have to find ways of
flying under the radar of sort

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:24.540 align:middle line:10%
of corporate media that
have their own agenda

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:29.880 align:middle line:10%
and look toward the agenda
of what would bring the most

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:33.420 align:middle line:10%
benefit to the most people
and the most beings on Earth.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:37.410 align:middle line:10%
And as I was saying,
that naturally

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:42.540 align:middle line:10%
starts to dawn in people
when they look inside

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:45.660 align:middle line:10%
and find a source of
wisdom and compassion

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:51.000 align:middle line:10%
that's been the
sort of mystic core

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.560 align:middle line:10%
that is seen through the
various wisdom traditions.

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Art can change the world.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.630 align:middle line:90%
It can change millions of minds.

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.720 align:middle line:10%
Truthfully, going back to
one of the biggest catalysts

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.950 align:middle line:10%
in my life, that set me off into
the direction that I'm on now

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:11.130 align:middle line:10%
is the conspiracy
documentary film generation,

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:14.990 align:middle line:10%
starting around 2006, 2007.

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:19.550 align:middle line:10%
Films like Zeitgeist,
Loose Change, Thrive.

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:23.690 align:middle line:10%
These films reached millions
upon millions of people

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:26.690 align:middle line:10%
and they changed
millions of minds.

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:28.790 align:middle line:90%
It woke me up, it truly did.

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:31.250 align:middle line:84%
It showed me that there
is so much about the world

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:33.260 align:middle line:90%
that I just was not aware of.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.530 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I woke up to that
alarm clock of these conspiracy

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:39.380 align:middle line:84%
documentaries, I needed
to move into something

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:42.170 align:middle line:84%
like human potential
because, truly,

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:44.210 align:middle line:84%
what is the best
solution we can bring

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:48.290 align:middle line:84%
to a world that seems quite
grim and quite dangerous

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:52.010 align:middle line:84%
other than the best kinds
of us that we can bring

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:54.560 align:middle line:84%
to the moment, the
best kinds of solutions

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:55.760 align:middle line:90%
we could come up with?

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And how would we be able
to do that if we were not

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:00.200 align:middle line:90%
in our full potential?

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.890 align:middle line:84%
But I will say this in thanks
to all the conspiracy theorists

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:05.670 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:07.980 align:middle line:84%
They're not afraid to
express their minds.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.800 align:middle line:84%
They're not afraid
to express things

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.020 align:middle line:84%
that will get them
ridiculed because they

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:17.170 align:middle line:84%
believe we need to hear it
and that we need to wake up.

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:21.290 align:middle line:84%
Also, if even just a fraction
of what they're saying

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:23.720 align:middle line:84%
has any truth to
it, you might want

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.850 align:middle line:84%
to know about it because
it would transform

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:27.860 align:middle line:90%
the way you look at the world.

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:30.170 align:middle line:84%
Our life, the way
we express ourselves

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:34.610 align:middle line:84%
to ourselves and the world
around us, is our masterpiece

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:36.690 align:middle line:90%
but you have to put in the time.

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:39.260 align:middle line:84%
You have to learn about the
world that you're involved in.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:42.680 align:middle line:84%
You have to really care
about the evolution of what's

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.610 align:middle line:90%
happening on this planet.

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And if you think it's too hard,
if you think you're not there

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:50.540 align:middle line:84%
yet, just listen to what
the social psychologist Amy

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:51.950 align:middle line:90%
Cuddy said.

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:54.320 align:middle line:90%
"Don't fake it till you make it.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.480 align:middle line:90%
Fake it till you become it."

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Like Mahatma Gandhi
said, "Be the change

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:00.950 align:middle line:90%
you wish to see in the world.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:03.410 align:middle line:84%
Don't just write about
it, scream about it, yell

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:05.720 align:middle line:90%
into a megaphone to the masses.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:07.820 align:middle line:90%
Become that change.

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:09.740 align:middle line:84%
Be what you wish to
see in the world."

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:15.330 align:middle line:90%


00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:17.870 align:middle line:90%
So here's my challenge for you.

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:21.290 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to choose
one meal and this meal

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:24.890 align:middle line:84%
is going to be your
magic ritual meal.

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:27.950 align:middle line:84%
Try and make it one
that is not bothered

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:31.010 align:middle line:84%
by a bunch of other people or a
bunch of other things going on.

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:35.210 align:middle line:84%
Find a quiet space, take this
one meal, sit down with it,

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:37.197 align:middle line:90%
arrange the plate beautifully.

00:20:37.197 --> 00:20:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
you want to do this

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:41.610 align:middle line:84%
is because we also
eat with our eyes.

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:44.580 align:middle line:84%
We find beauty in the way
our plates can be arranged.

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:48.650 align:middle line:84%
But it also turns this
plate into a magic sigil,

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:51.800 align:middle line:84%
a symbol that represents
the very thing that we

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.040 align:middle line:90%
are working on.

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.730 align:middle line:84%
So in this meal,
before you take a bite,

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:59.750 align:middle line:84%
just sit and appreciate this
sigil, the beautiful look

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:03.200 align:middle line:84%
of the plate, the way you've
arranged all the food,

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:07.310 align:middle line:84%
how tasty it's going
to be, and then dig in.

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:10.490 align:middle line:84%
Appreciate every
bite, every taste.

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:14.480 align:middle line:84%
Take your time, put the fork
down while you're chewing.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.010 align:middle line:90%
Take your time with it.

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And the entire time,
all you have to do

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.400 align:middle line:90%
is bring in your intention.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Your intention
could be anything.

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:25.890 align:middle line:84%
If you're sick and you want to
heal, bring that intention in.

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:28.790 align:middle line:84%
If you believe the world
needs some real inner healing

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:31.340 align:middle line:84%
and you want to bring that to
them but you don't know how,

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.650 align:middle line:90%
bring that intention in.

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Remember that all the
answers exist within you.

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:41.470 align:middle line:84%
It just takes the artist
mind to bring it out.

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:44.830 align:middle line:84%
So I implore you to bring
this gift, this beautiful gift

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:48.340 align:middle line:84%
that you're engaging in
this week, into the world

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:53.838 align:middle line:84%
and orchestrate some kind
of goodness on this planet.

00:21:53.838 --> 00:21:55.380 align:middle line:84%
Thank you guys so
much for joining me

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.270 align:middle line:90%
on this episode of "Limitless."

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:59.520 align:middle line:90%
I'll see you next time around.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.870 align:middle line:90%
