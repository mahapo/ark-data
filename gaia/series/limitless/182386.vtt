00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.810 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm going to start you off
with a quote from Lao Tzu.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.500 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Those who
flow as life flows know

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.888 align:middle line:90%
they need no other force."

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:32.119 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.620 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.580 align:middle line:10%
Today we're talking about
the flow state and shamanism.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.650 align:middle line:10%
So my favorite book on flow
is called "Stealing Fire."

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.480 align:middle line:10%
And the authors Jamie
Wheal and Steven Kotler

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.580 align:middle line:10%
founded what is called
the Flow Genome Project.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.350 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the
Flow Genome Project

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.980 align:middle line:84%
is looking deeper into
flow and studying it more

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.860 align:middle line:90%
than anybody else ever has.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.460 align:middle line:84%
Flow state, this zone,
is very well-documented.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.340 align:middle line:10%
You'll have athletes like Bill
Russell and Michael Jordan

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.370 align:middle line:10%
consistently talking about
experiencing this zone

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.430 align:middle line:10%
during high intensity games.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.150 align:middle line:84%
Even musicians, rock
bands, and orchestras

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.780 align:middle line:84%
all mention that there seems
to be this higher organizing

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.660 align:middle line:84%
force that everybody
else simply surrenders

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.570 align:middle line:84%
to when the music
becomes that one

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.270 align:middle line:84%
thing that all the
rest of the musicians

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.850 align:middle line:90%
are simply the conduit for.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.680 align:middle line:84%
The music is coming
through them.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.790 align:middle line:84%
But it's not just for
athletes and musicians.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.880 align:middle line:84%
It's actually even
good in the workplace.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.060 align:middle line:10%
There was a 10-year study from
the "McKinsey" magazine that

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.710 align:middle line:10%
said top-level executives become
five times more productive

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.390 align:middle line:10%
when in the state of flow.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.810 align:middle line:10%
It also crops up in
spiritual states.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.570 align:middle line:84%
There is this feeling of oneness
in the spiritual traditions

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.490 align:middle line:84%
and this ability to be
able to access information.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And the actions that need to
happen from that point forward

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.390 align:middle line:90%
are effortless.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.350 align:middle line:84%
So now let's go to the guy
who coined the term flow

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.640 align:middle line:90%
and flow state.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.960 align:middle line:10%
His name is Mihaly
Csikszentmihalyi.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.280 align:middle line:10%
And he was studying flow
for quite some time.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.210 align:middle line:10%
And he said in regards
to extreme situations,

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.180 align:middle line:10%
"You know what you need
to do is possible to do

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.890 align:middle line:10%
even though difficult. And
the sense of time disappears.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.720 align:middle line:10%
You forget yourself.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.770 align:middle line:10%
And you feel part of
something larger."

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.710 align:middle line:84%
This truly does sound spiritual,
this losing of one's self,

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.450 align:middle line:84%
a disintegrating and merging
with the entire universe where

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.600 align:middle line:84%
you are no longer
this little person,

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.480 align:middle line:84%
but you are the entire
universe and the mind at large.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.410 align:middle line:90%


00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.500 align:middle line:84%
So if you think that
the state isn't for you,

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.720 align:middle line:84%
it's only for
top-level athletes,

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.670 align:middle line:84%
only for musicians
who have trained

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.950 align:middle line:84%
their entire lives
or Navy SEALs,

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.190 align:middle line:84%
people who have put their
entire lives into accessing

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.540 align:middle line:90%
this state.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, remember what Johann
Wolfgang von Goethe said.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.337 align:middle line:84%
"Everything is hard
before it is easy."

00:03:08.337 --> 00:03:10.420 align:middle line:84%
But this doesn't mean that
we don't have obstacles

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.380 align:middle line:90%
to the flow state.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.210 align:middle line:84%
All of us are very overwhelmed,
overworked, and exhausted.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.420 align:middle line:84%
We are what Steven Kotler, one
of the authors of "Stealing

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.130 align:middle line:84%
Fire," calls 21st
century normal.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And when he describes what
21st century normal is,

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.590 align:middle line:84%
he goes into what you can see
in the body physiologically.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.900 align:middle line:84%
So he says that hyperactivity
in the prefrontal cortex

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.760 align:middle line:90%
comes online.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.020 align:middle line:84%
This is the higher cognitive
function of the brain,

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.730 align:middle line:84%
our sense of morality,
and our sense of our will.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.950 align:middle line:84%
Our brainwaves go
into the beta state.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And then we have a steady
drip, drip of a stress hormone

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.360 align:middle line:84%
called cortisol and another
one, norepinephrine.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.180 align:middle line:84%
But he goes on to say
that in the flow state,

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.570 align:middle line:84%
the hyperactivity in
the prefrontal cortex,

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.470 align:middle line:84%
that more human aspect
of our brain, goes quiet.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, so does
the inner critic within.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And then all of those
stressful hormones flush out.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And then we are flooded
with performance-enhancing

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.649 align:middle line:84%
and also feel good hormones
like oxytocin, anandamide,

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:22.100 align:middle line:90%
serotonin, and dopamine.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.640 align:middle line:84%
So the quieting of
this inner critic

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.470 align:middle line:90%
is well-documented as well.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.080 align:middle line:84%
Michael Jordan is
one of those who

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.520 align:middle line:90%
has talked about this state.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Michael Jordan also
is known as saying,

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.520 align:middle line:84%
"Heart is what separates
the good from the great."

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.220 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a
deeper look at heart.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at an episode
of "On the Road with Lilou"

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.210 align:middle line:84%
where she interviews Howard
Martin in an episode called

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.370 align:middle line:90%
At the Heart of it All.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.640 align:middle line:10%
>> So in the coherent state,
you have this highly-ordered

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.240 align:middle line:10%
physiological and emotional
condition in yourself.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.600 align:middle line:10%
So everything from reaction
speed time to visual field,

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.630 align:middle line:10%
all your sensitivities
are there.

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.380 align:middle line:10%
You're more sensitive
to your environment.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.000 align:middle line:10%
You're more sensitive
to yourself.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.950 align:middle line:84%
You're more sensitive
to what's going on.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.780 align:middle line:84%
You have a greater
ability to choose.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.630 align:middle line:10%
You have a greater ability
to regulate your emotions.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.793 align:middle line:10%
Athletes equate that to
what happens in the zone.

00:05:13.793 --> 00:05:16.210 align:middle line:10%
So the measurement of coherence
is the closest measurement

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.910 align:middle line:10%
that we know of to
measuring the zone.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.860 align:middle line:10%
So we've worked with
professional golfers,

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.440 align:middle line:10%
professional football
players, Olympic athletes

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.700 align:middle line:10%
of various kinds, gymnasts,
skiers, swimmers, all kinds.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.970 align:middle line:10%
And they use our technology
and our simple techniques

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.960 align:middle line:10%
to find a way to develop more
of that coherence in themselves

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.320 align:middle line:10%
naturally so that when they're
in athletic performance,

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.300 align:middle line:10%
it becomes second nature
to them because they

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.925 align:middle line:10%
can't think about
all that when they're

00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:43.960 align:middle line:10%
in the middle of
a football game.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.530 align:middle line:90%


00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:47.570 align:middle line:90%
>> So that's great.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.760 align:middle line:84%
There's two aspects
of what you just

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.020 align:middle line:84%
heard that I would
like to point back out.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:58.420 align:middle line:84%
One is that coherence sounds
an awful lot like flow.

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And number two is
that in this state,

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.060 align:middle line:84%
information is organized
and ordered differently.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.780 align:middle line:84%
So that is a hallmark of an
altered state of consciousness.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, what if we could access
coherence or flow on demand?

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.400 align:middle line:84%
What if we could just
call it up in the most

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.170 align:middle line:84%
unlikely or difficult
circumstances?

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:23.040 align:middle line:84%
So in gaming terms, this
would be called leveling up.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.070 align:middle line:90%
So how do we access flow?

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we go back to
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi,

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.100 align:middle line:84%
he not only studied flow
more than anybody else,

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.350 align:middle line:90%
he coined that term flow.

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:34.970 align:middle line:84%
But he also
identified that there

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.960 align:middle line:84%
are three triggers to flow
that we can use in our lives

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.850 align:middle line:90%
right now immediately.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And these three triggers
are having clear goals,

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.540 align:middle line:84%
immediate feedback
from the challenge,

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.710 align:middle line:84%
and also the proper
skill to challenge ratio.

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.290 align:middle line:84%
Now clear goals are
knowing what I'm doing now

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:57.650 align:middle line:84%
and what I'm going to do next
so the mind does not wander.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Immediate feedback is important
so we can change directions

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.620 align:middle line:90%
if need be in the moment.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.080 align:middle line:84%
Skill to challenge
ratio is very specific.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.460 align:middle line:84%
It's actually if here
is your skill level,

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:15.440 align:middle line:84%
then 4% above your skill
level is the optimal range

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.640 align:middle line:90%
to trigger flow.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.060 align:middle line:84%
So you want the challenge to
be just outside of your skill

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.160 align:middle line:84%
level, meaning this is
something that you have

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.720 align:middle line:90%
to rise to the occasion for.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.310 align:middle line:84%
You need to reach to
arrive at this skill

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.850 align:middle line:90%
to meet that challenge.

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And then if these three
are done correctly,

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:38.830 align:middle line:84%
it will prompt that state of
flow or coherence on demand.

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:42.530 align:middle line:84%
But what is it that gets in
the way of us even setting out

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:45.290 align:middle line:90%
on that path of training?

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.080 align:middle line:84%
Even in the tasks that we
would love to train for,

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.140 align:middle line:84%
what keeps us from being
able to just set out

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:55.400 align:middle line:84%
on the path of discovering and
unlocking our human potential?

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, could it be the
fear of the unknown?

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:02.060 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at a
film called "Beyond Fear"

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:05.580 align:middle line:90%
by Louie Schwartzberg.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:09.340 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.703 align:middle line:10%
>> I love to climb
mountains, ice climb.

00:08:12.703 --> 00:08:14.870 align:middle line:10%
And that's pretty wild, I
guess, for a blind person.

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:16.680 align:middle line:10%
I mean, being a blind
mountain climber

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.040 align:middle line:10%
is sort of like being
a Jamaican bobsledder.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.810 align:middle line:84%
The words don't
necessarily go together.

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:24.610 align:middle line:90%


00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:26.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm scanning my
tools up the ice.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.750 align:middle line:10%
And I'm trying to use
the end of my tools

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:29.997 align:middle line:10%
as though they are
extensions of my hands

00:08:29.997 --> 00:08:31.830 align:middle line:10%
where I'm actually
feeling through the metal

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:33.400 align:middle line:10%
picks of my tools.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And when I find something
I think is a good hit,

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.230 align:middle line:90%
I'll just tap it.

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:37.260 align:middle line:90%
And I'll listen to the sound.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And if it's a good
sound, then I'll swing.

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:41.610 align:middle line:90%


00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:48.080 align:middle line:10%
I think sometimes that fear of
reaching out into the unknown

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.000 align:middle line:10%
paralyzes people to the
point where they just

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.400 align:middle line:10%
decide not to reach out at all.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.580 align:middle line:10%
For me, all the great things
that have ever come to me

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.570 align:middle line:10%
have come through reaching
out into that unknown.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:02.240 align:middle line:10%
And I think life is just sort of
an ongoing process of reaching

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.310 align:middle line:10%
out into the darkness
when you really don't

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.650 align:middle line:10%
know what you're going to find.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:11.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Truthfully, this is an
aspect of humanity that I love.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.310 align:middle line:90%
I truly adore it.

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:16.020 align:middle line:84%
It is the ability for
us to face our fears

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:20.070 align:middle line:84%
and go beyond them to reach
into the darkness, peer

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:24.330 align:middle line:84%
beyond what our fears are, and
to see something quite familiar

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.730 align:middle line:90%
staring straight back at us--

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:28.890 align:middle line:90%
our higher potential.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:31.650 align:middle line:84%
This is truly what
humanity was built upon,

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:34.200 align:middle line:84%
all those explorers
and mariners that

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.450 align:middle line:84%
didn't know whether they
were going to make it back

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.100 align:middle line:90%
from this treacherous journey.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.730 align:middle line:84%
But they still set out
to see what this path had

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:44.710 align:middle line:90%
in store for them.

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:48.040 align:middle line:84%
Statistically, we are not all
going to blaze our own trails.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:51.680 align:middle line:84%
We're not all going to face our
fears to the same magnitude.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.850 align:middle line:84%
But we are all given
the same hardware.

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:56.120 align:middle line:84%
We are all set up
in the same way.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.990 align:middle line:84%
So it is possible for
every single one of us

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:01.250 align:middle line:90%
to enter these states.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:04.240 align:middle line:90%
So what is it that separates us?

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.690 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look back at
ancient shamanism, maybe even

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:12.430 align:middle line:84%
beyond ancient shamanism, to
that very first time somebody

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:15.670 align:middle line:84%
ever ate a psychedelic
plant and started

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:18.860 align:middle line:84%
entering this altered
state of reality,

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.350 align:middle line:84%
fearing that maybe they
had poisoned themselves,

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:25.190 align:middle line:84%
maybe they're dying, or
maybe they're meeting God.

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:28.610 align:middle line:10%
Well, Stuart Hameroff, an
anesthesiologist and a quantum

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:31.850 align:middle line:10%
theorist, says that
psychedelic compounds actually

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:35.090 align:middle line:10%
enter the mind into
a quantum state,

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:39.370 align:middle line:10%
that there is a state of reality
much finer than the scale,

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:41.750 align:middle line:10%
this macroscopic scale
that we are living at,

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:46.790 align:middle line:10%
that has information,
universal, timeless information

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:48.590 align:middle line:10%
available to us.

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:51.710 align:middle line:84%
If you look back in
time, all of the themes

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:54.590 align:middle line:84%
that were drawn and painted
onto these cave walls

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:56.990 align:middle line:90%
were shamanic in nature.

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:58.070 align:middle line:90%
Very curious.

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:02.330 align:middle line:84%
So is the shamanic state
and the psychedelic state

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:08.340 align:middle line:84%
encrypted into our DNA, written
into our ancestral memory?

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at a
show called "Psychedelica"

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.920 align:middle line:84%
and what Graham Hancock
has to say about this.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.160 align:middle line:90%


00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.300 align:middle line:10%
>> That evidence, we first
encounter it in the painted

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:26.360 align:middle line:10%
caves of upper paleolithic
Europe going back close

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.390 align:middle line:10%
to 40,000 years ago past.

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:34.070 align:middle line:84%
There are certain types
of imagery that regularly

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:37.370 align:middle line:84%
and routinely crop up
in those deeply altered

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:40.820 align:middle line:84%
states of consciousness
brought on by psychedelics.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And it is precisely
those types of imagery

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:47.030 align:middle line:84%
that we find in the
ancient rock and cave art

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:48.880 align:middle line:90%
all around the world.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, there is an interesting
set of findings about how

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:55.160 align:middle line:10%
humans differ from our
chimpanzee relatives in terms

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.940 align:middle line:10%
of the use of these psychedelics
and what happens in the body.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:02.420 align:middle line:84%
The human serotonergic
system is much more sensitive

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:04.160 align:middle line:90%
to these substances.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.700 align:middle line:84%
The binding of the
serotonin neural receptors

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:11.310 align:middle line:84%
with these psychedelics is two
to four times more powerful

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:14.810 align:middle line:84%
than what happens
in chimpanzees.

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:16.190 align:middle line:90%
>> So what does this mean?

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:17.750 align:middle line:84%
Michael Winkelman
is just showing us

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:22.320 align:middle line:84%
that we are hard-wired
for the psychedelic state.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.260 align:middle line:84%
Are we hardwired also
for the shamanic state

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:26.930 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness?

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:29.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's take a deeper look
at the shamanic state or even

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:31.310 align:middle line:90%
the psychedelic state.

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:33.540 align:middle line:84%
There's these phases
that seem to happen.

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.430 align:middle line:84%
There's the coming
on phase where

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:36.990 align:middle line:84%
you're starting to
feel it and then

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:38.430 align:middle line:90%
you become entrenched in it.

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:41.550 align:middle line:84%
Then there's the peak
phase where everything is

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:44.700 align:middle line:90%
blasting at 100% full throttle.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.190 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
coming down phase.

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And then there's this afterglow,
another phase where things just

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:54.690 align:middle line:84%
seem to kind of be hazy, but
also integrating, coming back

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:57.810 align:middle line:84%
into the real world or
this consensus reality.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:01.378 align:middle line:90%


00:13:01.378 --> 00:13:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, now let's take a
look at this nifty graphic

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.570 align:middle line:84%
that the Flow Genome
Project made up.

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And it shows that there's also
this cycle to the flow state.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:14.850 align:middle line:10%
And they're looking at not only
the brainwave states, but also

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:16.710 align:middle line:10%
the chemicals
inside the body that

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:18.960 align:middle line:10%
are prompted at these times.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.690 align:middle line:10%
And it all starts
with the struggle.

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:25.140 align:middle line:84%
The struggle state is
typified by beta brainwaves

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.110 align:middle line:84%
and chemicals like cortisol
and norepinephrine.

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:31.080 align:middle line:84%
That was that 21st century
normal that Steven Kotler

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.420 align:middle line:90%
mentioned.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:35.760 align:middle line:84%
Now the next phase
is the release phase.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's typified
by alpha brainwaves.

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that's
seen in the body

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.930 align:middle line:84%
chemically is nitric
oxide at this phase.

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:46.320 align:middle line:84%
It opens up the veins and
allows more blood, nutrients,

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.630 align:middle line:84%
and oxygen to arrive
at all the tissues.

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:52.470 align:middle line:84%
This is priming us for
the flow state, which

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:54.640 align:middle line:90%
is the next part of the phase.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:59.010 align:middle line:10%
The flow state is typified in
brainwaves by theta and gamma

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:03.210 align:middle line:10%
waves coming together, also
with endorphins, dopamine,

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:06.420 align:middle line:10%
and anandamide as the chemicals
that flood through the body.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:10.530 align:middle line:84%
Anandamide is also a chemical
that we find in cannabis.

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:12.730 align:middle line:10%
So then we go further
from this stage.

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And we go in to the
rest or recovery phase.

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is typified by
delta brainwaves, serotonin,

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.580 align:middle line:90%
and oxytocin--

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:24.480 align:middle line:90%
feel good chemicals.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.970 align:middle line:84%
So there are neurological
and chemical changes

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:31.050 align:middle line:84%
for entering the flow state
and exiting the flow state.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Could it be the same
for what is called

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:37.710 align:middle line:84%
shamanic flight or astral
travel when a shaman leaves

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:40.980 align:middle line:84%
their body, their mind,
their consciousness, leaves

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:43.950 align:middle line:84%
their body, travels
into another dimension

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:47.760 align:middle line:84%
or across this three-dimensional
space that we live in?

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.680 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a deeper
look at this phenomena

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.380 align:middle line:84%
and see if we can't
somehow suss out

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:54.930 align:middle line:84%
what's happening in the
brain and in the body

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:58.310 align:middle line:90%
during this moment.

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.830 align:middle line:10%
>> There is a well-known
phenomena of the out-of-body

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:03.110 align:middle line:10%
experience or astral projection.

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:05.570 align:middle line:10%
Well, what we know is that
there is a particular part

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:08.660 align:middle line:10%
of the brain that's supposed
to integrate our sense of self

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:12.230 align:middle line:10%
with our body, the
temporal parietal junction.

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:15.590 align:middle line:10%
And when this part of the
brain is taken offline,

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:17.960 align:middle line:10%
then we're able to
experience ourselves

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.120 align:middle line:10%
independent of our body.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.940 align:middle line:10%
>> Does this mean that the
shaman simply convinces his

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:27.110 align:middle line:10%
or her own brain that the
mind and body are separating?

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And if so does that mean
that it's just a mirage?

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:34.430 align:middle line:10%
Or is belief, imagination,
and creativity

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:37.940 align:middle line:10%
the physical mechanisms by
which an aspect of the shaman

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.400 align:middle line:10%
leaves his or her
body to perform work

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.880 align:middle line:10%
in other dimensions?

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.550 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps this is the
underlying knowledge

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:46.130 align:middle line:84%
that shamans utilized
when crafting the healing

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:47.480 align:middle line:90%
environment.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Shamans become healers.

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:50.870 align:middle line:10%
They become good artists.

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:55.010 align:middle line:10%
They can design
their own rituals.

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:57.800 align:middle line:10%
They create their
own music and so on.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Again, what makes
the shaman a shaman

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:04.580 align:middle line:84%
is that he or she had
the substantial number

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:08.580 align:middle line:90%
of personal experiences.

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:11.960 align:middle line:84%
>> So there are skilled
travelers, astral travelers,

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.970 align:middle line:90%
leaving their body.

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:16.850 align:middle line:10%
Well, Jamie Wheal,
he's the other author

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:19.780 align:middle line:10%
for "Stealing Fire"
along with Steven Kotler.

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:21.710 align:middle line:10%
And Jamie Wheal did
this YouTube video

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:24.620 align:middle line:10%
where he asked three
pertinent questions.

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:28.100 align:middle line:84%
Where does the information
come from in an altered state

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:32.050 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness like flow or
like the psychedelic state?

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:34.070 align:middle line:84%
In our default state
of consciousness

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:36.470 align:middle line:84%
right now where
we typically are,

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:40.340 align:middle line:84%
the brain is processing
about 120 bits of information

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:41.600 align:middle line:90%
a second.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.430 align:middle line:84%
It's actually seen
that our brain

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:48.170 align:middle line:84%
is able to process 11 million
bits of information per second

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:50.970 align:middle line:84%
under these altered
states of consciousness.

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:52.610 align:middle line:90%
That's a huge disparity.

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:55.910 align:middle line:84%
Imagine winning $120
versus $11 million.

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:58.670 align:middle line:84%
That's the difference
of the amount

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:01.190 align:middle line:84%
of information
processing your brain has

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:05.510 align:middle line:90%
under flow and shamanic status.

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:09.319 align:middle line:84%
Question number two, are we
able to access more than just

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:12.770 align:middle line:84%
what's in our body and in
our environment right now?

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Are we able to go
back into our ancestry

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:19.800 align:middle line:84%
and tap into what is
called epigenetic memory?

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.680 align:middle line:84%
So to answer
question number two,

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:25.329 align:middle line:84%
Jamie Wheal found some
epigenetic evidence.

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:29.570 align:middle line:84%
There's this experiment where
lab mice, one control group,

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:34.100 align:middle line:84%
and one experiment group,
the experiment group, a bell

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:35.180 align:middle line:90%
would ring.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
shock the mice.

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Again, the bell
would ring, it would

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:42.650 align:middle line:84%
shock the mice over
and over and over again

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:43.790 align:middle line:90%
throughout their lives.

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually,
they would have pups.

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And these pups would grow
up with the same treatment.

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:50.750 align:middle line:90%
A bell would ring.

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:51.890 align:middle line:90%
They would shock them.

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:52.970 align:middle line:90%
A bell would ring.

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:55.640 align:middle line:84%
They would receive a shock
over and over and over

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:59.340 align:middle line:84%
again until these mice
had their own pups.

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:02.640 align:middle line:84%
So these are the grandchildren
of the original mice.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.420 align:middle line:84%
These mice listened to
the sound of a bell,

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:07.190 align:middle line:90%
but they didn't get shocked.

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:10.100 align:middle line:84%
But the curious thing
was they still flinched.

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:13.460 align:middle line:84%
They showed a
neurological contraction

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:16.230 align:middle line:84%
in their entire
musculature as well.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:18.260 align:middle line:84%
So there's this memory
they were accessing

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.270 align:middle line:84%
from their parents and
their grandparents,

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:22.160 align:middle line:84%
whereas the control
group who were not

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:26.090 align:middle line:84%
getting the shocks at the
sound of a bell never flinched.

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:30.130 align:middle line:84%
This is evidence of
epigenetic memory.

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And his third question is are
we receivers and transmitters

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:37.000 align:middle line:84%
of information, rather
than just the brain

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.210 align:middle line:84%
causing for consciousness
and storing data?

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:42.820 align:middle line:84%
I've already shown you the
evidence in the lab mice.

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And this is very interesting
that mind can move across time,

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:47.920 align:middle line:90%
down through generations.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:51.820 align:middle line:84%
Now let's explore if mind
can move across space

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:55.576 align:middle line:90%
and into the mind of another.

00:18:55.576 --> 00:18:58.330 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:02.070 align:middle line:10%
>> This is magnetite, one of
the most magnetic substances

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:03.270 align:middle line:10%
on Earth.

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:05.760 align:middle line:10%
As you can probably guess,
it has a diverse range

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:09.690 align:middle line:10%
of uses from fridge magnets to
generating electricity in power

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:11.150 align:middle line:10%
plants.

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:13.230 align:middle line:10%
But what you probably
wouldn't guess

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:16.442 align:middle line:10%
is that your brain actually
synthesizes these crystals.

00:19:16.442 --> 00:19:18.150 align:middle line:10%
And you have hundreds
of millions of them

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:middle line:10%
inside your head.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.920 align:middle line:10%
Scientists are still
unsure what role, if any,

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.950 align:middle line:10%
these crystals play in
the brain's function.

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:27.870 align:middle line:10%
Studies have inferred
that it may play

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:30.270 align:middle line:10%
a role in long-term memory.

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:32.760 align:middle line:10%
It suggests that cellular
components of the brain

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:36.060 align:middle line:10%
communicate with each other
through magnetic signals

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:39.360 align:middle line:10%
with the magnetite particles
acting as tiny antennas

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.580 align:middle line:10%
simultaneously
receiving information

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.340 align:middle line:10%
throughout the different
parts of the brain.

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.260 align:middle line:10%
Magnetite also
acts as an antenna

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.610 align:middle line:10%
for external
electromagnetic fields,

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:51.760 align:middle line:10%
including the geomagnetic
field of the Earth itself.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.510 align:middle line:10%
And this is where things
start to get interesting.

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:56.670 align:middle line:10%
An enormous body of
research is emerging

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:59.460 align:middle line:10%
that shows substantive links
between magnetic fields

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:01.590 align:middle line:10%
and cognitive function.

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:04.290 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Persinger has
shown in the laboratory

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:07.680 align:middle line:10%
that magnetic brain stimulation
can create mental states

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.620 align:middle line:10%
conducive to human telepathy.

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:13.590 align:middle line:10%
A recent experiment placed
two people at a distance

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:15.000 align:middle line:10%
in different rooms.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.150 align:middle line:10%
Each was surrounded by an
identical computer-controlled

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:19.560 align:middle line:10%
magnetic field.

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:22.500 align:middle line:10%
When a light was flashed
in one subject's eye,

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:25.590 align:middle line:10%
the person in the other room
showed responses in their brain

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:28.050 align:middle line:10%
as if they saw the
flash of light.

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:30.570 align:middle line:10%
As Dr. Persinger
stated, "We think

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:33.900 align:middle line:10%
that's tremendous because
it may be the first macro

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:37.560 align:middle line:10%
demonstration of a quantum
connection or so-called quantum

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.860 align:middle line:10%
entanglement."

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:42.470 align:middle line:90%
>> So let me get this straight.

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:45.710 align:middle line:84%
These crystals connect
us electromagnetically

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:47.550 align:middle line:90%
with the Earth.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:50.010 align:middle line:84%
They're involved
in long-term memory

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:53.580 align:middle line:90%
and in quantum telepathy.

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:55.320 align:middle line:90%
Where do I buy them?

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, the drug
dealer would probably

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:59.470 align:middle line:90%
say, right here in my pocket.

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:03.870 align:middle line:84%
But the researcher, the
psychonaut, the flow state

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:09.600 align:middle line:84%
expert, would say, it's right
here encrypted into our body.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.880 align:middle line:84%
There is also something
else that our body produces

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:15.930 align:middle line:84%
endogenously, not just
these crystals but DMT,

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:17.920 align:middle line:90%
dimethyltryptamine.

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.850 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the most powerful
psychedelic compounds

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:22.100 align:middle line:90%
known to man.

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's created right
here in the human body.

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:28.910 align:middle line:10%
Author Dr. Rick Strassman
wrote a book "DMT--

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:32.960 align:middle line:10%
The Spirit Molecule" explaining
all the incredible experiences,

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:36.800 align:middle line:10%
mind-bending experiences, that
are outside of space and time

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:40.580 align:middle line:10%
that happen from this drug
being injected into them.

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:43.760 align:middle line:10%
But we produce it ourselves.

Another author, John
A. Chavez, wrote

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:48.170 align:middle line:84%
a book called "Questions
for the Lion Tamer."

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:50.720 align:middle line:10%
He uses a lot of evidence
and a lot of science

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:53.720 align:middle line:10%
to support some pretty
wild speculations.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.840 align:middle line:84%
He even calls the
chapter Wild Speculations

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:58.880 align:middle line:84%
because he wants to
show that evidence

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:02.690 align:middle line:84%
can be there to support
that we know very little

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:04.670 align:middle line:90%
about human consciousness.

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:07.190 align:middle line:10%
And he starts
speculating that DMT

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:14.030 align:middle line:10%
might be very integral to
telepathy, clairvoyance, heart

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:19.760 align:middle line:10%
coherence, channeling, aha
moments, miraculous healings,

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:22.880 align:middle line:10%
and even other
paranormal phenomena.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:27.260 align:middle line:84%
What is this state that
DMT seems to put us in?

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:29.000 align:middle line:84%
What is the state
that these brain

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.840 align:middle line:84%
crystals, these magnetite
crystals, help us enter into?

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.580 align:middle line:90%
What is that flow state?

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:36.320 align:middle line:90%
What is coherence?

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:40.770 align:middle line:84%
What is the shamanic and
the psychedelic state?

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:45.740 align:middle line:84%
What if they are all talking
about exactly the same thing?

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:50.710 align:middle line:84%
What if we are the limitless
pill that we need to swallow

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:53.940 align:middle line:84%
and that limitless pill
will open itself up and turn

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:56.700 align:middle line:84%
into exactly what we
need in the moment

00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:00.870 align:middle line:84%
if we enter into the right
state of consciousness?

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:05.700 align:middle line:84%
Are we able to affect future
generations in our family line

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:10.050 align:middle line:84%
simply because we access
this state more and more?

00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:12.930 align:middle line:10%
Are we able to allow for our
children and their children

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:16.680 align:middle line:10%
and the next seven
generations to be rewarded

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:19.800 align:middle line:10%
with this gift, this
beautiful ability

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:24.030 align:middle line:10%
to be able to access information
where life becomes effortless,

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:27.610 align:middle line:10%
lyrical, poetic, and perfect?

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:28.590 align:middle line:90%
I hope so.

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:31.899 align:middle line:84%
And I hope you set
off on this path.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:37.630 align:middle line:84%
So as usual, I want to leave
you guys with some challenges

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:40.720 align:middle line:84%
that you can employ in the week
to come before I see you next.

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:46.530 align:middle line:90%


00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:50.290 align:middle line:10%
The first challenge is if
you are capable of running,

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:52.320 align:middle line:10%
I want you to find
a patch of woods

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:56.370 align:middle line:10%
where there's a lot of
dynamics, a lot of variables.

00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to run as fast
as you can through those woods.

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:01.770 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, maintain your safety.

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:03.460 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, wear your shoes.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:05.778 align:middle line:90%
But run as fast as you can.

00:24:05.778 --> 00:24:07.320 align:middle line:84%
Your analytical mind
is going to have

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.390 align:middle line:84%
to quiet down because
you're not going to be

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:11.640 align:middle line:90%
able to overthink the moves.

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:14.580 align:middle line:84%
You just need to make
those moves in real time.

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.370 align:middle line:84%
If you make a mistake, just
get up, dust yourself off,

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:19.090 align:middle line:90%
keep going.

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:21.600 align:middle line:84%
Once you find your
pace, I want you

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:25.060 align:middle line:90%
to bump it up just about 4%.

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:30.770 align:middle line:84%
This is that challenge to skill
ratio, that trigger for flow.

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:32.030 align:middle line:90%
But what am I asking you?

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:35.000 align:middle line:90%
4% is not actually that much.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.990 align:middle line:84%
If you walk a 10-minute
mile, bumping that up 4%

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:43.730 align:middle line:84%
is only going to knock 20
to 30 seconds off that mile.

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:45.260 align:middle line:90%
So it's not that much.

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:50.050 align:middle line:84%
But it's just enough to
trigger the flow state.

00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:51.530 align:middle line:90%
Second challenge.

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:52.930 align:middle line:90%
It's the shamanic challenge.

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Find those in your community
that are truly in need.

00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:57.650 align:middle line:90%
It could be family.

00:24:57.650 --> 00:24:59.860 align:middle line:10%
It could be young
people, elders.

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Whoever it is, find the
ones in need and serve them.

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:06.700 align:middle line:84%
Because remember that
shamans weren't just

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:10.660 align:middle line:84%
there to keep the health, the
physical health of the tribe,

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:14.080 align:middle line:84%
they were also there
keeping the mental sanity.

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:17.510 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I'm asking
you to be for your community.

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:19.318 align:middle line:90%
Be an anchor for security.

00:25:19.318 --> 00:25:22.460 align:middle line:90%


00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:25.790 align:middle line:10%
Now I want to leave you with
a quote from Mahatma Gandhi.

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:28.830 align:middle line:10%
I think it sums up this
entire episode perfectly.

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:33.980 align:middle line:84%
He said, "The best way to find
yourself is to lose yourself

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:37.180 align:middle line:90%
in the service of others."

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:38.760 align:middle line:90%
I hope you take this to heart.

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'll see you around
next time on "Limitless."

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.930 align:middle line:90%
