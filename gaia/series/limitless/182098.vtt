00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.290 align:middle line:84%
>> What if your highest
potential lies dormant within

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.090 align:middle line:90%
your body?

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:25.320 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.960 align:middle line:10%
Today we're talking
about the human riddle,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.820 align:middle line:10%
because truly how
can you know what

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.530 align:middle line:10%
you're capable of if you don't
even know who and what you are?

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.800 align:middle line:84%
The human species
is a mystery to us.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.680 align:middle line:84%
All of our modern science,
all of our advancements

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.440 align:middle line:84%
have led us to the place
where we're still not agreeing

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.270 align:middle line:90%
on what consciousness truly is.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.880 align:middle line:90%


00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.920 align:middle line:84%
In some ways, the
very instrument

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.070 align:middle line:84%
we're using to answer that
question is consciousness

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.490 align:middle line:84%
itself, meaning all the
tools and the technologies

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.830 align:middle line:84%
that we use to answer
these questions

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.630 align:middle line:84%
are technologies to peer
directly back into ourselves.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.030 align:middle line:10%
We are the mystery, all the
way down to the human body

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.700 align:middle line:10%
and the language that
speaks to us with.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.250 align:middle line:10%
Yes, it does speak
to us, and it speaks

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.580 align:middle line:10%
through our human behavior,
as well as our spirit, which

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.130 align:middle line:10%
doesn't speak to us
directly through our body,

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.130 align:middle line:10%
but really read between the
lines of all the behaviors

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.270 align:middle line:10%
that we display through
our entire lives.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.900 align:middle line:90%
So let's begin with the body.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.760 align:middle line:90%
Why is there no manual?

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Why is there no
guidebook to tell us

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.750 align:middle line:84%
exactly what this language
of the body truly means?

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it's
because we are not

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.660 align:middle line:84%
a commodity or some product that
comes with some kind of owner's

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.680 align:middle line:90%
manual.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.030 align:middle line:90%
We are a riddle.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.190 align:middle line:84%
We're meant to seek the
answer to our own existence.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.790 align:middle line:84%
Our body is always
speaking with us.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.710 align:middle line:84%
We have chemical
messengers that are always

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.750 align:middle line:90%
going through our bloodstream.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.850 align:middle line:84%
We have electromagnetic impulses
going through our neurons.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.160 align:middle line:90%
We have postures that we hold.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.389 align:middle line:84%
We have behaviors and
movements that we display.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And all of this has very
valuable information for us,

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.010 align:middle line:84%
but we typically
don't listen to it.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And we outsource
what this riddle is.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.310 align:middle line:84%
We outsource our questions about
this language to the doctors

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.930 align:middle line:84%
and the scientists that
are out there today.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And one reason why I believe
that modern science is missing

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.310 align:middle line:84%
a huge part of this puzzle
is because they are only

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.450 align:middle line:84%
looking at the averages, the
numbers, the measurable spaces

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.160 align:middle line:90%
of what the body is saying.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.260 align:middle line:84%
So if you go to the
doctor and they tell you

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.560 align:middle line:84%
you have too high of cholesterol
or too high of blood pressure,

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.080 align:middle line:90%
what does this really mean?

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.640 align:middle line:90%
What is it saying?

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.430 align:middle line:84%
Because what is normal for
me may not be normal for you,

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.080 align:middle line:90%
and vise versa.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.980 align:middle line:84%
So to truly get at the
heart of the human riddle,

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.650 align:middle line:84%
we need to go deeper
than just science.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And this is why today,
to answer this riddle,

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.950 align:middle line:84%
we need to bring into question
who we are and why we're here.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.370 align:middle line:84%
So let's hear from Neil
Kramer in the "Initiation

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.040 align:middle line:90%
to a Mystical Life."

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.430 align:middle line:10%
>> The physical
world is a phantom,

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.250 align:middle line:10%
a holographic representation
of something else.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.100 align:middle line:10%
Nothing can be
taken at face value.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.160 align:middle line:10%
Nothing can be taken as it is.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.620 align:middle line:10%
At its very core,
the essence of life

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.270 align:middle line:10%
is mysterious,
mysterious by design.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.860 align:middle line:10%
The mystery is the teacher.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.530 align:middle line:10%
The mind can be
programmed by ourselves

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.455 align:middle line:10%
to encounter the world more
accurately, more openly.

00:03:42.455 --> 00:03:46.892 align:middle line:90%


00:03:46.892 --> 00:03:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So Neil Kramer said that
the mystery is the teacher.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.920 align:middle line:84%
That's very beautiful,
because when

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.670 align:middle line:84%
looking at the body and the
mysteries that it presents us,

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.730 align:middle line:84%
just the outer form
is the beginning

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.450 align:middle line:90%
or the tip of the iceberg.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.360 align:middle line:84%
If you were to open
up the body and take

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.790 align:middle line:84%
a look at all the
different compartments, all

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.040 align:middle line:84%
the different organs
and components,

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.220 align:middle line:84%
all of the different cells,
all the different life forms

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.030 align:middle line:84%
that are in there, the systems
that come together in harmony

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.040 align:middle line:84%
so we can have this
experience, saying

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.519 align:middle line:84%
this is me choosing to be here,
making these decisions right

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.910 align:middle line:90%
now, is truly incredible.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.550 align:middle line:90%


00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And we also have trillions
of bacterial and fungal cells

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.110 align:middle line:84%
inside of our body that
have DNA that is not human,

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.490 align:middle line:90%
but they still influence us.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:35.990 align:middle line:90%
They still speak with us.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.350 align:middle line:84%
They add to the overall
language of the body.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.230 align:middle line:84%
So what do all of these
components in our body

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.030 align:middle line:90%
have in common?

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.170 align:middle line:90%
The language of chemistry.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's just take a look
at a chemical compound.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.230 align:middle line:84%
Chemical compounds are many
different elements bonded

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.810 align:middle line:90%
together in a configuration.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And this configuration
is much like a key.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.140 align:middle line:84%
It fits into a receptor site
that our body is equipped with.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.220 align:middle line:84%
These receptor sites only allow
those chemical compounds in.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And when they do, they unlock
biological processes within us.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.900 align:middle line:84%
Now let's go even deeper
into chemical compounds,

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.720 align:middle line:84%
because if you see all the
little elements that make up

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.730 align:middle line:84%
that compound, every
one of them has

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.820 align:middle line:84%
an atomic weight or
a resonant frequency,

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.700 align:middle line:84%
meaning a pitch or a
tone that they hit.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.530 align:middle line:84%
But since there
are many elements,

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.990 align:middle line:84%
these are many tones happening
at the same time, structurally

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.760 align:middle line:90%
bound with one another.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.040 align:middle line:84%
This, to me, sounds like
music inside the body.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.410 align:middle line:84%
When a symphony or
a chord is struck,

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.880 align:middle line:84%
the body changes its composition
and goes into different modes,

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.860 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:53.400 align:middle line:84%
But what makes the peaceful
balance of our body go haywire?

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.880 align:middle line:84%
I believe that it's our modern
lifestyle and the stressors

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.160 align:middle line:84%
that come with the type
of society and culture

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.590 align:middle line:90%
we live in today.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.050 align:middle line:84%
These stressors are things
that our ancestors never

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.000 align:middle line:90%
had to deal with.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.700 align:middle line:84%
These are stressors
like being in the car

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.510 align:middle line:84%
in traffic late for work, or
the fear of losing our job,

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.180 align:middle line:84%
or not having enough
money, the fear

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:20.190 align:middle line:84%
of not being a good enough
parent or lover or human being.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.040 align:middle line:90%
These are simply perceptions.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.230 align:middle line:90%
They're not real threats.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.330 align:middle line:84%
But our body still
responds in that way.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.180 align:middle line:90%
So let's go deeper.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.290 align:middle line:84%
How do our perceptions
truly affect our body?

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's see what the experts
in the film "E-motion"

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.570 align:middle line:90%
have to say about this.

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Now when we react to
conditions in our life,

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.430 align:middle line:10%
there is an emotional component
that begins to create chemistry

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.060 align:middle line:10%
in our bodies, because the body
is interpreting an emergency

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.440 align:middle line:10%
situation.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Whenever you see something,
because the brain works

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:59.180 align:middle line:84%
in pictures, there is a response
to that image of the sensory

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.260 align:middle line:90%
impact.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.200 align:middle line:84%
If you hear a sound
that sounds dangerous,

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.410 align:middle line:84%
your body, your brain will
create an emotional molecule

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.700 align:middle line:90%
to get you to respond to that.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.540 align:middle line:10%
>> And so the mind does its
work very, very quickly.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.850 align:middle line:10%
And based on the data
that it is receiving,

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.990 align:middle line:10%
it forms a truth about the
present memory or experience.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Based on that truth, it
comes up with a thought

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:24.110 align:middle line:84%
that tells the self about
that memory or experience.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.180 align:middle line:84%
Based on that
thought, we generate

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.220 align:middle line:84%
what we believe is the
appropriate emotion

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.810 align:middle line:90%
to match that thought.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And as a result, our
heart rate increases,

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.810 align:middle line:84%
our immune system suppresses,
we become more anxious

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:39.350 align:middle line:84%
because we're not in our
fullest potential in the moment.

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:42.590 align:middle line:84%
The core of every symptom,
stress, and disease

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:45.082 align:middle line:84%
are emotions and memories,
traumatic perceptions

00:07:45.082 --> 00:07:46.790 align:middle line:84%
that are buried in
our subconscious mind.

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:49.840 align:middle line:90%


00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So I want to remind you
what the host said there.

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:55.030 align:middle line:84%
He said if we're not living
in our full potential,

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.550 align:middle line:84%
then our immune
system is compromised,

00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:59.430 align:middle line:90%
meaning baseline health--

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:02.320 align:middle line:84%
that standard that we would like
to have throughout our lives--

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.450 align:middle line:84%
comes from living to
our full potential.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:10.320 align:middle line:84%
So why is this not the case
today in modern society?

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give you an
example of a modern stressor

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:15.560 align:middle line:84%
and compare it to
an ancient one.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.560 align:middle line:84%
Let's imagine somebody almost
gets into a car accident.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.620 align:middle line:84%
They're fine, but they need to
pull over the car and process

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.510 align:middle line:90%
what's just happened.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:26.990 align:middle line:10%
These tiny little adrenal
glands on top of our kidneys

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:29.390 align:middle line:10%
start pumping out
a chemical compound

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:32.090 align:middle line:10%
or a song called adrenaline.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And what this chemical
does inside the body

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.490 align:middle line:84%
is it shuts down all the
biological processes that

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:41.929 align:middle line:84%
do not need to be there
for us to fight or flight.

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:44.179 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is a natural response.

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:47.300 align:middle line:84%
This goes all the way back to
the gazelle on the plains being

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.460 align:middle line:90%
chased by a cheetah.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.010 align:middle line:84%
So the response is
very unique, and it's

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.920 align:middle line:84%
very specific to
having this fear

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.990 align:middle line:90%
that we almost got injured.

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:58.760 align:middle line:84%
But what happens
in the distinction

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:03.160 align:middle line:84%
between the gazelle on the
plains and us in the car

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.290 align:middle line:84%
is that the gazelle, assuming
that it gets to safety,

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:08.170 align:middle line:90%
will go into a tremoring state.

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:11.300 align:middle line:84%
It will begin shaking
its body until it's done,

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.430 align:middle line:84%
and then it will
get up and move on.

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Why does it do
this unique dance?

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we see people
tremoring and shaking

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.070 align:middle line:84%
after a scary incident, but
it doesn't always happen.

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.910 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look deeply
inside the body at what's

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:30.260 align:middle line:84%
happening when this gazelle
goes into that tremoring fit.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.090 align:middle line:84%
All of the adrenaline that
was pumped out into the body,

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:35.870 align:middle line:84%
into the tissues,
begins to move itself.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.510 align:middle line:84%
Because of the shaking,
it starts the process,

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.580 align:middle line:84%
move itself into the
bladder where it can

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.990 align:middle line:90%
be eliminated from the body.

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:45.050 align:middle line:10%
But if you're simply
sitting in your car

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:48.680 align:middle line:10%
and you choose to call someone,
or drive that 15 minutes home

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.500 align:middle line:10%
and talk to somebody and
process it intellectually,

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:52.740 align:middle line:10%
this may be good.

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.940 align:middle line:84%
But it's not processing
what's happening to the body.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:59.150 align:middle line:10%
The author Bradford Keeney wrote
a book called Shaking Medicine

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.460 align:middle line:10%
because he noticed that
not only would animals

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:05.360 align:middle line:10%
go into these tremoring fits to
help the health and the balance

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.280 align:middle line:10%
of their body, but
he would also notice

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.000 align:middle line:10%
that tribesmen and
shamans within tribes

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.120 align:middle line:10%
would enter this tremoring
state so they would actually

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.780 align:middle line:10%
enter their mind into an
altered state of consciousness.

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.910 align:middle line:84%
In this state, they
were able to bring back

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:23.790 align:middle line:84%
information for the
healing of their community.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.410 align:middle line:90%
So this is very peculiar.

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:28.420 align:middle line:84%
This is an ancient
method of healing.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.660 align:middle line:84%
If we look at modern
exercises today,

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:34.050 align:middle line:84%
such as total release
experience or the trauma release

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:38.340 align:middle line:84%
experience, TRE, you'll notice
that involuntary shaking

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:41.310 align:middle line:84%
is what happens when the
body starts to take over.

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:45.330 align:middle line:84%
Some intelligence just
hijacks our decision making,

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.640 align:middle line:84%
and the body starts to
tremor and shake on its own.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And what seems to come from
this is a healing response.

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:58.420 align:middle line:84%
But then ask yourself, why do we
need specialized practices when

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.660 align:middle line:84%
this is what our ancient
ancestors in the animal kingdom

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.830 align:middle line:90%
does naturally?

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it's
because we come now

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.620 align:middle line:90%
from a very sedentary society.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:11.720 align:middle line:84%
At no other time
in history have we

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:15.380 align:middle line:84%
ever practiced the posture
of sitting nearly this much.

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.770 align:middle line:10%
We do not move like
our ancestors did--

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:22.850 align:middle line:10%
15 hours for food, 10,
11 hours squatting.

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:26.270 align:middle line:84%
We do not move through lush,
dense environments anymore.

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:29.690 align:middle line:84%
Our environment is very
predictable, very flat,

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:31.950 align:middle line:90%
and we barely move within it.

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:36.290 align:middle line:84%
This has massive consequences
to our body and our health.

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Steven Mann said, "today's
children are the least active

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:43.850 align:middle line:84%
ever and face a ticking
time bomb of health issues

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:46.070 align:middle line:84%
that puts them at serious
risk of having shorter

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:48.360 align:middle line:90%
lives than their parents."

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.780 align:middle line:90%
That's an incredible statement.

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:53.960 align:middle line:84%
He goes on to say that
movement has been stripped out

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:57.110 align:middle line:84%
of modern living, meaning
Generation Inactive, as he

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:59.330 align:middle line:84%
calls our youth,
are driven to school

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.450 align:middle line:84%
and fed a staple diet
of sofa play and screen

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:06.090 align:middle line:84%
time while being starved
of outdoor activities.

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:09.042 align:middle line:90%


00:12:09.042 --> 00:12:11.500 align:middle line:84%
Now that I've mentioned some
of the issues and the problems

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.900 align:middle line:84%
that we face in
our modern society,

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:17.080 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell you that the
solutions could not be simpler.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.480 align:middle line:84%
My favorite practice
is an integration

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:23.490 align:middle line:90%
of body, mind, and time.

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:25.560 align:middle line:84%
When we integrate
the body and the mind

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.610 align:middle line:84%
together over a period of time,
this is truly no different

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:33.060 align:middle line:84%
than all the movement modalities
in the ancient practices as

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:34.530 align:middle line:90%
well as meditation.

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And they all still exist today,
and they're just as powerful.

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:42.450 align:middle line:84%
So let's start cracking into
exactly how much the body can

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:45.180 align:middle line:84%
influence our
chemical composition

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.490 align:middle line:90%
and our true potential.

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:49.890 align:middle line:10%
A social psychologist
named Amy Cuddy

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:52.800 align:middle line:10%
did a TED Talk that
revolutionized the way we look

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.300 align:middle line:10%
at how we hold our posture.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.060 align:middle line:84%
If you see behind
her, there's a runner

00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:00.060 align:middle line:84%
that must have won this
race because his arms are up

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:03.320 align:middle line:90%
above his head in victory pose.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.860 align:middle line:90%
We're familiar with this pose.

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.650 align:middle line:84%
We see children do it when
they feel accomplished,

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:10.170 align:middle line:84%
when they did something
that they're proud of.

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:13.710 align:middle line:84%
We also see people
stretching with this posture

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.660 align:middle line:84%
to come out of
their seated posture

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:19.150 align:middle line:84%
that we adopt so
often in this society.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:21.930 align:middle line:84%
But what she found
was truly remarkable,

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:24.840 align:middle line:84%
that just two minutes of putting
your arms above your head

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.970 align:middle line:84%
changes your entire
chemical composition.

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:32.230 align:middle line:10%
Testosterone, the confidence
boosting hormone, raises.

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:35.750 align:middle line:10%
Cortisol, the stress
hormone, lowers.

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And testosterone
allows for people

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:40.450 align:middle line:84%
to feel more confident
in their allotted space,

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:42.640 align:middle line:84%
feeling like they can
speak up and truly

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.550 align:middle line:84%
be who they need to
be in that moment.

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:48.640 align:middle line:84%
This is incredible, that
two minutes of a posture

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:53.320 align:middle line:84%
can cause this kind of a change
in our body and in our minds.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.150 align:middle line:90%
Now let's take it deeper.

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:59.140 align:middle line:84%
You may have heard of Botox,
this injectable toxin that

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:01.720 align:middle line:84%
plumps up the skin and
smooths out wrinkles.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.220 align:middle line:84%
But you may not
have heard that it's

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.740 align:middle line:84%
being called the
other anti anxiety,

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.920 align:middle line:90%
or the other antidepressant.

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's being called this
for a very unique reason,

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:13.720 align:middle line:84%
because this toxin
has been known

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.310 align:middle line:90%
to paralyze key facial muscles.

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:20.380 align:middle line:84%
So the people who get Botox
cannot show the expressions

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:24.580 align:middle line:84%
or the emotions of happiness,
joy, depression, or anxiety.

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:27.280 align:middle line:90%


00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.010 align:middle line:84%
If we're not able to
use these muscles,

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:32.500 align:middle line:84%
then the body does not
respond by changing

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.750 align:middle line:84%
the chemical
composition, putting you

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.210 align:middle line:84%
in those moods and
those emotions,

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:41.650 align:middle line:84%
meaning our body and the
way we use it can literally

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:43.680 align:middle line:90%
make you happier.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:49.170 align:middle line:84%
But what does this say about
fulfillment, our greater life's

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:50.710 align:middle line:90%
purpose?

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:52.800 align:middle line:84%
What's the pose or
the posture that

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.330 align:middle line:90%
allows us to feel fulfilled?

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:58.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't believe that it
actually comes from our body.

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:01.140 align:middle line:84%
I believe it comes
from our spirit.

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:04.410 align:middle line:84%
I believe that spirit is much
like the narrator of the story

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:08.670 align:middle line:84%
of our lives, the one who has
a higher perspective on who we

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:11.010 align:middle line:84%
are, what direction
we're heading,

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:14.130 align:middle line:84%
and why we should end
up where we're going.

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:16.830 align:middle line:84%
But spirit also has
a good understanding

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:20.620 align:middle line:84%
of how our inner world
affects the world around us.

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:22.770 align:middle line:84%
So now let's take a
look at a show called

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:26.550 align:middle line:84%
"Missing Links" with Gregg
Braden, a Gaia special,

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:29.100 align:middle line:84%
as he dives in to
tackle that question.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:33.310 align:middle line:90%


00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:37.960 align:middle line:10%
>> In the original texts, the
Aramaic translates "to ask

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:43.540 align:middle line:10%
without hidden motive and be
surrounded by your answer,

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:46.980 align:middle line:10%
be enveloped by what you desire.

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.680 align:middle line:10%
And those are the key words--

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:49.840 align:middle line:10%
be.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.600 align:middle line:10%
If you are being
surrounded by your answer,

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.210 align:middle line:10%
if you are being enveloped
by what you desire,

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:59.110 align:middle line:10%
it means that you are having
the emotional experience

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:02.330 align:middle line:10%
as if those things
are already present.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:05.110 align:middle line:10%
And this is a very,
very powerful concept.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:08.770 align:middle line:10%
There is a huge
difference between working

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:14.230 align:middle line:10%
toward an outcome and
beginning as if that outcome is

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:15.340 align:middle line:10%
already present.

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:16.480 align:middle line:10%
Think about this.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.420 align:middle line:10%
Think about it for
your own healing.

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:20.170 align:middle line:10%
Think about it for
your own relationships.

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:23.620 align:middle line:10%
Think about it for the
abundance in your life.

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.200 align:middle line:10%
If you are asking for
them to be present,

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.110 align:middle line:10%
it means they are
not present now.

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:33.680 align:middle line:10%
If you are giving thanks
for what already exists,

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.570 align:middle line:10%
you are claiming that it
is present in this moment.

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:40.150 align:middle line:10%
You are changing the
biology of your body.

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:42.520 align:middle line:10%
You're changing the
chemistry of your body

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:45.160 align:middle line:10%
as it interacts with
your physical environment

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.920 align:middle line:10%
so that that reality
may be present.

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.100 align:middle line:10%
Remember, the field
is a mirror for what

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.510 align:middle line:10%
we claim to be true within.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:58.120 align:middle line:90%


00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:01.950 align:middle line:84%
>> So what Gregg showed us
there in that clip is that deep

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:07.560 align:middle line:84%
within us, our inner nature
knows how to be the change we

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:09.349 align:middle line:90%
wish to see in the world.

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And that this ancient
scripture in the Old Testament

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.740 align:middle line:90%
mirrors what Gandhi said--

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:16.170 align:middle line:84%
be the change you wish
to see in the world.

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:19.650 align:middle line:84%
Don't simply wish for
it, be it, live it.

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And in this way, as
we've seen before,

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:24.960 align:middle line:84%
the chemical composition and
everything about the body

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:28.920 align:middle line:84%
starts to reflect what we would
like to see in the outer world.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And it literally starts
to become just that.

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:34.630 align:middle line:90%
But why don't we use this gift?

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Why have we lost
this gift to time?

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:39.960 align:middle line:90%


00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you look at our
modern society today,

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:44.580 align:middle line:84%
we are in the business
of pushing nature out

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:46.050 align:middle line:90%
of our habitats.

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:50.460 align:middle line:84%
Any nature, such as plants or
animals, even the people that

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:53.670 align:middle line:84%
live within these
groups, are domesticated,

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:56.370 align:middle line:84%
living on a societal
form of terms

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:59.760 align:middle line:84%
rather than the wild
teacher of nature.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.330 align:middle line:84%
So what are we losing by
living in this modern society

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:05.460 align:middle line:90%
in the way that we do?

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Are we experiencing
a mass forgetting,

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:12.000 align:middle line:90%
a collective amnesia?

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Because truthfully, the
body is speaking to us.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.680 align:middle line:90%
Spirit is speaking to us.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And they have ancient, very
important messages for us.

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:24.570 align:middle line:90%


00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:26.950 align:middle line:84%
But if we've forgotten
how to use it,

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:30.060 align:middle line:84%
then we're not able to tap
back into the messages that

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:32.130 align:middle line:84%
have been left by
all of our ancestors

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:35.770 align:middle line:90%
and all of these scriptures.

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:37.630 align:middle line:84%
So I've been
mentioning a lot today

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:40.540 align:middle line:84%
about how modern lifestyle
stressors are unlike what

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:43.280 align:middle line:90%
our ancestors had to deal with.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is true, but what
am I really saying here?

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Should we throw away
all of our advancements,

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.650 align:middle line:84%
try and return to
hunter-gatherer times,

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:54.590 align:middle line:84%
live purely of nature,
go spear fishing,

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:58.740 align:middle line:84%
throw away all of
our technology?

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.330 align:middle line:90%
Of course not.

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:01.410 align:middle line:90%
This would be silly.

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:05.340 align:middle line:84%
What we really need to do
is honor all the advances

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.260 align:middle line:90%
that we've made as a species.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:11.350 align:middle line:84%
But we really need to respect
where we've come from.

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And let me put this to you
in a very scientific way.

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:17.010 align:middle line:10%
Author Chris Kresser,
a functional medicine

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:19.170 align:middle line:10%
practitioner,
wrote a book called

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:21.270 align:middle line:10%
"An Unconventional Medicine."

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:26.760 align:middle line:10%
And in that book, he said that
only roughly 5% of our DNA

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:30.240 align:middle line:10%
has updated since
hunter-gatherer times.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.320 align:middle line:90%
What does this mean?

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.190 align:middle line:84%
This means that we are
holistic creatures.

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:37.800 align:middle line:84%
We need to respect
our forward progress,

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.010 align:middle line:84%
but we also need to respect
where we've come from

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:44.550 align:middle line:84%
and why we are here in
the way that we are today.

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And if we do this,
we'll truly understand

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:51.460 align:middle line:84%
how to listen to the body,
listen to what it's saying,

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:55.540 align:middle line:84%
and listen for that thing
called spirit speaking to us

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.150 align:middle line:84%
in between the lines of all
the greater things that we

00:19:58.150 --> 00:19:58.960 align:middle line:90%
do in our lives.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:03.540 align:middle line:90%


00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.560 align:middle line:84%
Now I'll leave you
with a challenge

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.040 align:middle line:84%
so you can actually employ
what I'm talking about

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.600 align:middle line:84%
and feel the changes
in your life.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:15.410 align:middle line:90%


00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:18.160 align:middle line:84%
So the first one
was from Amy Cuddy.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:22.510 align:middle line:84%
Lifting the arms up above
the head for two minutes.

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:24.590 align:middle line:90%
Do this in front of the mirror.

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:27.070 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at your
posture as you do it.

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:29.410 align:middle line:90%
See if there's any asymmetries.

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:31.120 align:middle line:90%
Try and even them out.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.610 align:middle line:84%
Try and breathe
naturally, and find a way

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:36.340 align:middle line:84%
to enjoy this next
two minutes which

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.500 align:middle line:90%
might get a little intense.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And as you do that, as
it comes to a close,

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:45.280 align:middle line:84%
softly bring your arms down,
regulate your breathing,

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:48.290 align:middle line:84%
close your eyes, and just
feel what kind of difference

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:49.090 align:middle line:90%
that made.

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:52.480 align:middle line:90%


00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.980 align:middle line:84%
While you're in
front of the mirror,

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.860 align:middle line:84%
you might want to try smiling
for a couple of minutes.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:59.800 align:middle line:84%
You might even notice that
smiling inauthentically

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.440 align:middle line:84%
produces much different
change than smiling

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.390 align:middle line:90%
very authentically.

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:07.390 align:middle line:84%
So try to give your
most authentic smile

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:08.500 align:middle line:90%
for two minutes.

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And then, again, stop,
meditate on how it actually

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:13.330 align:middle line:90%
changed the way you feel.

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:15.870 align:middle line:90%


00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And the best body, mind, time
integration tool is meditation.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.610 align:middle line:84%
So I would advise you to
meditate every day because this

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:28.180 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most important
body, mind, and time

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:30.550 align:middle line:90%
integration tools that we have.

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:32.950 align:middle line:84%
It's the best way to
answer that question--

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:34.240 align:middle line:90%
who are we?

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.620 align:middle line:90%
What is the human riddle?

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:40.140 align:middle line:90%


00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.650 align:middle line:10%
And if you do this every single
day until I see you next,

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:46.920 align:middle line:10%
you will have linked your
body and mind that much more,

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.320 align:middle line:10%
which is going to be very
important as we set off

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:54.040 align:middle line:10%
on this journey to discover
our deepest human potential.

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:57.800 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for joining
me, and I'll see you next time.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:04.011 align:middle line:90%
