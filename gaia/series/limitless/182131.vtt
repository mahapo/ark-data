00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.290 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.110 align:middle line:10%
Today, we're going to be
talking about our natural human

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.210 align:middle line:10%
architecture and
the implications it

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.690 align:middle line:10%
might have for reading
quantum information.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.780 align:middle line:10%
I'll start you off with a
quote by Morihei Ueshiba.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.030 align:middle line:10%
He's a Japanese athlete.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.940 align:middle line:84%
He says that "a good
stance and posture reflect

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.370 align:middle line:90%
the proper state of mind."

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.570 align:middle line:90%
Sounds good.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.610 align:middle line:84%
Sounds a little
flowery, but I aim

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.640 align:middle line:84%
to show you that this is
true in a literal sense.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.540 align:middle line:84%
But what is a poor
posture reflect,

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.310 align:middle line:84%
and how does that
truly affect us?

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.110 align:middle line:84%
We know that in the
developed world,

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.930 align:middle line:84%
there are far more
postural issues

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.440 align:middle line:84%
than in the undeveloped world,
and these postural issues

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.100 align:middle line:84%
lead to things like joint
disease, heart problems,

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.310 align:middle line:84%
breathing trouble, poor
circulation, endocrine

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.210 align:middle line:84%
and hormone disruption,
digestive problems, headaches,

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.000 align:middle line:84%
anxiety, TMJ, prediabetes,
and even vision problems.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.660 align:middle line:84%
In the UK, there are estimates
that 70% of the workforce

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.970 align:middle line:90%
suffers from back pain.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.430 align:middle line:84%
In the US, estimates
are roughly 50%

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.160 align:middle line:84%
of the population suffers
from back pain likely due

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.620 align:middle line:90%
to poor posture.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.060 align:middle line:84%
There is an opioid
epidemic going on

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.220 align:middle line:84%
throughout all the
developed countries, and one

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.500 align:middle line:84%
of the number one reasons
for being prescribed

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.320 align:middle line:84%
an opiate is back pain,
and one of the number

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.460 align:middle line:84%
one causes of back
pain is poor posture.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.060 align:middle line:84%
So what if we are
not actually entering

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.820 align:middle line:84%
into our highest
and truest potential

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.470 align:middle line:84%
simply because of the way we
hold our body and our form?

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's take a look
at form versus function.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.760 align:middle line:84%
So the body that you're
given, the form that you have

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.820 align:middle line:84%
is literally the way
that your body is built.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.580 align:middle line:84%
The function is the way
that your form interacts

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.240 align:middle line:90%
with your environment.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.240 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look
at some animals.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.940 align:middle line:84%
You have monkeys
that climb trees.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And you would bet
that these monkeys

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.240 align:middle line:90%
were made for that environment.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.190 align:middle line:84%
Everything about their
body says that they

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.530 align:middle line:90%
were made to climb these trees.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.240 align:middle line:90%
Now, take a look at a fish.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.960 align:middle line:84%
Their bodies were built for
that aquatic environment.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.790 align:middle line:90%
It's simple to see.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.780 align:middle line:84%
Spiders were made to quietly
creep up walls, spin webs,

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.790 align:middle line:84%
and wait for their
food to come to them.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, bats were built to fly
around in complete darkness,

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.650 align:middle line:84%
echolocating their food
so they could fly to it.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And if you take a look at the
human form all the way back

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.070 align:middle line:84%
to Leonardo da Vinci's
"Vitruvian Man,"

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.210 align:middle line:84%
you'd have to wonder
what kind of environment

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.720 align:middle line:90%
are we built for?

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.960 align:middle line:90%
What exactly is our function?

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.506 align:middle line:84%
And are we harmonious
with our environment?

00:03:09.506 --> 00:03:12.840 align:middle line:90%


00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, we know that we're always
acting upon our environment.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.500 align:middle line:84%
So no matter what, we're
always making changes.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.010 align:middle line:84%
Even if we're asleep or
sitting perfectly still,

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.400 align:middle line:84%
we're still moving on
a cellular, molecular,

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.100 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic, and
even a conscious level.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.030 align:middle line:84%
In fact, not to get
too trippy on you,

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.510 align:middle line:84%
but go ahead and take a look
at your seemingly still hand,

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.760 align:middle line:84%
and if your eyes could do what
scientific technology is doing

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.950 align:middle line:84%
today, you'd be
able to amplify what

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.650 align:middle line:90%
you're seeing 10 billion times.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And that'll get you
down to the atomic scale

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.930 align:middle line:84%
where you'll notice
that nothing is still.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.600 align:middle line:84%
Everything is moving
and spiraling.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Then if you were to amplify
it 1 trillion trillion times,

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.390 align:middle line:84%
you'll get down to
the quantum scale,

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.040 align:middle line:84%
and this is a whole
different ballgame.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Quantum phenomena underlies
the physical world.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.710 align:middle line:84%
You could rightly say
that it is the fabric

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.860 align:middle line:84%
that all of our physical
world is built upon.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.690 align:middle line:84%
But it does not seem to have
to obey the time-space rules

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.490 align:middle line:90%
that our physical world does.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:18.860 align:middle line:84%
So how is it that
the basic building

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.898 align:middle line:84%
blocks of our physical world
can behave so differently?

00:04:23.898 --> 00:04:26.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's take a look at
a film called "Inner Worlds,

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Outer Worlds" as they address
quantum experiments that are

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.005 align:middle line:90%
looking at that very question.

00:04:34.005 --> 00:04:37.110 align:middle line:10%
>> International
researchers at CERN,

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.870 align:middle line:10%
the European laboratory
for particle physics,

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.420 align:middle line:10%
are searching for this field
that extends throughout all

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.740 align:middle line:10%
things.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.990 align:middle line:84%
But instead of
looking within, they

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.505 align:middle line:84%
look to the outer
physical world.

00:04:47.505 --> 00:04:50.900 align:middle line:90%


00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.940 align:middle line:10%
Researchers at the
CERN laboratory

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.300 align:middle line:10%
in Geneva, Switzerland announced
that they had found the Higgs

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.690 align:middle line:10%
boson or the "God particle."

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.610 align:middle line:84%
The Higgs boson
experiments prove

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.940 align:middle line:84%
scientifically that an
invisible energy field

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.470 align:middle line:90%
fills the vacuum of space.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.060 align:middle line:90%


00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.150 align:middle line:10%
CERN's large hadron
collider consists of a ring

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.240 align:middle line:10%
17 miles in
circumference in which

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.570 align:middle line:10%
two beams of particles
race in opposite directions

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.620 align:middle line:10%
converging and smashing together
at nearly the speed of light.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.530 align:middle line:10%
Scientists observe what comes
out of the violent collisions.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.910 align:middle line:90%


00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.790 align:middle line:10%
The standard model cannot
account for how particles get

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.320 align:middle line:10%
their mass.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.990 align:middle line:10%
Everything appears to
be made of vibration,

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.880 align:middle line:10%
but there is no
thing being vibrated.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.800 align:middle line:90%


00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.330 align:middle line:10%
It is as if there has been
an invisible dancer, a shadow

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.750 align:middle line:10%
dancing hidden in the
ballet of the universe.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.490 align:middle line:10%
All the other
dancers have always

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.490 align:middle line:10%
danced around this
hidden dancer.

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.790 align:middle line:10%
We have observed the
choreography of the dance.

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.160 align:middle line:10%
But until now, we could
not see that dancer.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:09.348 align:middle line:90%


00:06:09.348 --> 00:06:12.870 align:middle line:84%
>> So what exactly is our
natural human architecture

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.780 align:middle line:84%
in relation to this hidden
dancer that we just heard

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.360 align:middle line:90%
about?

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.950 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever checked out the
album cover of Pink Floyd's

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:21.870 align:middle line:90%
"Dark Side of The Moon?"

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.900 align:middle line:10%
It's this pyramid
prism, perfectly cut

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.562 align:middle line:10%
so pure white light
enters one side of it,

00:06:27.562 --> 00:06:29.520 align:middle line:10%
and then seven different
colors are popping out

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.470 align:middle line:10%
the other side of it.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.090 align:middle line:84%
Those seven different colors
are that pure white light

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.090 align:middle line:84%
but a different
expression of it.

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:39.630 align:middle line:84%
Just like every single
one of us are different,

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.970 align:middle line:84%
we may experience the
same kind of life,

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.910 align:middle line:84%
but we express
ourselves differently.

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:49.410 align:middle line:10%
So that pure white light
which is truly everywhere

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:52.185 align:middle line:10%
expresses itself differently
through different prisms.

00:06:52.185 --> 00:06:55.030 align:middle line:90%


00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.130 align:middle line:84%
So we express
ourselves according

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:00.910 align:middle line:84%
to the seven deadly sins
or seven cardinal virtues,

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.930 align:middle line:84%
much like those seven colors
coming out of that prison.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.610 align:middle line:84%
But if we truly are much
like a prism, then what

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.500 align:middle line:90%
is the mechanism in our body?

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's take a look at
the most likely candidate--

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.590 align:middle line:90%
the myofascial system.

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.870 align:middle line:84%
The myofascial system
is a catch-all phrase

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.440 align:middle line:84%
for all the connective
tissues, all the cartilage,

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.320 align:middle line:84%
all the joints,
all the ligaments,

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.500 align:middle line:84%
and all of the tissues in
the body that holds our body

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.090 align:middle line:90%
and gives it form.

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.430 align:middle line:84%
Our fascia allows
our body to move

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:37.240 align:middle line:84%
in all the unique and
myriad ways that it can.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And finally, it's
also set up to be

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:45.200 align:middle line:84%
very much like
fiber-optic technology.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's take a
look at posture.

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:49.600 align:middle line:90%
What holds us up?

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.850 align:middle line:84%
We would call this
natural human architecture

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:55.570 align:middle line:84%
just like we would call a house
or a building-- architecture.

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:58.450 align:middle line:84%
But if you see architecture
where bricks are simply

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:03.100 align:middle line:84%
stacked upon bricks, this is
not how the body operates.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.240 align:middle line:84%
Your bones are not
stacked upon one another.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Your entire fascial
system is actually

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.620 align:middle line:84%
pulling your body
up away from gravity

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:15.700 align:middle line:84%
so your joints can receive all
that synovial fluid, nutrients,

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.530 align:middle line:90%
and whatever else they need.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.510 align:middle line:84%
So there's not this
ultimate compression

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:22.730 align:middle line:84%
that you might imagine but
actually, a great levity.

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you look
deeper at fascia,

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:26.950 align:middle line:84%
the way it runs
across the body is not

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.860 align:middle line:90%
just chaotic and haphazardly.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:33.730 align:middle line:10%
It actually runs in many
different trains or tracks

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:35.870 align:middle line:10%
along the body.

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Ronelle Wood-- she's
a fascial worker,

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.700 align:middle line:84%
which is different than
a massage therapist.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.000 align:middle line:84%
She specifically works with the
fascial component of the body.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.050 align:middle line:10%
And she believes that the fascia
is set up to be fiber optic,

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:51.230 align:middle line:10%
and it transmits
photonic information.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.810 align:middle line:84%
Dr. James Oschman
calls the fascia

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:56.690 align:middle line:90%
a liquid crystalline matrix.

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:59.960 align:middle line:84%
What this sounds like
to me is a bendable form

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:04.580 align:middle line:84%
of a prism that refracts light
according to your posture.

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.040 align:middle line:10%
And even researcher and
author Lynne McTaggart

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:10.790 align:middle line:10%
says that the body comes
equipped with light tubes,

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:14.270 align:middle line:10%
and this accounts for
cellular communication.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:17.450 align:middle line:10%
But none of this would be
understood by modern science

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:20.360 align:middle line:10%
if it weren't for the incredible
work of Dr. Jean-Claude

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.670 align:middle line:10%
Guimberteau.

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:25.640 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Jean-Claude Guimberteau
took a look inside the body

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.340 align:middle line:10%
with a microscope
to show that fascia

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.190 align:middle line:10%
is a fractal
communication mechanism.

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:34.460 align:middle line:84%
It can morph and change due
to the forces of gravity

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.110 align:middle line:90%
and the way our body moves.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:39.470 align:middle line:84%
It sends information
about all of our movements

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:41.930 align:middle line:84%
as well as photonic
information through it

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:45.590 align:middle line:84%
because in his footage that
he showed through his film

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:49.520 align:middle line:84%
"Strolling Under the Skin," it
shows that fascia is perfectly

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.590 align:middle line:90%
set up to be fiber optic.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:54.430 align:middle line:90%


00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:59.080 align:middle line:84%
Dr. James Oschman says that
fascia forms the largest system

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.605 align:middle line:84%
in the body as it is the system
that touches all other systems.

00:10:02.605 --> 00:10:05.240 align:middle line:90%


00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.610 align:middle line:84%
So for a communication
mechanism in the body,

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:09.115 align:middle line:90%
this is what we would want--

00:10:09.115 --> 00:10:12.580 align:middle line:84%
a light-speed communication
mechanism that touches

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.620 align:middle line:90%
every system inside the body.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:18.029 align:middle line:90%
[SOOTHING MUSIC]

00:10:18.029 --> 00:10:28.770 align:middle line:90%


00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:30.810 align:middle line:84%
There are even this
fascial component

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:33.030 align:middle line:84%
that you heard of earlier--
the microtubules that

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:34.590 align:middle line:90%
are in neurons.

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:36.900 align:middle line:84%
We also have neurons
in the heart,

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.070 align:middle line:90%
and microtubules exist there.

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:43.780 align:middle line:84%
We also have neurons in the gut,
and microtubules exist there.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.020 align:middle line:84%
So there is a fascial
component that touches

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:49.180 align:middle line:90%
every aspect of our body.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:52.170 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's take a look
at what this might mean.

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:56.130 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Stuart Hameroff-- he's an
anesthesiologist and a quantum

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:57.210 align:middle line:10%
theorist.

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:00.300 align:middle line:10%
He and his colleague
Sir Roger Penrose

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:04.140 align:middle line:10%
theorized that microtubules
are responsible for waking

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.950 align:middle line:10%
consciousness entering into
the Planck scale or the quantum

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:08.880 align:middle line:10%
realm.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.100 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
what Dr. Stuart Hameroff

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:16.416 align:middle line:84%
has to say on an episode called
"The Real What The Bleep."

00:11:16.416 --> 00:11:19.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Where does quantum coherence
occur in the brain is I think

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:19.800 align:middle line:10%
what you're asking?

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:24.550 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I would
say microtubules.

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:26.090 align:middle line:10%
So if you look
inside nerve cells--

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:28.090 align:middle line:10%
just if you look inside
our body, you see bones,

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:29.490 align:middle line:10%
OK, the skeleton.

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:31.800 align:middle line:10%
But the microtubules are
not only structural support,

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.633 align:middle line:10%
they're also the nervous
system of the cell.

00:11:33.633 --> 00:11:34.713 align:middle line:10%
They organize things.

00:11:34.713 --> 00:11:36.630 align:middle line:10%
They spacially and
temporally organize things.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:37.500 align:middle line:10%
They transport things.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.160 align:middle line:10%
They seem to be--

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.368 align:middle line:10%
>> Little computers of cells?

00:11:39.368 --> 00:11:40.790 align:middle line:10%
>> Onboard computers
of the cell.

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:41.590 align:middle line:10%
Exactly.

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:44.440 align:middle line:10%
And each nerve cell is
incredibly complicated.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.700 align:middle line:10%
If you think of a single
cell like a paramecium,

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.220 align:middle line:10%
you know, a little
protozoan, it swims around.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:50.720 align:middle line:10%
It bumps into
something, moves away.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.550 align:middle line:10%
It swims over here.

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:53.040 align:middle line:10%
It finds food.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.220 align:middle line:10%
It avoids predators.

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.020 align:middle line:10%
It finds a mate.

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:56.222 align:middle line:10%
It has sex.

00:11:56.222 --> 00:11:57.430 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't have any synapses.

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:58.530 align:middle line:10%
It's one cell.

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:00.900 align:middle line:10%
It uses its microtubules
and cytoskeleton

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.430 align:middle line:10%
as information processing
to do all these things.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:07.140 align:middle line:10%
And that's when I read Roger's
book about quantum computing.

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.680 align:middle line:10%
And I thought he might
have the mechanism,

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:10.920 align:middle line:10%
but I have the structure.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:15.620 align:middle line:10%
That microtubules were the
quantum-computing devices,

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:18.660 align:middle line:10%
and that quantum coherence
among the microtubules

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.000 align:middle line:10%
throughout neurons
in the brain were

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.795 align:middle line:10%
necessary for consciousness.

00:12:22.795 --> 00:12:24.695 align:middle line:90%
[SWOOSH]

00:12:24.695 --> 00:12:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's very interesting
about the quantum realm and how

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:30.280 align:middle line:90%
uniquely it behaves.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.830 align:middle line:84%
But does this mean that the
fascial component of the body,

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:38.280 align:middle line:84%
the very thing that gives
our architecture its form,

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.580 align:middle line:84%
actually decodes quantum
information and therefore,

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:44.910 align:middle line:84%
universal and
timeless information

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:47.130 align:middle line:90%
through the body at light speed.

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:50.490 align:middle line:84%
If you take a look at some of
the stories of ancient shamans,

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:52.680 align:middle line:84%
stories of them
being able to see

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.710 align:middle line:84%
inside the body of
somebody, see their illness

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:58.080 align:middle line:84%
and be able to
address it using means

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:02.640 align:middle line:84%
that are not understood in
our waking consciousness.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.460 align:middle line:84%
These shamans also being able
to walk between the worlds

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.950 align:middle line:84%
and bring back information
to this world that's

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:10.890 align:middle line:90%
truly valuable for the tribe.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, how did the shamans
enter this other realms

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:17.100 align:middle line:84%
where they would gather
information and bring it back?

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, Stuart Hameroff says
that psychedelic compounds--

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:24.420 align:middle line:84%
which were used commonly as
sacraments by shamans and other

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:27.040 align:middle line:84%
methods to enter this
very same realm--

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.580 align:middle line:84%
he said that these
psychedelic compounds

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:32.040 align:middle line:84%
have a very unique
structure to them.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And their structure allows them
to bind with the microtubules

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.350 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And what that does
is actually changes

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:43.410 align:middle line:84%
the information processing
of those microtubules.

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:47.160 align:middle line:84%
So the way our neurons
transport information

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.070 align:middle line:84%
changes due to
these psychedelics.

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you've ever read
any Aldous Huxley or Huston

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.600 align:middle line:84%
Smith where they
talk about opening

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.510 align:middle line:84%
the doors of perception,
this is exactly what

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:01.620 align:middle line:84%
a psychedelic or a shamanic
trance sounds like.

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:03.360 align:middle line:90%
The floodgates are opening.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.070 align:middle line:84%
All the information
that typically

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:07.110 align:middle line:84%
goes into our
subconscious mind that

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:11.200 align:middle line:84%
doesn't arrive at our conscious
mind starts opening up,

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.640 align:middle line:84%
and we become conscious of
floods of new information

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:20.010 align:middle line:84%
that's always there, but we
typically don't access it.

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:22.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want to take
you back in time

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:26.010 align:middle line:84%
to take a look at a Chinese
physician named Hua Tuo--

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:29.490 align:middle line:90%
roughly 120 to 200 AD.

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:33.180 align:middle line:84%
He was an anesthesiologist
much like Stuart Hameroff,

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:36.660 align:middle line:84%
but he was using
cannabis-infused wine.

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, cannabis is not
a classic psychedelic,

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.210 align:middle line:84%
but it does have the
very same structure

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:46.350 align:middle line:84%
as psychedelics do and also
bind with our microtubules

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:49.440 align:middle line:84%
to change the
information processing.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, the interesting thing
about this guy, Hua Tuo,

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.380 align:middle line:84%
is that he also discovered
several of the meridians

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:56.440 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.040 align:middle line:84%
If you have studied
traditional Chinese medicine

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.490 align:middle line:84%
or have seen charts of the
meridian system in the body,

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:05.730 align:middle line:84%
there are these lines that
run through the body in a very

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:09.520 align:middle line:84%
unique configuration, and
they transport energy.

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for
acupuncture and acupressure

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.930 align:middle line:84%
is if there is a blockage at
any one of these nodal points

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:19.140 align:middle line:84%
on that meridian, then
pressure or a needle

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:21.330 align:middle line:90%
is applied directly there.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.450 align:middle line:84%
The needle is twisted so
it binds with the fascia.

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And then the person receiving
the treatment breathes,

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:30.000 align:middle line:84%
relaxes, which is
known to actually relax

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.180 align:middle line:90%
the fascial system.

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:36.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you take a look
back at how the fascia runs

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:39.120 align:middle line:84%
through the body in those
unique configurations,

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:43.050 align:middle line:84%
modern researchers have put
those two charts side by side

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:46.290 align:middle line:84%
and found out that
there is an 80% to 98%

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:49.530 align:middle line:84%
correlation between
those ancient meridians

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:54.970 align:middle line:84%
of the movement of energy and
our modern myofascial system.

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:57.630 align:middle line:84%
This could revolutionize the way
we look at those treatments--

00:15:57.630 --> 00:15:59.580 align:middle line:90%
acupuncture and acupressure.

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Could they rightly be called
micro myofascial release?

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:09.060 align:middle line:84%
Myofascial release is
a form of body work.

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:12.330 align:middle line:84%
It may look to the untrained
eye like massage therapy,

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:13.440 align:middle line:90%
but it's not.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:17.370 align:middle line:84%
It's working on adding
pressure to a unique spot

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:19.620 align:middle line:90%
on the fascial train.

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Again, these trains run
the length of the body.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And if pressure is
applied at a unique spot,

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:30.030 align:middle line:84%
and the person receiving the
treatment breathes and relaxes,

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:34.900 align:middle line:84%
this will relax the entire
train of fascia along the body.

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.290 align:middle line:84%
Which means that
healing just might

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:41.220 align:middle line:84%
be the loosening up of those
tissues allowing for its fiber

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:43.440 align:middle line:84%
optic capacity to
come back so it

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:48.120 align:middle line:84%
can move energy impregnated with
information through the body.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.610 align:middle line:84%
That information has
to do with the trauma

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:53.940 align:middle line:84%
or the sedentary lifestyle
that has caused for that fascia

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:56.640 align:middle line:90%
to become stuck and stiff.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:00.530 align:middle line:10%
Albert Szent-Gyorgyi-- he is
a biochemist and a Nobel Prize

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:01.330 align:middle line:10%
winner.

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.770 align:middle line:84%
He said, "In every culture
and in every medical tradition

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:09.839 align:middle line:84%
before ours, healing was
accomplished by moving energy."

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what
we're talking about today.

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:15.540 align:middle line:84%
Because in those
older traditions,

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:18.849 align:middle line:84%
the shamans job was to keep
the health of the tribe.

00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:20.099 align:middle line:90%
It was to heal.

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:24.270 align:middle line:84%
So could the shaman, a skilled
traveler of this realm,

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:27.720 align:middle line:84%
not just read the
information there.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.690 align:middle line:84%
Could that shaman actually
influence the information

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:32.830 align:middle line:90%
at the quantum realm?

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:34.000 align:middle line:90%
It's a unique question.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.810 align:middle line:10%
But if we look back to the
double slit experiment showing

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:42.620 align:middle line:10%
how the observer
of the experiment

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:45.470 align:middle line:10%
actually changes the
behavior of the photons

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:48.020 align:middle line:10%
that they're witnessing
meaning everyone, even

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:50.000 align:middle line:10%
those scientists,
their consciousness

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000 align:middle line:10%
was changing quantum
scale phenomena.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.150 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, if a shaman
was highly skilled,

00:17:56.150 --> 00:18:01.440 align:middle line:84%
they would be able to augment
or alter quantum information.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And this goes right back to
what Stuart Hameroff was saying.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:06.950 align:middle line:84%
The quantum realm
is the realm where

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:08.825 align:middle line:90%
you create your own reality.

00:18:08.825 --> 00:18:11.360 align:middle line:90%


00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.800 align:middle line:84%
So there are a bunch of
older modalities of movement,

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:18.500 align:middle line:84%
and every one of them are
truly a spiritual modality.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:20.650 align:middle line:84%
It's a form of linking
the body and the mind

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:24.190 align:middle line:84%
together with the
breath and over time,

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:27.970 align:middle line:84%
incrementally, building back the
proper way that the body should

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:31.820 align:middle line:84%
move and how the body should
breathe as it's moving

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:35.320 align:middle line:84%
and a good way to calm and
focus the mind so clarity

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.590 align:middle line:84%
on our real path in
life will open up.

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:42.730 align:middle line:84%
These modalities like Tai
Chi, yoga, martial arts,

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.370 align:middle line:84%
shamanic dance, the
whirling dervishes,

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:47.060 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:49.755 align:middle line:84%
All of this comes from
the ancient world.

00:18:49.755 --> 00:18:51.130 align:middle line:84%
But the ancient
world didn't know

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:53.890 align:middle line:84%
about the modern stressors
and the sedentary society

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:56.090 align:middle line:90%
that we live amongst today.

00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:58.930 align:middle line:90%
So we need a modern approach.

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And by far, my favorite
is Functional Patterns.

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Founded by Naudi Aguilar,
Functional Patterns

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:07.520 align:middle line:90%
is not an exercise routine.

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.770 align:middle line:90%
I've trained with him.

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:14.680 align:middle line:10%
It's truly working on how our
body integrates with gravity

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:18.070 align:middle line:10%
and becomes harmonious
with whatever environment

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:20.620 align:middle line:10%
we are forced to live within.

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:25.330 align:middle line:10%
And Naudi Aguilar is aptly
coined the MyoHacker.

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.120 align:middle line:84%
He's hacking into
the myofascial system

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:31.210 align:middle line:84%
because he believes the most
important aspect of our body

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:34.780 align:middle line:84%
is how supple, how
soft, and how healthy

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:39.130 align:middle line:90%
our fascial system truly is.

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to hand it off to
a man that I truly respect,

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:45.610 align:middle line:84%
that's been through
many years of discipline

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:48.700 align:middle line:84%
with his body and his
mind, being martial arts,

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.560 align:middle line:90%
and a spiritual path.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:53.980 align:middle line:10%
Foster and his wife Kimberly
made the "Thrive" movie

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:56.170 align:middle line:10%
and also the Thrive movement.

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:59.260 align:middle line:10%
Let's take a look at an
episode with Regina Meredith

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:03.661 align:middle line:10%
called Foster Gamble
on the Thrive movement.

00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:07.810 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm clear from both my
science and from my spiritual

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:11.440 align:middle line:10%
pursuits that what we
think of as ourselves,

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:14.230 align:middle line:10%
this body or this particular
personality or whatever,

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:16.510 align:middle line:10%
is simply part of an
infinite continuum.

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:18.560 align:middle line:10%
Like you said-- as
above, so below.

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:22.690 align:middle line:10%
And as we learn to clear our
channel, which is basically

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:26.410 align:middle line:10%
just relaxing our body, letting
the emotions flow clearly,

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:28.600 align:middle line:10%
and then both opening
and focusing the mind

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.360 align:middle line:10%
simultaneously, gateways open.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.300 align:middle line:10%
And then if you don't
violate the process,

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:37.890 align:middle line:10%
you can ask for guidance in all
different aspects of your life.

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:39.850 align:middle line:10%
And, you know,
most people hearing

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:42.490 align:middle line:10%
this will be going,
yeah, I know that

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:44.360 align:middle line:10%
from my own personal experience.

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:49.120 align:middle line:10%
And I think this is the whole
next frontier is not only

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:50.890 align:middle line:10%
out in space and
the other beings

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:53.660 align:middle line:10%
that we're meeting there
but also in inner space.

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:56.620 align:middle line:10%
And those two are really one
because I think even the outer

00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:00.760 align:middle line:10%
space travel and most of our
ET contact is primarily going

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.395 align:middle line:10%
on-- as [INAUDIBLE] says--

00:21:02.395 --> 00:21:06.830 align:middle line:10%
at simply different
frequency levels.

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:10.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you so much, Foster,
for exactly how you said that.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And that really brings me
back to the original question

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.020 align:middle line:90%
that I had for you--

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:18.950 align:middle line:84%
this human architecture,
what is it built for?

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:22.490 align:middle line:84%
What kind of environment
will it thrive in?

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:26.000 align:middle line:90%
What can we be harmonious with?

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.160 align:middle line:10%
Well, if you look at the
work of Chris Kresser

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:31.040 align:middle line:10%
and his book called "An
Unconventional Medicine,"

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:34.250 align:middle line:10%
he took a look at genetics
and said that roughly only 5%

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:38.960 align:middle line:10%
of our genes have updated since
hunter-gatherer times meaning

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.870 align:middle line:10%
our genes are more
equipped to operate

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:45.410 align:middle line:10%
within the environments,
the natural settings

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:48.170 align:middle line:10%
that our ancestors moved within.

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:51.500 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look
at natural settings.

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:56.330 align:middle line:84%
All the rich dynamics,
the uneven ground,

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:59.840 align:middle line:84%
the ever-changing
landscape of it,

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:03.620 align:middle line:84%
even the microbes in the
soil that are good for us,

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:06.860 align:middle line:84%
the negative ions in the
air that we're breathing,

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:11.020 align:middle line:84%
we were built for
this environment.

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:14.380 align:middle line:84%
We were built to move
within the natural settings

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.450 align:middle line:84%
and the natural
beauty of the Earth.

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:20.300 align:middle line:90%


00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.660 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to take you
back to that first statement

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:25.320 align:middle line:90%
that Morihei Ueshiba said.

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.210 align:middle line:84%
He said a good
stance and posture

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:30.060 align:middle line:90%
reflect a proper state of mind.

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, I believe the most proper
state of mind we can have is

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:37.680 align:middle line:84%
in reverence to the earth, this
thing that connects us all,

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:41.100 align:middle line:84%
the reason why we have food
to eat, water to drink,

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.770 align:middle line:84%
air to breathe, and
protection around us.

00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:46.510 align:middle line:90%


00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:48.910 align:middle line:90%
This Earth is the gift of life.

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:53.150 align:middle line:90%


00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:59.570 align:middle line:10%
And even Ravi Zacharias said
warship is a posture of life.

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:02.690 align:middle line:84%
So by giving thanks,
by giving our love

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:06.230 align:middle line:84%
and our appreciation to the
very earth that we live upon

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:09.980 align:middle line:84%
may be exactly what our
natural human architecture

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:11.000 align:middle line:90%
was built for.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.455 align:middle line:90%
[NATURE SOUNDS]

00:23:13.455 --> 00:23:21.292 align:middle line:90%


00:23:21.292 --> 00:23:23.750 align:middle line:84%
So I usually give you guys some
challenges for the upcoming

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:24.550 align:middle line:90%
week.

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:26.570 align:middle line:84%
But today, I'm going to
give you some materials

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:29.600 align:middle line:84%
that you can look into to deepen
your understanding of what

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.320 align:middle line:90%
I've been talking about today.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.860 align:middle line:84%
The first is a book by
Naudi Aguilar, the guy

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:35.390 align:middle line:90%
from Functional Patterns.

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:37.520 align:middle line:84%
His book is called
"The Power of Posture,"

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:41.060 align:middle line:84%
and it revolutionized the
way that I look at posture.

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:43.640 align:middle line:90%
The second is Katy Bowman.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.340 align:middle line:90%
Now, she wrote two books--

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.710 align:middle line:84%
"Move Your DNA" and
"Movement Matters."

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:50.870 align:middle line:84%
But aside from this,
one of the things

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:53.090 align:middle line:84%
that caught me in a
YouTube video of hers

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:57.050 align:middle line:84%
was showing the importance of
walking barefoot in nature.

00:23:57.050 --> 00:23:59.690 align:middle line:84%
It's truly remarkable what
it can do for your spirit,

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:02.960 align:middle line:84%
but it also is amazing how
much rich and nourishing

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:07.730 align:middle line:84%
information floods through the
body when you do this exercise.

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And lastly, "Holotropic
Breathing" from Stanislav Grof.

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.870 align:middle line:10%
Stanislav Grof was one
of the original people

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:17.990 align:middle line:10%
to start studying LSD and
the effects of psychedelics

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:19.550 align:middle line:10%
on consciousness.

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:23.870 align:middle line:10%
And after five decades of
it, he crafted another way

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:28.080 align:middle line:10%
to enter that same state
simply through breathing.

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:30.440 align:middle line:10%
If you want to understand
more of the quantum realm,

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:33.740 align:middle line:10%
I highly recommend you check
out "Holotropic Breathing"

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:37.260 align:middle line:10%
and learn how to enter the
state with that simple hack--

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:38.060 align:middle line:10%
your breath.

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.980 align:middle line:10%


00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:45.560 align:middle line:10%
So I invite you to take a walk
in the woods with no shoes on.

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:49.990 align:middle line:10%
Really feel the earth,
connect with nature once more,

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:52.340 align:middle line:10%
and see how that
changes your life.

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:55.230 align:middle line:84%
Do that this week, and I'll
see you next time around

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:56.030 align:middle line:90%
on "Limitless."
