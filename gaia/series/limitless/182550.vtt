>> Have you ever had the notion
that you could run on 100% all

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.980 align:middle line:84%
the time or skate through
life without slowing down?

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.370 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the real path to
unlocking our hidden potential

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.610 align:middle line:84%
requires us to take a step
back every now and then

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.050 align:middle line:90%
and take a much needed breath.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.495 align:middle line:90%

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.220 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back to "Limitless."

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.650 align:middle line:10%
Today, we're talking about an
extremely crucial part but also

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.860 align:middle line:10%
a very forgotten aspect of
unlocking our hidden potential.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And that is forgiveness
and self-care.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.390 align:middle line:90%
I like what Anne Lamot said.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.910 align:middle line:84%
"Everything will work
again if you unplug it

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.480 align:middle line:84%
for a few minutes,
including you."

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Everything you do all
moments of the day

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.870 align:middle line:84%
are taking some kind
of toll on the body.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.740 align:middle line:84%
Breathing, resting,
even relaxing,

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.310 align:middle line:90%
you're resisting gravity.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.980 align:middle line:90%
You're metabolizing.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.220 align:middle line:10%
And all of this has a certain
form of upkeep that it needs.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.680 align:middle line:84%
Things are always
going on regardless

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.790 align:middle line:84%
of how much effort you think
you're putting into the moment.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And all those moments truly
take a little bit of time,

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.080 align:middle line:84%
at least a little bit of
upkeep, to replenish ourselves.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Even psychological
events, as much

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.460 align:middle line:84%
as we think that it's not
physical, it's not material.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.500 align:middle line:90%
It shouldn't matter.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.140 align:middle line:84%
But psychological
events also take time

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.220 align:middle line:90%
to integrate themselves.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.860 align:middle line:84%
So we need to give
ourselves this time.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.650 align:middle line:90%
This is self-care.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.170 align:middle line:84%
The real essence
of self, I believe,

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.540 align:middle line:90%
is finding that inner parent.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.095 align:middle line:84%
We've seen that
parent in action.

00:01:55.095 --> 00:01:56.470 align:middle line:84%
We've seen the
love that they can

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.442 align:middle line:84%
bring to the moment, the
understanding, the tenderness.

00:02:00.442 --> 00:02:01.900 align:middle line:10%
Well, this is what
we need to bring

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.840 align:middle line:10%
to our bodies and our
minds, viewing them

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.460 align:middle line:10%
as our own children, loving
them, allowing them to be

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.280 align:middle line:10%
exactly who and what they are.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.350 align:middle line:84%
Force is not required
in these moments.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.070 align:middle line:84%
In fact, force will
harm that process.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.820 align:middle line:84%
So only time, real presence
in that time, and real care

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.620 align:middle line:90%
is needed.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.060 align:middle line:90%


00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.190 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people in
this world today

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.590 align:middle line:84%
think self-care is
a luxury, something

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.830 align:middle line:84%
that when you have a vacation
or enough money, then

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.090 align:middle line:90%
you can focus on self-care.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.520 align:middle line:90%
This is not true.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.010 align:middle line:84%
Self-care is essential
for our baseline health.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.590 align:middle line:90%
And I'll show you how.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.180 align:middle line:90%
We've all heard of stress.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.170 align:middle line:84%
We've even talked
about it on this show.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.410 align:middle line:90%
What are the effects of stress?

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.200 align:middle line:84%
Most people in developed
countries experience stress.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.830 align:middle line:84%
In fact, 3/4 of
American citizens

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.600 align:middle line:84%
say they experience
stress every single month.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.730 align:middle line:84%
One third of Americans say
they experience extreme stress.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And the leading
cause of this stress

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.680 align:middle line:90%
is seen as money and work.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.210 align:middle line:10%
Going even deeper, workplace
stress costs $300 billion

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.100 align:middle line:10%
a year in health care
annually in the US alone.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.490 align:middle line:84%
Roughly half the population
says that they experience

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.890 align:middle line:84%
restlessness,
staying up at night

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.050 align:middle line:84%
not being able to
sleep simply because

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.510 align:middle line:90%
of how stressed they are.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And this has led to roughly
50 million prescriptions

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.210 align:middle line:84%
in 2008 being filled for
sleeping pills like Ambien

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.410 align:middle line:84%
or $600 million being spent
on things like melatonin

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.680 align:middle line:84%
or valerian root just to
help people try to get back

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.400 align:middle line:84%
to center, just so
they can sleep and face

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.230 align:middle line:90%
another day of work.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.240 align:middle line:84%
This is how stressful
it's becoming.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.040 align:middle line:10%
In fact, in very real
terms, stress and not

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.590 align:middle line:10%
being able to
recover from burnout

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.170 align:middle line:10%
has reached epidemic levels
in the US and the UK.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.870 align:middle line:90%


00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.970 align:middle line:84%
But this is the
world we live in.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.300 align:middle line:90%
This is 21st century normal.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.570 align:middle line:84%
We can't avoid this
economic rat race.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.089 align:middle line:90%
It's inevitable, right?

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:22.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, what I aim to
show you is that there

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.060 align:middle line:84%
are ways that we can alleviate
stress and still stay just

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.510 align:middle line:90%
as productive.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.020 align:middle line:84%
There are very simple
hacks or tools.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And then there are very
involved hacks and tools.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.250 align:middle line:90%
And I'll share both with you.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.580 align:middle line:84%
But these tools are meant
to be seamlessly integrated

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.320 align:middle line:90%
into your day.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.510 align:middle line:84%
This first method that
we're going to show you

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.980 align:middle line:84%
is very simple, very easy, and
it creates a chemistry shift

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.340 align:middle line:84%
in your body that is very
similar to that which,

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.960 align:middle line:84%
if you were ever held or coddled
and nurtured as a little child,

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.720 align:middle line:84%
those chemicals that flooded
through your body back then

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.390 align:middle line:84%
are the same that this
self-care routine will

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.700 align:middle line:90%
help your body get back to.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.320 align:middle line:84%
But I won't be
showing it to you.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.170 align:middle line:10%
It'll be Dr. Mario
Martinez in an episode

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.010 align:middle line:10%
of "Inspirations" with Lisa Garr
called Rewriting the Genetic

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.270 align:middle line:10%
Code.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.950 align:middle line:10%
>> I had a Tibetan Lama teacher
who taught me the technique.

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.170 align:middle line:10%
In their world, it's moving the
chi, moving the energy around.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.750 align:middle line:10%
In our world, you're
actually creating immunity,

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.150 align:middle line:10%
and you're creating
some kinds of changes

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.620 align:middle line:10%
in your endocrine system.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.412 align:middle line:10%
So we have a lot to
learn from their ways.

00:05:27.412 --> 00:05:29.120 align:middle line:10%
And they have a lot
to learn from us too.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.910 align:middle line:10%
We've taught them what we
can do with functional MRIs

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.070 align:middle line:10%
and how the brain
shifts and all that.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.810 align:middle line:10%
But basically, what
they're doing is

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.068 align:middle line:10%
they're moving, creating,
what they call chi.

00:05:38.068 --> 00:05:39.110 align:middle line:90%
Put your hands like this.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And you're creating a
sense of cohesiveness.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.300 align:middle line:90%
And you could call it chi.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.170 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.420 align:middle line:90%
You do this for a few minutes.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And then what you do is
you put your arms gently

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.470 align:middle line:84%
over your shoulder crossed and
then go forward nine times.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to begin to feel

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.120 align:middle line:90%
some movement, some warmth.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:02.350 align:middle line:10%
And then after 9, 10 times,
then you go backwards like that.

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And then after you
finish, you stop and then

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.540 align:middle line:90%
feel what's happened.

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.220 align:middle line:84%
Feel what's happened with--
you feel some energy change.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.920 align:middle line:84%
Now what have you done
psychoneuroimmunologically?

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.345 align:middle line:84%
First, you created
a placebo effect.

00:06:14.345 --> 00:06:15.970 align:middle line:10%
This is something
that's going to work.

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:20.150 align:middle line:10%
Second, the touching
releases some--

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Oxytocin.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Oxytocin and all kinds of
other things that are going on.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.850 align:middle line:10%
You're beginning to feel the
effect of when your grandmother

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:28.990 align:middle line:10%
touched you and loved you.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.150 align:middle line:10%
And so all of that
has a healing effect.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.640 align:middle line:10%
Psychoneuroimmunologically
it has a healing effect.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.810 align:middle line:10%
But the Tibetans
know how to do it.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.670 align:middle line:10%
But they don't know the
biochemistry behind it.

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:39.470 align:middle line:10%
And you do it.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:40.300 align:middle line:10%
And it works.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.770 align:middle line:10%
And there's a
method that I teach.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.810 align:middle line:10%
It's not just an
intellectual process.

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.030 align:middle line:10%
You have to find out
what wound it cost.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.730 align:middle line:10%
Because across cultures, I found
that there are three wounds.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.280 align:middle line:84%
I call them archetypal
wounds because you see them

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.720 align:middle line:84%
in every culture, shame,
abandonment, and betrayal.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.590 align:middle line:10%
So you have to find out
if somebody was predatory

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:00.820 align:middle line:10%
with you, what did they do?

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:01.947 align:middle line:90%
Did they abandon you?

00:07:01.947 --> 00:07:02.780 align:middle line:90%
Did they betray you?

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:02.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Betray you, right.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Or did they shame you?

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And each of them has a
different biochemical process.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.040 align:middle line:10%
Shame has a lot of inflammatory.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.900 align:middle line:84%
Many of autoimmune
illnesses have

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.340 align:middle line:90%
some kind of a shame trauma.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.730 align:middle line:90%


00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.770 align:middle line:84%
>> So what I gather from
this is we are the medicine.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.770 align:middle line:84%
The medicine is
within us as if there

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:26.830 align:middle line:84%
is a pharmaceutical
dealer inside of us

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:32.620 align:middle line:84%
that every time we decide
to show shame, guilt, fear,

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.940 align:middle line:84%
anxiety, that there is a unique
chemical cocktail that it will

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.070 align:middle line:84%
produce and flood
through the system,

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.500 align:middle line:84%
setting off biological
processes that

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.310 align:middle line:84%
are hazardous to our
body and our mind.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And truthfully, self-care
is a feminine quality.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.200 align:middle line:90%
It's very receptive.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.910 align:middle line:90%
You're listening to your body.

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:54.430 align:middle line:84%
You're allowing your
body to express itself

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:57.670 align:middle line:84%
the way that it wants to,
not conditioned by culture

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:00.430 align:middle line:84%
or society, but
simply being what

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:02.740 align:middle line:90%
it wishes to be in the moment.

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.210 align:middle line:90%
And you're listening to that.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:06.490 align:middle line:84%
That's the feminine
quality of it.

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:10.030 align:middle line:84%
One aspect of this is being able
to take a little bit of time

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:14.080 align:middle line:84%
away from work or the
stressors in your life

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.970 align:middle line:84%
to be able to gain
some perspective,

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:19.450 align:middle line:84%
put things in a perspective
so you can understand

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:21.370 align:middle line:90%
what is this all in service to?

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:24.760 align:middle line:84%
Why am I working so
hard to begin with?

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.240 align:middle line:90%
This is very important.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And also a very crucial
aspect to self-care

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:33.370 align:middle line:84%
is being able to ask very,
relevant poignant questions,

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:36.850 align:middle line:84%
but then being silent
enough, patient enough,

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:42.100 align:middle line:84%
inquisitive enough to listen
for how your body might respond

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:45.400 align:middle line:84%
because you can't assume that
you know how your body speaks.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.760 align:middle line:84%
We've gotten into this
in this series before.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.830 align:middle line:84%
So what we're doing
to enter into a deeper

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:54.100 align:middle line:84%
relationship with our body
so we can bring it the love

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:58.030 align:middle line:84%
and nurturing that it needs
is to ask relevant questions.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:00.950 align:middle line:90%
What do you need?

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.530 align:middle line:84%
What's happening
inside you right now?

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:05.480 align:middle line:90%
What can I do for you?

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And then once you
ask those questions,

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:12.010 align:middle line:84%
giving yourself the space,
the time, and the silence

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:16.790 align:middle line:84%
to be able to listen for
how your body might respond.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:19.330 align:middle line:84%
Here's one way to put this
into action immediately.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:22.270 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the quickest,
fastest biohacking tool

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.680 align:middle line:90%
you will ever find.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And it changes your
chemistry within minutes.

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:29.430 align:middle line:90%
It's a simple smile.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.530 align:middle line:84%
If you smile in the mirror
for a couple minutes,

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.060 align:middle line:90%
it will change your chemistry.

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:35.250 align:middle line:90%
You will feel happier.

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:39.360 align:middle line:84%
But it may not be that
easy to see at first.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.740 align:middle line:90%
You may have to really try.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:45.190 align:middle line:84%
So this is where you put
that listening into action.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:46.920 align:middle line:90%
You give yourself a smile.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.420 align:middle line:90%
You smile in that mirror.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.770 align:middle line:84%
Try and make it as
authentic as possible.

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:54.240 align:middle line:84%
Think of things that make you
happy, make you feel content

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.680 align:middle line:90%
and fulfilled.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:00.150 align:middle line:84%
Smile and then listen
for how the body responds

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:01.710 align:middle line:84%
to that little
self-care routine.

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:05.240 align:middle line:90%


00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And if you think you can't,
if you think you can't smile,

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.470 align:middle line:84%
it's too hard, the stresses
of the day are too much,

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:13.690 align:middle line:84%
then I invite you to
take into consideration

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:15.820 align:middle line:90%
what Thich Nhat Hanh said.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:19.540 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Sometimes, your joy
is the source of your smile.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:24.928 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, your smile can
be the source of your joy."

00:10:24.928 --> 00:10:27.220 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to move on to
the next self-care routine.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And I believe this is
probably the most important

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:34.500 align:middle line:84%
self-care routine
you can abide by.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:38.010 align:middle line:90%
And it's forgiveness.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:40.970 align:middle line:84%
So to put forgiveness
into a better context,

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:42.770 align:middle line:84%
better than I could,
I'll throw it off

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:46.310 align:middle line:84%
to Stephen and Ondrea Levine
on an episode of "Omega" called

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:47.480 align:middle line:90%
Relationship--

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:51.140 align:middle line:90%
A Pathway to Self-Discovery.

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:54.170 align:middle line:10%
>> So we will talk to a group
to just to display to them how

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.150 align:middle line:10%
much we hold on
to our suffering,

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.670 align:middle line:10%
how much our wound
is our identity.

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:01.430 align:middle line:10%
We'll say to a group, now
everyone in this group

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:04.910 align:middle line:10%
is forgiven for everything
they've ever done.

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:07.550 align:middle line:10%
And it's true for the
people who are watching.

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:12.020 align:middle line:10%
You are forgiven for
everything you have ever done.

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:15.050 align:middle line:10%
Every miscreant act, every
moment of foolishness,

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.870 align:middle line:10%
of forgetfulness,
you're forgiven.

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:19.970 align:middle line:10%
And you'll see the
group start to smile.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:21.620 align:middle line:10%
And then you'll
feel that hardness,

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:25.430 align:middle line:10%
that hardness in the belly,
that grimness in the jaw.

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:29.450 align:middle line:10%
You can see how people are
so reluctant to relieve

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:32.750 align:middle line:10%
themselves, to release that
suffering of their guilt.

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:34.850 align:middle line:10%
They start to think who
are you to forgive me?

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:38.190 align:middle line:10%
They resist forgiveness
at every level.

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:40.700 align:middle line:10%
We resist letting
go of our pain.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.830 align:middle line:10%
We think we are our pain.

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:44.930 align:middle line:10%
And then we bring
that identity of I

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:46.750 align:middle line:10%
am my pain to a relationship.

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:48.650 align:middle line:10%
So you have twice
as much pain instead

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:52.020 align:middle line:10%
of twice as much healing.

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:55.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Twain once said,
"Forgiveness is the fragrance

00:11:55.560 --> 00:12:00.120 align:middle line:84%
that a violet sheds on the
heel that has crushed it."

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.670 align:middle line:90%
That's very beautiful.

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And what I believe that
means is forgiveness

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:07.650 align:middle line:84%
is something that is crucial
in our self-care routine

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:10.350 align:middle line:84%
regardless of what we're
forgiving, regardless

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:14.520 align:middle line:84%
of the harm that was
brought to us or others.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.640 align:middle line:84%
So why is it that we
hold onto so much pain?

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.200 align:middle line:84%
We have all this
pain from things

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.850 align:middle line:84%
that we could have
done better, things

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:24.960 align:middle line:84%
that we wish we would have done,
wish we would have not done.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.430 align:middle line:90%
And all this pain adds up.

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And we hold it like
bags of bricks.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.010 align:middle line:90%
But why do we hold it?

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:34.720 align:middle line:90%
Why do we not just set it down?

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.080 align:middle line:84%
What is it about our
pain that we have not

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.410 align:middle line:90%
learned enough from yet?

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:42.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'd like to give
you a quote from Arnold

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.530 align:middle line:90%
Schwarzenegger.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:45.900 align:middle line:84%
"The pain that
you hold is yours.

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.550 align:middle line:84%
There is not a single
pain quite like it.

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Nobody else on God's green
earth can feel this pain

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.210 align:middle line:84%
or have the indescribable
feeling of pride you

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:57.330 align:middle line:90%
will have when you overcome it.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.760 align:middle line:90%
This pain is not your curse.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.580 align:middle line:90%
This pain is your privilege."

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.360 align:middle line:90%
Very good point.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.850 align:middle line:90%
Our pain is not just our own.

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:09.540 align:middle line:84%
We're not the only ones who
have to deal with our pain.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.600 align:middle line:84%
We live in an
interconnected world.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:16.990 align:middle line:84%
Our pain shows up in our
relationships, friends, family,

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.920 align:middle line:84%
loved ones, colleagues,
you name it.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:24.690 align:middle line:84%
Our pain cannot truly be hidden
as much as we think it can.

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:28.500 align:middle line:84%
So trying to hold on to
this pain does not serve us.

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.470 align:middle line:84%
It is not part of
our human potential.

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:34.110 align:middle line:84%
We should learn how
to set the pain down.

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:37.690 align:middle line:90%


00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:40.720 align:middle line:84%
So to do this, I want to show
you an episode of "Waking

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.345 align:middle line:90%
Infinity."

00:13:42.345 --> 00:13:43.720 align:middle line:84%
I was traveling
around the world,

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.720 align:middle line:84%
and I interviewed this
beautiful couple, Foster

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.310 align:middle line:90%
and Kimberly Gamble.

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:50.680 align:middle line:10%
It's not all the things that
they're doing in the world.

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.230 align:middle line:10%
It's not all the great
attitudes that they

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:56.320 align:middle line:10%
can bring to other people's
minds through their art.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.400 align:middle line:10%
It's their relationship.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:01.360 align:middle line:10%
It's the bedrock of
everything they do.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.810 align:middle line:10%
>> And I've just come to realize
that I am way more eloquent,

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:06.820 align:middle line:10%
more effective in my
artistic expression,

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:09.130 align:middle line:10%
when I'm in co-creative
partnership with Kimberly than

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:10.480 align:middle line:10%
I would be on my own.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.630 align:middle line:10%
And she's said the same.

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:14.770 align:middle line:10%
And I think that really speaks
to the dynamic of synergy

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:17.515 align:middle line:10%
where the whole is way more
than the sum of the parts.

00:14:17.515 --> 00:14:19.390 align:middle line:10%
And I think that's a
lot of what we're seeing

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:20.500 align:middle line:10%
going on in the world now.

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.470 align:middle line:10%
As people are more and
more working on themselves

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:25.840 align:middle line:10%
and fulfilling their own
potential more and more

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.880 align:middle line:10%
as an individual,
they're naturally

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:31.150 align:middle line:10%
finding other partners
who are doing the same.

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:33.250 align:middle line:10%
And the next level
of fulfillment

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:36.040 align:middle line:10%
is in co-creative partnership
so that the communication

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.550 align:middle line:10%
is a total process.

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:40.408 align:middle line:10%
It actually is
whole and complete.

00:14:40.408 --> 00:14:41.825 align:middle line:84%
And that was
absolutely invaluable

00:14:41.825 --> 00:14:44.860 align:middle line:84%
and I think one of the reasons
why THRIVE has gone so viral.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.890 align:middle line:90%


00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:49.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I find their
words so beautiful.

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And truly, self-care, it's
enhanced in our relationships.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:59.140 align:middle line:84%
Trying to do it solo and
alone doesn't work nearly

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:03.350 align:middle line:84%
as well as it does when we are
in some kind of, as Foster put

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:06.010 align:middle line:90%
it, co-creative partnership.

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:07.960 align:middle line:84%
These kinds of
relationships deeply

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:11.270 align:middle line:90%
mirror us from the inside out.

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:14.920 align:middle line:84%
They also help us renew,
rejuvenate, refresh,

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:19.450 align:middle line:84%
spark new ideas, come up
with solutions to obstacles

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:21.730 align:middle line:84%
that we couldn't come
up with on our own.

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:24.230 align:middle line:84%
That's the beauty
of relationships.

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:26.920 align:middle line:84%
But it does not have to
be a love relationship

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.990 align:middle line:90%
or an intimate relationship.

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:33.760 align:middle line:84%
Any kind of relationship truly
works because all relationships

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:34.900 align:middle line:90%
are mirrors.

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.690 align:middle line:84%
They show us who we
are, how we behave

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:41.350 align:middle line:84%
in public, when our
thoughts are on or off, how

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:43.300 align:middle line:90%
we're conducting ourselves.

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.970 align:middle line:84%
They bring our minds
to our deepest ills

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:49.570 align:middle line:84%
or to our greatest joys
so we can understand who

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:50.560 align:middle line:90%
and what we are better.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:55.020 align:middle line:90%


00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.450 align:middle line:84%
People do wish to
see you at your best.

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:01.290 align:middle line:84%
It inspires others when
you are at your best.

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:05.040 align:middle line:84%
But if you're around loved
ones and you just cannot bring

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:08.970 align:middle line:84%
your A game to that moment,
there is no reason to just

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:10.260 align:middle line:90%
throw it all away.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.910 align:middle line:84%
If you can't bring your A
game to your loved ones,

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:14.520 align:middle line:90%
just bring your B game.

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:15.870 align:middle line:90%
They'll forgive you.

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:17.040 align:middle line:90%
They love you.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is a way to show
them that despite your stress,

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:24.120 align:middle line:84%
despite all that's going
on, you love them too.

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very crucial
aspect to self-care,

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.400 align:middle line:84%
not just loving
yourself, but learning

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:33.810 align:middle line:84%
how to love others
and let them love you.

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:38.380 align:middle line:84%
Truly, what we're talking about
is coming home in our skin,

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:42.030 align:middle line:84%
whether we're at the party
surrounded by people or alone

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:43.860 align:middle line:90%
in wilderness.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:48.800 align:middle line:84%
Home is where you feel
comfortable in your skin.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.850 align:middle line:84%
So here's some questions
that I invite you to ponder.

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Are there situations in your
life where you feel you cannot

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:59.120 align:middle line:90%
fully express yourself?

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.910 align:middle line:84%
Are there times where you feel
like you can't be yourself

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:04.280 align:middle line:84%
because of the people
that are around?

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:08.180 align:middle line:84%
You're not allowed
to be truthfully you?

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:12.109 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel like you love
losing yourself in crowds

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:15.380 align:middle line:90%
or hiding yourself in solitude?

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:18.619 align:middle line:84%
And finally, do you feel
comfortable and confident

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:19.540 align:middle line:90%
in your own skin?

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:23.339 align:middle line:90%


00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:27.170 align:middle line:84%
Use these questions to
spark a little self-inquiry

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:30.310 align:middle line:90%
and listen for a response.

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Now I'd like to take
it to an interview

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.380 align:middle line:90%
with a guy named Naudi Aguilar.

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:37.380 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed him, and I've
spoken about him before.

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:39.180 align:middle line:90%
He founded Functional Patterns.

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:41.730 align:middle line:84%
It's a way of moving
your body and integrating

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:43.860 align:middle line:84%
with your environment
seamlessly.

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.110 align:middle line:84%
But what he's talking
about has nothing

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:51.330 align:middle line:84%
to do with exercising or
even moving your body.

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:53.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Are you really trying to push
your limits as a human being

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:54.720 align:middle line:10%
on this planet?

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.990 align:middle line:10%
And that's not doing
some stupid back bend.

00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:59.520 align:middle line:10%
That's not doing some
useless handstand.

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.380 align:middle line:10%
It's ultimately
coming down to can I

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.770 align:middle line:10%
be OK with myself not feeling
like I have to prove myself

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:06.153 align:middle line:10%
to other people?

00:18:06.153 --> 00:18:08.070 align:middle line:10%
That's the real-- that's
the deeper undertones

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:09.367 align:middle line:10%
about Functional Patterns.

00:18:09.367 --> 00:18:10.950 align:middle line:84%
I think it was World
War I, they had--

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:13.170 align:middle line:84%
they wanted to send I think
supplies across the battlefield

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:14.280 align:middle line:90%
through these horses.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And these horses started
screaming anytime

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.372 align:middle line:90%
they'd start hearing the bombs.

00:18:17.372 --> 00:18:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And then they'd run right back
to where they were coming from.

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:24.060 align:middle line:10%
And the soldiers were like,
well, we can't be having this.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:25.923 align:middle line:84%
So let's tear out
their voice boxes.

00:18:25.923 --> 00:18:27.340 align:middle line:84%
So that way they're
not screaming,

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.250 align:middle line:84%
and they're not neighing,
then in that regard,

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:30.708 align:middle line:84%
they're just going
to keep running.

00:18:30.708 --> 00:18:32.058 align:middle line:10%
That's our logic.

00:18:32.058 --> 00:18:33.100 align:middle line:10%
Let's put it to the test.

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:34.680 align:middle line:10%
They go out onto
the battlefield.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.640 align:middle line:10%
The horses can't neigh.

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.990 align:middle line:10%
They all die of a heart attack.

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:41.770 align:middle line:10%
What does that particularly
mean for the human species?

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:43.840 align:middle line:10%
If you're not able to
fully express yourself,

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:46.510 align:middle line:10%
are you slowly giving
yourself a heart attack?

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Are you slowly destroying
your physiology?

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a very good point
about the real purpose of being

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:57.950 align:middle line:84%
able to express ourselves
and how important it is.

00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And this doesn't just float
around movement camps.

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:04.760 align:middle line:84%
It also goes all the way back
to the beginning of psychology

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:08.230 align:middle line:84%
to Sigmund Freud who said,
"Unexpressed emotions will

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:09.360 align:middle line:90%
never die.

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:14.660 align:middle line:84%
They're buried alive and will
come forth in uglier ways."

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:18.140 align:middle line:84%
And Oscar Wilde said
it even more pointedly.

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:21.890 align:middle line:84%
"The purpose of life
is self-expression."

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:24.330 align:middle line:84%
So how do we put
this into action?

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:28.290 align:middle line:84%
How do we truly bring all of
this into our day-to-day lives?

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:30.680 align:middle line:84%
I believe the
answer is community.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:34.070 align:middle line:84%
As I said, relationships
mirror our actions back to us

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:37.050 align:middle line:84%
so we can see who we are through
the lens of another person's

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:37.850 align:middle line:90%
eyes.

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:40.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, community is the
same thing, actually

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.240 align:middle line:84%
far more dynamic than just
our relationships around us,

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.947 align:middle line:90%
our family and our friends.

00:19:45.947 --> 00:19:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And there are many things that
our friends and family will not

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:49.850 align:middle line:90%
say to us.

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:51.450 align:middle line:84%
They'll say, yeah,
you're doing fine.

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:52.250 align:middle line:90%
You're doing great.

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:55.880 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, community might have
no issue with calling you out

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.200 align:middle line:90%
on certain things.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.830 align:middle line:84%
The right community is like
a social immune system.

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:02.230 align:middle line:90%
They keep us healthy.

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:05.340 align:middle line:90%
And we keep each other healthy.

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Truly, community in this
way is one of the best tools

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.000 align:middle line:90%
to arrive at our full potential.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.330 align:middle line:84%
So instead of waiting
for somebody else

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:18.630 align:middle line:84%
to bring the change we wish
to see in the world, the best

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:23.278 align:middle line:84%
us we can bring to the moment
is not just us individually.

00:20:23.278 --> 00:20:24.320 align:middle line:90%
It's our whole community.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.436 align:middle line:90%

00:20:26.436 --> 00:20:29.220 align:middle line:90%


00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to share with you a
personal example of self-care.

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.730 align:middle line:84%
The person that I've learned
the most about self-care from

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:40.270 align:middle line:84%
is a man named Rob in the
Page family, a dear friend.

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And I was up in Canada
with him working

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.660 align:middle line:90%
on a film called "Ungrip."

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And he puts it
very pointedly how

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:51.210 align:middle line:84%
he healed from depression,
an estranged relationship

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:54.420 align:middle line:90%
with his kids and his wife.

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.730 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at a clip
of a film called "Ungrip."

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:59.500 align:middle line:90%


00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Years ago, I was
very materialistic.

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:05.260 align:middle line:10%
I was working hard for
big houses, big cars, lots

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:07.340 align:middle line:10%
of money, that kind of stuff.

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:09.880 align:middle line:10%
And then when I recovered
from my depression,

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:13.180 align:middle line:10%
I realized that life is
all about my relationships,

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:16.090 align:middle line:10%
relationships with
individuals like yourself,

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:21.670 align:middle line:10%
other-- my friends and family,
but also with relationships

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:27.060 align:middle line:10%
with my food or my environment.

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:30.870 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes, I still
struggle with that.

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:32.350 align:middle line:10%
This is a journey.

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:35.700 align:middle line:10%
It's not something that's
open a door, walk through,

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:36.930 align:middle line:10%
you're a changed man.

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:38.850 align:middle line:10%
And this is something
I'll probably

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:41.280 align:middle line:10%
have to struggle with
for the rest of my life.

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.320 align:middle line:10%
Every once in a
while, I stumble.

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:46.710 align:middle line:10%
But I see it for what
it is and forgive myself

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:49.050 align:middle line:10%
and just move on.

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:55.300 align:middle line:10%
And that whole entire process
was a lot of hard work,

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:59.160 align:middle line:10%
like it was extremely
painful, took a lot of energy.

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:02.770 align:middle line:10%
But I'm at a point right now
where if I had to do it again,

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:06.710 align:middle line:10%
I would because I learned
so much about myself.

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:12.710 align:middle line:10%
And it positioned me very well
to actually get together again

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:13.510 align:middle line:10%
with my wife.

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:16.150 align:middle line:10%
We were separated
for three years.

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:18.020 align:middle line:10%
We reconciled the marriage.

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:25.050 align:middle line:10%
And we've been going strong
now for almost 10 years.

00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:27.720 align:middle line:10%
I believe the solution's
available for anybody,

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:33.260 align:middle line:10%
whether you live in a democratic
society or under a dictatorship

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:34.070 align:middle line:10%
or whatever.

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:36.270 align:middle line:10%
I believe the
solution is simple.

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:40.480 align:middle line:10%
And I believe the solution
is within ourselves.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:44.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Truthfully, there's nothing
more I can say about self-care.

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.950 align:middle line:84%
Self-care is this thing
we need to surrender to.

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:48.970 align:middle line:90%
It's not this activity.

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:51.700 align:middle line:90%
It's not something you force.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:56.180 align:middle line:84%
It's a natural balancing act
of the way of the universe.

00:22:56.180 --> 00:23:00.070 align:middle line:84%
So if you feel that you're
experiencing stress, burnout,

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:04.570 align:middle line:84%
not being able to recover or
relax enough from your stress,

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:07.210 align:middle line:84%
then what you really
need is a taste

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:12.490 align:middle line:84%
of self-care, real, true,
authentic self-care.

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:14.800 align:middle line:84%
So to do this and
employ it in your life,

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.120 align:middle line:90%
I have some challenges for you.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:21.160 align:middle line:90%


00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:25.560 align:middle line:84%
The first one is take a drink
of water and take a nap.

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:29.310 align:middle line:84%
If you live in a developed
country, you probably need it.

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:33.090 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, mend a
broken relationship.

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Bring forgiveness
into a relationship

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:38.470 align:middle line:90%
that truly needs it.

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And the third one,
find your tribe.

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:44.580 align:middle line:84%
Find the group that
you feel alive in,

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:47.490 align:middle line:84%
the one that allows you to
express yourself naturally,

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:50.190 align:middle line:84%
authentically, that
doesn't shame you for who

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:52.140 align:middle line:90%
and what you really are.

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:55.320 align:middle line:84%
Find the others, the
ones that lift you up

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:57.940 align:middle line:84%
and make you more of
who you are meant to be.

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:04.210 align:middle line:90%


00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:06.950 align:middle line:84%
