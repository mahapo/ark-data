>> Has anyone ever told you to
stop playing around and start

00:00:13.785 --> 00:00:14.660 align:middle line:90%
acting like an adult?

Plato once said,
"you can learn more

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.380 align:middle line:84%
about a person in
an hour of play

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.540 align:middle line:90%
than any year of conversation."

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.180 align:middle line:84%
So there is this mythic
rumor that only children play

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.280 align:middle line:90%
and adults work.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.050 align:middle line:90%
But must it be that way?

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.840 align:middle line:84%
Or is this simply the
default state, the state

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.660 align:middle line:84%
that we've adopted
in our culture?

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.570 align:middle line:10%
Because I believe that play
is an optimal way to learn,

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.310 align:middle line:10%
to come together as
a society, and also

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.750 align:middle line:10%
for loving relationships.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.060 align:middle line:84%
Because imagine a
loving relationship

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.430 align:middle line:90%
with absolutely no play.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.410 align:middle line:84%
I believe they're
too intertwined

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.050 align:middle line:90%
to remove one from the other.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.760 align:middle line:84%
If fun and play seems to
disappear as we age naturally,

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.910 align:middle line:84%
that would mean that
life seems to suck more

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.860 align:middle line:90%
as you experience more of it.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.930 align:middle line:84%
That would mean that the
day that you're born,

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.850 align:middle line:84%
that's the best it's
ever going to be,

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.250 align:middle line:84%
and it's all
downhill from there.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.330 align:middle line:84%
Now come on, does that sound
advantageous for evolution?

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.250 align:middle line:90%
Does that sound optimal?

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, what's the real
importance of play?

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.880 align:middle line:84%
Play just might be the
antidote to stress.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And stress nowadays seems
like the number one killer

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.390 align:middle line:84%
in the states, as it is
linked with the six leading

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.910 align:middle line:90%
causes of death.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.310 align:middle line:90%
But isn't stress just a choice?

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.990 align:middle line:84%
That question led
me down a rabbit

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.010 align:middle line:84%
hole where I stumbled upon
this man, Stephen Jepsen.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.350 align:middle line:84%
He's the guy that taught
me picking up marbles

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.680 align:middle line:84%
and tiny toys with your

as children on the playground.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.030 align:middle line:84%
I have found a very
basic truth to life.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.600 align:middle line:10%
I believe that we were born
to move, born to be active.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.830 align:middle line:10%
I think a sedentary lifestyle
is death, extremely unhealthy,

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.650 align:middle line:10%
and contributes to many of
humanity's modern health

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.500 align:middle line:10%
problems, including diabetes,
heart disease, obesity,

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.980 align:middle line:10%
depression, dementia,
Alzheimer's, et cetera.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.740 align:middle line:84%
I have a concept that I call
never leave the playground.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.290 align:middle line:84%
There is study
after study and book

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.730 align:middle line:84%
after book showing
the importance

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.500 align:middle line:90%
of remaining physically active.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.570 align:middle line:10%
I have come up with
some simple and fun

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.870 align:middle line:10%
games that will age-proof
one's brain and body.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:11.830 align:middle line:90%
I guess I'm different.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.810 align:middle line:90%
I do a lot of different things.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And some people might find that
a little bit odd or strange,

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.830 align:middle line:90%
but it is served--

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.260 align:middle line:90%
it has served me very well.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.310 align:middle line:10%
The games in my program
teach the right and left foot

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.350 align:middle line:10%
and right and left
hand new movements.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.110 align:middle line:10%
This contributes
to the generation

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.920 align:middle line:10%
of new brain cells, which
is termed as neurogenesis.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.640 align:middle line:84%
The brain is changed
by what I teach,

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.000 align:middle line:84%
which contributes
to neuroplasticity.

It's a beautiful philosophy.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.050 align:middle line:10%

in Rafe Kelley's movement

Now, Rafe started
as a parkour guy.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.020 align:middle line:10%
If you don't know
what parkour is,

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.410 align:middle line:10%
it's a type of "Jungle Book"
kind of running through urban

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.820 align:middle line:10%
spaces.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.750 align:middle line:10%
So he took this practice
back into nature

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.180 align:middle line:10%
where he believes
that it truly belongs.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.300 align:middle line:84%
I trained with Rafe under
the Golden Gate Bridge.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.750 align:middle line:84%
We practiced climbing trees,
wrestling and grappling,

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.840 align:middle line:84%
controlled falls,
and panoramic vision.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.580 align:middle line:84%
But then when I asked
him, why did you

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.370 align:middle line:90%
move your practice into nature?

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.950 align:middle line:90%
He said, it's healthier.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.420 align:middle line:90%
It feels right.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's as simple
as it needed to be.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:12.630 align:middle line:90%

What's the importance
of moving in nature?

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.200 align:middle line:10%
In 1966, Marian Diamond
took two groups of mice.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.900 align:middle line:10%
One she put in a very
enriched environment

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.710 align:middle line:10%
of lots of toys, lots of
levels, and unique spaces

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.390 align:middle line:10%
to play around in.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.600 align:middle line:84%
The other group was set
in simply an open box.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.560 align:middle line:84%
Nothing to play with, no
toys, no unique spaces.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.770 align:middle line:84%
She found that those mice
in the enriched environment

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.140 align:middle line:84%
had increased glial
cell activation.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.140 align:middle line:84%
That basically means new
brain cells being generated.

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.670 align:middle line:84%
They also showed better
cognitive performance simply

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.120 align:middle line:84%
from being in a more
enriched environment.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.410 align:middle line:84%
Now truthfully, this means
that play is a form of school.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.910 align:middle line:84%
In fact, animals and children
learn many of their motor,

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.970 align:middle line:84%
social, and even
self-confidence building skills

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.680 align:middle line:90%
through the act of play.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.370 align:middle line:84%
There are even studies showing
that child development thrives

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:15.690 align:middle line:90%

approaches versus less playful,

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.150 align:middle line:84%

approaches reveal

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.700 align:middle line:84%
that children in the
child-centered approaches

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.870 align:middle line:84%
do better in tests of
reading, language, writing,

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.430 align:middle line:90%
and mathematics.

But what is play, truthfully?

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.570 align:middle line:90%
Well, play is a lot of things.

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.420 align:middle line:90%
Some forms of play are exercise.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.340 align:middle line:90%
But you would never know it.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.760 align:middle line:84%
Some other forms of play
are focus and skill-building

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.840 align:middle line:90%
practices.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.420 align:middle line:84%
But you would never know
it, because you're typically

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.420 align:middle line:84%
focusing on the fun that
you're having, not the skills

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.950 align:middle line:90%
that you're learning.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:19.110 align:middle line:84%
So I invite you to
take a look at play

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:22.140 align:middle line:84%
as something that is less
of something that we do,

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.630 align:middle line:84%
and more of something
that we become.

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:29.830 align:middle line:84%
Because fun just might be an
altered state of consciousness.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:33.460 align:middle line:84%
Whereas stress brings you
into an agitated state,

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.490 align:middle line:84%
drowsiness brings you
into a sleepy state,

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:41.140 align:middle line:84%
fun seems to bring you into a
childlike, unlimited, and less

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.450 align:middle line:84%
restricted state
of consciousness,

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:47.230 align:middle line:84%
one that's not bound by the fear
of failure and making mistakes.

One of the side effects
though of this altered state

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.640 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness is laughter.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.580 align:middle line:84%
That thing that just grips
you and takes over your mood,

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.890 align:middle line:84%
hijacks how you
feel in the moment.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:05.930 align:middle line:84%
Milton Berle even said,
laughter is an instant vacation.

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:08.570 align:middle line:84%
Laughter is something that
can hit you from the outside,

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:10.790 align:middle line:90%
or emerge from the inside.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:13.790 align:middle line:84%

Martinez, has to say about
the power of laughter

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:30.440 align:middle line:10%
in an episode of "Inspirations"
with Lisa Garr called

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.520 align:middle line:10%
Rewriting the Genetic Code.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.220 align:middle line:10%
>> When you're laughing, you
have cardiovascular dilation,

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.190 align:middle line:10%
you're increasing
immune function.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:40.760 align:middle line:10%
All kinds of things
are going on.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:45.250 align:middle line:10%
But you can't do it
before you feel the hit.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:46.450 align:middle line:10%
You got to feel the hit.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:48.730 align:middle line:10%
You got to embody
it, and then allow

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:49.997 align:middle line:10%
yourself to experience it.

00:08:49.997 --> 00:08:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>> It's interesting.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:54.610 align:middle line:84%
I have a 10-year-old, and
we were at her soccer game.

00:08:54.610 --> 00:09:00.250 align:middle line:10%
And some of the other parents
get so upset with their kids.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:02.590 align:middle line:10%
They're 10.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:05.530 align:middle line:10%
And so sometimes, the
sense of humor gets lost,

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:08.252 align:middle line:10%
and it's being taught
to our kids these days.

00:09:08.252 --> 00:09:10.210 align:middle line:10%
>> And if you're too
mechanical about teaching,

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:12.582 align:middle line:10%
then what you're teaching
is to be mechanical,

00:09:12.582 --> 00:09:14.290 align:middle line:10%
not the information
that you're teaching.

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:15.624 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:09:15.624 --> 00:09:18.034 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:18.034 --> 00:09:19.970 align:middle line:90%


00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:22.820 align:middle line:84%
>> It would seem very obvious
that if you take your life too

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:27.320 align:middle line:84%
seriously, then you're probably
focusing on how you could fail,

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.400 align:middle line:84%
how you can mess up, only
focusing on the goal and what

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.240 align:middle line:84%
you'd like to get out of life
rather than the enriched moment

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.800 align:middle line:90%
of the now.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.840 align:middle line:84%
When you take your
life too seriously,

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.350 align:middle line:84%
this could actually lead to
some form of psychological

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:44.570 align:middle line:90%
and even physical illness.

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:50.230 align:middle line:84%
So in this way, laughter
is truly a medicine.

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Martinez said that you
have to feel the hit first,

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:55.730 align:middle line:90%
then you start laughing.

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:58.130 align:middle line:84%
But some researchers
are finding that even

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:01.520 align:middle line:84%
if you cause your own laughter,
you can still experience

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.150 align:middle line:90%
many of those health benefits.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:07.000 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look at a series
called "Taking Back the Years".

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.750 align:middle line:90%


00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.940 align:middle line:10%
>> According to
scientific studies,

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:16.320 align:middle line:10%
the body cannot differentiate
between fake and real laughter,

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.710 align:middle line:10%
and both have the same
physiological and psychological

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:20.550 align:middle line:10%
benefits.

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:23.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, really, it's
about choosing to laugh.

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.990 align:middle line:90%
I say we have a key here.

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:27.650 align:middle line:90%
So get your key.

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:28.960 align:middle line:90%
That's your key.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.820 align:middle line:90%
That's called willingness.

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And all you have to do
if you want to laugh

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:38.848 align:middle line:84%
is to stick that in your
belly button and turn it.

00:10:38.848 --> 00:10:40.750 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Yoga is a very
ancient discipline

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.910 align:middle line:84%
of working with the
mind and the body.

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And laughter yoga works
with the mind and the body.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.380 align:middle line:84%
So we have attitude adjustments
when we choose to laugh.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.360 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.458 align:middle line:90%
I made a mistake.

00:10:57.458 --> 00:10:59.850 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:02.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So we have attitude
adjustments when we choose

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.970 align:middle line:90%
to laugh.

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:05.920 align:middle line:84%
This is really
sounding more and more

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.540 align:middle line:84%
like an altered state
of consciousness.

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.840 align:middle line:84%
But I assure you,
laughter is not just

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:14.020 align:middle line:84%
some airy fairy or
hippy dippy medicine.

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:18.080 align:middle line:84%
It truly has a measurable
health benefits to it.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:22.420 align:middle line:10%
So let's take a little bit
deeper of a look at laughter

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:24.820 align:middle line:10%
with a film called
"Nature's Medicine,

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:28.170 align:middle line:10%
from Herbs to Laughter".

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:31.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Their benefits are not
limited to societal factors,

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.820 align:middle line:84%
as scientists have found
that laughter generates

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:38.950 align:middle line:84%
physiological changes
that soothe body and mind.

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:42.220 align:middle line:10%
Some laughs later,
the pulse falls,

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.650 align:middle line:10%
there is a rise in the levels
of happy hormones known

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:49.960 align:middle line:10%
as endorphins, and more
oxygen reaches the muscles.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.900 align:middle line:84%
The natural immune power
of the body enhances.

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:54.820 align:middle line:84%
Besides, the stress
hormones which

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.335 align:middle line:90%
the blood contains diminish.

00:11:56.335 --> 00:12:02.620 align:middle line:90%


00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:07.440 align:middle line:10%
Hence, laughter is
actually beneficial for us.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.830 align:middle line:84%
But sadly, as adults, we simply
don't have enough laughs.

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:13.490 align:middle line:90%


00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:17.150 align:middle line:10%
While children laugh
about 400 times per day,

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:19.580 align:middle line:10%
adults barely manage
to squeeze in one.

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:22.050 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:25.020 align:middle line:90%


00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:27.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Now again, with the being
an adult and less laughs,

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:29.370 align:middle line:90%
less fun.

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:31.960 align:middle line:84%
This truly sounds
like a problem.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.020 align:middle line:90%
But what are the solutions?

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:37.500 align:middle line:10%
As we've seen in this series,
Amy Cuddy, social psychologist,

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.740 align:middle line:10%
shows that two minutes
of arms above head

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.050 align:middle line:10%
changes your whole
chemistry so you can feel

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:45.660 align:middle line:10%
more confident in the moment.

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Smiling in the mirror
changes your chemistry,

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.590 align:middle line:84%
so you can actually feel
happier in the moment.

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, laughing
for a few minutes

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.270 align:middle line:84%
changes your
chemistry and puts you

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:59.790 align:middle line:84%
into an altered state to
where you're approaching

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:02.340 align:middle line:90%
the now moment differently.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:04.950 align:middle line:84%
This is truly one
of the best ways

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:08.550 align:middle line:84%
to hack our emotional state
with the intelligent use

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:10.530 align:middle line:90%
of our body.

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:14.340 align:middle line:10%
Plato said, "our children,
from their earliest years,

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:18.300 align:middle line:10%
must take part in all the
more lawful forms of play.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.520 align:middle line:10%
For if they are not surrounded
with such an atmosphere,

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.360 align:middle line:10%
they can never grow up
to be well conducted

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:28.060 align:middle line:10%
and virtuous citizens."

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:32.060 align:middle line:10%
So play is truly
good for society.

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:35.560 align:middle line:84%
But why does it seem so
difficult to introduce play

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.530 align:middle line:90%
into our lives as we age?

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:42.450 align:middle line:84%
Why is it so difficult to have
fun in this kind of a rat race

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:44.610 align:middle line:90%
that we seem to live in?

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the
discipline of it.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:50.100 align:middle line:84%
This is the path of
our human potential.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.990 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
be handed to us.

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:53.910 align:middle line:90%
We need to work on it.

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:58.080 align:middle line:84%
It's a challenge that's
beckoning us to meet it halfway

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.590 align:middle line:84%
so we can at least engage
with it, learn from it.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:05.910 align:middle line:84%
Because being able to
endogenously or self-produce

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:09.390 align:middle line:84%
a state of play in the most
unlikely and even difficult

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:14.100 align:middle line:84%
circumstances is truly
a superhuman skill.

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.580 align:middle line:84%
But the paradox is,
laughter, and even smiling,

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:20.620 align:middle line:84%
is not appropriate
in all situations.

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:26.040 align:middle line:84%
But rising to the occasion
of the challenge always is.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.950 align:middle line:84%
One of the best ways to enter
into the parts of our mind

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:32.340 align:middle line:84%
that need laughter
the most, we probably

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:35.880 align:middle line:84%
have to at least acknowledge,
if not find beauty,

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.660 align:middle line:84%
in the darkness of the mind,
those dark corners that

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:43.110 align:middle line:84%
hold all of our resistance
and all of our fears

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:47.140 align:middle line:84%
in order to start working
on that superhuman skill.

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And one of the best ways
to work on this skill

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.390 align:middle line:90%
is by starting small.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:54.690 align:middle line:84%
I suggest turning your daily
chores, the things you'd rather

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:57.240 align:middle line:84%
not be doing, into
an opportunity

00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:01.470 align:middle line:84%
to introduce play into
a moment of service.

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Take, for instance,
what Alan Watts

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:07.185 align:middle line:84%
has to say about chores
in his essential lectures.

00:15:07.185 --> 00:15:10.010 align:middle line:90%


00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:14.150 align:middle line:10%
>> The art of washing dishes is
that you only have to wash one

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:16.730 align:middle line:10%
at a time.

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:18.440 align:middle line:10%
If you're doing
it day after day,

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.320 align:middle line:10%
you have in your mind's
eye an enormous stack

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:25.040 align:middle line:10%
of filthy dishes, which you
have washed up in years past,

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:29.120 align:middle line:10%
and an enormous stack of filthy
dishes, which you will wash up

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.940 align:middle line:10%
in years future.

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:36.133 align:middle line:10%
But if you bring in your mind
to the state of reality which

00:15:36.133 --> 00:15:40.270 align:middle line:10%
is, as I've pointed out to you,
only now, this is where we are.

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:42.490 align:middle line:10%
There is only now.

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:45.130 align:middle line:10%
You only have to wash one dish.

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:47.070 align:middle line:10%
It's the only dish you'll
ever have to watch.

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:48.580 align:middle line:10%
This one.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:50.110 align:middle line:10%
You ignore all the rest.

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:53.380 align:middle line:10%
Because in reality, there is
no past and there is no future.

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:54.490 align:middle line:10%
There is just now.

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:56.260 align:middle line:10%
So you wash this one.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:16:00.160 align:middle line:10%
And instead of thinking,
have I got it really clean,

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:04.300 align:middle line:10%
is you turn the cleaning
movement into a dance.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.130 align:middle line:10%
And you dig that.

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:08.680 align:middle line:10%
And you swing that
plate around and you let

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.360 align:middle line:10%
the rinsing water go over it.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.960 align:middle line:10%
You put it off in the rack.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:13.760 align:middle line:10%
Crazy.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:14.230 align:middle line:10%
See?

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:15.030 align:middle line:10%
Take the next one.

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:17.700 align:middle line:10%


00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:20.920 align:middle line:10%
And you get this
rhythm going, see?

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:25.570 align:middle line:10%
And you're not under
compulsion all the time.

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Now just imagine that.

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:32.710 align:middle line:84%
How Alan Watts was describing
the only dish you're washing

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:34.600 align:middle line:90%
is the one in the moment.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Now expand that out to any other
chore, difficult situations.

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:44.080 align:middle line:84%
Imagine having the skill to
be able to introduce play

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.540 align:middle line:84%
into the things that
you never imagined

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:50.200 align:middle line:84%
should have a playful
air about them.

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And remember that there's
something about play that

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:57.130 align:middle line:84%
puts you more into the moment,
because the only moment

00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:59.830 align:middle line:84%
that truly matters,
like Alan Watts said,

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:02.530 align:middle line:90%
is this one, the one right here.

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:05.470 align:middle line:84%
Now imagine a figure skater
going up for a triple Lutz,

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:09.910 align:middle line:84%
one of the most difficult moves,
and having to land and continue

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:12.010 align:middle line:90%
skating away gracefully.

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:14.290 align:middle line:84%
That's a very
challenging moment.

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:17.630 align:middle line:84%
But what is the best
way to approach it?

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:22.270 align:middle line:84%
It's not by stressing yourself
out trying to overly manage

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:23.680 align:middle line:90%
that situation.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.500 align:middle line:84%
It's a balance between
management and trusting

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.292 align:middle line:84%
in the process,
trusting the fact

00:17:28.292 --> 00:17:29.500 align:middle line:90%
that you've been here before.

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.770 align:middle line:90%
You've done this before.

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:34.930 align:middle line:84%
The really most important
moment is the one

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:38.080 align:middle line:90%
right here and right now.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Now there's this
guy, Marquese Scott,

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:43.850 align:middle line:84%
he became really famous after
he did this viral YouTube video

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:46.640 align:middle line:84%
where he was doing a
robot dance to a Foster

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.340 align:middle line:84%
the People's song called
"Pumped Up Kicks",

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:51.680 align:middle line:90%
but the dubstep version.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.500 align:middle line:10%
This went so viral that it
got him on many talk shows

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:57.500 align:middle line:10%
where he got to do
this robot dance.

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.540 align:middle line:10%
And people were so
enthralled by the fact

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:02.720 align:middle line:10%
that he had so much
body control, something

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:06.920 align:middle line:10%
that looks so difficult,
but was done so playfully.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.330 align:middle line:90%
So here's my challenge to you.

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:10.710 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:14.530 align:middle line:90%


00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:19.420 align:middle line:84%
Turn your chores into
a playful moment.

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:22.060 align:middle line:84%
Clean your house with just
your toes and music on.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:25.240 align:middle line:84%
Wash the dishes with your
favorite tunes jamming.

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.430 align:middle line:84%
Walk through your
house on all fours.

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:30.430 align:middle line:84%
If you're stuck in
traffic, turn that moment

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:31.960 align:middle line:84%
into the challenge
of learning how

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:35.290 align:middle line:84%
to calm your nerves into some
kind of controlled breathing

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:36.220 align:middle line:90%
exercise.

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:40.090 align:middle line:84%
But do something to
introduce a form of play,

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:43.240 align:middle line:84%
a form of, I will
rise to this occasion,

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.190 align:middle line:84%
into those moments that
seem very unlikely.

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:47.640 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Because introducing play
into our moments of service

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:56.280 align:middle line:84%
is truly the most
adult thing we can do.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:00.150 align:middle line:84%
So I'll end off on a quote
from Plato yet again.

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:06.190 align:middle line:84%
He said, "life must
be lived as play."

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:08.380 align:middle line:84%
I hope this episode
has served you well.

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.600 align:middle line:10%
And I really hope to
see you next time around

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.280 align:middle line:10%
on "Limitless."
