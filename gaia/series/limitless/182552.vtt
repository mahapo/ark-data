00:00:08.982 --> 00:00:10.490 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you noticed that there's
this strong push in modern

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.720 align:middle line:90%
society for us to be rational?

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, what if logic and
rationale are not as foolproof

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.960 align:middle line:90%
as they seem?

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:31.810 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.420 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back to "Limitless."

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.990 align:middle line:10%
Today we're talking
about the irrational.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And Friedrich
Nietzsche even said

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.070 align:middle line:84%
the irrationality of
a thing is no argument

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.900 align:middle line:84%
against its existence;
rather, a condition of it.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.320 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like to do
today is to break you

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.440 align:middle line:84%
outside of your thought box,
outside of your comfort zone--

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.110 align:middle line:84%
that logical, practical
bubble that we typically

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.670 align:middle line:90%
feel comfortable in.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Today I'd like to bring
you into something

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.830 align:middle line:90%
a little bit more irrational--

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.250 align:middle line:90%
an Irrational Evolution.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.830 align:middle line:90%
So what is truth--

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.680 align:middle line:84%
that thing that we all
seem to be striving for,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.600 align:middle line:84%
that thing that we
believe will actually

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.260 align:middle line:84%
solve some of these
ecological and societal issues

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.700 align:middle line:90%
that we face?

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.550 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Greeks
believed what is memorable

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.930 align:middle line:90%
and what is passed down--

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.820 align:middle line:90%
that is truth.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.960 align:middle line:84%
Plato said what abides in
the world of perfect forms

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.310 align:middle line:90%
is truth.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Then you go to
Asia, in the east.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.070 align:middle line:84%
There are many beliefs of a
more holistic form of truth,

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.730 align:middle line:90%
the balance of nature.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.470 align:middle line:84%
What about the Lakota
Native American tribe?

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.900 align:middle line:84%
They believe that
the clashing of ideas

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.480 align:middle line:84%
brings forth the spark
of truth, meaning

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.150 align:middle line:84%
that what truth is
is something that

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.160 align:middle line:90%
lies within the social context.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.740 align:middle line:84%
It's in between the
lines, a little bit

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.190 align:middle line:84%
more elusive than
we may believe.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.520 align:middle line:84%
So these are all different
cultures with different ideas

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.910 align:middle line:90%
of what truth really is.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.230 align:middle line:90%
So how do we get there?

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.820 align:middle line:84%
How do we arrive, or at least
move in the direction of truth?

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.690 align:middle line:10%
Well, many people
today are using logic.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's take
a look at logic.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.810 align:middle line:84%
Let's just say you have a
sphere, and inside this sphere,

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.330 align:middle line:84%
you have what you
know that you know.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.490 align:middle line:84%
Right outside the sphere is what
you know that you don't know.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.550 align:middle line:84%
So all of this-- what you know
you know and what you know you

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:31.810 align:middle line:90%
don't know--

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.370 align:middle line:90%
will inform your logic.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.040 align:middle line:84%
But all that empty
space around it--

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.700 align:middle line:84%
the things that you're not even
aware of that you don't know--

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.300 align:middle line:90%
this is where logic breaks down.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.560 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.260 align:middle line:90%
Two children, side by side.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Both of them have
puzzles, 500 pieces each.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.500 align:middle line:84%
Each of them-- both
children-- have constructed

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.490 align:middle line:90%
their puzzles--

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.860 align:middle line:90%
499 pieces of them--

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.790 align:middle line:84%
and they have one piece
left, but it won't fit.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.290 align:middle line:90%
It makes no sense to them.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.690 align:middle line:90%
Why doesn't this one piece fit?

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Neither of them understand
that the other child

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.900 align:middle line:84%
sitting right next to them has
the solution to their problem.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.380 align:middle line:84%
The solution is as close as
this other child is to them.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.470 align:middle line:84%
All they have to do is hand
each other their piece,

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.490 align:middle line:90%
problem solved.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.830 align:middle line:84%
But they're spending more time
on figuring out this one piece

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.880 align:middle line:84%
than they took on
the entire puzzle.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.650 align:middle line:84%
This is an example of
inferior logic in action.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.310 align:middle line:84%
So the real question is,
what is the other vehicle?

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.400 align:middle line:10%
If logic is not the only
way to arrive at truth,

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.800 align:middle line:10%
what is this other vehicle?

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.070 align:middle line:84%
Myself and many other people
believe that intuition

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.872 align:middle line:90%
must come into play.

00:03:44.872 --> 00:03:46.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's hear what
Albert Einstein has

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.050 align:middle line:90%
to say about intuition.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.380 align:middle line:84%
"The intuitive mind
is a sacred gift,

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.380 align:middle line:84%
and the rational mind
is a faithful servant.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.100 align:middle line:84%
We have created a society
that honors the servant,

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.590 align:middle line:90%
and has forgotten the gift."

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.313 align:middle line:90%
Isn't this true?

00:04:02.313 --> 00:04:03.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is
Albert Einstein, one

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.550 align:middle line:84%
of the most celebrated
minds in all of science,

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.600 align:middle line:84%
saying that the intuitive
mind is the superior one.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.120 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look at the
difference between things

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.060 align:middle line:84%
that you sense through your
sense organs and things

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.660 align:middle line:84%
that you intuit using
this abstract thing called

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.520 align:middle line:90%
intuition.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.790 align:middle line:84%
Sensing is practical,
down to earth,

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.360 align:middle line:84%
concrete, focused on
the present and past,

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.660 align:middle line:84%
detail-oriented,
and quite literal.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.280 align:middle line:84%
But intuition, on
the other hand,

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.670 align:middle line:84%
is visionary, future-oriented,
imaginative, conceptual,

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.880 align:middle line:84%
abstract, and
focused on meanings,

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.860 align:middle line:84%
and it's also read
between the lines.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's not this objective truth
that we can all agree upon,

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.160 align:middle line:90%
but this subjective thing--

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.760 align:middle line:84%
this thing that emerges
from within, our intuition--

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.000 align:middle line:84%
is the missing piece
of the puzzle--

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.040 align:middle line:84%
how to arrive at a
full picture of truth.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.100 align:middle line:84%
So to me, using our intuition
and using the rational mind--

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.860 align:middle line:84%
this is a holistic way to
move forward as a species.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.790 align:middle line:84%
So let's put this into
a cultural context.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.360 align:middle line:84%
In society, we really
do respect science.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.800 align:middle line:10%
In fact, there's actually
two legs of physics.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.960 align:middle line:90%
One is modern physics.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.565 align:middle line:90%
The other is quantum physics.

00:05:30.565 --> 00:05:32.190 align:middle line:10%
Now, when you take
a look at these two,

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:33.817 align:middle line:10%
they behave very differently.

00:05:33.817 --> 00:05:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And we've talked
about quantum physics

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.510 align:middle line:84%
before and how oddly or
irrational quantum physics

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.732 align:middle line:90%
seems to behave.

00:05:42.732 --> 00:05:44.190 align:middle line:10%
It seems like modern
physics should

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.970 align:middle line:10%
be very straightforward, very
understandable, very concrete

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.440 align:middle line:10%
and practical.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.300 align:middle line:84%
But there's certain
things that still boggle

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.580 align:middle line:90%
the mind in modern physics.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.760 align:middle line:84%
Take, for instance,
time dilation.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.980 align:middle line:10%
If you have two
identical clocks,

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.990 align:middle line:10%
you place one on the
Earth and one on a plane,

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.100 align:middle line:10%
this plane goes
600 miles an hour,

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.720 align:middle line:10%
and it races around for hours
in the air as fast as it can go,

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.700 align:middle line:10%
and then it lands.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.800 align:middle line:10%
Once you take a look
at those two clocks,

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:19.020 align:middle line:10%
the one that was moving in the
plane is nanoseconds younger.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.530 align:middle line:10%
Now, this isn't some
trick or effect of motion.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:27.040 align:middle line:84%
Physics is saying that all
frames of reference are just

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.550 align:middle line:84%
as valid for things that
are in uniform motion,

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.760 align:middle line:84%
but if these things are
not in uniform motion,

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.630 align:middle line:84%
then that frame of reference
cannot keep time the same way

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.010 align:middle line:90%
as the other.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.800 align:middle line:84%
This is interesting, because
this is saying that time is not

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.980 align:middle line:90%
some solid, structural thing.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.760 align:middle line:90%
It's based on our perspective.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.460 align:middle line:84%
It's based on our
frame of reference.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.680 align:middle line:90%
That's how elusive time is.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.380 align:middle line:84%
But time, in modern
physics, still

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.000 align:middle line:84%
does move in a very linear
and logical fashion.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.100 align:middle line:84%
This is not how
quantum physics works--

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.900 align:middle line:90%
the whole other leg of physics.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.970 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physics seems
far more irrational.

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:11.050 align:middle line:10%
Now, let's take a look at what
Stuart Hameroff, of a quantum

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.110 align:middle line:10%
theorist, has to say on
"The Real What the Bleep"

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:15.130 align:middle line:10%
with Regina Meredith.

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.900 align:middle line:10%


00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, first of all, to
explain quantum mechanics

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:22.160 align:middle line:10%
or quantum theory
in a general sense,

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.430 align:middle line:10%
our world is really described
by two sets of laws.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.340 align:middle line:10%
You might only say
there are two worlds.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.910 align:middle line:10%
There's the classical,
everyday world

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:31.340 align:middle line:10%
where things are definite,
and there's the quantum world

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:32.470 align:middle line:10%
that's small scale--

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:34.970 align:middle line:10%
although exactly how
small is unclear--

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:36.980 align:middle line:10%
where things are
quite indefinite,

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.340 align:middle line:10%
and things can be in two or
more places at the same time,

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:41.810 align:middle line:10%
separated from themselves.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.660 align:middle line:10%
Things can be interconnected
over great distances,

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.300 align:middle line:10%
and seemingly together even
when they're separated.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.610 align:middle line:10%
And things can condense
into one object.

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.190 align:middle line:10%
These are all-- and
time doesn't flow.

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.080 align:middle line:10%
These are all characteristics
of the quantum world.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.080 align:middle line:10%
And the classical world,
as I said, is definite.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.360 align:middle line:10%
I think, in a very general
sense, the subconscious--

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.180 align:middle line:10%
our dreamworld, the kind
of situation you describe--

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:07.190 align:middle line:10%
relates to the quantum world,
and consciousness is actually

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:09.260 align:middle line:10%
the transition
between that quantum

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.030 align:middle line:10%
world and the classical world.

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:13.280 align:middle line:10%
So it's kind of a
boundary between--

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.710 align:middle line:10%
consciousness exists on the
boundary between the quantum

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:17.290 align:middle line:10%
world and the classical world.

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:21.010 align:middle line:90%


00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:25.860 align:middle line:84%
>> The quantum realm boggles
the mind, not quite rational.

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:30.330 align:middle line:84%
So this is why focusing on
science is very crucial.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.640 align:middle line:84%
But also, understanding
the limitations

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.140 align:middle line:84%
of our mind, the limitations
of what we can conceive of,

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.070 align:middle line:90%
is very crucial.

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Because really, what
science is is experiments

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:43.740 align:middle line:84%
that are set up in
a unique way which

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:47.790 align:middle line:84%
acts as a lens to let data
through certain constraints.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:53.160 align:middle line:84%
So all experiments are lenses
for data to come through.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.710 align:middle line:84%
But what happens on the
other end of that lens, when

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:58.050 align:middle line:84%
somebody observes
data coming through

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.120 align:middle line:90%
a scientific experiment?

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.380 align:middle line:90%
What then happens?

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.990 align:middle line:84%
The data doesn't just
sit there doing nothing.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:04.830 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:08.670 align:middle line:84%
We draw meaning and
philosophy from the data.

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:10.150 align:middle line:90%
That's the next part of it.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:11.730 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting
thing is now this

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:15.360 align:middle line:84%
is no longer the domain of
the scientist within us.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.310 align:middle line:84%
It's the philosopher
within us that

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:21.120 align:middle line:84%
draws a meaning from the
experiences that we have.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.650 align:middle line:84%
Our perceptions have a huge
impact on who and what we are

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:28.720 align:middle line:84%
and how much potential we
can bring to the moment.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.170 align:middle line:90%
So this isn't a light matter.

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:34.650 align:middle line:10%
Let's take it to a cellular
biologist named Bruce Lipton

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:37.410 align:middle line:10%
as he talks about just that.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:40.950 align:middle line:10%
This episode is called "Bruce
Lipton On 'The Biology Of

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:43.220 align:middle line:10%
Belief.'"

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.940 align:middle line:10%
>> And this is what the new
biology is taking us back

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.682 align:middle line:10%
to-- is that before we
saw ourselves as victims.

00:09:48.682 --> 00:09:50.890 align:middle line:10%
If there was something wrong,
we'd go to the outside.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:53.410 align:middle line:10%
We'd look for a
drug or a chemical

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:56.270 align:middle line:10%
to correct the
functioning of the system.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:58.690 align:middle line:10%
Now, with the new
biology, we're recognizing

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:01.300 align:middle line:10%
that we can adjust
our own chemistry,

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.840 align:middle line:10%
but we have to do it through
our consciousness and our issues

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.270 align:middle line:10%
of our perceptions of
how we see the world.

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:10.000 align:middle line:10%
And why that's
really freeing up is

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.310 align:middle line:10%
that think about it
this way-- it's easier

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:15.220 align:middle line:10%
to change your perceptions than
it is to change your genes.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.020 align:middle line:10%
And that when we
recognize that perceptions

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:20.080 align:middle line:10%
run the show, when we start
emphasizing our beliefs

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.740 align:middle line:10%
and our psychology
behind our health,

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.870 align:middle line:10%
that is a
self-empowering process.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:28.400 align:middle line:90%


00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I really like Bruce
Lipton, and I love his book,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.040 align:middle line:90%
"The Biology of Belief."

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.890 align:middle line:84%
One of the best things
this book showed to me

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:41.540 align:middle line:84%
is that our perceptions not only
change us on a chemical level,

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:45.440 align:middle line:84%
on a neurological level, but
they also don't sit idly by.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.380 align:middle line:84%
They're always acting
upon our decision-making.

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:49.790 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, you
could say they're

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:54.050 align:middle line:84%
always steering the ship,
whether we're awake or asleep.

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And some people believe
that our entire species

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:02.240 align:middle line:84%
is largely asleep, so we are
being driven, in this way,

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.460 align:middle line:90%
by our beliefs--

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.940 align:middle line:90%
logical or not.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:08.890 align:middle line:84%
I want to give you
an example of this.

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:11.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show you
an optical illusion.

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'll explain the
optical illusion of it,

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.890 align:middle line:90%
but it will still work.

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.720 align:middle line:84%
You'll notice that this image
has a lot of unique colors

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.520 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:23.060 align:middle line:84%
It kind of looks like a
negative of a photograph.

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.280 align:middle line:90%
There's a dot in the center.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.050 align:middle line:90%
I want you to focus on that dot.

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:29.920 align:middle line:84%
Stare directly at that
dot, and only the dot.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Your peripheral vision is going
to be able to see the rest

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:34.900 align:middle line:84%
of the image-- all the
colors, all the shapes--

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.570 align:middle line:84%
so you might be able to make
out a little bit of what

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:39.880 align:middle line:90%
this image is.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.910 align:middle line:84%
But as you're staring at
it, your eyes, right now,

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:45.860 align:middle line:84%
are adjusting to
the color gradient.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm going to
do is change the image.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:52.900 align:middle line:84%
The image is really only
going to change in color,

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:57.310 align:middle line:84%
but as it changes, I want you
to keep your eyes on that dot.

00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:59.140 align:middle line:90%
Don't move them from the dot.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you do this
correctly, you'll

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.670 align:middle line:90%
see exactly what I'm getting at.

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:06.640 align:middle line:84%
So keep staring at the
dot, and this image

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.170 align:middle line:90%
is going to change now.

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:13.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, you might notice, as
you're staring at the dot,

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:17.350 align:middle line:84%
that there's a beautiful
color image that has emerged.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.300 align:middle line:90%
But now adjust your eyes.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.120 align:middle line:90%
Notice that there is no color.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.940 align:middle line:90%
It's a black and white image.

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:29.350 align:middle line:84%
Very interesting that your
eyes put the right colors

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:31.960 align:middle line:90%
in the right places.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:36.520 align:middle line:84%
You saw a color image when
there was no color present.

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.470 align:middle line:10%
There is a scientific
explanation for this.

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:40.300 align:middle line:10%
Again, it's the
McCollough effect.

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:43.930 align:middle line:10%
But the fact is you
were seeing color

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.360 align:middle line:10%
when no color was present.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:50.000 align:middle line:84%
Your mind was filling
in the blanks.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And we do this all the time,
in many different scenarios.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.790 align:middle line:84%
I could show you 100
different optical illusions

00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:59.770 align:middle line:84%
to drive home this
point, but I think

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:02.950 align:middle line:84%
that's enough to show you
that we fill in the blanks

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:05.110 align:middle line:84%
when we don't
understand something.

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:07.780 align:middle line:84%
When our logic falls
short and becomes

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:12.880 align:middle line:84%
inferior to a superior
form of logic that is true,

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:16.740 align:middle line:84%
we still seem to stick
with our inferior logic.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:18.450 align:middle line:90%
We fill in those blanks.

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:20.190 align:middle line:84%
Things that are
completely irrational

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:22.890 align:middle line:90%
will still fit into the box--

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:26.100 align:middle line:84%
the thought box-- that
we typically live within.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.750 align:middle line:90%
Am I making the point?

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:31.620 align:middle line:84%
The way you perceive the world
will tell you what is possible

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.880 align:middle line:90%
and what is not possible.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:37.200 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to remember
that in this life,

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.200 align:middle line:84%
in this path towards unlocking
our hidden potential,

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.540 align:middle line:90%
we really want to try a lot.

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:45.300 align:middle line:84%
We want to challenge our
assumptions and our beliefs.

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.950 align:middle line:84%
We want to break out
of that thought box.

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:50.430 align:middle line:84%
I like what Dr. Henry
Link said about this.

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:53.400 align:middle line:84%
He says, "We generate
fears while we sit,

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.460 align:middle line:90%
and we overcome them by action."

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.920 align:middle line:84%
So this is exactly what
I'm asking you to do.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.630 align:middle line:90%
Don't just sit around.

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:02.700 align:middle line:90%
Challenge your perceptions.

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:04.380 align:middle line:90%
Challenge your beliefs.

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:07.020 align:middle line:90%
And this might truly help you.

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.410 align:middle line:84%
So moving forward
from this point, what

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:11.120 align:middle line:84%
happens after we
have a philosophy,

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.390 align:middle line:84%
we have enough meaning
to move forward?

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:16.910 align:middle line:84%
We experienced something,
we gathered the data,

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:19.460 align:middle line:84%
and then we extrapolated
some kind of meaning.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.050 align:middle line:90%
Then what?

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:23.990 align:middle line:10%
Well, philosophies don't
just sit idly by either.

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:25.320 align:middle line:90%
They want to act.

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.740 align:middle line:84%
They want to commit
to something.

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And that process
of commitment is

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:34.793 align:middle line:84%
what I call the religious
aspect of consciousness.

00:14:34.793 --> 00:14:36.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, that trips people
up sometimes-- the word

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:37.760 align:middle line:90%
"religious."

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.620 align:middle line:90%
Here is the distinction.

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.370 align:middle line:84%
Religion is an aspect
of consciousness,

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:46.430 align:middle line:84%
whereas a religious
institution are what humans,

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:50.390 align:middle line:84%
and rather, groups of
humans do with that aspect

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:51.870 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:54.710 align:middle line:84%
So there really is some
form of a connection,

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:58.340 align:middle line:84%
but not a real connection
between religious institutions

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:01.610 align:middle line:84%
and the religious aspect,
or the committing aspect

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:02.836 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:15:02.836 --> 00:15:06.650 align:middle line:90%


00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:08.420 align:middle line:84%
If you take a look
at a marriage,

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:09.620 align:middle line:90%
you have three parties.

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:12.470 align:middle line:84%
Party 1 is marrying party
2, and the third party

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:13.700 align:middle line:90%
is the witness--

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:14.780 align:middle line:90%
the church.

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.400 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones
who, in a sense,

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.200 align:middle line:90%
take care of the contract.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.630 align:middle line:84%
The two other
parties make the vow.

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And in some cultures,
they'll take a ribbon

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:25.550 align:middle line:84%
and wrap it around the
hands of the lovers,

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:29.480 align:middle line:84%
showing that these two
parties are becoming one.

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:33.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is the root
word for religion.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:38.240 align:middle line:84%
It's the Latin verb
"religare," to bind.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.820 align:middle line:84%
So that aspect within
our consciousness

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:43.130 align:middle line:84%
that calls us to
commit to something,

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.290 align:middle line:84%
not just sit around
and do nothing--

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:49.200 align:middle line:84%
having all these philosophies,
but nothing to do with them.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.860 align:middle line:84%
The religion in us
asks us, it beckons

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:58.430 align:middle line:84%
us to commit to something
that we truly believe in.

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:01.610 align:middle line:10%
So I invite you to take a look
at this episode of "Omega."

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:05.010 align:middle line:10%
It's an interview with Stephen
Levine and Ondrea Levine,

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:07.400 align:middle line:10%
and the episode is
called "Relationship--

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:12.190 align:middle line:10%
A Pathway to Self-Discovery."

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:15.430 align:middle line:10%
>> We wait to be safe to
let go, and therefore,

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:20.200 align:middle line:10%
we never find the great
experience that no state

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.510 align:middle line:10%
of mind is preferable
to any other--

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:23.710 align:middle line:10%
to the heart.

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:25.180 align:middle line:10%
Only to our self-image.

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:27.340 align:middle line:10%
To the heart, it's
all just one thing.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:29.560 align:middle line:10%
It's all just the
flow unfolding.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.420 align:middle line:10%
It's all just the
divine presence.

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.160 align:middle line:10%
It's all sacred.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:37.870 align:middle line:10%
One of the things we learned
from our relationship,

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:41.230 align:middle line:10%
as it expanded and expanded,
more than anything else,

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:47.490 align:middle line:10%
was that love is the only
rational act of a lifetime.

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Love is the only
rational act of a lifetime.

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:54.940 align:middle line:90%
How did that phrase hit you?

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.170 align:middle line:90%
It struck me very deep.

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:58.800 align:middle line:90%


00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.590 align:middle line:10%
That which we believe
in and want to commit to

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:05.880 align:middle line:10%
wants to come into the world,
but it needs an act to do it.

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:09.329 align:middle line:10%
And that's where the final
piece of the puzzle comes in--

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:10.650 align:middle line:10%
art.

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:12.780 align:middle line:84%
Art is the way we
bring forth all

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:16.050 align:middle line:84%
of our abstract ideas
and beliefs and concepts,

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:18.569 align:middle line:84%
and bring them into
this concrete moment

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:20.339 align:middle line:90%
that we call the now.

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:21.930 align:middle line:90%
It's an artistic moment.

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:25.530 align:middle line:84%
All the things we say, the way
we say them, the things we do,

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:28.740 align:middle line:84%
the way we dress up
our body, how we eat,

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:31.020 align:middle line:84%
how we talk, how
we sing, the things

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:33.210 align:middle line:84%
we like, the things
we don't like--

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:36.700 align:middle line:84%
all of these things show up
in actions and behaviors.

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.620 align:middle line:90%
This is the art of life.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:40.585 align:middle line:90%
This is the artist in us.

00:17:40.585 --> 00:17:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
beautiful thing, and it

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:46.180 align:middle line:84%
completes the whole
ecosystem of consciousness.

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:50.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is important, because
all ecosystems are holistic.

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:53.610 align:middle line:84%
Like the way the
Asian cultures believe

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:58.420 align:middle line:84%
about truth is holistic,
it's a balancing act.

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:02.880 align:middle line:10%
But if, for some reason,
science, philosophy, religion,

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:06.350 align:middle line:10%
and art are at odds
with one another,

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:10.430 align:middle line:10%
then consciousness and the
cycle of it is not complete,

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:13.430 align:middle line:10%
and the ecosystem will
start to suffer from it.

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:17.390 align:middle line:10%
The scientist may not understand
the artist or the religious,

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:18.420 align:middle line:10%
and vice versa.

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:22.580 align:middle line:84%
Anyway you mish and mash,
those four elements--

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.890 align:middle line:84%
they may not
understand one another,

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:28.400 align:middle line:90%
but they complete one another.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:33.410 align:middle line:84%
They are in balance with one
another in a proper ecosystem.

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:36.120 align:middle line:90%


00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:40.160 align:middle line:10%
So I invite you to listen
to Jean Houston's word

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.620 align:middle line:10%
in an episode of
"Inspirations with Lisa Garr."

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:45.700 align:middle line:90%


00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:51.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Quantum teaches us that
the atom is mostly space.

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:52.660 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, yes.

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:55.120 align:middle line:10%
>> And for many, many years,
we believed that that was--

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:56.710 align:middle line:10%
that space was nothing.

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:59.890 align:middle line:84%
But now you're
filling that space

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:04.860 align:middle line:84%
with these incredible thoughts
of being able to engage with it

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.688 align:middle line:90%
and dance with that space.

00:19:06.688 --> 00:19:08.230 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk a little
bit about that?

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:10.120 align:middle line:84%
I think your new book
is about this, yes?

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.578 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the new
one's coming out--

00:19:11.578 --> 00:19:13.340 align:middle line:90%
that it is consciousness.

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:18.280 align:middle line:10%
And that once we realize that
we are, as I said, the universe,

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:22.540 align:middle line:10%
we have access to many of its
powers, its capacities, things

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:24.040 align:middle line:10%
that we never
thought we could do,

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.730 align:middle line:10%
the manifestation of
creating the future,

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:30.940 align:middle line:10%
you see, ways of turning
possibility waves

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:33.430 align:middle line:10%
into probability waves.

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:36.970 align:middle line:10%
So I've just been teaching
people how to do this,

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:40.510 align:middle line:10%
and it's been quite remarkable
how to create what is called,

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:42.760 align:middle line:10%
in Buddhism, a terma.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.680 align:middle line:10%
And Padmasambhava-- back
in the 8th century--

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.550 align:middle line:10%
he's the man who brought
Buddhism to Tibet.

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:51.430 align:middle line:10%
He and his wife began
to plant termas,

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:54.430 align:middle line:10%
called hidden treasures, into
the past, into the future,

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:56.365 align:middle line:10%
in people's minds, in nature.

00:19:56.365 --> 00:20:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And so I've been teaching people
how to actually create a terma.

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:03.910 align:middle line:84%
So that's powerful intention--
a powerful intention--

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:08.620 align:middle line:84%
that is not just for your
betterment, but for the world.

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you so
much, Jean Houston,

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.910 align:middle line:84%
for exactly how you said that
and the heart that you brought

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:16.700 align:middle line:84%
to that message,
because it's very true--

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:21.270 align:middle line:84%
there's so much empty space that
is pregnant with possibility.

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:24.420 align:middle line:84%
There's so much room
to bring ourselves,

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:28.320 align:middle line:84%
our own artistic expression,
into every single moment.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And when we do this,
especially with real heart,

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:33.770 align:middle line:90%
then we are planting seeds--

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:38.900 align:middle line:84%
good seeds-- that will grow
into good fruits in the future.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:43.250 align:middle line:84%
Ralph Waldo Emerson said,
"The creation of 1,000 forests

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:45.920 align:middle line:90%
is in one acorn."

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:50.210 align:middle line:84%
This is how long one seed
that you plant can last.

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:53.300 align:middle line:10%
It will ripple throughout
eternity, generation

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.320 align:middle line:10%
after generation.

00:20:55.320 --> 00:21:01.110 align:middle line:84%
The seed is small, but
the effect is enormous.

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:04.120 align:middle line:84%
So here's the big
question I need to ask.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.930 align:middle line:84%
What is it going to
take for humanity

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:11.910 align:middle line:84%
to wake up to our actions,
to what we do to the planet,

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:14.190 align:middle line:90%
and to one another?

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:17.770 align:middle line:84%
I believe the answer
is, again, love.

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:22.140 align:middle line:84%
It's the only rational
act of a lifetime.

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:25.290 align:middle line:84%
When all other things
fail, the one bridge

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:28.710 align:middle line:84%
between all of our ideas, all of
our concepts, all the goodness

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:30.330 align:middle line:84%
we wish to bring
into the world--

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:33.570 align:middle line:90%
it's all driven by love.

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:35.940 align:middle line:90%
Love is the most powerful bond.

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:39.300 align:middle line:84%
It is strong, and
it is very decisive.

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:42.930 align:middle line:84%
It has a very strong commitment
to bringing more love

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:44.020 align:middle line:90%
into this world.

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:45.120 align:middle line:90%
But that's the thing--

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.270 align:middle line:90%
love does not just arrive here.

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:51.750 align:middle line:84%
It needs somebody,
like you, to bring it.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:54.060 align:middle line:84%
It needs somebody
like you to spread it.

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:56.790 align:middle line:90%


00:21:56.790 --> 00:22:00.930 align:middle line:84%
Plant those seeds, and start
bringing it into this planet,

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:05.200 align:middle line:84%
because it is truly the
only medicine that matters,

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.680 align:middle line:84%
and we are in
desperate need of it.

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.900 align:middle line:84%
So with that being said,
here's my challenge for you.

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:17.430 align:middle line:90%


00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:21.020 align:middle line:84%
I challenge you to do one
thing every single day that's

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:25.640 align:middle line:84%
illogical, outside of your
realm of rationale, pragmatism.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:29.120 align:middle line:84%
Talk to somebody that you
would normally pass by.

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.730 align:middle line:84%
Go to a restaurant that
you would never go to,

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:33.170 align:middle line:90%
and try something there.

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:35.840 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is,
do it specifically

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:39.530 align:middle line:84%
because it is
illogical, irrational,

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:41.970 align:middle line:84%
to see what it has
in store for you.

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:43.880 align:middle line:10%
And the second part
of this challenge

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:47.925 align:middle line:10%
is to listen for what
intuition might come to us.

00:22:47.925 --> 00:22:49.550 align:middle line:10%
So whether you're
looking for your keys

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:51.175 align:middle line:10%
and you can't find
them, whether you're

00:22:51.175 --> 00:22:54.230 align:middle line:10%
trying to pick a movie
or a book to read,

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:57.980 align:middle line:10%
do something where you need
to listen to your intuition.

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:00.612 align:middle line:90%
Listen for how it might speak.

00:23:00.612 --> 00:23:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And remember that it
might come to you in a way

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:05.900 align:middle line:84%
that you have no clue that
intuition could actually

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:07.500 align:middle line:90%
speak in this way.

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.400 align:middle line:84%
So these are your challenges--
do something irrational,

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:14.103 align:middle line:90%
and listen for your intuition.

00:23:14.103 --> 00:23:15.770 align:middle line:10%
So thank you guys so
much for joining me

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:18.240 align:middle line:10%
on this special
episode of "Limitless."

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.390 align:middle line:10%
I really hope you take
these messages to heart

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:24.170 align:middle line:10%
and employ them and realize
that the way we conceive

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:26.840 align:middle line:10%
of this world may
not be what it seems,

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.940 align:middle line:10%
and when you break
free from that,

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:33.150 align:middle line:10%
that is where you will find
your deepest potential.

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:35.530 align:middle line:84%
I'll see you guys
next time around.

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:44.171 align:middle line:90%
