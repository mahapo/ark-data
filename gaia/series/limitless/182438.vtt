>>BEN STEWART: Have
you ever wondered

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.140 align:middle line:84%
if anyone or anything has ever
hijacked your decision making?

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.660 align:middle line:84%
What if there are
creatures inside your body

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.543 align:middle line:90%
that do exactly that?

00:00:20.543 --> 00:00:23.489 align:middle line:90%

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:29.890 align:middle line:90%


00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.730 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back to "Limitless."

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.480 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we're
going to be talking

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.540 align:middle line:10%
about the holobiosis
and the gut brain,

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.290 align:middle line:10%
but I'll start you off with
a quote from Hippocrates.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.120 align:middle line:84%
He says, "All disease
begins in the gut."

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.030 align:middle line:84%
I was taught that we have one
brain, the one in our head.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And this brain was
responsible for every decision

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.160 align:middle line:90%
I will ever make.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.710 align:middle line:10%
All things that I do
comes back to this brain.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.200 align:middle line:10%
So if I do something,
it's simply

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.470 align:middle line:10%
a calculated Ben-brain move.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.840 align:middle line:84%
But this was in the
'90s before the internet

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.270 align:middle line:84%
made a lot of new research
readily available.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And what I came to find
is that we are anything

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.420 align:middle line:90%
but one single unit of life.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, we may not be
the only decision maker.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.760 align:middle line:10%
We may be actually closer to
what Rodney Dietert calls,

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.660 align:middle line:10%
as the title of his book
suggests, "a Human Super

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.550 align:middle line:10%
Organism."

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Other researchers are
calling it a holobiont.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.170 align:middle line:84%
A holobiont is a unit of
life that is holistic.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.010 align:middle line:84%
So there's that word again
holobiosis, holobiont.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.900 align:middle line:90%
Holos means whole.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.070 align:middle line:84%
You see this in the word
holistic or holographic.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.050 align:middle line:84%
It represents the
entirety of the system.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.290 align:middle line:90%
So that's holos.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.640 align:middle line:90%
Biont is a unit of life.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.570 align:middle line:84%
But biosis is an
ecosystem of life,

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.265 align:middle line:84%
many different organisms making
up one single super organism.

00:01:59.265 --> 00:02:01.840 align:middle line:90%


00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.100 align:middle line:84%
So how do microbes
truly fit the bill

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.410 align:middle line:84%
when we're talking about
our human potential?

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.990 align:middle line:84%
As we're talking about
who's the decision maker,

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.590 align:middle line:84%
we really need to take a
deeper look at microbes.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.390 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.630 align:middle line:84%
Why might we even
have them in our body?

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.320 align:middle line:10%
Well, let's take a look at
a film called "Resistance--

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.220 align:middle line:10%
Not All Germs Are
Created Equal."

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.220 align:middle line:10%
>> We have a very skewed
sense of our relationship with

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.285 align:middle line:10%
microorganisms in general
and bacteria specifically.

00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:35.470 align:middle line:90%


00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.325 align:middle line:10%
They collectively outweigh human
beings by 100 million times.

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:42.070 align:middle line:10%


00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.960 align:middle line:10%
They can replicate 500,000
times faster than we can.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.100 align:middle line:90%


00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.055 align:middle line:84%
And they've been doing
this for 1,000 times

00:02:51.055 --> 00:02:52.555 align:middle line:84%
longer than our
species has existed.

00:02:52.555 --> 00:02:56.040 align:middle line:90%


00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BEN: Very interesting.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.300 align:middle line:84%
These microbes, these
bacteria can rightly

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.110 align:middle line:84%
be seen as ancient intelligent
organisms, actually

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.950 align:middle line:84%
the most ancient intelligent
organisms on this planet.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.810 align:middle line:10%
So these microbes are so
crucial in every aspect of life

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.970 align:middle line:10%
that they are here
to help us thrive.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.720 align:middle line:84%
They're in a lot of
the foods that we eat.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.870 align:middle line:90%
You go to the supermarket.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.310 align:middle line:84%
You see things like kombucha,
yogurt, kimchi, sauerkraut.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.860 align:middle line:90%
These are all fermented foods.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And in these fermented
foods live billions, if not

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.430 align:middle line:90%
trillions of microorganisms.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.680 align:middle line:84%
But in the 1900s, there
was this campaign,

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.830 align:middle line:84%
a scientific one at that,
saying that bacteria

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.660 align:middle line:90%
are bad for your health.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.840 align:middle line:84%
This gave rise to the
campaign of antibiotics,

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.900 align:middle line:84%
depleting all the
bacteria in our body.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.140 align:middle line:84%
Scrubbing our hands and making
sure we're squeaky clean.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.870 align:middle line:84%
Mouthwash, making sure
there's no microbes in there

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.100 align:middle line:84%
because it was the idea,
bacteria equals bad health.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.050 align:middle line:84%
But now that we actually know
more about these bacteria,

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.320 align:middle line:84%
we know that there's good
bacteria and bad bacteria.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.240 align:middle line:90%
There's pathogens, bad bacteria.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And there's probiotics,
good bacteria,

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.510 align:middle line:90%
ones that help us digest.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.360 align:middle line:84%
The microbiome,
basically, the catch term

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.540 align:middle line:84%
for all the microbes in
our gut, this microbiome

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.460 align:middle line:84%
is responsible for roughly 80%
to 90% of our immune system,

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.410 align:middle line:90%
keeping us healthy.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.390 align:middle line:84%
All these different
bacterial strains

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.410 align:middle line:84%
communicate with one another
through a chemical language.

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And with this chemical
language and a process

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.000 align:middle line:84%
called quorum
sensing, they can tell

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.680 align:middle line:84%
what the populations
of these bacteria are.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.500 align:middle line:84%
If anything's getting
out of control,

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.600 align:middle line:84%
they can bring it
back into balance.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.060 align:middle line:84%
If there's a pathogen
or a parasite,

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.070 align:middle line:90%
then they can get to action.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.760 align:middle line:84%
These microbes are responsible
for keeping us healthy.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.260 align:middle line:84%
So how far back do these
fermented foods and this idea

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.205 align:middle line:90%
of good bacteria truly go?

00:04:59.205 --> 00:05:00.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can look
back into time

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.370 align:middle line:84%
into Western Africa
at the food garri.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.910 align:middle line:84%
It's a root vegetable
called cassava.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And this is a staple
there in Western Africa.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.340 align:middle line:84%
There's also the
Tanzanian togwa which

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.470 align:middle line:84%
is a fermented
gruel, which actually

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.100 align:middle line:84%
helps people in
malnourished countries

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.930 align:middle line:90%
maintain their health.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.640 align:middle line:84%
If you look in Asia, there's
soy beans, seafood, black beans,

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.920 align:middle line:84%
fish sauce, and even
side dishes that

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.800 align:middle line:84%
are all fermented and have
these good strains of bacteria

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.090 align:middle line:90%
in them.

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.080 align:middle line:84%
In Europe, you'll see
sourdough and sauerkraut.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.550 align:middle line:84%
Fermentation goes all the
way back to ancient Egypt

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.380 align:middle line:90%
and likely beyond.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.470 align:middle line:84%
But what if I were to tell you
that these little critters,

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.830 align:middle line:84%
these microbes in our
stomach, they not only

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.300 align:middle line:90%
help our immune system.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.280 align:middle line:10%
They not only help
us digest food,

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.170 align:middle line:10%
but they also
inform how we feel,

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.990 align:middle line:10%
think, and make decisions.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.520 align:middle line:10%
So now let's take a look
at a film called, "The Gut,

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.810 align:middle line:10%

had had the chance to use

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.040 align:middle line:10%
the microscope
Michael Gershon uses,

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.165 align:middle line:10%
these are some of the
neurons he would've observed.

00:06:13.165 --> 00:06:16.970 align:middle line:90%


00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.850 align:middle line:10%
200 million of these neurons
line our intestine wall.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.340 align:middle line:10%
They spend the length
of our digestive tubes

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.140 align:middle line:10%
helping us to digest food.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:32.460 align:middle line:10%
Our two brains resemble
each other like brothers.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.070 align:middle line:84%
The upper brain houses the
central nervous system,

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.202 align:middle line:84%
and the lower brain houses
the enteric nervous system.

>>MICHEL NEUNLIST:
The second brain

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.240 align:middle line:10%
has had its name
usurped really because I

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.390 align:middle line:10%
consider it to be the first
brain, the original brain even.

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:47.520 align:middle line:10%
Primitive
multicellular organisms

>>BEN: Very peculiar.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Before we even had neurons, or
a nervous system, or a brain,

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.830 align:middle line:84%
evolutionarily, the first
gut was the digestive tube.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.420 align:middle line:84%
That's how we learned about
our outside environment.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.480 align:middle line:90%
We would literally swallow it.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:17.160 align:middle line:84%
Two brains, one in our
gut and one in our head.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.280 align:middle line:84%
They do communicate, and it's
a very important communication

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.190 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.250 align:middle line:90%
It's called the gut-brain axis.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.260 align:middle line:90%
There's five different channels.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.620 align:middle line:84%
A few of which are the vagus
nerve, the cranial nerve

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.950 align:middle line:84%
that wanders outside of
the spinal column; the HPA

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:35.340 align:middle line:84%
axis, which is the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:38.827 align:middle line:84%
axis; and simply through
chemical languages.

00:07:38.827 --> 00:07:40.410 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of
microbes, and they're

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:43.320 align:middle line:84%
communicating a lot of
very useful and valuable

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.000 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.050 align:middle line:84%
But there was this myth that we
have far more microbial cells

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:53.340 align:middle line:84%
than we do human cells,
meaning far more microbial DNA

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:56.580 align:middle line:90%
in our body than our human DNA.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.920 align:middle line:84%
They've brought that into
balance a little bit more

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.170 align:middle line:84%
with this article that
says, "You're Probably

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.100 align:middle line:90%
Not Mostly Microbes."

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And, in this article,
they did new research,

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.360 align:middle line:84%
and they came to find that
it's actually not true.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:14.070 align:middle line:84%
We are about half human
and half microbial.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Half the cells in our
body are not ours.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.950 align:middle line:84%
So could we rightly
say that these microbes

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:23.530 align:middle line:90%
might be our puppet masters?

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:27.130 align:middle line:84%
They cause us to crave
certain foods that feed them

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:29.200 align:middle line:84%
and create their
optimal environment.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:34.169 align:middle line:84%
They cause us to behave, and
think, and emote differently.

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:36.178 align:middle line:84%
This is a lot of
power that they have.

00:08:36.178 --> 00:08:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And this has been known
for quite some time

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:40.940 align:middle line:84%
that a microbe can
change the behavior

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:46.460 align:middle line:84%
of a macroscopic or higher-order
creature such as the killifish.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:50.310 align:middle line:84%
There's a very specific
parasite that gets into them.

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And when it does, it
causes them to disobey

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:54.610 align:middle line:90%
their primal command.

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:57.830 align:middle line:84%
Their primal command is
swim very low in the water

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:01.130 align:middle line:84%
so none of the predatory birds
can come down and eat you.

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:02.580 align:middle line:90%
Makes sense.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.880 align:middle line:84%
But when infected
with this parasite,

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.770 align:middle line:90%
they disobey this command.

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:10.460 align:middle line:84%
They swim in the shallow
water, right towards the top.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.400 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, they
swim very erratically.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.450 align:middle line:90%
They move a lot.

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:17.210 align:middle line:84%
So the sun catches their
scales, and they could

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:19.160 align:middle line:90%
be easier seen by the bird.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.770 align:middle line:84%
So the birds come
down, swoop them up.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:23.990 align:middle line:84%
Now the parasite
is inside the bird.

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:28.220 align:middle line:10%
The birds drop all of their
waste onto this field.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.230 align:middle line:84%
The cows come by,
eat the grass that

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:32.000 align:middle line:90%
is infected with this parasite.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, the parasite
gets to live out

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:36.920 align:middle line:84%
the rest of its illustrious
life in one of those four

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.260 align:middle line:90%
stomachs of that cow.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.670 align:middle line:90%
That is smart.

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.040 align:middle line:84%
In computer terms,
that fish just

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.680 align:middle line:90%
got hacked by that parasite.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And they do this through
chemical languages.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.160 align:middle line:84%
They change the ratio of
these neural chemicals

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.880 align:middle line:84%
and the chemistry in our body
to get us to think differently.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.160 align:middle line:84%
Literally, they are
hijacking our thinking.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.670 align:middle line:90%


00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a deeper look
at how many of these

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:06.140 align:middle line:84%
bacterial strains
live in our body.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:09.710 align:middle line:84%
We have many different areas
in which these bacteria live

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:11.450 align:middle line:90%
and many different strains.

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:13.550 align:middle line:84%
For instance, there's
a different strain

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:17.240 align:middle line:84%
of bacteria E. coli on
the bottom of your foot

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:22.070 align:middle line:84%
than on the top of your foot, or
in your forearms, your armpits,

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:27.080 align:middle line:84%
hair follicles, eyes,
mouth, digestive tract,

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.630 align:middle line:84%
and even through
your bloodstream.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:32.600 align:middle line:84%
The unique thing about it
is every single one of us

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.650 align:middle line:84%
has a very peculiar
ratio of these strains.

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:38.600 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we're missing
a strain or two.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.390 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we have a few
that we shouldn't have.

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:45.530 align:middle line:84%
But we all have our own unique
ratio, which is as unique to us

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:48.350 align:middle line:90%
as our fingerprint is.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:50.380 align:middle line:90%
There's also an enterotype.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:54.550 align:middle line:84%
Something that is guided by our
ancestry, meaning our ancestors

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:58.840 align:middle line:84%
passed down these microbes
almost as if they're heirlooms.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, how do we pass on our
enterotype to our children

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.030 align:middle line:90%
and to their children?

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:06.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, this happens
through the birth canal.

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And if you are born
through the birth canal,

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.810 align:middle line:84%
you are properly
inoculated by your mother.

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:14.320 align:middle line:84%
You are getting the same
imprint, microbial imprint

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.060 align:middle line:90%
as your ancestors did.

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:19.150 align:middle line:84%
But if you are born
by cesarean section,

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:22.600 align:middle line:84%
you may not be properly
seeded or inoculated.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And this has given rise to
a fecal transplant method

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.510 align:middle line:84%
that doctors sometimes
are using now

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:32.500 align:middle line:84%
to give children a better start
as it may improve their health.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.890 align:middle line:90%


00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:38.370 align:middle line:84%
Another cool fact,
did you know that most

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:42.300 align:middle line:84%
of the dust particles that are
floating around in your house

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.010 align:middle line:90%
are dead skin?

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And upon that dead skin
live many microorganisms

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.090 align:middle line:84%
that come from you
and other people.

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:52.990 align:middle line:90%
What does this mean?

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:55.650 align:middle line:84%
This means that we
actually share microbiomes.

00:11:55.650 --> 00:12:00.060 align:middle line:84%
We share bacteria when we don't
even realize we're doing this.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.980 align:middle line:90%
If you're in an elevator--

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:03.600 align:middle line:90%
nobody even has to sneeze--

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:07.320 align:middle line:84%
you're getting their
microbiome in you.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.080 align:middle line:84%
If you're on an airplane and
you're sitting all the way

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.630 align:middle line:84%
in the back, you are
sharing the microbiome

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:15.060 align:middle line:90%
of the pilot and the co-pilot.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:18.300 align:middle line:84%
Another interesting little
point, all of your lovers,

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.030 align:middle line:84%
all of your intimate
partners, you share

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:23.280 align:middle line:90%
their microbes in you.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And you share yours
with them for life.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:30.360 align:middle line:90%
Might want to think about it.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.090 align:middle line:84%
So back to the
holobiont, this idea

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:36.540 align:middle line:90%
that there is one unit of life.

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:39.100 align:middle line:90%
But what is that unit of life?

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.600 align:middle line:84%
Are we a single unit of
life if we're constantly

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:47.406 align:middle line:84%
giving microbes out and
getting microbes back.

00:12:47.406 --> 00:12:50.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's take a look
at a Gaia original series

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:53.150 align:middle line:84%
called "Psychedelica,"
the episode "Psychedelics

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:56.190 align:middle line:84%
and Consciousness" to
answer this question.

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:58.760 align:middle line:84%
>>TERENCE MCKENNA: We are
like an organ of Gaia.

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:04.700 align:middle line:10%
We are the organ which
binds and releases energy.

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.710 align:middle line:10%
For reas-- I mean,
a liver cell doesn't

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:09.560 align:middle line:10%
need to understand why
it binds and releases

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.370 align:middle line:10%
enzymes of the liver.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:15.590 align:middle line:10%
We bind and release energy
for reasons perhaps never

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:19.400 align:middle line:10%
to be clear to us
but which place us

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:23.900 align:middle line:10%
firmly within the context
of the Gaian mind.

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:29.360 align:middle line:10%
Suddenly, we come with
an epigenetic capability.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:35.670 align:middle line:10%
We write books, tell stories,
dance, sing, carve, paint.

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:37.790 align:middle line:10%
These are not genetic processes.

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:39.890 align:middle line:10%
These are epigenetic processes.

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:44.520 align:middle line:10%
And they bind information
and express the Gaian mind.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.480 align:middle line:10%
The Gaian mind is a real mind.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.120 align:middle line:10%
Its messages are real messages.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:53.960 align:middle line:10%
And our task, through
discipline, psychedelics,

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:57.880 align:middle line:10%
attention to detail,
whatever we have going,

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:01.040 align:middle line:10%
is to try and
extract this message

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.010 align:middle line:10%
and eliminate ourselves
from the message

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:08.680 align:middle line:10%
so that we then can see
the face of the other.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.180 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.180 align:middle line:90%


00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BEN: Gaia.

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:20.720 align:middle line:84%
That word, that Greek word
that means the entire living

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:26.540 align:middle line:84%
planet, this seemingly
single unit of life.

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Everything that is on it is
just as dynamic and diverse

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.870 align:middle line:84%
as all the constituents
in our human body

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:37.070 align:middle line:84%
that we call me, this
single unit of life.

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:40.460 align:middle line:10%
But if you look at
Gaia, the whole planet,

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:43.310 align:middle line:10%
as a single living
organism, you will actually

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:47.330 align:middle line:10%
be thinking closer to what our
ancestors and shamanic tribes

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.520 align:middle line:10%
believed about the planet--

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:53.720 align:middle line:10%
that the entire planet
is conscious, sentient.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:58.820 align:middle line:84%
It thinks, and we are
merely a cell upon it.

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.130 align:middle line:10%
So that person that you
heard in "Psychedelica"

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:05.570 align:middle line:10%
was Terence McKenna,
a psychoanaut, author,

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:08.330 align:middle line:10%
and respected researcher
of psychedelics.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.210 align:middle line:10%
Rest in peace, Terence.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:13.460 align:middle line:84%
He was looking so deeply
into the question of,

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.770 align:middle line:84%
what is consciousness
and how can psychedelics

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:18.590 align:middle line:90%
help us arrive at that answer?

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:21.470 align:middle line:84%
This quest brought he
and his brother, Dennis,

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:25.880 align:middle line:84%
down into the Amazon, where he
found this plant combination.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:30.770 align:middle line:84%
It was a vine and a leaf,
and only when combined would

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:34.066 align:middle line:84%
the psychedelic properties
start emerging from it.

00:15:34.066 --> 00:15:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And the most interesting
thing that I believe he found,

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:41.960 align:middle line:84%
the diet that they would enter
into before drinking ayahuasca

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:45.920 align:middle line:84%
for about a week, or two
weeks, maybe months or years

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.320 align:middle line:90%
was the actual medicine.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.380 align:middle line:84%
That their dieta, which
is Spanish for diet,

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:54.830 align:middle line:84%
was the healing tradition,
and ayahuasca was merely

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:56.730 align:middle line:90%
a part of it.

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:59.660 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a deeper look
at this show "Psychedelica,"

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:01.910 align:middle line:84%
another episode
called "Ayahuasca--

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:04.760 align:middle line:90%
Journey into Infinity."

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.730 align:middle line:84%
>> The strongest and most
lasting effects neurologically

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:09.600 align:middle line:90%
happen in the gut.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:13.250 align:middle line:84%
The enteric nervous system
has about 100 million neurons

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:15.860 align:middle line:84%
similar to what dogs
have in their brain.

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:17.990 align:middle line:84%
This neurology is
in communication

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:20.900 align:middle line:84%
with the microbiome,
or colonies of bacteria

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:23.900 align:middle line:84%
in the gut that are integral
to our health and even

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.460 align:middle line:90%
our impulses.

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.530 align:middle line:10%
It is believed by
ayahuasca shamans

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:30.433 align:middle line:10%
that the real medicine
is not the brew itself.

00:16:30.433 --> 00:16:31.850 align:middle line:10%
>>ZACH POITRA:
And, in the jungle,

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:33.950 align:middle line:10%
if you talk to the
Mithros and they say,

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:36.230 align:middle line:10%
oh, you want to
study the medicine?

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:37.940 align:middle line:90%
Dieta, dieta, dieta.

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:40.645 align:middle line:84%
They don't say, ayahuasca,
ayahuasca, ayahuasca.

00:16:40.645 --> 00:16:42.020 align:middle line:10%
>>TERENCE MCKENNA:
What they say,

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:44.240 align:middle line:10%
if you really get
down with them,

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.360 align:middle line:10%
is that the diet is everything.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.670 align:middle line:10%
And that you're a tourist, and
you're here for a few weeks,

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:52.410 align:middle line:10%
and, yes, we'll
give you ayahuasca.

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:55.910 align:middle line:10%
But what this is really
about is controlling diet

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:58.850 align:middle line:10%
over a period of
months, even years,

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:02.960 align:middle line:10%
and taking a regular
regimen of this stuff

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:08.480 align:middle line:10%
and transforming yourself into
some kind of other person.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.366 align:middle line:90%

00:17:11.366 --> 00:17:12.810 align:middle line:90%


00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:16.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN: So what does this dieta,
or diet, really do to our body?

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:19.190 align:middle line:84%
What does this
food actually mean

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:22.040 align:middle line:90%
about changing our microbiome?

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.290 align:middle line:84%
If you look at these
foods in the dieta,

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:26.579 align:middle line:90%
they're high in fiber.

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:29.370 align:middle line:84%
High-fiber foods are
called prebiotics.

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:32.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, the difference between
a probiotic bacterial strain

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:37.740 align:middle line:84%
and a prebiotic, prebiotics
are simply food with high fiber

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.900 align:middle line:84%
and the right kinds
of chemical compounds

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:42.220 align:middle line:84%
within them to
feed the microbes.

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:46.770 align:middle line:84%
So, literally, prebiotics
are food for our microbiome.

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:50.130 align:middle line:90%
We maybe don't eat enough fiber.

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:51.210 align:middle line:90%
It's just a guess.

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:54.090 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't, you
may not be allowing

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:57.330 align:middle line:84%
the optimal environment in
your gut for these microbes

00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:00.120 align:middle line:90%
to survive and keep you healthy.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.180 align:middle line:84%
Now let's take a look at
some other modern lifestyle

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:07.320 align:middle line:84%
elements that are truly
damaging the microbiome.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:12.570 align:middle line:10%
Some of them are antibiotics,
NSAIDS, over-the-counter meds,

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:16.890 align:middle line:10%
painkillers, cosmetics, hand
sanitizers, house cleaning

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:20.730 align:middle line:10%
products, chemical shampoos,
sugars, conventional meats

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:24.550 align:middle line:10%
and animal products,
refined gluten, alcohol,

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:29.370 align:middle line:10%
food additives, pesticides,
fungicides, Monsanto's Roundup,

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:33.220 align:middle line:10%
glyphosates, and stress.

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:35.060 align:middle line:84%
So I've heard a
lot of people say,

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:37.450 align:middle line:84%
does this mean you can't
have fun because it's not

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.040 align:middle line:90%
good for your microbes?

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.270 align:middle line:90%
Well, no.

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:42.520 align:middle line:84%
There are still even
some alcoholic beverages

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.470 align:middle line:90%
that you can enjoy.

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:46.060 align:middle line:10%
If you take a look
at this one book,

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:49.600 align:middle line:10%
"Wild Fermentation"
by Sandor Ellix Katz.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:53.620 align:middle line:10%
She shows that there are many
different ways to ferment foods

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:56.170 align:middle line:10%
where the bacterial
strains are the very reason

00:18:56.170 --> 00:19:01.120 align:middle line:10%
for the fermentation and
improving your microbiome.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:05.020 align:middle line:84%
So good microbes actually
help you stay healthier.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:07.240 align:middle line:90%
They help you detox.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.640 align:middle line:84%
They help create the right
amount of metabolites

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.730 align:middle line:84%
and the right amount of
nutrition inside the body.

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:16.260 align:middle line:84%
They're also good for
your mental health.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.820 align:middle line:10%
There's a book, "The
Psychobiotic Revolution"

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:21.670 align:middle line:10%
by Scott C. Anderson,
showing that there

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:25.240 align:middle line:10%
are certain strains of
probiotics that are actually

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:29.530 align:middle line:10%
good for your mental health
just as, if not better than,

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:32.660 align:middle line:10%
the pharmaceuticals that
are out there on the market.

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:37.520 align:middle line:84%
But I caution you, not all
probiotics are created equal.

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.940 align:middle line:84%
If you go into the
supermarket and you simply

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:43.750 align:middle line:84%
get yogurt, or kombucha,
or kimchi, and sauerkraut,

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:47.200 align:middle line:84%
these probiotics may be
good for your digestion,

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.380 align:middle line:84%
but it does not compare to
the massive amounts of strains

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:54.490 align:middle line:84%
that we need for all of
the biochemical processes

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:55.930 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:58.420 align:middle line:84%
So you're not going to
find in most supermarkets

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.430 align:middle line:90%
really good probiotic strains.

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:02.920 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have to do
a little bit deeper digging.

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:06.042 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:06.042 --> 00:20:06.940 align:middle line:90%


00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, how did our ancient
ancestors stay healthy?

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:12.160 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have access
to the supermarkets

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:16.720 align:middle line:84%
or online being able to buy
the best probiotic strains, so

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.460 align:middle line:90%
what did they do?

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:21.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, our ancient ancestors
moved through the natural world

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:23.260 align:middle line:90%
far more than we do.

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And the natural world was
far different back then.

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:29.620 align:middle line:84%
There's microbes in the soil,
and they were constantly

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:32.920 align:middle line:84%
touching the earth,
touching nature.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:37.030 align:middle line:84%
So, truly, this may be the
way that they stayed healthy.

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:39.400 align:middle line:84%
But then you have
to ask yourself,

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:43.660 align:middle line:84%
is our modern society divorcing
us from this form of nature,

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:47.140 align:middle line:84%
from touching the earth, and
from gaining these microbes

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:50.390 align:middle line:90%
to keep us healthier?

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:53.750 align:middle line:84%
Because, mind you, in
one teaspoon of soil,

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:56.600 align:middle line:84%
you'll find just
as many microbes

00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:00.240 align:middle line:84%
as there are people
on this planet.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.410 align:middle line:84%
So now let's take a deeper
look at these microbes.

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:06.330 align:middle line:10%
Let's see what Compton Rom has
to say about it on an episode

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:08.940 align:middle line:10%
of "Open Minds" with
Regina Meredith,

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:12.325 align:middle line:10%
in an episode called
"Life-Giving Microbes Within."

00:21:12.325 --> 00:21:13.950 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
So are we their host

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:15.450 align:middle line:10%
or are they our host?

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:17.490 align:middle line:10%
>>COMPTON ROM: Right,
we are their host.

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:19.740 align:middle line:10%
If you think that
way, then you'll

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:23.520 align:middle line:10%
start to create a paradigm
shift in your body.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:28.290 align:middle line:10%
So I've come up
with this new way

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:31.350 align:middle line:10%
of thinking about the
microbes in our gut, which

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:35.400 align:middle line:10%
we call our gastrointestinal
tract or our GI tract.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And, frequently, when
we relabel things,

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:43.360 align:middle line:84%
we tend to subconsciously think
differently about those things.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:46.650 align:middle line:10%
Well, I would like to
think as the microbes

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:49.020 align:middle line:10%
as our little
computers in our gut.

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:52.070 align:middle line:10%
And they're the ones
making all of our vitamins.

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:57.390 align:middle line:10%
The only reason why
we have to take B12

00:21:57.390 --> 00:22:00.240 align:middle line:10%
exogenously is because we
don't make enough in our gut.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:03.732 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of microbes
that make B12 in our gut.

00:22:03.732 --> 00:22:05.190 align:middle line:10%
If we pack more of
these microbes--

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:07.470 align:middle line:10%
I mean, B12 we don't
have to take B12.

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:10.570 align:middle line:10%
And you can be vegan and
plant based all you want.

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:12.510 align:middle line:10%
You just have to have
the proper microbes.

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:14.100 align:middle line:10%
You just need to arm
them because they

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.660 align:middle line:10%
have the intelligence.

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:21.200 align:middle line:10%
And they have the will to make
our lives a limitless life.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:25.430 align:middle line:10%
So these are intelligent little
computers living in our gut.

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:29.860 align:middle line:10%
And you can sense that our gut
is like one big condominium

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:35.350 align:middle line:10%
complex of 90
trillion organisms.

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:38.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN: The real parallel
here is nanotechnology,

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:44.450 align:middle line:84%
these microbial-sized
computers, these little robots.

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:46.960 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of predictions
about what this technology can

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.270 align:middle line:84%
do for us, how it can
improve our health,

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:53.560 align:middle line:84%
how it can actually work better
than the microbes in our gut.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.010 align:middle line:84%
Many people are very
skeptical about this.

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:57.910 align:middle line:84%
There are actually
predictions that range

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:01.840 align:middle line:84%
from these
self-replicating nanorobots

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:06.220 align:middle line:84%
to produce food and diamonds
all the way to devouring

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:09.340 align:middle line:84%
the entire earth because
they can't stop replicating.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:11.170 align:middle line:90%
So is this an issue?

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:15.550 align:middle line:84%
Should we worry about this
kind of a technology overtaking

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:18.460 align:middle line:84%
all the natural
biological technology that

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:21.390 align:middle line:90%
already exists inside our gut?

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:24.930 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at a film
called "How to Live Forever--

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:25.973 align:middle line:90%
Results May Vary."

00:23:25.973 --> 00:23:27.390 align:middle line:10%
>>RAY KURZWEIL:
15 years from now,

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:30.690 align:middle line:10%
we're really going to have the
fruits of this biotechnology

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:34.770 align:middle line:10%
revolution where we can
very dramatically reprogram

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:37.333 align:middle line:10%
the information processes
that run in our bodies.

00:23:37.333 --> 00:23:39.000 align:middle line:10%
We're going to be
able to add new genes,

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.800 align:middle line:10%
turn off genes, really
reprogram who we are.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.830 align:middle line:10%
And we'll have not
just designer babies

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:45.800 align:middle line:10%
but designer baby boomers.

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:49.510 align:middle line:84%
Computers that are now in your
pocket will be blood-cell size.

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:51.390 align:middle line:90%
They'll be very intelligent.

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:53.790 align:middle line:10%
And we'll have millions
of these nanorobots,

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:56.160 align:middle line:10%
nanobots going through
our bloodstream,

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.430 align:middle line:10%
keeping us healthy from inside,
going inside our brains,

00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:02.118 align:middle line:10%
interacting directly with
our biological neurons,

00:24:02.118 --> 00:24:04.410 align:middle line:10%
and really extending who we
are, and putting our brains

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:06.660 align:middle line:10%
on the internet,
giving us access

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:10.810 align:middle line:10%
to vast resources of
knowledge, memory,

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:13.280 align:middle line:10%
problem-solving capability.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN: There's many
different speculations

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:18.450 align:middle line:84%
of where technology
should go, but the thing

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:20.130 align:middle line:84%
we have to ask
ourselves is, what

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:23.430 align:middle line:90%
is optimal for the human being?

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:27.510 align:middle line:84%
Can we even wrap our minds
around the things that we need?

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:31.080 align:middle line:84%
In the 1900s, where science
was really advanced,

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:35.400 align:middle line:84%
we still believed we needed
to eliminate all bacteria.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.140 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until
decades later that we

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:42.810 align:middle line:84%
realized this was causing many
adverse health side effects.

00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Part of the mystery of
life is taking a look

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:47.610 align:middle line:90%
around at what already exists.

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:51.450 align:middle line:84%
These biological organisms,
where did they come from?

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Some bacteria and
some fungal strains

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:57.240 align:middle line:90%
can survive interspace travel.

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.420 align:middle line:90%
Very incredible.

00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:03.280 align:middle line:84%
So this planet may have been
seeded from another planet.

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:08.010 align:middle line:84%
So the whole holobiont theory
may not even be Gaia itself.

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:09.810 align:middle line:90%
It may not just be this planet.

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:13.510 align:middle line:90%
It could be the entire universe.

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:15.270 align:middle line:84%
So we have to ask
ourselves, what

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:20.580 align:middle line:84%
are we working towards with all
of our technological advances?

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:22.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that
technology is a bad thing.

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:25.353 align:middle line:84%
I want to put
things into balance.

00:25:25.353 --> 00:25:27.270 align:middle line:84%
The one thing that I
would like us to remember

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:30.660 align:middle line:84%
is that technology
comes from our minds

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:35.220 align:middle line:84%
whereas these microbes
comes from somewhere else.

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And we can't really
conceive of who

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.240 align:middle line:84%
or what put them into
motion in the same way

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.570 align:middle line:84%
that we don't even know where
we come from, why we're here,

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:44.820 align:middle line:90%
who we truly are.

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:49.020 align:middle line:84%
So if we can put technology
into the service of us answering

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:51.600 align:middle line:84%
these questions and
answering the questions,

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.810 align:middle line:90%
what is optimal for human life?

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:57.720 align:middle line:84%
What is optimal for
the planet itself?

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Then I truly believe
that this technology

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:03.330 align:middle line:84%
in tandem with our
own intelligence

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:06.930 align:middle line:84%
and all the microbes and
their ancient intelligence

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:10.350 align:middle line:84%
can be put together in
service of this planet,

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:14.880 align:middle line:84%
on this path of unlocking our
deepest human potential, not

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.959 align:middle line:84%
just individually
but as a collective.

00:26:17.959 --> 00:26:21.452 align:middle line:90%

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:26.490 align:middle line:84%
Just for one week, I'd
like you to eliminate

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:33.390 align:middle line:84%
red meat, highly processed
foods, caffeine, and alcohol.

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:35.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, after eliminating
these things,

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:39.600 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to supplement
with more fruits, veggies

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:44.682 align:middle line:84%
with high fiber,
berries, nuts, and seeds.

00:26:44.682 --> 00:26:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And once you do
that, once you make

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.810 align:middle line:84%
this change in your
diet, every single day,

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:51.570 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to
meditate for 20 minutes.

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:55.890 align:middle line:10%
I'd like you to focus on the gut
microbiome, all these microbes

00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:57.750 align:middle line:10%
in your gut, these
little computers,

00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:00.330 align:middle line:10%
as Compton Rom calls them.

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And as you connect
with these microbes,

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.770 align:middle line:90%
ask them for some assistance.

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And don't disempower
yourself believing that you

00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:09.030 align:middle line:90%
don't know how to do this.

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:10.560 align:middle line:90%
Your microbes know.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.410 align:middle line:84%
What I'd like you
to ask them for

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:17.040 align:middle line:84%
is to begin eliminating some
of the plaque and the pathogens

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.320 align:middle line:90%
that exist in your gut.

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.780 align:middle line:84%
Not too much, not too
fast because that'll

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:23.790 align:middle line:90%
bring on a healing crisis.

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:26.920 align:middle line:84%
Simply enough to
improve your health.

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And if you carry this on until
next week when I see you,

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:36.880 align:middle line:84%
you will have literally changed
your body from the inside out.

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.850 align:middle line:10%
So I want to thank you
so much for joining me

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:40.640 align:middle line:10%
in this special episode.

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:43.740 align:middle line:10%
And I'll see you around
next time on "Limitless."
