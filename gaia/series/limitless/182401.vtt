a disease.

Welcome back to "Limitless."

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.390 align:middle line:10%
Today we're talking
about age and longevity.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.830 align:middle line:84%
I'll start you off with a
quote from Myles Munroe.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:45.060 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Most people die at age
25 and are buried at age 65."

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.940 align:middle line:84%
Are we helpless victims
on this long journey

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.100 align:middle line:90%
from cradle to grave?

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.170 align:middle line:84%
From diet to lifestyle to
mindset to advanced technology,

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.990 align:middle line:84%
can we cheat death and
stay young forever?

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's look back
in history at people

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.290 align:middle line:90%
who have supposedly done it.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.000 align:middle line:84%
If you see, in
the Old Testament,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.670 align:middle line:84%
a character named Sarah,
the wife of Abraham,

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.210 align:middle line:84%
she lived to the
ripe old age of 127.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.020 align:middle line:84%
In Asia, the story of
Chen Yun, who supposedly

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.620 align:middle line:90%
lived 16,100 years.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.340 align:middle line:10%
And the oldest documented
living person in history

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.230 align:middle line:10%
was Jeanne Calment--

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.600 align:middle line:10%
born in Arles, France,
lived to 122 years old.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.290 align:middle line:84%
Before 1900, she remembers
meeting Vincent van Gogh when

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.390 align:middle line:90%
he visited her father's shop.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.590 align:middle line:90%
So she did it.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.610 align:middle line:84%
She arrived at an
incredibly old age.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.910 align:middle line:10%
From the 4,000 year
old Babylonian poem,

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.390 align:middle line:10%
"The Epic of Gilgamesh," all
the way to stories and legends

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.630 align:middle line:10%
of the fountain of youth
and the elixir of life,

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.810 align:middle line:10%
stories of immortality
and this quest

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.300 align:middle line:10%
is written into
our genetic code,

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.201 align:middle line:10%
into our cultural heritage.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.160 align:middle line:90%
But what exactly is aging?

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.270 align:middle line:84%
What is this process, and how
can understanding this process

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.520 align:middle line:84%
help us along on the path of
unlocking our hidden potential?

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.080 align:middle line:10%
Well, let's see
what David Wolfe has

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.210 align:middle line:10%
to say in an episode
of "Inspirations"

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.442 align:middle line:10%
with Lisa Garr called Superfood
Secrets to Optimal Health.

00:02:22.442 --> 00:02:24.650 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a number of
meanings to the aging process.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.890 align:middle line:10%
One is oxidation.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:26.690 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.172 align:middle line:10%
Free radical theory of aging--

00:02:28.172 --> 00:02:29.380 align:middle line:10%
what the heck does that mean?

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.637 align:middle line:84%
>> When we're born out
of our mothers' waters,

00:02:31.637 --> 00:02:33.860 align:middle line:90%
we've never seen the atmosphere.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.470 align:middle line:84%
The oxygen we breathe
actually hurts us.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.960 align:middle line:84%
Another theory of aging
has to do with methylation,

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.660 align:middle line:84%
and we're basically-- that's
why we need raw foods,

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.890 align:middle line:90%
so we have enough methyl groups.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:44.960 align:middle line:10%
Another one is telomeres.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.760 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.480 align:middle line:10%
>> So like a shoelace, right?

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.100 align:middle line:10%
There's that little thing,
that little plastic thing

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.240 align:middle line:10%
at the end of the shoelace.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.560 align:middle line:84%
When we're born, we
have that little thing.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.230 align:middle line:84%
It protects the ends
of our chromosomes.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.610 align:middle line:84%
With every cell replication, a
little bit of that chromosome

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.920 align:middle line:90%
is lost--

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.150 align:middle line:90%
>> In the little, tiny hairs--

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.040 align:middle line:90%
>> --in every cell.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.730 align:middle line:90%
>> --on a cell?

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:02.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.100 align:middle line:84%
The little end of
the filament is lost.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.530 align:middle line:84%
There's a little bit of
damage at the end of the DNA.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.320 align:middle line:84%
With every cell-- let's say it's
a white blood cell, let's say--

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.560 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.660 align:middle line:10%
>> --it's a muscle
cell or a heart cell--

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.420 align:middle line:10%
we lose a little bit.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.800 align:middle line:10%
That doesn't make much of a
difference in a year or 10

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.740 align:middle line:10%
years or 15 years or 30 years.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:24.610 align:middle line:10%
But in 100 years, it
makes a huge difference.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>> But how do these cycles of
time truly affect the body?

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.930 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.100 align:middle line:84%
How can these cycles of time
be seen in our telomeres?

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.470 align:middle line:10%
You heard David Wolfe
talking about telomeres

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.840 align:middle line:10%
like that little plastic piece
on the end of a shoelace,

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.690 align:middle line:10%
to keep it from unraveling
and coming apart.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.990 align:middle line:10%
And it gets shorter
each and every time

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.890 align:middle line:10%
our cells divide and the
chromosomes are split apart.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And every time they
get shorter, this

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.440 align:middle line:84%
is showing us that we
have less and less time.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.210 align:middle line:90%


00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.570 align:middle line:84%
So this is what's really
important about understanding

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.940 align:middle line:84%
the cycles of time
that we live through,

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.250 align:middle line:84%
what it means for
our body, and what it

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.920 align:middle line:90%
might mean for our telomeres.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.410 align:middle line:84%
Because, as we know,
these telomeres,

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.730 align:middle line:84%
they show our physiological
age but they don't really

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.490 align:middle line:84%
show how many years
we've actually lived.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.839 align:middle line:84%
It's not like rings on a tree
saying how many seasons they've

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:20.430 align:middle line:90%
gone through.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Telomeres can be
different according

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.050 align:middle line:84%
to your age because
of how you've lived

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.100 align:middle line:90%
your life-- your lifestyles.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.000 align:middle line:84%
So in that wiggle room
between age and telomere

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.780 align:middle line:84%
length lies your
hidden potential

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.140 align:middle line:84%
on how to approach
aging and longevity.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.250 align:middle line:90%
We are not helpless victims.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.380 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of information, a
lot of wisdom at our disposal,

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.180 align:middle line:90%
and we can use it.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.760 align:middle line:84%
Even in modern
science, we're being

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.250 align:middle line:84%
shown that eating
the proper foods,

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.700 align:middle line:84%
getting enough vitamins
B, D, and E, as well

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.480 align:middle line:84%
as fish oils such as
the omega 3 fatty acids,

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.500 align:middle line:84%
and staying away from omega
6's, from red meats and peanuts,

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.950 align:middle line:84%
actually preserves
our telomere length.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.770 align:middle line:84%
So there is a simple
hack, a simple tool.

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.390 align:middle line:84%
Now let's take a
look at the fact

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.780 align:middle line:84%
that our body regenerates
itself over time.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.780 align:middle line:84%
You may have heard this
myth that in seven years

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.150 align:middle line:84%
you have a brand new
body, because all

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.610 align:middle line:84%
the cells in your body
regenerate and replenish

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:21.600 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.050 align:middle line:84%
In over seven years, we
have a very new body--

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.750 align:middle line:84%
maybe not fully new, but
this is really good news.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.670 align:middle line:90%
We do regenerate over time.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.210 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.210 align:middle line:90%
But telomeres are not cells.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.580 align:middle line:84%
The question now rises,
can telomeres regenerate?

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at a film called,

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.530 align:middle line:90%
"Taking Back the Years."

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Telomeres are the
ends of our chromosomes.

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.730 align:middle line:10%
So I've got a
cartoon here to show.

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:57.320 align:middle line:10%
Everything that you are
is encoded on the DNA

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.630 align:middle line:10%
that's in these chromosomes.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.910 align:middle line:84%
It turns out, right
at the very tips--

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.490 align:middle line:84%
right above this
goldish color here--

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.860 align:middle line:84%
are the structures
called telomeres.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.800 align:middle line:84%
They cap the ends
of our chromosomes.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.920 align:middle line:10%
>> So can we lengthen
our telomeres again?

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.120 align:middle line:10%
>> In the series of tests that
were done by Dr. Abraham Aviv,

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.980 align:middle line:10%
he had shown that morbidly obese
people have shorter telomeres,

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.080 align:middle line:10%
but that when they lose a lot
of weight their telomeres come

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.880 align:middle line:10%
back.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.390 align:middle line:90%
That's actually good news.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:30.650 align:middle line:84%
Because if those tests turned
out to be completely correct,

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.520 align:middle line:84%
it suggests that lifestyle
modifications can, in fact,

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.300 align:middle line:90%
improve your telomere health.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>> If something like losing
weight can add length

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.460 align:middle line:84%
to our telomeres and effectively
add years to our life,

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.760 align:middle line:84%
then this means we are not
helpless victims on this

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.170 align:middle line:90%
journey from cradle to grave.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.280 align:middle line:90%
So let's go a little bit deeper.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.220 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at what centenarians

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.950 align:middle line:90%
are doing to stay old longer.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Centenarians are that
group of the population

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.220 align:middle line:84%
that hits 100 years
and keeps living.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.000 align:middle line:84%
According to a study, this
is one of the largest growing

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.070 align:middle line:90%
demographics of the population.

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:15.200 align:middle line:84%
By 2030, there should be a
million centenarians worldwide.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.330 align:middle line:90%
And another fun little tidbit--

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:21.320 align:middle line:84%
80% of those
centenarians are women.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.770 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:24.570 align:middle line:90%

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:25.903 align:middle line:90%
What are their character traits?

00:07:25.903 --> 00:07:29.400 align:middle line:84%
What can we learn from
these centenarians?

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.970 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's go even deeper.

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:35.010 align:middle line:10%
Let's go back to Dr. Mario
Martinez in an "Inspirations"

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:39.120 align:middle line:10%
episode with Lisa Garr called
Rewriting the Genetic Code.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:43.335 align:middle line:84%
>> What would you say that these
centenarians have in common?

00:07:43.335 --> 00:07:45.210 align:middle line:10%
>> These things that
we're pointing out here,

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:47.980 align:middle line:10%
they have a tremendous
sense of humor.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:51.060 align:middle line:10%
The present is always an
opportunity to make decisions.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:52.590 align:middle line:10%
They know how to forgive--

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:55.170 align:middle line:10%
extremely important.

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.560 align:middle line:10%
It's that resilience, that
way of looking at things--

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.275 align:middle line:10%
>> And I asked them, do
you hate those people?

00:08:02.275 --> 00:08:03.650 align:middle line:10%
"I dislike him,
but I'm not going

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.370 align:middle line:10%
to waste any time
with people like that.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:08.520 align:middle line:90%
I have too many things to do."

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:12.480 align:middle line:84%
>> You may have heard the whole
adage of forgive and forget,

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.450 align:middle line:84%
but I take the Tupac
Shakur approach--

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:18.210 align:middle line:90%
forgive but don't forget.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.730 align:middle line:84%
Truthfully, there may
be no reason to forget.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:23.520 align:middle line:84%
It actually may not be
advantageous to forget.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.550 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:26.850 align:middle line:84%
So what is it about
our memory of the past,

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:31.600 align:middle line:84%
those things that we hold
onto that weigh us down?

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.990 align:middle line:84%
Could our burdens be
seen like bags of bricks?

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:37.809 align:middle line:84%
Things that we could
just simply put down.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:41.659 align:middle line:84%
If we don't need them anymore,
why are we holding them?

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:43.669 align:middle line:84%
So if we get better
at the skill of being

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:46.670 align:middle line:84%
able to notice when a burden
that does not serve you

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:47.660 align:middle line:90%
comes along--

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.680 align:middle line:84%
so you could just
simply put it down.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.220 align:middle line:90%
Here's a counterpoint though.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.370 align:middle line:84%
Do not be confused or
mistaken about the distinction

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:59.010 align:middle line:84%
between burdens and
responsibilities.

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:01.010 align:middle line:84%
Let's hold up our
end of the bargain

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:03.080 align:middle line:90%
and truly make it a skill--

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:06.170 align:middle line:84%
the ability to put down
things that do not serve us,

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:10.910 align:middle line:84%
but to hold on to those
things that do serve us.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:12.850 align:middle line:84%
So let's take another
look at the centenarians

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:17.380 align:middle line:84%
and see what skills do they have
that we can start tapping into.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:20.230 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
the film, "Ikaria--

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:24.057 align:middle line:84%
The Island Where
People Live Forever."

00:09:24.057 --> 00:09:24.890 align:middle line:10%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:27.500 align:middle line:10%
>> If I could turn back
time to when I was 30,

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.510 align:middle line:10%
I would have made the
same mistakes again.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:31.767 align:middle line:10%
>> You would have
still married me.

00:09:31.767 --> 00:09:33.100 align:middle line:10%
>> (LAUGHING) The same mistakes.

00:09:39.862 --> 00:09:40.820 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:44.810 align:middle line:10%
If you are not from
Ikaria, everything

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:45.810 align:middle line:10%
seems to be moving slow.

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.475 align:middle line:10%


00:09:48.475 --> 00:09:52.180 align:middle line:10%
But for Ikarians, this
is their natural rhythm.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.250 align:middle line:90%


00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:58.770 align:middle line:10%
They have a deep-rooted
philosophy--

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.650 align:middle line:10%
they dominate time.

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:05.640 align:middle line:10%
Time does not dominate them.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.060 align:middle line:10%
Their attitude
toward stress seems

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:10.000 align:middle line:10%
to help them tackle
their cardio illnesses.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.347 align:middle line:90%


00:10:14.347 --> 00:10:15.180 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:18.350 align:middle line:10%
Ikarians have a
certain wisdom when it

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:21.260 align:middle line:10%
comes to the pleasures of life.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:26.470 align:middle line:10%
They want to enjoy
human interaction.

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:31.590 align:middle line:10%
They are in touch
with immediate family.

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:36.910 align:middle line:10%
They have a calmness about
what may happen in the future.

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:40.793 align:middle line:10%
They do not have the stress that
consumes the rest of the world.

00:10:40.793 --> 00:10:43.900 align:middle line:90%


00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:47.590 align:middle line:84%
>> These centenarians on the
island of Ikaria seem to have

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:52.160 align:middle line:84%
a lot of tips and tricks on how
to stay young for a long time.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.610 align:middle line:84%
But the one I liked the
most was that they're not

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:56.470 align:middle line:90%
victims of time.

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:59.950 align:middle line:84%
They do not let themselves
be tossed around by the waves

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:01.540 align:middle line:90%
on the ocean of life.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.270 align:middle line:84%
They become the dance
partner of time,

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:07.600 align:middle line:84%
where there's this certain form
of harmony and communication

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.585 align:middle line:90%
between them.

00:11:09.585 --> 00:11:10.960 align:middle line:84%
But it's not the
things that they

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.140 align:middle line:90%
do, as much as how they do it--

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:17.860 align:middle line:84%
the attitude that they bring
to these circumstances,

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:22.510 align:middle line:84%
these situations, such
as smoking and drinking.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:25.630 align:middle line:84%
You've heard that these things
will cut minutes or years

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:26.780 align:middle line:90%
off your life.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:30.640 align:middle line:84%
But there are many centenarians
that smoke and drink.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.280 align:middle line:84%
George Burns is a
great example of that.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:37.450 align:middle line:84%
Every evening, have a cigar
and a shot of whiskey.

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:42.130 align:middle line:84%
If you can treat that moment
like a ritual, like a ceremony,

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:45.850 align:middle line:84%
with great reverence for
life, an attitude of happiness

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:49.540 align:middle line:84%
and joy that you get to
live these years longer,

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.910 align:middle line:90%
this seems to be the trick.

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:54.850 align:middle line:84%
So bringing a new you and a
new attitude into the things

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:56.920 align:middle line:90%
that you do is not new.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.810 align:middle line:84%
It's actually one
of the oldest things

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:01.540 align:middle line:84%
that you can see in
documented history.

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:04.010 align:middle line:84%
It's called a
ritual and ceremony.

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And when these tribes
would gather together

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:10.540 align:middle line:84%
for grand ceremonies, the entire
community would come together.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.600 align:middle line:84%
Everyone would put their
heart into the same thing,

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.780 align:middle line:84%
the same notion that
we should respect life

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:17.710 align:middle line:90%
around the elements.

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:21.460 align:middle line:84%
Tell stories, but do something
with that great attitude

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.950 align:middle line:90%
for life and living.

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:27.580 align:middle line:84%
This is beautiful, but
that's the old world.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:31.030 align:middle line:90%
What about the new world?

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:34.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's take a look at a film
called, "How to Live Forever--

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:38.950 align:middle line:84%
Results May Vary"
by Mark Wexler.

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:41.770 align:middle line:10%
>> I predict that
within about 10 years,

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:44.710 align:middle line:10%
so long as the funding for the
research is sufficiently good,

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:48.340 align:middle line:10%
we may have breakthroughs in
the laboratory in mice that will

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.890 align:middle line:10%
make it clear that it's only
a matter of time before we can

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:53.165 align:middle line:10%
essentially eliminate
aging in humans.

00:12:53.165 --> 00:12:55.540 align:middle line:10%
There's going to be a wide
variety of different stem cell

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:59.310 align:middle line:10%
therapies to repopulate
tissues that are losing cells.

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:00.900 align:middle line:10%
There's going to be
vaccines involved.

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:03.400 align:middle line:10%
There's almost certainly going
to be standard small molecule

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.547 align:middle line:10%
drugs involved--

00:13:04.547 --> 00:13:06.130 align:middle line:10%
lots of different
things put together.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:07.922 align:middle line:10%
Now, the aging process
will not, of course,

00:13:07.922 --> 00:13:09.640 align:middle line:10%
be eliminated from
the body in this way.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.620 align:middle line:10%
It'll be just like repair and
maintenance of the machine.

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.550 align:middle line:10%
So it'll need to be
reapplied periodically.

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:21.850 align:middle line:10%
>> The most significant
revolution of our lifetime will

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:24.250 align:middle line:10%
be the creation of
the ageless society.

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:27.640 align:middle line:84%
It will dwarf the
creation of the computer.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.040 align:middle line:10%
Aging is no longer inevitable.

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:34.390 align:middle line:10%
Anti-aging medicine is a very
contained, very scientific,

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:38.590 align:middle line:10%
very objective clinical science.

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:42.460 align:middle line:10%
But the anti-aging
marketplace, you know,

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:46.630 align:middle line:10%
is everything from
Botox to plastic surgery

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:48.690 align:middle line:10%
to sports medicine.

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:54.760 align:middle line:10%
So it's around the kernel of
what anti-aging medicine is.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Initially, I knew nothing
about calorie restriction

00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:58.510 align:middle line:84%
and didn't really
care about longevity.

00:13:58.510 --> 00:13:59.927 align:middle line:10%
I just went to the
medical library

00:13:59.927 --> 00:14:01.280 align:middle line:10%
to learn about nutrition.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:04.840 align:middle line:10%
And then I happened upon
Roy Walford's research with

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.560 align:middle line:10%
rodents, showing that when you
give them less-- in some cases,

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.350 align:middle line:10%
a lot less than what they
normally eat, 30%, 40%,

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:12.820 align:middle line:10%
45% less--

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:16.750 align:middle line:10%
they live much, much longer,
sometimes as much as 50% or 60%

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:19.060 align:middle line:10%
longer.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:20.770 align:middle line:84%
>> You may have
already guessed--

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:23.290 align:middle line:84%
all these things that
we've been told about aging

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:26.740 align:middle line:84%
and longevity, these future
technologies, these ideas,

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:29.140 align:middle line:84%
these methods,
they're in existence.

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:30.530 align:middle line:90%
They're here.

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:32.300 align:middle line:90%
They're already at our disposal.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.330 align:middle line:84%
If you have access
to the internet,

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.370 align:middle line:84%
all of this information is
readily available to you

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:40.660 align:middle line:90%
and all of your loved ones.

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:43.560 align:middle line:84%
It may be a common thing
to hear advice but not

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.480 align:middle line:84%
be able to employ
it in the moment,

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:49.170 align:middle line:84%
because we're too deeply
in our groove in the things

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:50.590 align:middle line:90%
that we always do.

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:54.490 align:middle line:84%
Even if we think about
the solution at the time,

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:58.290 align:middle line:84%
sometimes it seems difficult
to change our behavior.

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:01.440 align:middle line:84%
But as we look deeper into these
technologies and potentially

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:05.160 align:middle line:84%
future technologies-- things
that haven't been created yet--

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.160 align:middle line:84%
is it possible to
download our consciousness

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.500 align:middle line:90%
onto a computer database?

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.170 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible for us
to live consciously

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:17.070 align:middle line:84%
without a body in the
everlasting anatomy

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:19.098 align:middle line:90%
of a computer?

00:15:19.098 --> 00:15:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first
thing I have to go to

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:24.300 align:middle line:90%
is IBM's Blue Gene Project.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And in this, they are trying
to simulate the brain,

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:30.900 align:middle line:84%
because there's this belief
that the neuronal activity

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.270 align:middle line:84%
in the brain accounts for
all of our consciousness.

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:36.750 align:middle line:84%
So if you can have a computer
that has the same processing

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:39.750 align:middle line:84%
power as all of the
neurons in the human brain,

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:42.750 align:middle line:84%
then it's potential that you
could download consciousness

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:46.150 align:middle line:84%
into this computer
and live forever.

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:49.830 align:middle line:84%
So how is IBM's Blue Gene
Project coming along?

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:52.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, they have the
processing power now of a cat.

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:54.870 align:middle line:90%
That's excellent, right?

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:56.580 align:middle line:90%
Well, almost.

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:59.610 align:middle line:84%
It's about 100 times
slower than a cat.

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:02.220 align:middle line:90%
So they're not quite there yet.

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:03.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's this
Cambridge neuroscientist

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:06.940 align:middle line:84%
that I deeply respect,
Dr. Hannah Critchlow.

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:10.630 align:middle line:84%
Here's what she has to say
when somebody asked her,

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:13.120 align:middle line:90%
can we live inside a computer?

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:17.140 align:middle line:84%
Can our consciousness be
downloaded into a database?

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:20.410 align:middle line:84%
"People could probably
live inside a machine.

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:25.240 align:middle line:84%
Potentially, I think it is
definitely a possibility."

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.650 align:middle line:90%
Does that mean anything?

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:32.620 align:middle line:84%
She said probably, potentially,
possibly, definitely, maybe.

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:34.750 align:middle line:84%
We don't know, and
this is probably

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:38.080 align:middle line:84%
the best response she could have
given because we truly do not

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.600 align:middle line:90%
know if this is a possibility.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.170 align:middle line:10%
So I started looking
deeper into this question,

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:47.710 align:middle line:10%
and I happened upon Dr. Jeff
Hawkins, one of the best

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:51.070 align:middle line:10%
researchers on what
is intelligence

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:55.840 align:middle line:10%
and can intelligence be
reproduced by a computer.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:59.170 align:middle line:10%
Well, he says flat out
we're not even close yet,

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:03.620 align:middle line:10%
because we don't even understand
the mechanisms of our brain.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Many people believe that
our brains store data.

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:08.140 align:middle line:90%
But as he's saying, it does not.

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:10.359 align:middle line:90%
Computers store data.

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:14.920 align:middle line:84%
Our brains recall
sequences of patterns.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Our brains don't even store
the sequences of patterns.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.650 align:middle line:84%
They recall the
sequences of patterns.

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:24.880 align:middle line:10%
What he actually says, this
very grounded researcher,

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:28.690 align:middle line:10%
he says that these sequences
of patterns are stored

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:32.350 align:middle line:10%
holographically,
extra-cerebrally,

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:34.390 align:middle line:10%
outside of the mind--

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:37.540 align:middle line:10%
meaning having less
to do with neurology

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:41.230 align:middle line:10%
and more to do with our ability
to access consciousness,

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:46.670 align:middle line:10%
access the mind, access
these sequences of patterns.

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:50.530 align:middle line:84%
So that's a very good point to
show us that we may not even

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:52.250 align:middle line:90%
be close to this.

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:54.430 align:middle line:84%
But the real point that
I'm getting at is--

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:58.120 align:middle line:84%
let's just say we could
live to 200 years.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Let's just say the average
lifespan could be 500 years.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:05.010 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's just go all
the way to 1,000 years.

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:08.760 align:middle line:84%
How would that change
things on this planet?

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Would retirement age
still be 65 if you're

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:14.520 align:middle line:90%
going to live to 1,000?

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.730 align:middle line:10%
Would we all be rushing out
to have a job by the age of 20

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:21.240 align:middle line:10%
or get married at
the age of 20, 25

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.658 align:middle line:10%
if we live to 1,000 years old?

00:18:23.658 --> 00:18:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And what are some
of the changes that

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.810 align:middle line:84%
would happen, that we can't
even wrap our minds around,

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:32.160 align:middle line:84%
because our life expectancy
is roughly 70, 80?

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.200 align:middle line:90%
How would it improve the wisdom?

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Remember those archmaesters
that hold the wisdom

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:38.430 align:middle line:90%
and the knowledge of the world?

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:42.430 align:middle line:84%
How would the sciences, the
religions, the philosophies,

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:44.820 align:middle line:90%
the arts be changed?

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.680 align:middle line:90%
Would they be enriched?

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.360 align:middle line:90%
Would they deteriorate?

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:53.985 align:middle line:84%
Would living longer actually
give you a better life?

00:18:53.985 --> 00:18:56.910 align:middle line:84%
Would living longer
on this planet truly

00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:59.850 align:middle line:84%
mean that you are
living a better life?

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:03.520 align:middle line:84%
Because if we are a riddle
figuring ourselves out,

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.540 align:middle line:90%
what does that mean?

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:06.810 align:middle line:84%
Do we need to spend
more time on this planet

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:09.750 align:middle line:90%
or do we need more presence?

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:12.750 align:middle line:84%
I would hazard to say
we need more presence,

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:17.020 align:middle line:84%
that way we can live
those years more fully.

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:19.890 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm going to toss it off
to somebody I really respect.

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:23.010 align:middle line:90%
Her name's Kimberly Gamble.

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:26.060 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm watching my wrinkly
arms and hands and stuff,

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.140 align:middle line:10%
and I just love it.

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.300 align:middle line:10%
I feel so grateful
that I love it,

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:33.270 align:middle line:10%
because I know the whole
aging thing in this culture

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:35.940 align:middle line:10%
is just horrible for women.

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:36.740 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.282 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's like
this, if you're not

00:19:38.282 --> 00:19:40.090 align:middle line:90%
young there's no use for you.

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And thankfully, I'm
not experiencing that.

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:46.460 align:middle line:10%
And instead, I'm
feeling it like my body

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:50.740 align:middle line:10%
is this constant spiritual
teacher, because it's

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:53.290 align:middle line:10%
so transient like everything.

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:58.270 align:middle line:10%
And I'm watching myself kind of
wrinkle out of it in some way.

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:02.170 align:middle line:90%


00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:05.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Man, I love these
words by Kimberly.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.910 align:middle line:84%
It's so beautiful
to hear somebody

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:11.140 align:middle line:84%
who's living it and also
embracing those years of age.

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:13.330 align:middle line:84%
Because isn't that
truly the trick?

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:16.870 align:middle line:84%
Embracing the coming
of age, seeing it

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:21.230 align:middle line:84%
as a gift, something that
can teach us about ourselves.

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:25.250 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not so much about
the quantity of our years,

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:27.710 align:middle line:90%
but the quality of our years.

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:29.330 align:middle line:90%
Time is a tool.

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:30.650 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:33.260 align:middle line:90%
It's what we do with time.

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:38.820 align:middle line:84%
I believe the best way we can
approach aging and longevity is

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:43.650 align:middle line:84%
to take all that wisdom, not
to amass a fortune of time,

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:48.180 align:middle line:84%
but to amass a fortune of
wisdom, not just for us,

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:52.170 align:middle line:84%
not for self-serving reasons,
but to serve the planet,

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:54.130 align:middle line:90%
to serve others--

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:57.180 align:middle line:84%
to bring more real
wisdom, real solutions

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:59.790 align:middle line:84%
to the human condition,
the human problems,

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:02.410 align:middle line:90%
the global issues that we face.

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:03.820 align:middle line:90%
This would be the purpose.

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:07.330 align:middle line:84%
This would be the
quality of our years.

Martin Luther King Jr.
said, "If a man has not

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:13.150 align:middle line:84%
discovered something
that he will die for,

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:14.410 align:middle line:90%
then he isn't fit to live."

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:23.460 align:middle line:90%
So here's my challenge for you--

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:25.710 align:middle line:90%
find what you would die for.

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:28.800 align:middle line:84%
Find what you believe is to
be the most important reason

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:32.510 align:middle line:84%
why you are here on this
planet, and don't hoard it.

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:33.310 align:middle line:90%
Share it.

once, in the next coming week

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:46.850 align:middle line:10%
or in your entire
lifetime, then I truly

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:49.520 align:middle line:10%
honor and respect that
choice that you made,

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.290 align:middle line:10%
