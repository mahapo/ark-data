00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.180 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.790 align:middle line:90%
>> What is human potential?

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.470 align:middle line:90%
Just how far can it take us?

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.980 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.680 align:middle line:84%
What if I were to tell you
that the purpose of our highest

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.740 align:middle line:84%
potential is to transcend
limited thinking

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.970 align:middle line:84%
and bring it into superhuman
or cosmic consciousness?

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.460 align:middle line:90%
Hi, I'm Ben Stewart.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.610 align:middle line:10%
Welcome to the nexus point
between your old life

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.810 align:middle line:10%
and your new self.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.650 align:middle line:84%
In this series, we will be
unlocking the deepest mysteries

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.550 align:middle line:90%
of our human potential.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And as with all
great journeys, we

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.700 align:middle line:84%
will begin with the unparalleled
power of the question mark.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.770 align:middle line:90%
Just what are we capable of?

00:00:48.770 --> 00:01:00.650 align:middle line:90%


00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.720 align:middle line:84%
When you look at
yourself in the mirror,

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.250 align:middle line:84%
do you see that
what you are right

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.270 align:middle line:84%
now, the finished
product, no more no less?

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.180 align:middle line:84%
Or do you see that what you
are capable of becoming?

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.140 align:middle line:84%
The only thing standing between
you, who and what you are now,

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.050 align:middle line:84%
and a future filled with
unlimited possibilities

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.050 align:middle line:84%
is a belief that you hold
about you and the world

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.670 align:middle line:90%
that you live in.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.620 align:middle line:84%
So when I say the words full
potential or peak potential,

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.580 align:middle line:84%
what does that conjure
up in your mind?

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.330 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of?

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Do you think of the people that
can lift the heaviest weights,

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.120 align:middle line:84%
run the fastest,
jump the highest,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.100 align:middle line:90%
hold the breath the longest?

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.640 align:middle line:84%
What about withstanding the
most extreme conditions?

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.510 align:middle line:84%
Or super memory, super
recall, the ability

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.510 align:middle line:84%
to read faster
than anybody else?

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.030 align:middle line:84%
Are these the
things you think of?

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And mind you, that everything
that I've just mentioned

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.760 align:middle line:84%
are truly the outward or
more masculine qualities.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.770 align:middle line:84%
What about the
feminine qualities,

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.700 align:middle line:84%
the ones that are more
hidden, such as intuition,

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.610 align:middle line:84%
grace in the face
of great adversity,

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.320 align:middle line:84%
compassion when
it's needed most,

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.270 align:middle line:84%
and fertility, being
pregnant with possibility?

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.150 align:middle line:84%
These are less measurable
and so less talked about.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.050 align:middle line:84%
But they're just as, if not
more important in the path

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.920 align:middle line:90%
of our greatest potential.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.360 align:middle line:84%
So I liken our human potential
with a seed or plant.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.370 align:middle line:84%
Once the conditions are set,
enough food, water, light,

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.900 align:middle line:90%
it will simply grow.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.320 align:middle line:90%
No force required.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.830 align:middle line:84%
In fact, force will
only hinder it.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.240 align:middle line:84%
So are the conditions for
your potential to grow set?

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.060 align:middle line:84%
And if not, what's
holding you back?

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:54.440 align:middle line:84%
Are there people,
forces, situations, vows

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.640 align:middle line:84%
and commitments that you've
made, a form of self sabotage

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.280 align:middle line:84%
that you engage in
that holds you back

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.990 align:middle line:90%
from what you could become?

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.820 align:middle line:84%
So I'll ask you
one more question.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.090 align:middle line:84%
The word impossible,
what does it mean to you?

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.420 align:middle line:84%
If you think of it, this
word will inscribe itself

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.360 align:middle line:84%
into your brain and
into your behavior.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.890 align:middle line:84%
So be very careful of
how you define that word.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, the brain isn't the
only and most important

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.940 align:middle line:90%
organ that we have.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.920 align:middle line:84%
But it is the one
that neuroscientists

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.350 align:middle line:84%
and modern science seems
to focus on the most.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.390 align:middle line:90%
So let's just start right there.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.770 align:middle line:90%
The brain.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:37.310 align:middle line:84%
Two hemispheres and three
lobes, very uniquely set up.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.260 align:middle line:10%
And even though there's
been a little bit

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.560 align:middle line:10%
of a myth in the past that the
right hemisphere is completely

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.250 align:middle line:10%
creative and the left
hemisphere is totally logical,

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.260 align:middle line:10%
this has been
dispelled to a bit,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.870 align:middle line:10%
but neuroimaging has
helped us see that we

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.730 align:middle line:10%
do have two distinct brains.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.330 align:middle line:10%
And they think
distinctly different.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.130 align:middle line:84%
So now let's take a
look at a series called

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.050 align:middle line:90%
"Steps Away from the Future."

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.457 align:middle line:84%
This episode called "The
Hidden Side of the Brain"

00:04:02.457 --> 00:04:04.790 align:middle line:84%
will show you something about
the evolution of our brain

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:05.957 align:middle line:90%
that you may not have known.

00:04:05.957 --> 00:04:08.670 align:middle line:90%


00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.910 align:middle line:10%
>> Of course, talking about the
left side and the right side

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.740 align:middle line:10%
of the brain is
a simplification.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.010 align:middle line:10%
Our brain isn't a map, as
people used to assume naively

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.149 align:middle line:10%
in the last century.

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:21.540 align:middle line:10%
It's characterized by an
astonishing plasticity, which

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.050 align:middle line:10%
localizes on the right side
of the brain functions, that,

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.510 align:middle line:10%
or on the left side
and other people.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.630 align:middle line:10%
Nevertheless, in most
cases, the functions

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.970 align:middle line:10%
of analysis and logical
reasoning are on the left,

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.330 align:middle line:10%
whereas visual and intuitive
functions are on the right.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.460 align:middle line:10%
There's a snowstorm
on the little city

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.280 align:middle line:10%
of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.920 align:middle line:10%
This is where Dr.
Darold Treffert lives.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.100 align:middle line:10%
This psychiatrist has
dedicated 40 years of his life

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.560 align:middle line:10%
to the Savant syndrome.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.570 align:middle line:10%
>> We are a left
hemisphere society.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.250 align:middle line:10%
We depend on our
left hemisphere.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.100 align:middle line:10%
It serves us well, logical,
sequential thinking, language,

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.852 align:middle line:10%
things that have served as well.

00:05:00.852 --> 00:05:02.310 align:middle line:10%
They serve us so
well that we begin

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.650 align:middle line:10%
to use only that
well-worn pathway, sort

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.210 align:middle line:10%
of to the neglect of
the rest of the brain,

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.670 align:middle line:10%
the right hemisphere.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.538 align:middle line:10%
Yet, some people call that the
tyranny of the left hemisphere.

00:05:12.538 --> 00:05:15.890 align:middle line:90%


00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:21.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Now the human brain went from
1,440 grams about 150,000 years

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.680 align:middle line:10%
ago, and then it put it into
reverse and brought it back

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.110 align:middle line:10%
to 1,300 grams meaning our brain
has shrunk in the past 150,000

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.170 align:middle line:10%
years.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:34.210 align:middle line:84%
So the question we must
ask ourselves is why?

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.970 align:middle line:10%
There is a book called
"Return to the Brain of Eden"

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.340 align:middle line:10%
by Tony Wright and
Graham Gynn, and they've

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.010 align:middle line:10%
done amazing work looking
at just this question.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.210 align:middle line:84%
In this book, they also
talk about Savant syndrome,

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.370 align:middle line:84%
the amazing ability
for our brain

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.130 align:middle line:84%
to be able to incur
some kind of a damage

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.260 align:middle line:84%
and then the healthy
parts of the brain

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.460 align:middle line:90%
take over those functionalities.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.972 align:middle line:84%
These Savants actually have
a gift that no one else has.

00:06:00.972 --> 00:06:03.430 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to go back to
"Steps Away from the Future,"

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.310 align:middle line:84%
and that episode "The
Hidden Side of the Brain,"

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.440 align:middle line:84%
because they dive
a little bit deeper

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.000 align:middle line:90%
into this Savant syndrome.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.080 align:middle line:90%


00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Kim Peek was the inspiration
for the movie "Rain Man,"

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.070 align:middle line:10%
and I was a consultant
to the movie.

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:18.890 align:middle line:10%
And that's where we first met.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.680 align:middle line:10%
Kim is what I call the
Mount Everest of memory.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.210 align:middle line:10%
He has memorized 12,000
books, word for word.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.080 align:middle line:10%
He has a factual memory within
15 areas of expertise that

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.260 align:middle line:10%
simply history,
biography, in the Bible,

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.427 align:middle line:10%
you simply cannot stump him.

00:06:34.427 --> 00:06:36.260 align:middle line:10%
And one of the most
amazing things about him

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.460 align:middle line:10%
is that he reads so quickly,
he reads one page with one eye,

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.770 align:middle line:10%
and he reads the other
page with the other eye,

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.370 align:middle line:10%
and immediately goes to his hard
disk, and it's stored there.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.600 align:middle line:10%
I keep saying at some point, the
image has to come up disk full,

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.740 align:middle line:10%
but it never does.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.940 align:middle line:10%
>> The human brain is
divided into two hemispheres,

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.740 align:middle line:10%
and they have two very
different functions.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.610 align:middle line:10%
So this is a human brain.

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.903 align:middle line:10%
And so you're looking now at the
external surface of the brain.

00:07:06.903 --> 00:07:08.070 align:middle line:10%
This is the left hemisphere.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.713 align:middle line:10%
This is the right hemisphere.

00:07:09.713 --> 00:07:11.130 align:middle line:10%
And you can see
here, that they're

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.500 align:middle line:10%
divided into two halves.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.920 align:middle line:10%
And the two hemispheres process
different kinds of information

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.520 align:middle line:10%
in different ways.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.720 align:middle line:10%
So the right hemisphere
is all about experiencing

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.290 align:middle line:10%
the present moment.

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:25.860 align:middle line:10%
It's all about right
here, right now.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.530 align:middle line:10%
In the right here right now,
there are no boundaries.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:31.140 align:middle line:10%
Everything is
perceived as energy.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:35.310 align:middle line:10%
And so the atoms and molecules
just experience the energy,

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:38.250 align:middle line:10%
and they blend with one another,
so that there's the big picture

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:39.190 align:middle line:10%
vision.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:42.180 align:middle line:10%
So the right hemisphere
thinks in pictures,

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.610 align:middle line:10%
and it's all about the
right here right now.

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:48.030 align:middle line:10%
The left hemisphere takes
that present moment experience

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.370 align:middle line:10%
and then breaks it
down into details.

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:55.320 align:middle line:10%
And part of the details is our
language, our ability to speak,

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.810 align:middle line:10%
our ability to make
sound, our ability

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.420 align:middle line:10%
to place meaning on that sound.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:04.410 align:middle line:10%
And part of that sound is
my ability to say I am.

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:06.570 align:middle line:10%
I am an individual.

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.030 align:middle line:10%
And as soon as I
say I am, then I

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:13.110 align:middle line:10%
exist separate from all
of the energy around me.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:15.720 align:middle line:10%
So the two hemispheres
work together in order

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:19.480 align:middle line:10%
for us to have a single
perception of reality.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:24.120 align:middle line:10%
>> And so there is that huge
store of material in all of us,

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.880 align:middle line:10%
and the question is how can
we access that without having

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.490 align:middle line:10%
an injury or some kind
of central nervous system

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:30.458 align:middle line:10%
catastrophe?

00:08:30.458 --> 00:08:32.750 align:middle line:10%
And that's where our research
is leading us these days.

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:36.169 align:middle line:90%


00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:39.260 align:middle line:84%
>> The process of
neuroplasticity is the ability

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.559 align:middle line:84%
for our brain and certain
regions of it to adopt

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:45.440 align:middle line:84%
functions of the injured
portions of the brain.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.410 align:middle line:84%
But without injury, you can
still prompt neuroplasticity,

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:52.580 align:middle line:84%
which is the restructuring
of your brain,

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:59.540 align:middle line:84%
simply by things like new and
novel forms of moving the body,

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:03.950 align:middle line:84%
outside the box
ways of thinking,

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:08.720 align:middle line:84%
and also sinking the body
and mind, very intelligently.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And these are ways
that, without injury, we

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:14.130 align:middle line:84%
can actually prompt
neuroplasticity,

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:16.610 align:middle line:90%
the restructuring of our brain.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:19.910 align:middle line:84%
There's even tasks like
using your less dominant hand

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:23.630 align:middle line:84%
to write, to brush your teeth,
open doors with, shake hands

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:27.920 align:middle line:84%
with, even using your less
dominant foot to kick or jump

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.990 align:middle line:90%
or take your first step with.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:33.530 align:middle line:84%
These things prompt
neuroplasticity.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:36.140 align:middle line:84%
But the question
I have for you now

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:40.250 align:middle line:84%
is how far can
neuroplasticity truly take us?

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.190 align:middle line:10%
Let's take a look at a
film called "Sonic Magic--

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:46.860 align:middle line:10%
The Wonder of
Science and Sound."

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:50.660 align:middle line:10%
>> Bats actually see with sound.

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:55.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Perhaps even more astonishing
is the fact that some humans

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.690 align:middle line:10%
are able to do the same thing.

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:00.690 align:middle line:10%
>> So we've got a tree here.

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:02.900 align:middle line:10%
I'll turn here.

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:07.040 align:middle line:10%
>> By 13 months of age,
Daniel Kish had lost both eyes

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.010 align:middle line:10%
to a cancer called
retinoblastoma.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:13.580 align:middle line:10%
Instinctively, he soon began
to make a clicking sounds

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:17.720 align:middle line:10%
and started to echo
locate just like bats do.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.450 align:middle line:10%
Those clicks you hear
are from his mouth, not

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:22.610 align:middle line:10%
the tapping of his cane.

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:27.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Big open area, but we're
approaching a structure.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.420 align:middle line:10%
>> He calls this flash sonar.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.170 align:middle line:10%
[CLICKING]

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:36.790 align:middle line:10%
Flash sonar has become Kish's
primary means of navigation.

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:39.123 align:middle line:10%
>> So in my case, it wasn't
something I was really aware

00:10:39.123 --> 00:10:39.923 align:middle line:10%
of.

00:10:39.923 --> 00:10:41.620 align:middle line:10%
It just happened
as a consequence

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:43.570 align:middle line:10%
of my childhood experiences.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:45.670 align:middle line:10%
[CLICKING]

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:53.140 align:middle line:10%
I get an image that occurs
in a 360 degree field.

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:58.840 align:middle line:10%
The roof structure we're under
isn't totally solid somehow.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:03.820 align:middle line:10%
It's got openings in it,
as if it were slatted or--

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:07.270 align:middle line:10%
I describe them
as fuzzy geometry,

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:10.840 align:middle line:10%
moving, dynamic figures.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:14.080 align:middle line:10%
They have depth and
contour and character,

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.780 align:middle line:10%
and they provide
me with information

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.220 align:middle line:10%
about location, density.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:22.000 align:middle line:10%
And you can also kind of
hear things around corners,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.770 align:middle line:10%
and you can hear
things through objects.

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:27.936 align:middle line:10%
So you know, it always has this
kind of omnipresence about it.

00:11:27.936 --> 00:11:30.366 align:middle line:10%
[CLICKING]

00:11:30.366 --> 00:11:36.690 align:middle line:90%


00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:40.230 align:middle line:10%
As a kid, I was raised
to think of myself

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:44.400 align:middle line:10%
as pretty unremarkable.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:51.040 align:middle line:10%
My parents, their emphasis,
their regard for me was you're

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.360 align:middle line:10%
a kid like any other kid.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:58.620 align:middle line:10%
>> We asked him to draw a
picture to recreate from memory

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:02.430 align:middle line:10%
the image he got from nothing
more than the sound of clicks.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:05.930 align:middle line:10%
>> I'll just do a
little dash line here.

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:09.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And remember, he had never
set foot in this pavilion

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:10.710 align:middle line:90%
before today.

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:14.070 align:middle line:10%
>> And then we had another
column kind of across the way

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:15.300 align:middle line:10%
here.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:19.110 align:middle line:84%
Definitely taxing my
artistic merits here.

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:20.190 align:middle line:90%
Should I say tada?

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:22.440 align:middle line:10%
Tada!

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:26.310 align:middle line:10%
>> The accuracy of
the image is uncanny.

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:29.700 align:middle line:10%
>> It shows that there is an
actual imaging process taking

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.180 align:middle line:10%
place.

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:35.020 align:middle line:10%
You're using sound instead
of light to create a picture.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:39.700 align:middle line:90%


00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.740 align:middle line:84%
>> We are truly
adaptable creatures.

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:44.020 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what
this video showed me.

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And Daniel Kish is one of
the best examples of this.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:47.950 align:middle line:90%
He didn't injure his brain.

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:49.240 align:middle line:90%
He injured his eyes.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.310 align:middle line:90%
Yet his brain still adapted.

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:54.640 align:middle line:84%
He received the gift that
most anybody in the world

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.810 align:middle line:84%
will never receive, simply
because the conditions arose,

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:01.700 align:middle line:84%
and he said yes
to the challenge.

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:05.140 align:middle line:84%
So now I want to ask you
that first question again.

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.750 align:middle line:84%
What does impossible
mean to you?

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And are you willing to believe
that you can't do something

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.020 align:middle line:90%
if you've never tried it?

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.270 align:middle line:84%
I want to bring your attention
to some people who have

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:17.700 align:middle line:90%
overcome extreme adversity.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.920 align:middle line:10%
One of them is Viktor Frankl.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:24.270 align:middle line:84%
In World War II, he was
experimented on and tortured.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:26.880 align:middle line:84%
In many ways, all
the people around him

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.360 align:middle line:84%
that were healthier,
stronger, smarter,

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.660 align:middle line:84%
all of their life expectancies
were dropping to zero,

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.560 align:middle line:90%
and many of them were dying.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.790 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't fathom the amount
of pain that they were under,

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:40.950 align:middle line:90%
but Victor survived.

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:45.210 align:middle line:84%
He did so, and he said
later, why, why he believes

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:48.190 align:middle line:84%
he survived such
incredible atrocities.

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And it was because he knew
that he must tell people

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:52.980 align:middle line:90%
about his journey.

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:55.410 align:middle line:84%
He had some work to
do in the future.

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:58.560 align:middle line:84%
This gave him purpose
that superseded

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.860 align:middle line:84%
all of the pain and the
suffering he was going through.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:04.050 align:middle line:10%
Victor was quoted as
saying, "Everything

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:07.140 align:middle line:10%
can be taken from a
man, but one thing,

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:11.070 align:middle line:10%
the last of the human freedoms,
to choose one's attitude

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:13.440 align:middle line:10%
in any given set
of circumstances,

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.840 align:middle line:10%
to choose one's own way."

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.140 align:middle line:10%
Another example is
Stephen Hawking.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:22.150 align:middle line:10%
He had a amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:25.870 align:middle line:84%
A British scientist with
amazing accomplishments,

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:27.240 align:middle line:90%
he fathered children.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:31.110 align:middle line:10%
He authored many very
pivotal scientific books, all

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:33.040 align:middle line:10%
without the use of his body.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.820 align:middle line:10%
Then there's Frida Kahlo,
stricken with polio

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:39.720 align:middle line:10%
at an early age, suffered
a very severe car accident,

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.360 align:middle line:10%
and had chronic pain in
her back for the rest

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.840 align:middle line:10%
of her life in a way that most
people would be bedridden,

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.100 align:middle line:10%
but not Frida.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.020 align:middle line:90%
She knew she had to paint.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.330 align:middle line:84%
She knew she had
to express herself.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:55.620 align:middle line:84%
So she did, and she
became a renowned painter.

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:57.480 align:middle line:10%
Then there's Helen Keller.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Born deaf and blind and
despite these setbacks,

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:03.870 align:middle line:84%
despite two of her
greatest sense organs

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:07.050 align:middle line:84%
being taken from her
from birth, she still

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:10.590 align:middle line:84%
authored about 400
articles, several books,

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:13.005 align:middle line:84%
was involved in women's
rights and politics.

00:15:13.005 --> 00:15:17.440 align:middle line:90%


00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.540 align:middle line:10%
And even Albert
Einstein, thought

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:22.480 align:middle line:10%
to have dyslexia and maybe
even Asperger's, didn't

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.300 align:middle line:10%
speak until the age of four.

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.820 align:middle line:84%
Although he is one of the most
celebrated scientific minds

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.880 align:middle line:84%
in history, he is quoted as
saying, "Everybody is a genius.

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.050 align:middle line:84%
But if you judge a fish by
its ability to climb a tree,

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:37.810 align:middle line:84%
it will spend its whole life
believing that it is stupid."

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:41.860 align:middle line:90%


00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.110 align:middle line:84%
Side note, none of
these individuals

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:47.700 align:middle line:84%
went down in history as
the people with poor luck.

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:52.920 align:middle line:84%
They are known for
incredible accomplishments.

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:56.000 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to bring it
deeper, the shamans,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.690 align:middle line:84%
stories of shamans that go back
many, many thousands of years.

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:02.390 align:middle line:84%
Many of these stories
actually begin

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:05.180 align:middle line:84%
when the shaman suffered
some kind of an injury

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:08.960 align:middle line:84%
or had a fever that prompted
innate capacities to come out

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.390 align:middle line:90%
that they never knew they had.

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:14.000 align:middle line:84%
So by taking a look
at these stories,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.530 align:middle line:84%
were these individuals just the
crazy people in the society?

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:20.150 align:middle line:90%
Not the shamans.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:21.920 align:middle line:84%
The shamans were
looked at as one

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:25.190 align:middle line:84%
of the most respected
and heralded positions

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:26.510 align:middle line:90%
in any tribe.

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:29.390 align:middle line:84%
The information that they
would bring back to the tribe

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:33.440 align:middle line:84%
was so useful that they were one
of the most respected roles you

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.990 align:middle line:90%
could imagine in any tribe.

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And one hallmark of shamans
is entering an altered state.

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:43.250 align:middle line:84%
One of the ways they did
this was through the use

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:45.260 align:middle line:90%
of psychedelic plants.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to take a
look at a Gaia original series

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:50.930 align:middle line:90%
called "Psychedelica."

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:53.660 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the fundamental
effects of psychedelics is

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:57.290 align:middle line:10%
to integrate material that's
normally not accessible

00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:59.930 align:middle line:10%
to consciousness, and the
fundamental way in which

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:02.900 align:middle line:10%
psychedelics make this
information available is

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:06.140 align:middle line:10%
by a destabilizing of what's
called the default mode

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.140 align:middle line:10%
network, this part of the
brain that integrates our sense

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:12.050 align:middle line:10%
of self, our
autobiographical memories,

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:13.940 align:middle line:10%
and our reflection
upon our lives.

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.310 align:middle line:10%
So basically, what's
happening under psychedelics

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:19.790 align:middle line:10%
is a liberation of the parts
of the brain that 80% or 90%

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:21.800 align:middle line:10%
of the brain that
they say we don't use.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.650 align:middle line:10%
And we use it, but we're
just not able to access it.

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:27.470 align:middle line:10%
Psychedelics give us
access to that unconscious.

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:31.700 align:middle line:10%
>> The language facility in the
brain is destabilized as well.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:34.010 align:middle line:10%
So the combination
of our self identity

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:35.960 align:middle line:10%
and our language
being put off balance

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.600 align:middle line:10%
by simply ingesting
a plant gives rise

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.610 align:middle line:10%
to the ineffability
of the experience.

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:45.620 align:middle line:10%
Just as we see with any mystical
or spiritual experience,

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:48.350 align:middle line:10%
words are not enough to
communicate the magnitude

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:49.310 align:middle line:10%
of the experience.

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:55.430 align:middle line:90%


00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:57.680 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to reiterate what
Michael Winkelman had said

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.270 align:middle line:90%
right there.

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:02.480 align:middle line:84%
80% to 90% of our brains
that we're not accessing.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.610 align:middle line:84%
Now this brings up
a myth, and the myth

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:07.430 align:middle line:84%
is that we only use
10% of our brains.

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:09.620 align:middle line:84%
But that's talking
about neural activity.

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.680 align:middle line:84%
It's not talking
about potential.

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
the myth comes in,

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:18.320 align:middle line:84%
because George Leonard
actually explains in the 1960s,

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.140 align:middle line:84%
he researched 37
psychiatrist, brain

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:25.610 align:middle line:84%
researchers, and specialists on
the topic of human potential.

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And he said, not
one of them were

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:30.140 align:middle line:84%
quoted as saying that
we use more than 10%

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:33.950 align:middle line:84%
of our power, our ability
to learn and perform,

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:37.880 align:middle line:84%
calculating and creative
cognitive tasks.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:41.120 align:middle line:10%
George Leonard wrote a
book called "Mastery,"

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.750 align:middle line:10%
and he says, "We fail to
realize that mastery is not

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:45.980 align:middle line:10%
about perfection.

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:49.130 align:middle line:90%
It's about a process, a journey.

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:51.650 align:middle line:84%
The master is the one
who stays on the path day

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:54.320 align:middle line:90%
after day, year after year.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:58.250 align:middle line:84%
The master is the one who is
willing to try and fail and try

00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:03.230 align:middle line:84%
again for as long
as he or she lives."

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.600 align:middle line:84%
So now I want to ask
you again a question

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.820 align:middle line:90%
that I asked you before.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:13.450 align:middle line:84%
What is holding you back from
the rest of your potential?

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And if you keep going beneath
all the layers, deeper

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:19.130 align:middle line:84%
and deeper, you'll
come to realize

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:22.870 align:middle line:84%
what most people come to realize
when they ask these questions,

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:26.780 align:middle line:84%
and that's the only thing
holding you back is you.

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:31.850 align:middle line:10%
Author and podcaster Tim Ferriss
said that fear is your friend.

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:33.590 align:middle line:10%
It is an indicator.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:36.410 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes it will show
you what you shouldn't do,

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:40.880 align:middle line:84%
but more often than not, it
shows you what you should do,

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.510 align:middle line:84%
meaning that there is a
gift hidden, encrypted

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:46.240 align:middle line:90%
inside all of our fears.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And instead of
running from them,

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:53.450 align:middle line:84%
ignoring them, pushing them
away, actually embracing them,

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:56.300 align:middle line:84%
facing them, and seeing
what they have to say

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.300 align:middle line:90%
is where the true gift lies.

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.040 align:middle line:84%
I personally believe
that we are not

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.850 align:middle line:84%
held back by conditions or
principles of the universe,

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:08.690 align:middle line:84%
as much as we are held back
by a lack of imagination

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:11.330 align:middle line:84%
and a lack of clarity
on what we truly want

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:14.222 align:middle line:90%
to work towards in our lives.

00:20:14.222 --> 00:20:15.680 align:middle line:84%
We know that the
power of belief is

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:20.330 align:middle line:84%
something that is talked about,
sometimes is exaggerated about.

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:25.040 align:middle line:84%
But the placebo effect is one
example of the incredible power

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.930 align:middle line:90%
of the mind and belief.

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:29.450 align:middle line:84%
We know that all
pharmaceutical trials

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:32.960 align:middle line:84%
have to set up and beat
the placebo effect in order

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.350 align:middle line:90%
to go to market.

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And we give all the credit
to the pharmaceuticals.

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:40.690 align:middle line:84%
But we don't give any credit
to the placebo effect,

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:43.040 align:middle line:90%
the power of belief.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And the reductionists and the
scientists may scoff at this

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:49.330 align:middle line:84%
and say that we exaggerate
a little bit too much.

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:52.380 align:middle line:84%
But if something
works, it simply works.

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And the power of
belief does just that.

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.800 align:middle line:84%
We're living in a
very unique world, one

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.960 align:middle line:90%
that we scarcely understand.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.240 align:middle line:84%
Even the scientists
will agree on this.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:05.430 align:middle line:84%
Albert Einstein, who
we already mentioned,

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:08.280 align:middle line:84%
one of the most celebrated
scientific minds in all

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:12.480 align:middle line:84%
of history, is quoted as saying
that, "Time and space are

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:17.800 align:middle line:84%
modes by which we think and not
conditions in which we live."

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:18.600 align:middle line:90%
Think about that.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.750 align:middle line:84%
That's a powerful statement,
one of the fathers

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:26.040 align:middle line:84%
of modern science saying
that time and space are not

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:30.590 align:middle line:84%
conditions outside of us,
but modes by which we think.

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:33.930 align:middle line:90%
And thinking can be changed.

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:37.350 align:middle line:84%
At the same time that
Albert Einstein fathered

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:41.490 align:middle line:84%
one branch of science,
being modern physics,

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:43.980 align:middle line:84%
another branch was
birthed, and this

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:47.390 align:middle line:84%
is the branch of quantum
physics and quantum mechanics.

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:51.000 align:middle line:10%
And Niels Bohr said that if
quantum mechanics has not

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.240 align:middle line:10%
profoundly shocked you, then
you haven't understood it yet.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:57.240 align:middle line:84%
Now in this series,
we will go deeper

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.790 align:middle line:84%
into the quantum phenomena
and the implications

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:04.860 align:middle line:84%
that it has on our path
towards our potential.

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:07.240 align:middle line:84%
But for now, just
realize that there

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:09.880 align:middle line:90%
is a world beneath this world.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:13.930 align:middle line:84%
The fabric of our reality
is much more peculiar

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:15.160 align:middle line:90%
than we've thought.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:18.070 align:middle line:84%
This fabric responds
to our thinking.

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:20.620 align:middle line:84%
It engages with
our consciousness.

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:24.070 align:middle line:90%
And it exists all around us.

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:28.410 align:middle line:84%
So where do we begin in such
a weird and trippy world?

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:33.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, humbly I believe we begin
right where we're at, no more,

00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:36.360 align:middle line:84%
no less, by removing
the obstacles that we

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.360 align:middle line:90%
have placed in our own way.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:43.590 align:middle line:10%
Aeschylus, a Greek playwright,
said that from a small seed

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:47.100 align:middle line:10%
a mighty trunk may grow.

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:49.230 align:middle line:84%
So that seed of
your potential, will

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:53.460 align:middle line:84%
grow into a mighty tree that can
withstand thousands of storms.

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:58.200 align:middle line:84%
This potential exists
within you right now.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:02.370 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm asking of you is
to see more in that mirror

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:06.010 align:middle line:84%
than just the flesh and
blood staring back at you.

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:08.880 align:middle line:10%
I want you to remember that you
are far more than you've ever

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:09.990 align:middle line:10%
considered.

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:14.310 align:middle line:10%
You are actually your entire
impact upon this planet.

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:17.190 align:middle line:10%
This is why the Native
American Indians, when

00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:19.320 align:middle line:10%
their council
would sit and speak

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.330 align:middle line:10%
about the future of
their tribe, they

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:25.600 align:middle line:10%
had one credo that they
would adhere to most of all.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.740 align:middle line:84%
They said, in our every
deliberation, we must consider

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:32.850 align:middle line:84%
the impact that our decisions
will have upon the next seven

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:36.900 align:middle line:84%
generations, meaning
long after you're gone,

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:41.340 align:middle line:84%
your impact on this world
will still be ringing.

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:43.300 align:middle line:84%
So instead of just
leaving you with a bunch

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:46.870 align:middle line:84%
of intellectual, conceptual
ideas to toss around,

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:50.680 align:middle line:84%
I want to leave you with some
real practical tips and tools

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.690 align:middle line:84%
that you can take
and employ right now.

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:58.360 align:middle line:90%


00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.750 align:middle line:84%
On a piece of paper, draw
a line down the middle.

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:03.700 align:middle line:84%
On the left side,
write down some things

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:05.690 align:middle line:84%
that you feel are
impossible for you,

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:09.400 align:middle line:84%
right now, things like it's
impossible for me to run a mile

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:12.080 align:middle line:90%
or get married.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.690 align:middle line:84%
Meditate for a moment
on what you've written.

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:16.430 align:middle line:84%
Then on the right
side of the page,

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:18.380 align:middle line:84%
write down the first
solution you think

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:20.540 align:middle line:90%
of for each of these doubts.

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:21.830 align:middle line:90%
Be practical.

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Try to stick as close to
the things that are just

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:27.410 align:middle line:84%
out of reach instead of finding
the most extreme examples

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:29.120 align:middle line:90%
of impossibility.

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.210 align:middle line:84%
We're not claiming to
be superheroes just yet.

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And throughout the week,
come back to this list

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:39.530 align:middle line:84%
and re-evaluate your doubts and
see day by day how they change.

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:42.110 align:middle line:10%
If you employ these tips
just a few times before you

00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:44.840 align:middle line:10%
see me next, you will
begin to demystify

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.450 align:middle line:10%
what you believe is
impossible, and hopefully

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:50.330 align:middle line:10%
have realized that it is only
your doubts that keep you

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:53.640 align:middle line:10%
from living to your
full potential.

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.180 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very much
for joining me,

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:58.790 align:middle line:84%
