00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.290 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Bradley Nelson.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.750 align:middle line:10%
In this episode of
"E-Motion Code Toolkit,"

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.480 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to share with you
some powerful information about

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.389 align:middle line:10%
your subconscious mind.

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:23.930 align:middle line:84%
In my years of
research, I have found

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.030 align:middle line:84%
that getting rid of
your emotional baggage

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.020 align:middle line:84%
can change how your life
manifests as far as abundance,

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.440 align:middle line:90%
as far as love and health.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.620 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious
computer within you

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.600 align:middle line:84%
is by far the most powerful
part of who you are.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.050 align:middle line:84%
You spend your waking hours
in your conscious mind,

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.420 align:middle line:84%
and that's where you take
tests and you go to school,

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.520 align:middle line:84%
and you watch TV and
you work your job

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.380 align:middle line:90%
and have your relationships.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.350 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, your
subconscious mind

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.560 align:middle line:84%
is creating new cells
for you every moment,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.260 align:middle line:84%
is digesting your food,
keeping your heart beating,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.580 align:middle line:90%
keeping your lungs working.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.130 align:middle line:10%
That subconscious part of you
knows and remembers everything

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.050 align:middle line:10%
that you've ever done,
every face you've ever

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.070 align:middle line:10%
seen in a crowd.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Everything you've ever eaten
or tasted or touched or smelled

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.390 align:middle line:84%
is recorded in that holographic
computer of your subconscious

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.490 align:middle line:90%
mind.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.730 align:middle line:84%
It knows why your
life may not be

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.740 align:middle line:90%
working as well as it should.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.490 align:middle line:84%
It, your subconscious mind,
knows what emotional baggage

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.940 align:middle line:84%
you have and what effects
that emotional baggage is

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.370 align:middle line:90%
having on you.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And the only way that we can
get to that emotional baggage,

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.620 align:middle line:84%
find out what it
is and release it,

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.670 align:middle line:84%
is by accessing your
subconscious mind.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.770 align:middle line:84%
In the earlier
episode, I showed you

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.981 align:middle line:84%
how you can get answers
using the elbow test.

00:01:48.981 --> 00:01:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Now I'd like to share with
you another kind of testing

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.830 align:middle line:84%
that we call the sway test that
some people find even easier.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.500 align:middle line:84%
To understand how
the sway test works,

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.840 align:middle line:84%
it's helpful to
think about plants.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.230 align:middle line:84%
A plant will grow towards the
light coming in from a window.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.600 align:middle line:84%
By the same token, a
plant will grow away

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.530 align:middle line:84%
from a speaker that's playing
harsh, grating sounds.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.380 align:middle line:84%
Your body will tend
to sway forward

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.570 align:middle line:84%
if you're holding thoughts
of truth or positivity

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:15.920 align:middle line:90%
or congruency.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.540 align:middle line:84%
Your body will tend
to sway backward

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.120 align:middle line:84%
if you're holding thoughts
of negativity, falsehood

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.990 align:middle line:90%
or incongruency.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.260 align:middle line:90%
So let's do this.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.040 align:middle line:84%
First of all, stand up, drop
your hands to your sides

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.436 align:middle line:84%
and allow yourself
to totally relax.

00:02:31.436 --> 00:02:32.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to turn
sideways so you

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.160 align:middle line:84%
can see the reaction
that my body's undergoing

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.020 align:middle line:90%
as we do this.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.462 align:middle line:84%
First thing I'd like you to do
is think about the word war.

00:02:43.462 --> 00:02:45.170 align:middle line:84%
War is about the most
negative thing that

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.060 align:middle line:84%
happens on the
planet, and I'd like

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.730 align:middle line:84%
you to think about what really
goes on a human level in war.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.660 align:middle line:10%
And as you think about
that word and as you

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.690 align:middle line:10%
think about what really
goes on in war, the moment

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.090 align:middle line:10%
your subconscious mind
connects with what

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.970 align:middle line:10%
your conscious mind is
thinking at that moment,

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.310 align:middle line:10%
your body will start
to sway backward

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.070 align:middle line:10%
away from that negative
thought of war.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.370 align:middle line:10%
Now, let's try
something positive.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.580 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to think
about the word gratitude.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Is there somebody in your life
that you have gratitude for?

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.620 align:middle line:84%
Allow your heart to fill with
gratitude for that person.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.370 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a parent, maybe a
loved one, whoever it might be.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And as you allow
your heart to fill

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.240 align:middle line:84%
with that feeling of gratitude,
when your subconscious

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.880 align:middle line:84%
mind makes a connection with
what your conscious mind is

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.540 align:middle line:84%
thinking, you'll start to
sway forward just like that.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Now we can use this method
called the sway test

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.340 align:middle line:90%
to find emotional baggage.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.320 align:middle line:90%
Here's how it works.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.910 align:middle line:84%
As you're standing
there, totally

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.020 align:middle line:84%
relaxed, close
your eyes and make

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.150 align:middle line:90%
this statement in your mind.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.960 align:middle line:84%
I have a trapped emotion
that needs to be released.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.430 align:middle line:84%
As you hold that
thought in your mind,

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.740 align:middle line:84%
I have a trapped emotion
that needs to be released,

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:09.350 align:middle line:84%
your body will start to sway
either forward or backward.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.260 align:middle line:84%
If your body sways forward,
that is your subconscious mind

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.290 align:middle line:84%
telling you, yes, you do
have a trapped emotion that

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.089 align:middle line:90%
needs to be released.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.820 align:middle line:84%
Once your body says yes, you
have a trapped emotion that

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.769 align:middle line:84%
needs to be released,
at that point,

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.140 align:middle line:84%
you can go to the
e-motion code chart.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.980 align:middle line:10%
Start by figuring out which
column this emotion is in.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.900 align:middle line:84%
Ask yourself, is this
trapped emotion in column A.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.430 align:middle line:10%
Focus on that
thought for a moment,

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.940 align:middle line:10%
and allow your body to either
sway forward or backward.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.030 align:middle line:10%
If your body sways
forward, then that emotion

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.150 align:middle line:10%
is in column A. If your
body sways backward,

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.300 align:middle line:10%
the emotion is in
column B. Either way,

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.290 align:middle line:10%
you can next narrow
down the rows by asking,

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.120 align:middle line:10%
is this trapped emotion
in one of the odd rows.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.590 align:middle line:84%
If your body goes forward
on one of the odd rows,

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.740 align:middle line:84%
you've narrowed it down
to 15 emotions out of 60.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:10.050 align:middle line:10%
Now you can ask, is the
emotion in row one in column A.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.680 align:middle line:84%
If it's not in that one, ask if
it's in row three in column A,

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.020 align:middle line:84%
or row five in column A.
It will be in one of once.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.240 align:middle line:84%
Once you narrow it down
to a particular cell,

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.350 align:middle line:84%
you can then ask which emotion
it is by naming the emotions

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.470 align:middle line:84%
one at a time and asking if
it's this one or this one

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.460 align:middle line:90%
or this one, and so on.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.600 align:middle line:84%
Once you've identified the
emotion, you can then ask,

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.140 align:middle line:84%
do we need to know more
about this trapped emotion.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.240 align:middle line:84%
In other words, does
your subconscious mind

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.290 align:middle line:84%
need to have you dig a little
deeper to find this emotion

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.755 align:middle line:84%
and bring it to the
surface and release it.

00:05:42.755 --> 00:05:44.880 align:middle line:84%
If you do need to know
more, usually the only thing

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.880 align:middle line:84%
you'll need to know
is when it occurred.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.940 align:middle line:10%
And what you can do is you
can take the age of the person

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.620 align:middle line:10%
and divide it in half and ask
if it occurred before that time

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.470 align:middle line:10%
or after that time, and
you can narrow down the age

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.220 align:middle line:10%
that quickly.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, once you've identified
the trapped emotion

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.120 align:middle line:84%
and the body is
ready to release it,

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.600 align:middle line:84%
you can simply pass a
magnet, any kind of magnet,

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.550 align:middle line:84%
or your fingertips, over the
governing meridian like this.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.070 align:middle line:84%
Now the governing meridian
starts at the tailbone,

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.840 align:middle line:84%
travels up the back and
over the top of the head,

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.620 align:middle line:84%
and what we do is we simply put
some energy into that meridian

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.640 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.629 align:middle line:84%
It takes three swipes to release
a trapped emotion just like so.

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:30.420 align:middle line:84%
One of the beautiful
things about this work

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.160 align:middle line:84%
is that none of
us have ever seen

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.260 align:middle line:90%
a trapped emotion come back.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.390 align:middle line:84%
When you release a
trapped emotion correctly,

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.280 align:middle line:90%
it's gone forever.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.070 align:middle line:84%
A great analogy for this is
if you take a credit card out

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.090 align:middle line:84%
of your wallet and you
look at a credit card,

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.120 align:middle line:84%
and it has the magnetic
strip on the back.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.460 align:middle line:84%
If you rub that magnetic
strip with a magnet,

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.446 align:middle line:84%
that data is transformed and
the information there is gone.

00:06:51.446 --> 00:06:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's a similar process
here with the e-motion code.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.030 align:middle line:84%
You're releasing the emotional
energy, and it's gone.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:58.149 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Bradley Nelson.

00:06:58.149 --> 00:06:59.190 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for joining me.

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.773 align:middle line:10%
In our next episode, we're going
to be talking about the heart

00:07:01.773 --> 00:07:05.090 align:middle line:10%
wall and how you can release it.

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:15.094 align:middle line:90%
