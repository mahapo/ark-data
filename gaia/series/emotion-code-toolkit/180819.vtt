00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, I'm Dr. Bradley Nelson.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.370 align:middle line:10%
In this episode of
"E-Motion Code Toolkit,"

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.760 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to share with you how
you can identify and get rid

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.250 align:middle line:10%
of the heart wall.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.290 align:middle line:84%
In my years of
research, I have found

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.390 align:middle line:84%
that getting rid of
your emotional baggage

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.330 align:middle line:84%
can change your life and
create more abundance for you.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.230 align:middle line:90%
More love for you.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.880 align:middle line:90%
And more health for you.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.700 align:middle line:10%
Scientists now believe that
the heart is a second brain.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.950 align:middle line:84%
It is the part of you that
holds your creativity, your best

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.310 align:middle line:90%
creative ideas.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.880 align:middle line:84%
It's the source of
love and romance.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And really, the
core of your being.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.680 align:middle line:84%
This is what the ancient peoples
believed about the heart.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And now, with the
new instrumentation

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.330 align:middle line:84%
that we have in our
day, we're finding out

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.060 align:middle line:84%
that the ancient
people we're right.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.220 align:middle line:84%
The heart is all
of those things.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.160 align:middle line:84%
When you feel like your
heart is going to break--

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.690 align:middle line:84%
when you're going through
a divorce, or some kind

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.580 align:middle line:84%
of relationship
difficulties, or you're

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.390 align:middle line:84%
being abused, or hurt, or
deeply grieved in some way--

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.270 align:middle line:84%
it can feel like your
heart is breaking.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.052 align:middle line:90%
And it's a physical sensation.

00:01:20.052 --> 00:01:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And if you've
experienced this, you

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:22.950 align:middle line:90%
know what I'm talking about.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.470 align:middle line:84%
It can feel like there's an
elephant sitting on your chest.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.170 align:middle line:84%
Or like you're choking,
like you can't breathe.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.470 align:middle line:84%
In those circumstances, what's
going on is that your heart--

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.380 align:middle line:84%
that most delicate part of
you, the core of your being--

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.280 align:middle line:84%
is really under assault.
And when that happens--

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.500 align:middle line:84%
if it happens more
than once or twice,

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.550 align:middle line:84%
your subconscious mind will put
up a wall around your heart.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And that wall is
literally made from layers

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.840 align:middle line:90%
of your emotional baggage--

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.820 align:middle line:90%
your trapped emotions.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.120 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, I'm going to
show you how you can find out

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.110 align:middle line:90%
if you have a heartwall.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.520 align:middle line:84%
And how you can start to
release those emotions

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.130 align:middle line:84%
that are making up
the layers of energy

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.650 align:middle line:90%
around that heart of yours.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.690 align:middle line:84%
How do you know if
you have a heartwall?

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, 93% of people do so the
odds are, you do have one.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.750 align:middle line:84%
But there is a more positive,
more discreet, and clear way

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.430 align:middle line:84%
that you can find out
if you have a heartwall.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.054 align:middle line:84%
And that is simply by asking
your subconscious mind.

00:02:24.054 --> 00:02:26.220 align:middle line:84%
There are two ways I'm going
to share with you right

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.000 align:middle line:90%
now that you can do this.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.490 align:middle line:84%
The first method
looks like this,

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.850 align:middle line:84%
the elbow test-- we shared
that with you earlier.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.600 align:middle line:84%
You can also use the
sway test to find out

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.100 align:middle line:90%
if you have a heartwall.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.040 align:middle line:84%
As you focus on that thought,
or that statement, or question--

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.890 align:middle line:90%
do I have a heartwall?

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.350 align:middle line:84%
Or I have a heartwall,
either way--

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.940 align:middle line:84%
as you focus on that,
if you do your body will

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.220 align:middle line:90%
start to go forward.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.100 align:middle line:84%
If you don't, your body
will start to go backward.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.610 align:middle line:84%
If you get a no answer,
try using the word hidden.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.570 align:middle line:90%
I have a hidden heartwall.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And your body may very well
sway forward on that one.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's talk
about how you can

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.960 align:middle line:84%
release an emotion
from your heartwall

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.960 align:middle line:90%
and start taking that wall down.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.680 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes if you're
in a bad situation--

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.320 align:middle line:10%
a dysfunctional relationship,
difficult work, et cetera--

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.980 align:middle line:10%
your body may not be ready
to release your heartwall.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.620 align:middle line:84%
So the first question
that you need to ask

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.200 align:middle line:84%
is, can I release an emotion
from my heartwall now?

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.870 align:middle line:84%
Ask that question
and you'll either

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.000 align:middle line:90%
get a strong or a weak answer.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.080 align:middle line:84%
Or your body will sway forward,
for yes, or backward, for no.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.090 align:middle line:90%
If you get a yes answer--

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.850 align:middle line:84%
at that point, you can go
to the emotion code chart

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.150 align:middle line:84%
that you see here
and you can ask--

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.680 align:middle line:90%
where is this emotion?

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.320 align:middle line:90%
Is it in column A or B?

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.180 align:middle line:90%
One of those will be strong.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.600 align:middle line:10%
And then following the same
method that we used earlier

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.190 align:middle line:10%
that I showed you in
the previous episode--

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.950 align:middle line:10%
you'll be able to identify
the emotion and release it.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.680 align:middle line:10%
You want to continue this
process until you've gotten rid

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.250 align:middle line:10%
of all the emotions that are
surrounding that wall of yours.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.930 align:middle line:84%
What we have seen over
many years is that when

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.150 align:middle line:84%
your heartwall is taken
down, your ability to love--

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.329 align:middle line:84%
to give love, but
also to receive love--

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.100 align:middle line:90%
improves.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.130 align:middle line:90%
People's relationships improve.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.470 align:middle line:90%
People that are around you--

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.610 align:middle line:90%
people that you interact with--

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.880 align:middle line:84%
will pick up on a
subconscious level

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.410 align:middle line:90%
that, that wall is taken down.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And you will see that people
start to react differently

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.760 align:middle line:84%
to you and interact differently
with you than they have before,

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.540 align:middle line:84%
even if they have no idea that
you've taken down this wall.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.060 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing thing.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.830 align:middle line:84%
People sometimes find love who
never ever thought they would.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.380 align:middle line:84%
People sometimes fall in
love who never thought

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.790 align:middle line:90%
they'd ever fall in love.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.480 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people, for the first
time in their life, feel joy.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.130 align:middle line:84%
People often have
creative ideas that

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.360 align:middle line:84%
start to flow out of their
heart because you see,

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.620 align:middle line:84%
your heart is where your best
creative ideas really are.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.390 align:middle line:84%
They're not up
here in this brain.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.222 align:middle line:90%
They're in this brain.

00:05:10.222 --> 00:05:12.180 align:middle line:84%
I believe that one of
the most important things

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.300 align:middle line:84%
that you can do for
yourself is to get rid

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.330 align:middle line:90%
of that wall around your heart.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.040 align:middle line:90%
It's a key to being happy.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.050 align:middle line:84%
It's a key to connecting
with other people.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.890 align:middle line:84%
It's also a key to
health because you see,

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.290 align:middle line:84%
your heart is continually
sending messages

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.900 align:middle line:90%
to all the cells in your body.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.760 align:middle line:10%
When you have a
heartwall, it interferes

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.690 align:middle line:10%
with that ability of your
heart to really communicate.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.210 align:middle line:84%
If you get stuck, if you
have any issues at all--

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.930 align:middle line:84%
my recommendation is to get a
copy of "The Emotion Code" book

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:43.780 align:middle line:90%
and read it.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.340 align:middle line:84%
There's more detail in there
about how this process works.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining me
on this journey of healing.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.130 align:middle line:84%
I hope that you'll take
these very simple tools

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.580 align:middle line:84%
of "The E-motion Code," get rid
of your heartwall start getting

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.250 align:middle line:84%
rid of the rest of
your emotional baggage.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.390 align:middle line:10%
And unlock the powerful healer
and the powerful individual

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.790 align:middle line:10%
that you are inside.

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:07.970 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for listening.

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:19.670 align:middle line:90%
