00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:12.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm Dr. Bradley Nelson,
author of "The Emotion Code."

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.180 align:middle line:10%
In this series called the
"E-Motion Code Toolkit,"

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.820 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to give you the
practical techniques that will

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.840 align:middle line:10%
enable you to find and release
your own emotional baggage.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.820 align:middle line:84%
In my many years
of research, I have

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.220 align:middle line:84%
found that getting rid
of your emotional baggage

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.159 align:middle line:84%
is the key to creating better
relationships for yourself,

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:36.450 align:middle line:84%
better health for yourself, and
more abundance for yourself.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.390 align:middle line:84%
To help you understand the
impact that emotional baggage

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.930 align:middle line:84%
can have on you, we need to talk
a little bit about your body.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.930 align:middle line:84%
If you look at your hand,
your hand looks solid.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.760 align:middle line:84%
But if you were to magnify your
hand a million times or so,

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.610 align:middle line:84%
you'd see that your hand
is actually made mostly

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.400 align:middle line:90%
of energy and empty space.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.170 align:middle line:90%
Your body is an energy field.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.280 align:middle line:84%
You are a body of pure energy,
a being of pure energy.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, we can measure
thoughts electronically,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.180 align:middle line:84%
and we can measure
emotions as well.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And every emotion has its
own particular vibration.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.240 align:middle line:84%
So anger is a
different frequency

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.310 align:middle line:90%
of vibration than grief.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And grief is different
from sadness.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.580 align:middle line:90%
They're all different.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.560 align:middle line:84%
But as you have lived
through your life

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.300 align:middle line:84%
and you've experienced intense
emotional times, on a quantum

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.640 align:middle line:84%
level, what happened
during those times

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.010 align:middle line:84%
was that your body
was literally feeling

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.820 align:middle line:84%
this vibration of whatever
it was-- anger or resentment

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.770 align:middle line:90%
or sadness or grief.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And during those
times when you're

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.120 align:middle line:84%
feeling that emotion
so powerfully,

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.060 align:middle line:84%
your whole body can
take on that vibration.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that emotion,
that energy, and that vibration

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.140 align:middle line:90%
is too powerful.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.960 align:middle line:84%
It's too much for your body
to really take and process.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And so the emotional energy
can become trapped in the body.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And that forms a little
ball of emotional energy

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.430 align:middle line:84%
from about the size
of a baseball to about

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.120 align:middle line:90%
the size of a softball.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And these energies can
lodge anywhere in your body.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And having them then disrupts
how you function, how you feel,

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.770 align:middle line:84%
and how you live the
rest of your life.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.900 align:middle line:84%
When you have a trapped emotion,
it affects you in two ways.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.510 align:middle line:84%
A trapped emotion will
affect you physically,

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.570 align:middle line:84%
because there is
a distorting force

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.360 align:middle line:84%
that a trapped emotion
will cause on the energy

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.920 align:middle line:90%
field of your body.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And because your body really
is nothing more than an energy

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.090 align:middle line:84%
field, when you distort the
energy field of the body,

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.270 align:middle line:84%
you're ultimately distorting the
tissues of the body themselves.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.370 align:middle line:84%
You're interfering with
the chemical reactions

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.966 align:middle line:90%
in that area of the body.

00:02:42.966 --> 00:02:44.340 align:middle line:84%
You're interfering
with the blood

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.590 align:middle line:84%
flow to some degree and the
lymph flow to some degree.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.089 align:middle line:84%
And you're interfering
with the flow

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:50.160 align:middle line:84%
of energy, the chi
energy, the acupuncture

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.620 align:middle line:90%
energy in that area.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.640 align:middle line:84%
That's why trapped emotions
are the number one most common

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.730 align:middle line:90%
cause of physical pain.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.040 align:middle line:84%
90% of all the physical
pain that people have

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.430 align:middle line:84%
is actually caused by
trapped emotions that are

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.800 align:middle line:90%
in that area causing that pain.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.010 align:middle line:84%
But they also have
another effect on us.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.660 align:middle line:84%
What we believe now
is that when you

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.500 align:middle line:84%
have a trapped emotion,
that part of your body

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.380 align:middle line:84%
that is housing that
energy is literally

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.940 align:middle line:84%
feeling that vibration or
feeling that emotion 24

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.010 align:middle line:90%
hours a day, 7 days a week.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And so when you release a
trapped emotion of anger

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.760 align:middle line:84%
or resentment or frustration
or whatever it might be,

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.940 align:middle line:84%
you're literally freeing
your body tissues

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.950 align:middle line:90%
from feeling that energy.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And this is a reason why
releasing emotional baggage

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.920 align:middle line:90%
changes how people think.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And it can change how you
think and how you feel.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.210 align:middle line:84%
It can change what you
attract into your life.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's why this is such an
important thing for you to do.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.580 align:middle line:84%
So how can you identify trapped
emotions that are in your body?

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.400 align:middle line:84%
The only way that
you can do it is

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.240 align:middle line:84%
by tapping into your
own subconscious mind.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And your subconscious
mind is the part of you

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.410 align:middle line:84%
that digests your
meals and keeps

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.050 align:middle line:84%
your heart beating and
your lungs breathing

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.180 align:middle line:90%
and your food digesting.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.120 align:middle line:84%
That part of you knows what
emotional baggage you have.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.519 align:middle line:84%
It knows when that
emotional baggage

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.940 align:middle line:90%
occurred, who was involved.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.000 align:middle line:90%
It knows everything about it.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.310 align:middle line:84%
How do we tap into the
subconscious mind though?

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.320 align:middle line:90%
How can we ask questions?

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.060 align:middle line:90%
We use muscle testing.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to teach you today
a very simple form of muscle

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.080 align:middle line:84%
testing that we
call the elbow test.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.450 align:middle line:90%
Here's how it works.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.110 align:middle line:10%
Bring your elbow on either
hand into your side.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.930 align:middle line:10%
And with your other hand,
you can grab your fist,

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.390 align:middle line:10%
or you can grab your
wrist, either way.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And what I'd like you to
do now is say something

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.637 align:middle line:90%
that is true or congruent.

00:04:47.637 --> 00:04:48.720 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you something.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.220 align:middle line:90%
Say the word "yes."

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.330 align:middle line:84%
Say the word "yes," and then
gently press down on your arm

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.390 align:middle line:84%
and see if that arm
wants to stay strong.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.220 align:middle line:90%
Now say the word "no."

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.210 align:middle line:90%
Say the word "no."

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.010 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.280 align:middle line:90%
Press down on your arm.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.090 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see that there
will be a change there.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.640 align:middle line:84%
If you don't see that
change, if your forearm

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.950 align:middle line:84%
doesn't weaken
there and drop, it

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.200 align:middle line:84%
means that you are
using too much force.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.560 align:middle line:84%
So just allow your body to
relax a little bit more.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.920 align:middle line:84%
So what you can do is, you
can simply ask this question.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.730 align:middle line:84%
Do I have a trapped emotion
that needs to be released?

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.640 align:middle line:90%
And muscle test that.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.740 align:middle line:90%
The answer will be yes or no.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.660 align:middle line:84%
What we do now is, we
use a chart of emotions.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.370 align:middle line:90%
And here you can see the chart.

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.550 align:middle line:84%
This chart has 60
emotions in it.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.600 align:middle line:10%
It's divided up into two
columns and six rows.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.350 align:middle line:10%
We identify the trapped
emotion by first identifying

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:43.850 align:middle line:10%
what column it's in.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.870 align:middle line:84%
So let's ask, is this
trapped emotion in column A?

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.550 align:middle line:10%
I get a yes answer.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.710 align:middle line:10%
I could ask, is it in column B?

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:52.790 align:middle line:10%
I get a weak response.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.410 align:middle line:10%
That's a no answer.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.630 align:middle line:10%
Now that we've
identified the column,

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.640 align:middle line:10%
we can identify the row.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.890 align:middle line:84%
So, first of all,
to make this easy,

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.660 align:middle line:84%
let's ask if this
trapped emotion--

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.670 align:middle line:84%
now that we know it's
in column A-- is it

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.200 align:middle line:90%
in one of the odd rows?

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.090 align:middle line:84%
So that's narrowed it down
to 15 emotions out of 60.

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.490 align:middle line:90%
Is it in row 1 in column A?

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:14.330 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.900 align:middle line:90%
So is it in row 3 in column A?

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:16.700 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.150 align:middle line:84%
So, for me, identifying this
trapped emotion that I have,

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm finding that it
is in column A, row 3.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.360 align:middle line:84%
That narrows it down
to five emotions.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.290 align:middle line:10%
You can ask about those emotions
one at a time and muscle

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:31.720 align:middle line:10%
test each one.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.870 align:middle line:84%
One of those emotions
should test strong for you.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.420 align:middle line:84%
At that point,
you can ask, do we

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.520 align:middle line:84%
need to know any more
about this emotion?

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.420 align:middle line:84%
If the body says no,
then you can go ahead

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.650 align:middle line:84%
and use your fingertips or a
magnet and simply swipe three

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.650 align:middle line:84%
times over the forehead--
over the top of the head

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:53.300 align:middle line:84%
to the back of the
neck like this.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.000 align:middle line:84%
That releases that
emotional energy.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Once you release a trapped
emotion like this--

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.430 align:middle line:84%
and the process is
very, very simple--

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:05.480 align:middle line:84%
you may experience positive
changes right away.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.820 align:middle line:90%
You may feel lighter.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.800 align:middle line:90%
You may feel better.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.040 align:middle line:84%
It's also possible
that for a day or so,

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.860 align:middle line:84%
you may feel echoes
of that emotion

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.620 align:middle line:90%
as it's actually healing.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.630 align:middle line:84%
Releasing as many
trapped emotions

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.530 align:middle line:84%
as you can as fast as you can
is not necessarily the best way

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:25.620 align:middle line:90%
to do this.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.490 align:middle line:84%
We recommend releasing no more
than about 8 or 10 trapped

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.160 align:middle line:90%
emotions every couple of days.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.680 align:middle line:84%
Our emotional baggage
is the single biggest

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.970 align:middle line:84%
underlying common denominator
for all the disease processes

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.530 align:middle line:90%
that we suffer from.

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:43.250 align:middle line:84%
It is the biggest underlying
cause of depression and anxiety

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:47.850 align:middle line:84%
and phobias and panic attacks
and PTSD and eating disorders.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:51.020 align:middle line:84%
It is a factor in
every disease process

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.560 align:middle line:84%
that we have seen
in 30 years now.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.830 align:middle line:84%
So getting rid of this
baggage can help you.

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:01.950 align:middle line:84%
It may help you to prevent
disease in your future,

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:05.030 align:middle line:84%
but it can also help
you to unlock the person

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:08.114 align:middle line:84%
that you are really
capable of becoming.

00:08:08.114 --> 00:08:09.530 align:middle line:10%
In the next episode,
I'll give you

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:11.720 align:middle line:10%
more tools to release
your emotional baggage

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.670 align:middle line:10%
and live in your
fullest potential.
