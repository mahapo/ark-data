00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to
House of Wellbeing.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:18.400 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to the Dating
Confidence Mind Talk audio.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.010 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.110 align:middle line:84%
But before it does,
I'd like to remind you

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.910 align:middle line:84%
that the following
audio contains

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.610 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.490 align:middle line:84%
aim to help you reach a
deep level of relaxation.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.150 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.660 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place,

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.260 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions, where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.710 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.010 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.190 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.308 align:middle line:84%
will alert you, and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:52.308 --> 00:00:53.850 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
there's nothing at all

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.070 align:middle line:84%
you need to do apart
from close your eyes,

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.820 align:middle line:84%
relax, and let go and enjoy
all the peaceful benefits

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.575 align:middle line:90%
and feelings that come with it.

00:01:02.575 --> 00:01:05.120 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now
to make yourself

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.900 align:middle line:84%
as comfortable as
possible and listen

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.205 align:middle line:90%
to the sound of my voice.

00:01:10.205 --> 00:01:13.640 align:middle line:90%


00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And as you do so, you may be
aware of other sounds going on

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.510 align:middle line:90%
around you.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.600 align:middle line:84%
But you know that
they're not important.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.550 align:middle line:90%
They don't matter at all.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And you can dismiss them
out of your awareness

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.095 align:middle line:84%
and focus your mind
entirely on what I'm saying.

00:01:34.095 --> 00:01:37.270 align:middle line:90%


00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.520 align:middle line:84%
This is your time and
you make the most of it.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.260 align:middle line:90%


00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.700 align:middle line:84%
No one needs or wants
anything from you at all.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.280 align:middle line:90%


00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to
take in a deep breath,

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.490 align:middle line:84%
filling your lungs
as much as you can.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.230 align:middle line:90%
And let it out slowly.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.460 align:middle line:90%


00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.435 align:middle line:84%
And again, take in
a long, slow breath.

00:02:09.435 --> 00:02:12.160 align:middle line:90%


00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.315 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready,
let it out slowly.

00:02:15.315 --> 00:02:20.170 align:middle line:90%


00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Now you can allow your
breathing to return

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:32.160 align:middle line:84%
to normal, gentle
breaths in and out,

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.510 align:middle line:84%
returning to your normal
gentle breathing pace.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.460 align:middle line:90%


00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now
to imagine yourself

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.515 align:middle line:84%
outside in your favorite
place in nature.

00:02:46.515 --> 00:02:49.960 align:middle line:90%


00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.460 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a peaceful
tropical beach,

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.300 align:middle line:84%
or it could be a
beautiful garden.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.640 align:middle line:90%


00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you can
imagine lying back

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.805 align:middle line:84%
on a boat which is sailing
on a tranquil river.

00:03:04.805 --> 00:03:07.440 align:middle line:90%


00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.640 align:middle line:84%
It really doesn't matter
where you are, as long

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.220 align:middle line:90%
as it feels good to you.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.690 align:middle line:90%


00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.075 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beautiful day.

00:03:17.075 --> 00:03:19.810 align:middle line:90%


00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:27.010 align:middle line:84%
The sky is a special
shade of blue, so clear.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.100 align:middle line:90%
And it's a warm summer's day.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.840 align:middle line:90%


00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.680 align:middle line:84%
There's a breeze gently
blowing over you,

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.720 align:middle line:84%
and the temperature is
just how you like it.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.980 align:middle line:90%


00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And in the sky is
a dazzling sun,

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.530 align:middle line:84%
so bright that you just
want to close your eyes

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.090 align:middle line:84%
and feel the glowing, healing
warmth of the sun on your body.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.140 align:middle line:90%


00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And surprisingly, you find
that you can direct that sun

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.960 align:middle line:90%
over and around your body.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And as you realize
this, you begin

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.165 align:middle line:84%
to direct the light from
the sun over your face.

00:04:20.165 --> 00:04:24.350 align:middle line:90%


00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.220 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the healing
warmth of the light

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.560 align:middle line:84%
from the sun over your face,
just relaxing those muscles

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.495 align:middle line:84%
around the eyes, around the
nose and mouth and your brow.

00:04:37.495 --> 00:04:41.190 align:middle line:90%


00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And as you do this, you find
that your facial muscles

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.620 align:middle line:84%
begin to flatten
out as they relax,

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.600 align:middle line:90%
and you let go completely.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.110 align:middle line:90%


00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.710 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beautiful day.

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.240 align:middle line:84%
You move the light from the
sun into the throat area,

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.610 align:middle line:84%
feeling the warmth of the light
from the sun in your throat,

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.370 align:middle line:84%
relaxing all the muscles, just
letting go completely now.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.530 align:middle line:90%


00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And the warm sunlight now
moving into your shoulders

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.920 align:middle line:84%
and across your
shoulders, making them

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:35.130 align:middle line:84%
feel loose and limp
and comfortable

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.540 align:middle line:84%
as your shoulders sink into
the frame of your body.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:43.910 align:middle line:90%


00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And you feel so comfortable
now, so relaxed and at peace,

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.450 align:middle line:84%
and you let nothing bother
or concern you at all.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:02.350 align:middle line:90%


00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And you direct the light from
the sun down your right arm,

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.340 align:middle line:84%
from the shoulders to
the tips of your fingers.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.690 align:middle line:84%
The right arm begins
to relax and let go.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.720 align:middle line:90%


00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's a beautiful feeling
to be here right now.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.220 align:middle line:90%


00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.310 align:middle line:84%
The warmth of the
light from the sun

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.540 align:middle line:84%
penetrates the nerves and bones
and muscles of that right arm.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:37.420 align:middle line:90%


00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.070 align:middle line:90%
And it's such a beautiful day.

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:44.410 align:middle line:84%
You move the sun
over to your left arm

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:51.320 align:middle line:84%
and guide the light from the
sun down and up your left arm,

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.690 align:middle line:84%
from the top of your
shoulders all the way down

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:57.100 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your fingers.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.860 align:middle line:90%


00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:05.640 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the left arm
relaxing, becoming comfortably

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.475 align:middle line:90%
heavy and totally relaxed.

00:07:09.475 --> 00:07:14.890 align:middle line:90%


00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:21.610 align:middle line:84%
Now move that warm light
across and into the chest area

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:29.220 align:middle line:84%
and relax the chest, all
the muscles there, Now

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:32.020 align:middle line:84%
down to the stomach,
relax in your tummy

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:37.110 align:middle line:84%
and down into your hips and your
thighs over to your right leg.

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:40.680 align:middle line:90%


00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.640 align:middle line:84%
The light warms the muscles
as you relax your right leg.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Let it feel comfortable
and heavy now.

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.240 align:middle line:90%


00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:55.030 align:middle line:84%
Now move the light from the
sun down your right leg,

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.330 align:middle line:84%
up and down from
the top of the hips

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:02.430 align:middle line:84%
to the tips of your toes
as the right leg relaxes,

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:03.660 align:middle line:90%
and you let go.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:10.100 align:middle line:90%


00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a beautiful
day, you now move the light

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:15.790 align:middle line:90%
into your left leg.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:21.550 align:middle line:84%
You move it up and down the left
leg, from the top of the hips

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:23.290 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your toes.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:29.210 align:middle line:84%
And your left leg relaxes,
releasing tension,

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.150 align:middle line:90%
letting go now completely.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:35.100 align:middle line:90%


00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:41.799 align:middle line:84%
Your whole body is now totally
and completely relaxed,

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:44.530 align:middle line:84%
from the top of your
head all the way down

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:45.970 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your toes.

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:49.880 align:middle line:90%


00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And as your body relaxes,
your mind also relaxes.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:59.200 align:middle line:90%


00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And I want you now to
notice that the sun is

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:09.370 align:middle line:84%
setting, going down now,
deeper and deeper down.

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And you're so deeply
relaxed but still

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.010 align:middle line:90%
completely alert and aware.

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:17.170 align:middle line:90%


00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:20.440 align:middle line:84%
You resist the temptation
to fall asleep.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is thoroughly
relaxed, but you

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.360 align:middle line:90%
stay focused on these words.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.770 align:middle line:90%


00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:32.390 align:middle line:84%
So now I'd like you to
use your imagination.

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And once again, you're in a
wonderful place in nature.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:41.500 align:middle line:84%
The trees are a
beautiful shade of green.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.420 align:middle line:84%
It's a stunning day, and the
sun is shining down on you.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:48.030 align:middle line:90%


00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:51.870 align:middle line:84%
There's a soft and
gentle breeze in the air,

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.705 align:middle line:84%
making you feel pleasantly
relaxed and calm.

00:09:54.705 --> 00:09:58.280 align:middle line:90%


00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:02.410 align:middle line:84%
All around, you can see
trees and plants and an array

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:07.740 align:middle line:84%
of the most beautiful
flowers you have ever seen,

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:11.100 align:middle line:90%
so colorful and vibrant.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And you can smell the rich
aroma of these flowers,

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.905 align:middle line:90%
making you feel so peaceful.

00:10:16.905 --> 00:10:21.320 align:middle line:90%


00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.140 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else matters right now.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.800 align:middle line:84%
You feel completely
at ease and so calm.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.970 align:middle line:90%


00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And in the distance,
you can hear

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.340 align:middle line:84%
the sound of water
flowing slowly

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:40.680 align:middle line:84%
and gently a sound
of water is helping

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.080 align:middle line:84%
you to go more and
more deeply relaxed.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.940 align:middle line:90%


00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:49.570 align:middle line:84%
You may feel your muscles
are loosening more and more,

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:52.420 align:middle line:84%
relaxing with the beautiful
flowing sound of water.

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:57.220 align:middle line:90%


00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:03.480 align:middle line:84%
Out of curiosity, you decide to
follow the sound of the water,

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:08.070 align:middle line:84%
and you feel excited about where
it's leading you, knowing deep

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:12.930 align:middle line:84%
within yourself you're going
to a very special place,

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:14.570 align:middle line:84%
a place where you're
going to create

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:17.850 align:middle line:84%
some positive, wonderful,
long lasting changes.

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:22.220 align:middle line:90%


00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:26.540 align:middle line:84%
As you walk slowly
towards the water,

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:31.610 align:middle line:84%
you can hear the sound of
birds singing in the trees.

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:33.290 align:middle line:90%
You feel totally at ease.

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:37.200 align:middle line:90%


00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.310 align:middle line:84%
As you finally
reach the lake, you

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:45.050 align:middle line:84%
realize it's the most beautiful
vision you've ever seen,

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:47.780 align:middle line:84%
and you're in awe of the
beauty that surrounds you.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:51.890 align:middle line:90%


00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:56.060 align:middle line:84%
The vast lake is filled
with a variety of colors--

00:11:56.060 --> 00:12:01.420 align:middle line:84%
rich colors of blues,
turquoise, and light greens--

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:05.290 align:middle line:84%
and it fills your mind and
body with a wave of relaxation.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:08.040 align:middle line:90%


00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:11.690 align:middle line:84%
You may be becoming more relaxed
with each and every breath

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:19.970 align:middle line:84%
you take, feeling more calm,
more peaceful, and more

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:21.465 align:middle line:90%
relaxed than ever before.

00:12:21.465 --> 00:12:25.270 align:middle line:90%


00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:29.080 align:middle line:84%
Your mind may be
drifting in and out,

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:33.820 align:middle line:84%
just letting go deeper
and deeper still.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:38.680 align:middle line:84%
You may feel as though your
mind is flowing gently,

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.700 align:middle line:84%
flowing gently like the
lake in your imagination.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:45.320 align:middle line:90%


00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.550 align:middle line:84%
You look into the distance,
and you can see a wooden bridge

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:49.840 align:middle line:90%
leading over the lake.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.640 align:middle line:90%


00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.330 align:middle line:84%
You walk towards the bridge,
feeling more and more

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:56.375 align:middle line:90%
deeply relaxed.

00:12:56.375 --> 00:12:58.990 align:middle line:90%


00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:00.720 align:middle line:84%
As you reach the
bridge, you can see

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.230 align:middle line:84%
there are 10 steps leading over
to the other side of the lake.

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:08.420 align:middle line:90%


00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:12.150 align:middle line:84%
You slowly start
walking over the bridge,

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:13.835 align:middle line:84%
counting the steps
in your mind--

00:13:13.835 --> 00:13:16.590 align:middle line:90%


00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:28.400 align:middle line:84%
10, 9, deeper and
deeper still, 8, 7,

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:33.070 align:middle line:84%
all the way down
to relaxation now,

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:42.950 align:middle line:84%
6, 5 and 4, drifting off
peacefully and easily,

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:53.060 align:middle line:84%
3, 2, all the way down,
deeply relaxed, and 1.

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.320 align:middle line:84%
You see a comfortable
padded chair,

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.520 align:middle line:84%
and you take a seat,
ready to embrace

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:02.810 align:middle line:84%
the changes to come in your
deep state of relaxation now.

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:07.780 align:middle line:90%


00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And as you continue
relaxing and drifting down

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:15.210 align:middle line:84%
into this calm and
comfortable feeling,

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:18.750 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to talk to you about
the issue of dating confidence.

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:21.760 align:middle line:90%


00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And dating can be a daunting
thought for many people.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:29.500 align:middle line:84%
So whether you're newly
single or whether you've

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:36.340 align:middle line:84%
been single for a while, we're
now going to work on this area.

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:39.630 align:middle line:84%
It means that you're
already open to change,

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:42.060 align:middle line:84%
to positive
suggestions, and you'll

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.490 align:middle line:84%
allow yourself to be the
best that you can be.

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:47.680 align:middle line:90%


00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And being the best
version of yourself

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:53.380 align:middle line:90%
will come easily to you.

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:56.950 align:middle line:84%
You know that you don't need
to be loud and overly charming,

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:59.200 align:middle line:90%
overly witty, or charismatic.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.780 align:middle line:84%
All you need to do
is to be yourself,

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:05.320 align:middle line:84%
and you know that
you're good enough.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.170 align:middle line:84%
You know that you're
determined to allow

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:11.750 align:middle line:84%
your unique personality
to project on your date.

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:15.710 align:middle line:90%


00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And what really
matters is that you

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:21.840 align:middle line:84%
meet someone who genuinely likes
the real you and, of course,

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:22.960 align:middle line:90%
that you like them too.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:28.880 align:middle line:90%


00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.820 align:middle line:84%
You no longer listen to
your negative inner critic.

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:34.645 align:middle line:90%


00:15:34.645 --> 00:15:39.350 align:middle line:84%
You know that if left
to its own devices,

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:44.210 align:middle line:84%
it will control how you
feel about yourself,

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:47.300 align:middle line:84%
and it will gradually wear
down your confidence levels.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.970 align:middle line:90%


00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:53.350 align:middle line:84%
So you need to take charge
of that inner voice,

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:56.180 align:middle line:90%
and you need to do it quickly.

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:59.950 align:middle line:84%
So from now on, you replace
your inner critic's beliefs

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:01.990 align:middle line:90%
with positive affirmations.

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:04.780 align:middle line:90%


00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:08.210 align:middle line:84%
Turn your inner critic into
your very own cheerleader.

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:10.960 align:middle line:90%


00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:15.010 align:middle line:84%
You're no longer
interested in negativity,

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:18.790 align:middle line:84%
as you know that it
feeds more negativity

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:21.280 align:middle line:84%
and will take over your
thinking altogether.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:24.030 align:middle line:90%


00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Change those negative
thoughts into positive ones

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:29.820 align:middle line:84%
and notice the changes
that take place.

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:32.840 align:middle line:90%


00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:36.500 align:middle line:84%
You are confident, and you
enjoy meeting new people

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:40.160 align:middle line:90%
and the excitement of dating.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.460 align:middle line:84%
Even if you don't quite
believe it at first,

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:46.040 align:middle line:84%
keep pushing out those
negative thoughts

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.110 align:middle line:84%
and replacing them
with positive ones.

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:52.010 align:middle line:90%


00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:55.250 align:middle line:84%
You are confident, and you
enjoy meeting new people

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:58.640 align:middle line:90%
and the excitement of dating.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:02.870 align:middle line:84%
The more you listen to and
repeat that affirmation,

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:07.310 align:middle line:84%
the more your mind
will believe it.

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:10.950 align:middle line:84%
You may initially have to make
a concerted effort to do that.

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:14.329 align:middle line:84%
But with practice, it will
become easier and easier.

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And with more practice, the more
your mind will start to change,

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:20.042 align:middle line:84%
and it will start
to believe what

00:17:20.042 --> 00:17:21.250 align:middle line:90%
you've been telling yourself.

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:25.020 align:middle line:90%


00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:28.770 align:middle line:84%
I'd also like to remind yourself
why you're so unique and so

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:29.700 align:middle line:90%
wonderfully you.

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:33.380 align:middle line:90%


00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:36.250 align:middle line:84%
So take a moment now to
think about the things you're

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:39.340 align:middle line:84%
proud of, the things
you're happy with,

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:45.390 align:middle line:84%
the things that you want to
celebrate about yourself,

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:47.400 align:middle line:84%
the things your
friends love about you.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.280 align:middle line:90%


00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.650 align:middle line:84%
See those qualities
now within your mind

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:55.520 align:middle line:84%
and recognize what a
fantastic person you are.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:59.740 align:middle line:90%


00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:05.850 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it's kindness,
consideration, someone

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:07.560 align:middle line:90%
who is good fun to be with.

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.140 align:middle line:90%


00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:16.310 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it's someone who's
intelligent, helpful, caring,

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:19.325 align:middle line:84%
trustworthy, a person who
likes to stick to their word.

00:18:19.325 --> 00:18:23.270 align:middle line:90%


00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:26.690 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you're a good
conversationalist,

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:30.045 align:middle line:84%
a good listener, a generous,
happy, and likable person.

00:18:30.045 --> 00:18:33.700 align:middle line:90%


00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.760 align:middle line:84%
There may be areas that you're
working on and improving.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.130 align:middle line:90%
We all have areas to work on.

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:41.990 align:middle line:90%
Your date does too.

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:45.080 align:middle line:84%
All of those qualities
are a part of you--

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.650 align:middle line:90%
the wonderful, unique you.

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:49.760 align:middle line:84%
But right now you're
focusing on the positives,

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.610 align:middle line:84%
so take your time now to
make a mental list of all

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:55.490 align:middle line:84%
your positive
traits and qualities

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:57.290 align:middle line:84%
and recognize that
you're someone

00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:00.585 align:middle line:84%
that many people would be only
too happy to have as a partner.

00:19:00.585 --> 00:19:10.140 align:middle line:90%


00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And there's a part of you
that wants to take more,

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.860 align:middle line:84%
but perhaps your
lack of confidence

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:20.410 align:middle line:90%
has been holding you back.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And you know that one
of the quickest ways

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:26.980 align:middle line:84%
to grow in confidence is to push
yourself out of that comfort

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:28.180 align:middle line:90%
zone that you're living in.

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:30.920 align:middle line:90%


00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:35.900 align:middle line:84%
Life is nice and easy when you
don't need to push yourself,

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:41.340 align:middle line:84%
and pushing out of your comfort
zone may initially scare you.

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:45.210 align:middle line:84%
But with your newfound
confidence and newfound

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:48.780 align:middle line:84%
excitement to date, will
leave you feeling fantastic.

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:51.880 align:middle line:90%


00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:55.240 align:middle line:84%
You're no longer afraid
to push yourself,

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:58.810 align:middle line:84%
to put yourself out there and
to see what new adventures life

00:19:58.810 --> 00:19:59.810 align:middle line:90%
has in store for you.

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:03.600 align:middle line:90%


00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.840 align:middle line:84%
You know that you don't
need to be feeling your most

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.910 align:middle line:90%
confident immediately.

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:10.700 align:middle line:84%
You simply tell yourself
you're confident.

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:14.480 align:middle line:84%
You act confidently and
project that confident image

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.940 align:middle line:90%
of yourself on the date.

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And if you do it enough
times, it becomes real.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.860 align:middle line:84%
You're tricking
your mind by acting

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:25.410 align:middle line:84%
in such a confident
manner that it'll then

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:29.730 align:middle line:84%
start to believe it's true, and
the confidence will organically

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:31.200 align:middle line:90%
build and shine through.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:36.300 align:middle line:90%


00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:40.650 align:middle line:84%
So now project your
mind into the future.

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:44.610 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to imagine that
you have a very special date,

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:49.190 align:middle line:84%
and you really want to
make a good impression.

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:51.320 align:middle line:84%
You are at home, and
you're getting ready,

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.240 align:middle line:90%
and you're calm and confident.

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:56.120 align:middle line:90%


00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:00.320 align:middle line:84%
See yourself now telling
yourself you are confident,

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:05.140 align:middle line:84%
telling yourself you're
excited to meet your date.

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:06.840 align:middle line:90%
Now feel that confidence.

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.350 align:middle line:90%


00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:13.940 align:middle line:84%
Feel the excitement, the
anticipation of what could be.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:17.110 align:middle line:90%


00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:20.890 align:middle line:84%
The more confident you
feel, the more attractive

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:26.250 align:middle line:84%
you feel, and the more your
date will be interested in you.

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:29.490 align:middle line:84%
Tell yourself you're
confident over and over,

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:32.205 align:middle line:84%
and soon your mind will
turn the words into reality.

00:21:32.205 --> 00:21:36.650 align:middle line:90%


00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And you really are looking
forward to the date.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:42.350 align:middle line:84%
You start to get dressed, and
you're happy with what you see.

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:44.870 align:middle line:84%
There's no negative
thinking now--

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:48.590 align:middle line:90%
positive thoughts only.

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:51.560 align:middle line:84%
You know that you've got
so many special qualities

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.000 align:middle line:90%
which others admire in you.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.620 align:middle line:90%


00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And now project your
mind a little way further

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:05.490 align:middle line:84%
into the future and imagine
you're already with your date.

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:07.680 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you're having a
drink or eating dinner.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:11.290 align:middle line:84%
You're getting to
know one another.

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:14.375 align:middle line:84%
You're genuinely interested in
learning more about your date.

00:22:14.375 --> 00:22:17.730 align:middle line:90%


00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:21.060 align:middle line:84%
You listen attentively
and you respond

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:22.580 align:middle line:90%
in an appropriate manner.

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:27.630 align:middle line:90%


00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:32.810 align:middle line:84%
You maintain eye contact
easily, and you're smiling.

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:37.070 align:middle line:84%
Your body language is open,
receptive, and friendly.

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And conversation comes
easily and naturally to you.

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:44.720 align:middle line:90%


00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:50.650 align:middle line:84%
And all the time you're relaxed
and calm and confident inside.

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:52.600 align:middle line:84%
Your intuition will
let you know if you'd

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.520 align:middle line:90%
like to see your date again.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And if things don't work out,
you tell yourself nothing

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.670 align:middle line:90%
ventured, nothing gained.

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:02.990 align:middle line:84%
You're proud of yourself
for going on the date

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:04.720 align:middle line:84%
and for putting
yourself out there.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:08.070 align:middle line:90%


00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:10.530 align:middle line:84%
With each date that
you go on, you're

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:12.970 align:middle line:84%
growing in confidence
more and more,

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:16.940 align:middle line:84%
even if the date
doesn't work out.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:19.010 align:middle line:84%
You know that the
next date you'll have

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:24.290 align:middle line:84%
will be equally good, if not
better, because next time more

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:29.570 align:middle line:84%
about your date and be even
more relaxed and natural.

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Your confidence in dating
again is truly increasing now.

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:37.810 align:middle line:90%


00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And when, with your
date, you don't

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:44.280 align:middle line:84%
pretend to be something
or someone you're not.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:47.130 align:middle line:84%
You are your own
authentic, natural self.

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:52.470 align:middle line:84%
You're confident without
appearing arrogant.

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:55.050 align:middle line:84%
You like yourself, and
others like you too.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:58.002 align:middle line:90%


00:23:58.002 --> 00:24:02.150 align:middle line:90%
You enjoy meeting new people.

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:07.130 align:middle line:84%
Every date is so different,
and there's always so much

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:08.630 align:middle line:90%
to learn about the other person.

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:12.820 align:middle line:90%


00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:16.360 align:middle line:84%
Conversation flows easily,
and your genuine interest

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.611 align:middle line:90%
makes you even more attractive.

00:24:18.611 --> 00:24:22.850 align:middle line:90%


00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:26.630 align:middle line:84%
You recognize that some
dates will be successful,

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:29.420 align:middle line:90%
and others less so.

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.940 align:middle line:84%
You gel more with some
people and not so much

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:36.280 align:middle line:84%
with others, just
like with friendships.

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:40.660 align:middle line:84%
You surprise yourself with your
own feelings of ease and calm

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:46.090 align:middle line:84%
and a quiet inner confidence
that says I am confident,

00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:50.890 align:middle line:84%
I have many wonderful
qualities, I respect myself,

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:52.540 align:middle line:90%
and others respect me too.

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:56.310 align:middle line:90%


00:24:56.310 --> 00:25:00.150 align:middle line:84%
It may be that you find your
ideal partner after just one

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:04.650 align:middle line:90%
date, or it could take longer.

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:06.450 align:middle line:84%
It really doesn't
matter right now

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:11.260 align:middle line:84%
because you find that it's
fun to be on the dating scene.

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:14.740 align:middle line:84%
You feel lighthearted
because dating is fun,

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:17.710 align:middle line:84%
and you have all the confidence
that you need to succeed,

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:21.650 align:middle line:84%
not only on dates but in all
other areas of your life.

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:24.980 align:middle line:90%


00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:27.860 align:middle line:84%
You are a unique individual
with so much to offer.

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:30.690 align:middle line:90%


00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:34.140 align:middle line:84%
You realize that your
date may be nervous,

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:36.720 align:middle line:84%
so you always do your
best to put them at ease

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.070 align:middle line:90%
without going overboard.

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:40.760 align:middle line:90%


00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:44.480 align:middle line:84%
You're aware of the
importance of body language,

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:47.375 align:middle line:84%
and you ensure that yours
is open and friendly.

00:25:47.375 --> 00:25:50.430 align:middle line:90%


00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:53.100 align:middle line:84%
You're fun to be with,
and you enjoy dating

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:54.560 align:middle line:90%
and getting to know people.

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:58.920 align:middle line:90%


00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.780 align:middle line:84%
These hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:03.240 align:middle line:84%
embedded in your
subconscious mind,

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:05.190 align:middle line:84%
and they'll become
more and more powerful

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:08.290 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count up from 1 to 5

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:13.210 align:middle line:90%
to awaken you.

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of 5, you'll
be wide awake, fully refreshed,

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:20.340 align:middle line:84%
alert, and feeling fantastic,
bringing back with you now

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:21.585 align:middle line:90%
all the wonderful feelings.

00:26:21.585 --> 00:26:24.750 align:middle line:90%


00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:32.450 align:middle line:84%
Coming back now with
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:34.340 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open when you're ready.

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:37.390 align:middle line:90%
