00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Welcome to
House of Wellbeing.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.250 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to the
Loneliness Mind Talk audio.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.270 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.210 align:middle line:84%
But before it does,
I'd like to remind you

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.740 align:middle line:84%
that the following
audio contains

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.040 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic suggestions
that help you to reach

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.348 align:middle line:90%
a deep level of relaxation.

00:00:27.348 --> 00:00:29.390 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that
wherever you are listening

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.600 align:middle line:84%
to this audio, you're in a
safe and comfortable place,

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.330 align:middle line:84%
you're free from distractions
where you can fully relax

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.020 align:middle line:90%
and let go.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.890 align:middle line:84%
So please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.880 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.060 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.553 align:middle line:84%
will alert you, and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:48.553 --> 00:00:49.970 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
there's nothing you

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.230 align:middle line:84%
need to do at all apart
from close your eyes,

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.540 align:middle line:84%
relax, lie back and let go, and
enjoy all the peaceful feelings

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.480 align:middle line:84%
and all the benefits
that come with it.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.240 align:middle line:90%


00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.880 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to make sure
you in a comfortable position

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.500 align:middle line:90%
with your eyes closed.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And you inhale
deeply, and hold it

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.180 align:middle line:90%
for a count of three seconds.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.700 align:middle line:90%


00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.915 align:middle line:90%
And exhale slowly.

00:01:19.915 --> 00:01:23.590 align:middle line:90%


00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.220 align:middle line:90%
Again, breathe in.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready,
you exhale slowly.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.760 align:middle line:90%


00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And one more time,
inhaling deeply now,

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.520 align:middle line:90%
and exhaling when you're ready.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And you can start to feel
every part of your body

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.870 align:middle line:90%
releasing now and relaxing.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.770 align:middle line:90%


00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.520 align:middle line:84%
Each time you're inhaling,
you're bringing more oxygen

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.850 align:middle line:90%
into your body.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And each time you exhale,
it causes your body

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.850 align:middle line:90%
to keep relaxing more and more.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.030 align:middle line:90%


00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.935 align:middle line:84%
And now you can continue
breathing easily and freely

00:02:14.935 --> 00:02:18.540 align:middle line:90%
at your body's normal pace.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.930 align:middle line:84%
Gentle breaths in and out as
you normally would breathe,

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.780 align:middle line:84%
feeling yourself becoming
more calm and peaceful.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.740 align:middle line:90%


00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And your subconscious
mind will always

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.120 align:middle line:84%
be aware of what
I'm saying to you.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.510 align:middle line:84%
So it becomes less
and less important

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.850 align:middle line:84%
for you to consciously
listen to my voice.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.970 align:middle line:90%


00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.510 align:middle line:84%
Your subconscious mind and
all levels of your inner mind

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.390 align:middle line:84%
can hear and receive
everything I tell you.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And your conscious mind
can relax completely now.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.980 align:middle line:90%


00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And you're continuing
to experience

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.880 align:middle line:90%
perfect peace of mind.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.900 align:middle line:90%


00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And you can feel yourself
moving into the situation

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.850 align:middle line:90%
I described to you.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.690 align:middle line:84%
It's going to happen
automatically.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.410 align:middle line:84%
You don't even need to
think about it consciously.

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.170 align:middle line:90%


00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.550 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to imagine yourself
lying in a comfortable position

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:34.010 align:middle line:84%
near a stream of fresh, clear
water in a beautiful forest

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.560 align:middle line:90%
on a perfect summer day.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.820 align:middle line:90%


00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:46.330 align:middle line:84%
There's a warm, gentle breeze,
and the air is fresh and clean.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.540 align:middle line:84%
The sound of the peaceful
stream, so relaxing now.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.590 align:middle line:90%


00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And it keeps becoming
less important

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.290 align:middle line:84%
for you to consciously
listen to my voice,

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.960 align:middle line:84%
because your subconscious
mind is hearing and receiving

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.380 align:middle line:90%
everything I'm saying.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And in your mind, you're
enjoying the beauty of nature

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.570 align:middle line:84%
as the sunlight shines
through the trees

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.830 align:middle line:84%
and you listen to the
gentle flow of water

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.990 align:middle line:84%
and the birds
singing cheerfully.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.170 align:middle line:90%


00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And you're lying there
comfortably relaxing now,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.060 align:middle line:90%
so peaceful.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And you continue feeling more
relaxed than ever before.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.770 align:middle line:84%
As you continue enjoying this
peaceful, pleasant experience,

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.730 align:middle line:84%
a soothing drowsiness is
coming over your whole body

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.180 align:middle line:84%
from the top of your head
to the bottom of your feet.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.080 align:middle line:90%


00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.035 align:middle line:84%
You continue feeling calmer,
more relaxed, and more secure.

00:05:06.035 --> 00:05:12.810 align:middle line:90%


00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And now, as you lie
with your eyes closed,

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.510 align:middle line:84%
you are so relaxed and
comfortable and happy

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.610 align:middle line:84%
that you continue moving into
a more peaceful, more detached

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:24.410 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.180 align:middle line:90%


00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.450 align:middle line:84%
It may seem like you're
drifting into a state of sleep.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.770 align:middle line:90%


00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And there may be times when
it seems like my voice is

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.300 align:middle line:90%
a long distance away.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.660 align:middle line:84%
There may be times
when I'm talking to you

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.910 align:middle line:84%
and you're not consciously
aware of my voice.

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's fine, because
your subconscious mind

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.480 align:middle line:90%
is receiving every word I say.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.610 align:middle line:90%


00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And from now on, you'll
be influenced only

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.075 align:middle line:84%
by positive thoughts,
ideas, and feelings.

00:06:00.075 --> 00:06:02.660 align:middle line:90%


00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.020 align:middle line:90%
More calm, secure, and relaxed.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.160 align:middle line:90%
More comfortable and at ease.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.935 align:middle line:84%
More in control of
yourself at all times.

00:06:13.935 --> 00:06:18.600 align:middle line:90%


00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.090 align:middle line:84%
Your mind enables
you to be relaxed

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:25.490 align:middle line:84%
and calm as you go about the
activities of your daily life.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.200 align:middle line:90%


00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And now in a moment, I'm going
to count down from 10 to one.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And when I get to
the count of one,

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.610 align:middle line:84%
you'll have relaxed into a
deep, deep state of relaxation.

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.790 align:middle line:90%


00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And now take a deep breath
in, and exhale slowly

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:48.770 align:middle line:90%
when you're ready.

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.330 align:middle line:90%


00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:57.020 align:middle line:84%
So 10, focusing your
attention on your feet.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:02.820 align:middle line:84%
Think about your feet, about
those feet and toes and ankles.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:08.315 align:middle line:84%
Allow them to tense and
then release and get loose.

00:07:08.315 --> 00:07:12.830 align:middle line:90%


00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:18.690 align:middle line:84%
Nine, now all those
muscles in your legs,

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:22.280 align:middle line:84%
your calves, and your
knees, your thighs.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:26.180 align:middle line:84%
Releasing those muscles
now, feeling your legs

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.695 align:middle line:90%
becoming heavier and heavier.

00:07:27.695 --> 00:07:31.910 align:middle line:90%


00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:36.600 align:middle line:84%
Eight, now feeling that
relaxation spreading

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.195 align:middle line:90%
into your body and your chest.

00:07:39.195 --> 00:07:43.850 align:middle line:90%


00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:49.330 align:middle line:84%
Seven, now feel that
relaxation in your shoulders,

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.910 align:middle line:84%
spreading all the way
down into your arms,

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.640 align:middle line:84%
down into your hands
and your fingers.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:00.520 align:middle line:84%
Your arms are feeling heavy,
so relaxed, as if they

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.170 align:middle line:90%
belong to someone else now.

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:06.010 align:middle line:90%


00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And six, allow your
neck to release.

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:17.050 align:middle line:84%
Aware of your face relaxing,
your cheeks and your jaw,

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:17.850 align:middle line:90%
your lips.

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:24.270 align:middle line:90%


00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:32.039 align:middle line:84%
Five, let your eyes relax,
your eyebrows, your forehead.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:36.659 align:middle line:84%
And four, everything
feels loose and heavy,

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:40.380 align:middle line:84%
as if your arms and
legs were made of stone.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.684 align:middle line:90%
Totally relaxed.

00:08:41.684 --> 00:08:44.870 align:middle line:90%


00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:49.120 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the
weight pressing down,

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:53.820 align:middle line:84%
and you can't be bothered to
move your arms and legs now.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:58.990 align:middle line:84%
You can enjoy the feeling of
total relaxation, letting go.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:02.600 align:middle line:84%
The more you relax,
the more you release.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.290 align:middle line:90%


00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And three, as your
mind drifts off,

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:14.070 align:middle line:84%
you feel a wave of relaxation
traveling down your body,

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:16.380 align:middle line:84%
down from the top of
your head, relaxing

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:20.790 align:middle line:84%
your face, your neck, your
shoulders, your body spreading

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:21.840 align:middle line:90%
down and down.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.920 align:middle line:90%


00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And two, each
soft, gentle breath

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:32.800 align:middle line:90%
relaxing you more and more.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.210 align:middle line:90%
Nothing matters now.

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:35.155 align:middle line:90%
This is your time.

00:09:35.155 --> 00:09:37.950 align:middle line:90%


00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:40.480 align:middle line:90%
And one, totally relaxed now.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.470 align:middle line:90%
Totally at ease.

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:46.440 align:middle line:84%
A place where you feel
relaxed and comfortable.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.170 align:middle line:90%


00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:52.730 align:middle line:84%
Think of what that
place is like,

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:57.860 align:middle line:84%
maybe a beach or a favorite
chair, or snuggled warm in bed

00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:59.840 align:middle line:90%
on a stormy night.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:04.860 align:middle line:84%
Maybe floating in
some warm water.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:09.770 align:middle line:84%
Allow your mind to drift
over these things, whatever

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:12.190 align:middle line:90%
feels right for you.

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:13.360 align:middle line:90%
Nothing matters.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.630 align:middle line:90%
This is your time to relax.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:19.480 align:middle line:84%
Just being in the moment
and letting your mind

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:23.600 align:middle line:84%
empty as you enjoy the state
of deep relaxation now.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:31.540 align:middle line:90%


00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:35.230 align:middle line:84%
We know that loneliness is
a feeling of disconnection

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:37.990 align:middle line:90%
from society.

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:41.050 align:middle line:84%
And for many people,
loneliness can significantly

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:45.150 align:middle line:84%
impact your quality of life
and your physical and mental

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:45.950 align:middle line:90%
health.

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:49.240 align:middle line:90%


00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.290 align:middle line:84%
While some people may
define loneliness as a state

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:57.400 align:middle line:84%
of solitude or being
alone, loneliness

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.380 align:middle line:90%
is actually a state of mind.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:02.130 align:middle line:90%


00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:05.400 align:middle line:84%
It can hurt, and it can
leave you feeling isolated.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.800 align:middle line:84%
But the good news is
it's often temporary,

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.870 align:middle line:84%
and today we're
going to help ease

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:11.700 align:middle line:90%
any feelings of loneliness.

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:15.720 align:middle line:90%


00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.550 align:middle line:84%
This feeling you've
been having is

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:21.570 align:middle line:84%
fueled by the more attention
you give it, the more you

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:28.650 align:middle line:84%
focus on yourself, the more
you become self-absorbed.

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:30.900 align:middle line:84%
It distracts you
from focusing on what

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:34.950 align:middle line:84%
may help you, which is
creating and maintaining

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:39.110 align:middle line:90%
meaningful relationships.

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:45.370 align:middle line:84%
So from now on, you make the
effort to reach out to others,

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:50.220 align:middle line:84%
to initiate conversation,
and to have some face time,

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.110 align:middle line:84%
even when you
don't feel like it.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:55.660 align:middle line:90%


00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.540 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you're going to
break the cycle of loneliness

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:02.230 align:middle line:84%
by finding and spending
time with people who enjoy

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:05.464 align:middle line:90%
the same activities as you.

00:12:05.464 --> 00:12:10.180 align:middle line:84%
You have a newfound
curiosity about others,

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.880 align:middle line:84%
finding shared
interests which helps

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.225 align:middle line:84%
you to focus your mind on
much more positive thoughts.

00:12:16.225 --> 00:12:21.760 align:middle line:90%


00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.850 align:middle line:84%
As you start to understand
that loneliness is a feeling,

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:29.890 align:middle line:84%
it's not a fact, you realize
you now have the power

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:32.180 align:middle line:90%
to change this feeling.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:36.230 align:middle line:84%
To build connections,
meet new people,

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:38.720 align:middle line:84%
engage with old friends,
and fill your life

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.860 align:middle line:84%
with conversation
and shared interests.

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:48.510 align:middle line:90%


00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:51.770 align:middle line:84%
You no longer withdraw
into yourself,

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:54.830 align:middle line:84%
instead feeling a
burst of energy,

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:58.040 align:middle line:84%
an abundance of braveness
and courage and motivation

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.785 align:middle line:84%
to connect with people,
bringing a passion or interest

00:13:01.785 --> 00:13:02.585 align:middle line:90%
into your life.

00:13:02.585 --> 00:13:07.330 align:middle line:90%


00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.420 align:middle line:84%
You keep your thoughts
positive, understanding

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:14.760 align:middle line:84%
that negative thoughts
no longer serve you.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:19.690 align:middle line:84%
You feel confident, in control,
and ready to take action

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:21.430 align:middle line:90%
and reconnect with the world.

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:27.490 align:middle line:90%


00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:32.020 align:middle line:84%
Some feelings of loneliness can
stem from an emotional memory

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.360 align:middle line:84%
or something that's
happened to you in the past.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And if that's
relevant to you, you

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:39.900 align:middle line:84%
decide that now is the time
to let that feeling go.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:43.640 align:middle line:90%


00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:47.990 align:middle line:84%
Living too much in the past
can leave you feeling down,

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:50.720 align:middle line:84%
whereas worrying about what
might happen in the future

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.240 align:middle line:90%
can make you feel anxious.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:58.280 align:middle line:84%
So from now on, you decide
to live in the present,

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:03.980 align:middle line:84%
in the here and now where
you can control how you feel.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And you purposefully
and intentionally keep

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:09.620 align:middle line:84%
your thoughts positive
and uplifting.

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:15.520 align:middle line:90%


00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.640 align:middle line:84%
Each and every day,
you make a plan

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:23.530 align:middle line:84%
to fight the mental and
emotional habit of loneliness,

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:27.600 align:middle line:84%
because you know now
it's simply a habit.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And from now on, it's
a habit you will break.

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:36.510 align:middle line:84%
You have a newfound energy,
courage, and determination

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:40.680 align:middle line:84%
to make connections,
which sees you wanting

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.440 align:middle line:84%
friendly chats with people
because you instantly

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.790 align:middle line:90%
feel better because of them.

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:49.660 align:middle line:90%


00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.690 align:middle line:84%
It may be that you call
family members or friends

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:57.020 align:middle line:84%
or use online video programs to
meet people virtually or talk

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:57.820 align:middle line:90%
face to face.

00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:00.850 align:middle line:90%


00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:04.850 align:middle line:84%
You search for people who share
mutual interests with you,

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:06.610 align:middle line:84%
whether that's
cooking or sports.

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:09.470 align:middle line:84%
Or you may arrange to
read the same book,

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:13.045 align:middle line:84%
watch the same TV shows, or find
other ways to keep in touch.

00:15:13.045 --> 00:15:17.050 align:middle line:90%


00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:20.650 align:middle line:84%
Knowing that a shared
interest is a great starting

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:23.200 align:middle line:84%
point for a new
relationship, you're

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.000 align:middle line:90%
excited to build on this.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:32.120 align:middle line:90%


00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:36.620 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you make sure
you always seek and create

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:41.500 align:middle line:84%
new experiences,
which in turn makes

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.195 align:middle line:90%
you feel connected and valued.

00:15:43.195 --> 00:15:45.910 align:middle line:90%


00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:49.480 align:middle line:84%
You're no longer afraid of
getting to know new people

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:53.400 align:middle line:84%
or reconnecting
with old friends.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.650 align:middle line:84%
You try out a few
groups to see which

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:59.845 align:middle line:84%
ones fit you best and decreases
your feelings of loneliness

00:15:59.845 --> 00:16:00.645 align:middle line:90%
the most.

00:16:00.645 --> 00:16:03.400 align:middle line:90%


00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.760 align:middle line:84%
You feel confident
and self-assured

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:10.760 align:middle line:84%
that people are interested
and want to speak to you.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.300 align:middle line:90%
You have a lot to offer people.

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:17.400 align:middle line:90%


00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:21.140 align:middle line:84%
As you connect more and
share your life more,

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:25.010 align:middle line:84%
you still find time to
enjoy being on your own,

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:28.580 align:middle line:84%
enjoying your own
company, keeping

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:31.040 align:middle line:84%
your day filled with
interesting things to do

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.410 align:middle line:90%
and people to speak to.

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:36.830 align:middle line:90%


00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:40.100 align:middle line:84%
You talk more to strangers,
as even seemingly trivial

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.550 align:middle line:84%
interactions with strangers,
like chatting with a shop

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:48.110 align:middle line:84%
assistant or cashier, helps you
to keep your loneliness at bay,

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:50.420 align:middle line:84%
making you feel more
socially connected.

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:54.340 align:middle line:90%


00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:57.550 align:middle line:84%
You reach out to
people to say hi,

00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:00.100 align:middle line:84%
to ask them how they are,
to chat about whatever's

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:01.570 align:middle line:90%
on their mind.

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And these small acts
make a huge difference

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:08.800 align:middle line:84%
and again, help you reduce
those feelings of loneliness,

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.790 align:middle line:84%
leaving you feeling
fulfilled and happy.

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:14.410 align:middle line:90%


00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:17.140 align:middle line:84%
You feel confident,
full of gratitude

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:20.230 align:middle line:84%
for what you have in
your life, and positive

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:21.420 align:middle line:90%
about the future now.

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:24.410 align:middle line:90%


00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:28.640 align:middle line:84%
You start to rethink how you
spend your time, breaking

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.820 align:middle line:84%
the old habit of staying
in, watching TV on your own,

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:36.290 align:middle line:84%
or doing things in isolation,
choosing to make the effort

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:39.020 align:middle line:90%
to connect with people instead.

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, making
sure you fill your life

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.930 align:middle line:84%
with meaningful social
connections to help you

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:46.340 align:middle line:90%
start living differently.

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:51.630 align:middle line:90%


00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps you choose
to find a different way

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:59.070 align:middle line:84%
to interact with others,
such as giving back.

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And you know volunteering
is such a valuable way

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:03.795 align:middle line:84%
to meet other people
and to connect.

00:18:03.795 --> 00:18:06.590 align:middle line:90%


00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:09.350 align:middle line:84%
You find lots of ways to
offer support for people

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:12.920 align:middle line:84%
who may be in a similar
position to yourself,

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:16.430 align:middle line:84%
or whose circumstances may mean
that they're more vulnerable

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:17.780 align:middle line:90%
and in need than yourself.

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:23.740 align:middle line:90%


00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:25.810 align:middle line:84%
You're optimistic
about the new life

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:28.920 align:middle line:90%
you're creating for yourself.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.250 align:middle line:84%
You feel in control and
confident about breaking

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:35.520 align:middle line:84%
your old habit of
loneliness and bringing

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:39.560 align:middle line:84%
more social connections into
your life, which makes you feel

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.640 align:middle line:90%
happy and much more fulfilled.

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:47.630 align:middle line:90%


00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:51.190 align:middle line:84%
You feel confident and
positive about the future now.

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:57.060 align:middle line:90%


00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And these hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:02.090 align:middle line:84%
embedded in your
subconscious mind,

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:04.620 align:middle line:84%
and they'll become
more and more powerful

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.410 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:08.920 align:middle line:90%


00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count up from one to five

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:13.590 align:middle line:90%
to awaken you.

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of five, you'll
be wide awake, fully refreshed,

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:20.700 align:middle line:84%
alert, and feeling
fantastic, bringing back

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:24.040 align:middle line:84%
with you all the
wonderful new feelings.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:25.830 align:middle line:90%
Coming back now.

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:30.870 align:middle line:90%
One, two, three, four, and five.

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:33.620 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open when you're ready.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:38.000 align:middle line:90%
