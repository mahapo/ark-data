00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to House
of Well-Being.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.580 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to Getting
Over an Ex Hypnotherapy Audio.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.250 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.170 align:middle line:84%
But before it does,
I'd like to remind you

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.730 align:middle line:84%
that the following
audio contains

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.620 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.470 align:middle line:84%
aim to help you reach a
deep level of relaxation.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.200 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that wherever
you're listening to the audio,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.320 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place,

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.443 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions, where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:38.443 --> 00:00:40.860 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.460 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.530 align:middle line:84%
will alert you, and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.200 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
there's nothing at all

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.510 align:middle line:84%
you need to do apart
from close your eyes,

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.680 align:middle line:84%
relax, lie back, and
let go, and enjoy

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.200 align:middle line:84%
all those peaceful feelings
and all the benefits that

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.000 align:middle line:90%
come with it.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.740 align:middle line:90%


00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Make yourself as
comfortable as possible

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.025 align:middle line:84%
and concentrate on
the sound of my voice.

00:01:09.025 --> 00:01:11.780 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And begin by drawing in
a long, slow, deep breath

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.970 align:middle line:90%
in through your nose.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.020 align:middle line:90%
Hold the breath for a moment.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And now slightly open your
mouth and release all the air

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.990 align:middle line:84%
from your body in a
long, low, deep sigh,

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.190 align:middle line:84%
and relax, allowing your
lungs to naturally deflate

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.680 align:middle line:84%
as your body sinks into
gentle relaxation now.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.350 align:middle line:90%


00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.420 align:middle line:84%
Now in your
imagination, I'd like

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.400 align:middle line:84%
you to imagine that
you're standing

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.770 align:middle line:84%
on the top of a hill
on a beautiful island,

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.530 align:middle line:84%
and it's a lovely,
warm summer's day.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.950 align:middle line:84%
There's a clear blue sky,
not a cloud in sight,

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.620 align:middle line:84%
and the temperature is
just how you like it.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.630 align:middle line:90%


00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.260 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the gentle
warmth of the sun on your head

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.670 align:middle line:84%
and shoulders, and you can
hear the sounds of nature

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.075 align:middle line:84%
all around you, making you
feel even more relaxed.

00:02:24.075 --> 00:02:29.630 align:middle line:90%


00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.430 align:middle line:84%
The long grass in the
meadow below sways slightly,

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.680 align:middle line:84%
and you can see a
winding path that

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.100 align:middle line:84%
disappears into a
small apple orchard,

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.860 align:middle line:90%
just at the bottom of the hill.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.070 align:middle line:90%


00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And just beyond the
orchard, you can

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.460 align:middle line:84%
see the sea, the
sunlight darting off

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.910 align:middle line:84%
the tops of the waves,
and the whole ocean

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.590 align:middle line:90%
shimmering and sparkling.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.840 align:middle line:90%


00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.040 align:middle line:84%
You begin to move easily
down the path now,

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.570 align:middle line:84%
noticing the grass
springing under your feet,

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.870 align:middle line:84%
pushing you encouragingly
towards your destination.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.470 align:middle line:90%


00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And you catch the faint smell
of sea air and the breeze

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:27.965 align:middle line:84%
as you get closer to the
ocean now as you stroll down,

00:03:27.965 --> 00:03:29.890 align:middle line:90%
down the winding path.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And you move
smoothly and easily,

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.665 align:middle line:84%
and you feel relaxed and
centered and fully in control.

00:03:38.665 --> 00:03:43.470 align:middle line:90%


00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And you're becoming aware now
of a growing calm within you.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.830 align:middle line:90%


00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.040 align:middle line:84%
You stop to look at the
beautiful flowers growing

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:01.500 align:middle line:84%
each side of the path, their
colors so vivid and bright.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And you stand there for a
moment, taking in the view.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.130 align:middle line:84%
A feeling of happiness flows
through you, continuing down.

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.810 align:middle line:90%


00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:23.220 align:middle line:84%
You're aware now of a deep sense
of calmness and tranquility,

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.450 align:middle line:84%
right from the top of your
head to the tips of your toes,

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.900 align:middle line:84%
renewing your energy,
feeling wonderful.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.420 align:middle line:90%


00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.810 align:middle line:84%
As you walk, you find yourself
almost floating as though

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.648 align:middle line:84%
in a dream world down
towards the orchard.

00:04:39.648 --> 00:04:42.924 align:middle line:90%


00:04:42.924 --> 00:04:48.070 align:middle line:84%
You move with such ease,
with no effort whatsoever.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And in no time,
you find yourself

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.420 align:middle line:84%
drifting through
the fruit trees with

00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:00.150 align:middle line:84%
a lush, cool, green foliage
forming a canopy overhead.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.335 align:middle line:84%
And you see the
sunlight glittering

00:05:02.335 --> 00:05:03.210 align:middle line:90%
through the branches.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.710 align:middle line:90%


00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And as you stand there, you
feel a glittering sunlight

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.850 align:middle line:84%
on your face and neck, and
you feel and experience

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.135 align:middle line:84%
it vibrating throughout your
entire body-mind system.

00:05:20.135 --> 00:05:25.370 align:middle line:90%


00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And as the sunlight moves, it
glows and warms and soothes

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.460 align:middle line:90%
and heals your body and mind.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And you release and relax
and move down and down,

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.660 align:middle line:84%
taking in another deep breath,
relaxing even more now.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.470 align:middle line:90%


00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.080 align:middle line:84%
You can hear the
sound of the ocean

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.900 align:middle line:90%
as you move nearer and nearer.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And with every
step you take, you

00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:00.260 align:middle line:84%
feel more relaxed
and more calm as you

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.290 align:middle line:84%
follow that winding path
that leads you downwards.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:07.630 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.450 align:middle line:84%
You turn a corner,
and to your delight

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:17.320 align:middle line:84%
you find yourself on a
beautiful deserted beach,

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.790 align:middle line:84%
the beach sweeping away into
small bay in front of you.

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And the ocean is a striking
turquoise blue, pure and clear.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And you can feel the warm
sand underneath your shoes.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And you take your
shoes off, and you

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.430 align:middle line:84%
start walking lazily across
the beach to the water's edge.

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.220 align:middle line:90%


00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.550 align:middle line:84%
You feel the sand
beneath your feet

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.510 align:middle line:84%
and you feel the
sand change from cool

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:55.160 align:middle line:84%
to moist beneath your feet as
you wander along the shoreline.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:00.830 align:middle line:90%


00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.170 align:middle line:84%
As you turn around,
you start to walk up

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:07.610 align:middle line:84%
the beach towards
a grassy mound.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And as you walk up slowly, you
take in the smell of the ocean

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:17.450 align:middle line:84%
and you hear the sound
of the water hissing

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:18.560 align:middle line:90%
over the warm sand.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.720 align:middle line:90%


00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.980 align:middle line:84%
You reach the mound
now and you sit down,

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.090 align:middle line:90%
making yourself comfortable.

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.520 align:middle line:90%


00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And as you gaze out across
the breathtaking scene,

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:40.210 align:middle line:84%
you watch the waves roll
in and roll out again,

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:44.200 align:middle line:90%
rhythmically in and out again.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:49.380 align:middle line:90%


00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:52.680 align:middle line:84%
You play with the sand
through your fingers,

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.040 align:middle line:90%
noticing just how good you feel.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.370 align:middle line:90%
So relaxed now.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:03.690 align:middle line:84%
So relaxed that you've opened
up your subconscious mind

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:06.400 align:middle line:84%
and you're ready to start
making those changes

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.275 align:middle line:84%
you've been wanting to
make once and for all.

00:08:09.275 --> 00:08:15.100 align:middle line:90%


00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:19.090 align:middle line:84%
Now that you're in a
deeply relaxed state,

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:23.080 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to focus on moving
on from your last relationship.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:27.080 align:middle line:90%


00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.570 align:middle line:84%
Whether this was your
decision or theirs,

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:32.450 align:middle line:84%
it's always hard to adjust
to being on your own

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:36.540 align:middle line:84%
after a relationship and to
getting used to new routines

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:37.340 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:40.750 align:middle line:90%


00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:44.690 align:middle line:84%
But it's time to
move on now, time

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:48.250 align:middle line:90%
to find yourself once again.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And this doesn't have to
be a lonely time at all.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:57.660 align:middle line:84%
It may be just the chance you
need to create new friendships,

00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.595 align:middle line:90%
a partner, a soulmate.

00:08:59.595 --> 00:09:05.180 align:middle line:90%


00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And you know that
one of the best

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.950 align:middle line:84%
things you can do to
move on from an ex

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:13.670 align:middle line:84%
is to surround yourself
with people who you love

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:21.070 align:middle line:84%
and people who love you,
people who you connect with.

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:26.380 align:middle line:84%
That may be family or friends,
or connecting or reconnecting

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:30.070 align:middle line:84%
with people who care about
you, as this will start to add

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.650 align:middle line:90%
meaning back into your life.

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:35.910 align:middle line:90%


00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.690 align:middle line:84%
You can start to rebuild
meaning into your life

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:43.130 align:middle line:84%
once you take the time to
cultivate relationships that

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:47.000 align:middle line:84%
are separate and distinct
from your old relationship

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:47.925 align:middle line:90%
and your old self.

00:09:47.925 --> 00:09:53.370 align:middle line:90%


00:09:53.370 --> 00:10:01.880 align:middle line:84%
This is a new phase for you,
one of healing and recovery,

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:06.370 align:middle line:84%
but also one that's exciting,
whether you feel it now or not.

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:11.530 align:middle line:90%


00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:16.570 align:middle line:84%
You take the time now to
truly work out who you are,

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:20.910 align:middle line:84%
what you need, and how
to get your needs met.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:24.930 align:middle line:90%


00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:30.910 align:middle line:84%
So in this precious time now,
this time that's just for you,

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:33.760 align:middle line:84%
it's time to think
about your needs

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.460 align:middle line:84%
and how you want
to meet them now

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.920 align:middle line:84%
that you don't have to
think about someone else.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:44.190 align:middle line:90%


00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:47.700 align:middle line:84%
You take this time
to learn and to heal,

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:51.390 align:middle line:84%
which makes you feel excited,
positive, and motivated.

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:54.920 align:middle line:90%


00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.030 align:middle line:84%
You no longer think
about your ex-partner

00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:00.860 align:middle line:84%
as deep down you know
that you're moving on.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And you no longer have
the need or desire

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:06.950 align:middle line:84%
to waste any more time
focusing on something

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:08.145 align:middle line:90%
you can no longer change.

00:11:08.145 --> 00:11:13.440 align:middle line:90%


00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.190 align:middle line:84%
You realize now that you
weren't meant to be together.

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And whilst you still care
for this person very deeply,

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:25.740 align:middle line:84%
the relationship was never
the same as when you first

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.140 align:middle line:90%
started seeing each other.

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:32.050 align:middle line:90%


00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:34.540 align:middle line:90%
People change.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:37.310 align:middle line:90%
People grow.

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:42.210 align:middle line:84%
People go in different
directions, and that's OK.

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:44.040 align:middle line:84%
But you now realize
that you need

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:48.690 align:middle line:84%
someone who's on the same path,
going in the same direction

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:50.990 align:middle line:84%
and growing at the
same time as you.

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:55.590 align:middle line:90%


00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
you've decided now

00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:00.600 align:middle line:84%
to stop thinking
about your ex-partner

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.750 align:middle line:84%
and to get on with
your new life.

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And that makes you feel
excited, energized, and happy.

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:11.460 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to
imagine in your mind

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:14.310 align:middle line:84%
gathering all your ex-partner's
belongings together

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:16.020 align:middle line:84%
and placing them
into an old trunk.

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:18.810 align:middle line:90%


00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:22.620 align:middle line:84%
These may be photographs
or letters, memories

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:26.950 align:middle line:90%
or holidays or nights out.

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:29.520 align:middle line:84%
Gather them all up and
place them in the trunk.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:33.050 align:middle line:90%


00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:36.020 align:middle line:84%
Don't forget the
unpleasant memories too,

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:38.450 align:middle line:90%
not just the happy times.

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:41.510 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps there were rows, the
disappointments, the letdowns.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:42.965 align:middle line:90%
You place them all in the trunk.

00:12:42.965 --> 00:12:46.110 align:middle line:90%


00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And you take some
time now to think

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:51.200 align:middle line:84%
about what those memories
are and place them

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.240 align:middle line:90%
in the dusty old trunk now.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:13:00.470 align:middle line:90%


00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And as you place
them into the trunk,

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:06.280 align:middle line:84%
you notice how they start to
mean less and less to you.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:09.630 align:middle line:90%


00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:13.050 align:middle line:84%
You notice the
negative memories are

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:14.580 align:middle line:90%
greater than the happy ones.

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:19.270 align:middle line:90%


00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:22.960 align:middle line:84%
You notice there are far
more negative memories.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And as you place
them away, you start

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:28.750 align:middle line:90%
to feel strong and confident.

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:33.280 align:middle line:84%
You know that you have so many
exciting times to come now,

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.400 align:middle line:84%
and you're starting your healing
journey with self-confidence

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.620 align:middle line:90%
and determination.

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:42.550 align:middle line:90%


00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:45.880 align:middle line:84%
As you place the
memories into the trunk,

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:49.150 align:middle line:84%
you realize you're emptying
your mind now of all the things

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:52.990 align:middle line:84%
that have been holding you back
from moving on and preventing

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:55.990 align:middle line:90%
you from feeling good.

00:13:55.990 --> 00:14:03.250 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you feel strong and
empowered, self-confident and

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:04.770 align:middle line:90%
optimistic about the future.

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:08.910 align:middle line:90%


00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:11.270 align:middle line:84%
You have faith that you
don't need your ex-partner

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:12.070 align:middle line:90%
to be happy.

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:17.740 align:middle line:90%


00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:22.440 align:middle line:84%
You are perfectly capable
of being happy on your own.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:26.530 align:middle line:84%
It simply takes adjustment
and a little bit of time,

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:30.550 align:middle line:84%
but each day becoming
stronger and stronger,

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:35.950 align:middle line:84%
taking one day at a time, being
surrounded by family or friends

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:38.785 align:middle line:84%
and putting yourself and your
needs first for a change.

00:14:38.785 --> 00:14:42.800 align:middle line:90%


00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.370 align:middle line:84%
You are strong and confident,
calm and in control.

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:50.960 align:middle line:90%


00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.380 align:middle line:84%
It's now time to
put the trunk away,

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:56.840 align:middle line:84%
to say goodbye to those
memories and to be

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.830 align:middle line:90%
free of the burden of your past.

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:03.640 align:middle line:90%
And you know just the place.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.500 align:middle line:84%
At the back of
your mind is a room

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.720 align:middle line:90%
with a secret cupboard in it.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And in it, there may
also be many childhood

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.950 align:middle line:84%
forgotten memories that
no longer serve you.

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:16.490 align:middle line:90%


00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:18.560 align:middle line:84%
You decide this is
the perfect place

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.020 align:middle line:84%
to keep all the memories
from your ex-partner.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:24.410 align:middle line:90%


00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:26.180 align:middle line:84%
Here, you won't
stumble across them

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:30.660 align:middle line:84%
when randomly accessing
other information,

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:32.840 align:middle line:84%
but you aren't throwing
them totally away.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.380 align:middle line:90%


00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:39.370 align:middle line:84%
So in years to come,
you'll be able to look back

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:42.430 align:middle line:84%
at those memories with an
amusing sort of nostalgia.

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:47.280 align:middle line:90%


00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.250 align:middle line:84%
So you now imagine
taking the trunk

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.620 align:middle line:84%
and visualizing
yourself taking it

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.650 align:middle line:84%
across to the back of the room
where the secret cupboard is.

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:58.730 align:middle line:90%


00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And when all the items are
safely in the cupboard,

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.130 align:middle line:84%
you close the door
on those memories.

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:06.450 align:middle line:90%
You lock them away.

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:08.750 align:middle line:90%
You don't need them at all.

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:10.610 align:middle line:84%
You're ready to get
on with your life,

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:12.440 align:middle line:90%
to start living once again.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:18.430 align:middle line:90%


00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:21.310 align:middle line:84%
As you place the
trunk away, you think

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:24.970 align:middle line:84%
about the time of who
you were before you were

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:30.410 align:middle line:90%
with your partner, the old you.

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:35.030 align:middle line:84%
You remember being happy, fun,
busy, going through your life

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:37.500 align:middle line:90%
at your own pace.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.960 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it was easy then,
and it will be easy again.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:44.220 align:middle line:90%


00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.340 align:middle line:84%
Now that the memories
of your ex-partner

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.340 align:middle line:84%
are leaving your mind, you
feel like a great weight has

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:51.020 align:middle line:90%
been lifted off your shoulders.

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:54.280 align:middle line:90%


00:16:54.280 --> 00:17:00.480 align:middle line:84%
You feel the tension, stress,
and anxiety leave your body.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:05.790 align:middle line:84%
You feel free, light, and
you have a tremendous amount

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:11.069 align:middle line:84%
of hope and optimism
for the future,

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:15.690 align:middle line:84%
taking one day at a time,
feeling strong and confident.

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:19.240 align:middle line:90%


00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:20.180 align:middle line:90%
You feel good.

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:21.430 align:middle line:90%
You feel elated.

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:22.394 align:middle line:90%
And you feel happy.

00:17:22.394 --> 00:17:26.510 align:middle line:90%


00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:31.040 align:middle line:84%
You're free to do what you want
to do, when you want to do it,

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:35.130 align:middle line:84%
with no one questioning
your every move.

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:37.220 align:middle line:84%
The possibilities
are endless now.

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:41.870 align:middle line:90%


00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:44.140 align:middle line:84%
You're excited that you
can shape your future

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:45.490 align:middle line:90%
in any way you want to.

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:48.990 align:middle line:90%


00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:51.350 align:middle line:84%
You remember that you have
friends and family who

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:56.830 align:middle line:84%
love you, and you don't
feel alone in your journey.

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:59.050 align:middle line:84%
You're surrounded
with support and love,

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:01.555 align:middle line:84%
and they're excited to join
you in your new ventures.

00:18:01.555 --> 00:18:06.200 align:middle line:90%


00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And now life begins to take
on more meaning for you.

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:13.070 align:middle line:90%


00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:18.980 align:middle line:84%
You're open to new
possibilities, new horizons,

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:20.795 align:middle line:90%
ready to scale new heights.

00:18:20.795 --> 00:18:23.930 align:middle line:90%


00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:27.650 align:middle line:84%
It's a wonderful feeling
to be free, free as a bird,

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:31.580 align:middle line:84%
free to fly wherever you want,
feeling strong, confident,

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:32.380 align:middle line:90%
and calm.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:36.720 align:middle line:90%


00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.380 align:middle line:84%
Your subconscious mind realizes
that emotional freedom for you

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:44.300 align:middle line:90%
is just what you need right now.

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:49.220 align:middle line:84%
Putting yourself first
is just what you need,

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:51.190 align:middle line:84%
knowing that the
right person for you

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:54.200 align:middle line:84%
is just around the
corner, and you'll

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.330 align:middle line:84%
be in exactly the
right state of mind

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:59.770 align:middle line:84%
when you meet them as you're
feeling strong, confident,

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:00.570 align:middle line:90%
and happy.

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:09.340 align:middle line:90%


00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:11.260 align:middle line:84%
These hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.240 align:middle line:84%
embedded in your
subconscious mind.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:16.370 align:middle line:90%


00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:18.050 align:middle line:84%
They'll become more
and more powerful

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:22.100 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count from one up to five

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:26.630 align:middle line:90%
to awaken you.

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of five, you'll
be wide awake, fully refreshed,

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:32.950 align:middle line:84%
alert, and feeling
fantastic, bringing back

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:35.420 align:middle line:84%
with you all the
wonderful new feelings.

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:42.490 align:middle line:84%
So coming back now with one,
two, three, four, and five.

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:45.240 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open when you're ready.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:51.000 align:middle line:90%
