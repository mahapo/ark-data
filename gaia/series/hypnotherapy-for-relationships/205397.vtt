00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to House
of Well-Being.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.050 align:middle line:84%
You are listening to the
bereavement mind talk audio.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.780 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.220 align:middle line:84%
But before it
does, I'd just like

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.950 align:middle line:84%
to remind you that the
following audio contains

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.650 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.390 align:middle line:90%
aim to cause deep relaxation.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.990 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.530 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place,

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.370 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions, where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.910 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.230 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.860 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.040 align:middle line:84%
will alert you and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.630 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
there's nothing at all

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.400 align:middle line:84%
you need to do apart from close
your eyes, relax and let go,

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.190 align:middle line:84%
and enjoy the peaceful feelings
and all the benefit that

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.990 align:middle line:90%
comes with it.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.620 align:middle line:90%


00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.140 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to take in a very
deep breath, slowly inhaling,

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.320 align:middle line:84%
filling your lower
and upper lungs.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And exhaling again, allowing
your lungs to deflate naturally

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.010 align:middle line:90%
and slowly.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.100 align:middle line:90%


00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And once you've done
that, I'd like you

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.930 align:middle line:84%
once again to take in a deep
breath, filling your lungs.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready,
allow that breath

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:41.780 align:middle line:84%
to slowly release as you
exhale, gently and powerfully.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.560 align:middle line:90%


00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And now you can
allow your breathing

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.850 align:middle line:84%
to return to normal, your
normal breathing pace.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.940 align:middle line:84%
Gentle breaths in and out
as you normally would.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.440 align:middle line:90%


00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And as you relax, you're
aware of your eyes,

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.150 align:middle line:84%
of how comfortable they
feel, closed and relaxed,

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.405 align:middle line:90%
totally at ease.

00:02:07.405 --> 00:02:12.450 align:middle line:90%


00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now to
focus only on my words,

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.510 align:middle line:84%
and nothing else bothers
or concerns you at all.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.610 align:middle line:84%
This is your time, and no
one needs or wants anything

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.410 align:middle line:90%
from you.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.330 align:middle line:90%


00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.460 align:middle line:84%
Putting everything
else aside, I'm

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.930 align:middle line:84%
going to draw your attention
to various parts of your body.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And as I draw your attention
to that part of your body,

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.670 align:middle line:84%
you can allow each part
to relax and to release,

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.620 align:middle line:84%
each muscle and nerve,
every part of it as I

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.040 align:middle line:90%
refer to it in turn.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.500 align:middle line:90%


00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.080 align:middle line:84%
So let's first focus
on your fingers

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.720 align:middle line:84%
and your hands, your
wrists, your forearms,

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.620 align:middle line:90%
and your upper arms.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.110 align:middle line:90%


00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And as you think about
this part of your body,

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.430 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to be aware of
any tension in those muscles,

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.065 align:middle line:90%
and concentrate on that tension.

00:03:18.065 --> 00:03:21.116 align:middle line:90%


00:03:21.116 --> 00:03:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And now as you allow those
muscles to relax and release,

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.500 align:middle line:84%
every nerve, every
fiber in your hands,

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.470 align:middle line:84%
your wrists and fingers,
arms, allow that tension

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:44.550 align:middle line:84%
to flow away now, to drain down,
allowing the muscles to rest

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:51.960 align:middle line:84%
and release,
lengthen and loosen.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.464 align:middle line:84%
Feel your arms become heavier
as they release completely.

00:03:56.464 --> 00:04:00.550 align:middle line:90%


00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.790 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to
concentrate your attention

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.050 align:middle line:84%
on your feet, your ankles,
your calves, your knees,

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.730 align:middle line:84%
and the large muscles
of your thighs,

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.865 align:middle line:84%
aware of any tension
in those muscles.

00:04:15.865 --> 00:04:19.410 align:middle line:90%


00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And as you concentrate
on them, you

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:28.790 align:middle line:84%
can relax every muscle, every
fiber in your legs and feet,

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.440 align:middle line:84%
allowing all of attention
to fade away now

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.930 align:middle line:84%
as you drift deeper
into relaxation.

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.900 align:middle line:90%


00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:44.620 align:middle line:84%
Muscles loosening and
lengthening as muscles

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.570 align:middle line:90%
relax and release now.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.570 align:middle line:84%
Legs feeling heavy as
you release completely.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.270 align:middle line:90%


00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.810 align:middle line:84%
Aware now of your chest,
your lower back muscles,

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:06.480 align:middle line:84%
your stomach muscles, your
upper back and upper chest.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.760 align:middle line:84%
Notice how all the muscles
in this part of your body

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.100 align:middle line:84%
are now becoming more
and more relaxed,

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:21.470 align:middle line:84%
loosening and lengthening
as each muscle releases

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.990 align:middle line:90%
and tension drains away now.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.570 align:middle line:90%


00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Now allow your shoulders to
sink into the frame of your body

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.920 align:middle line:90%
as you sink into relaxation.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.870 align:middle line:90%


00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:46.630 align:middle line:84%
All the little muscles in
your neck and scalp, aware

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.320 align:middle line:90%
of the tension here.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And now you can
release that tension

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.680 align:middle line:84%
as every muscle in
this part of your body

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.940 align:middle line:84%
becomes more and more
relaxed, so that you

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.820 align:middle line:84%
can feel each and every
muscle in your body

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.410 align:middle line:84%
now loose and limp as that
comfortable heaviness continues

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:07.210 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:12.500 align:middle line:90%


00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And whilst you're
relaxing in this way,

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.900 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to
use your imagination

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.530 align:middle line:84%
to think about a
beautiful summer's day.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.730 align:middle line:90%


00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.190 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to
imagine that you're

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:31.405 align:middle line:84%
floating on a cloud, so
peaceful and so quiet.

00:06:31.405 --> 00:06:34.430 align:middle line:90%


00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:39.440 align:middle line:84%
You feel safe and secure,
and you enjoy the serenity

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.750 align:middle line:84%
and peace as you
float and drift,

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.970 align:middle line:90%
feeling so comfortable and calm.

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:50.070 align:middle line:84%
You're completely at ease,
and every muscle and nerve

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:52.140 align:middle line:84%
in your entire
body is completely

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:58.570 align:middle line:84%
relaxed as you go deeper and
deeper into relaxation now.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:01.770 align:middle line:90%


00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder if you can
allow yourself to sink deeper

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:10.040 align:middle line:84%
into relaxation now as I
count from one down to three.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.920 align:middle line:90%


00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And as I reach the
number three, you

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:19.130 align:middle line:84%
can allow yourself to have
drifted much, much deeper

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.080 align:middle line:90%
than you've ever been.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.470 align:middle line:90%


00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:28.310 align:middle line:84%
So one, your entire body
completely released now.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.190 align:middle line:84%
Every muscle, every
nerve, and every fiber

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.560 align:middle line:90%
relaxed and at ease.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.830 align:middle line:84%
Your entire body feeling
completely relaxed

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:38.510 align:middle line:90%
and comfortably heavy now.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.330 align:middle line:90%


00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And two, your head
feeling so heavy now.

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's a really
pleasant feeling,

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.390 align:middle line:90%
and you feel safe and secure.

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And you're enjoying this
state of deep relaxation

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.840 align:middle line:84%
as you fall further and
further into relaxation now.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.410 align:middle line:90%


00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And you're now deeper than
you've ever been, so deeply

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:10.300 align:middle line:84%
relaxed that every
word I utter to you

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.390 align:middle line:84%
will sink into your
subconscious mind

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:20.230 align:middle line:84%
and create some powerful changes
as you sink deeper and deeper.

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:23.610 align:middle line:84%
Mind alert, but body
totally relaxed now.

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:29.670 align:middle line:90%


00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:32.700 align:middle line:84%
Losing someone we love is
the most difficult thing

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.820 align:middle line:90%
that we ever have to cope with.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And at this particular time of
your life, it's natural for you

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:43.400 align:middle line:84%
to experience many
unhappy feelings

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.900 align:middle line:90%
that you find hard to bear.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:49.640 align:middle line:90%


00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.510 align:middle line:84%
Grieving is a highly
individual experience.

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:55.280 align:middle line:90%


00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:59.480 align:middle line:84%
There's no right or
wrong way to grieve.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:03.000 align:middle line:84%
How you grieve depends
on many factors,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.010 align:middle line:84%
including your personality
and coping style, your life

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:11.360 align:middle line:84%
experience, your faith, and
how significant the loss was

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.160 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.170 align:middle line:90%


00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And you know that inevitably,
the grieving process

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:20.940 align:middle line:90%
takes time.

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.010 align:middle line:90%
Healing happens gradually.

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:26.845 align:middle line:84%
It can't be forced or hurried,
and there's no normal timetable

00:09:26.845 --> 00:09:27.645 align:middle line:90%
for grieving.

00:09:27.645 --> 00:09:32.010 align:middle line:90%


00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:35.520 align:middle line:84%
While grieving a loss is
an inevitable part of life,

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.960 align:middle line:84%
there are ways to help
cope with the pain,

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.510 align:middle line:84%
come to terms with your
grief, and eventually

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:46.280 align:middle line:84%
find a way to pick up
the pieces and continue

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:50.300 align:middle line:84%
to live your life whilst dealing
with the pain and grieving.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:54.420 align:middle line:90%


00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.630 align:middle line:84%
The first step is to
acknowledge your pain

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.060 align:middle line:84%
and to accept that
your grief may trigger

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.240 align:middle line:84%
many different and
unexpected emotions, which

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.340 align:middle line:90%
is perfectly normal.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:07.590 align:middle line:90%


00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:13.470 align:middle line:84%
Understanding that your grieving
process is unique to you,

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:17.690 align:middle line:84%
so seek out support from the
people who care about you.

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And always support
yourself emotionally

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:23.630 align:middle line:84%
by taking care of
yourself physically.

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:27.640 align:middle line:90%


00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.010 align:middle line:84%
As we all go through
the grieving process

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:36.050 align:middle line:84%
in our own way, you may
feel that at the moment

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:39.980 align:middle line:84%
you're in a dark tunnel
to which there is no end.

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:44.730 align:middle line:84%
The emotions you experience
may change from day to day.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:47.700 align:middle line:84%
They may range from
denial to guilt or blame,

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.550 align:middle line:84%
from anger, to the
eventual healing

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:53.070 align:middle line:90%
stage, which is acceptance.

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:55.690 align:middle line:90%


00:10:55.690 --> 00:11:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And some people claim to
feel no emotion at all.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.750 align:middle line:84%
It's as though a part
of them has died too.

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:05.630 align:middle line:90%


00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And there may be times when
you feel you can't go on

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:11.470 align:middle line:90%
without the person you lost.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the
case, then you can

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:16.570 align:middle line:84%
accept that these feelings
are perfectly normal.

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:21.260 align:middle line:90%


00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.115 align:middle line:84%
And we may ask ourselves,
why did it happen?

00:11:24.115 --> 00:11:26.860 align:middle line:90%


00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And you may ask yourselves
all kinds of questions.

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:33.070 align:middle line:90%


00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:34.720 align:middle line:84%
You may wonder if
there was anything

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:40.700 align:middle line:84%
you could have done to prevent
your loss from happening.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:43.595 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps you feel angry
that you've lost someone.

00:11:43.595 --> 00:11:46.360 align:middle line:90%


00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And this is all a part
of the grieving process,

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:54.694 align:middle line:84%
and only you know what
you're feeling right now.

00:11:54.694 --> 00:11:57.430 align:middle line:84%
But you know that the
way you are feeling

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.380 align:middle line:84%
is not making you
happy, and this

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.750 align:middle line:84%
is why you're listening
to this mind talk today.

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:06.380 align:middle line:90%


00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And you know that you loved
this very special person.

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:15.830 align:middle line:84%
You still you, and I'm
sure you always will.

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:20.820 align:middle line:84%
You remember that no one can
ever take that away from you.

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And in time, it will
become easier for you.

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.680 align:middle line:84%
But for now, if you
feel like crying,

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:31.560 align:middle line:90%
then that's exactly what you do.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:35.957 align:middle line:84%
You know that you can't
bottle those feelings up,

00:12:35.957 --> 00:12:37.540 align:middle line:84%
because you know
they're an expression

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:40.840 align:middle line:90%
of your feelings of loss.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And when someone passes away,
we're upset for ourselves,

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:46.105 align:middle line:84%
as it's really our loss
that we're feeling.

00:12:46.105 --> 00:12:50.630 align:middle line:90%


00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:55.550 align:middle line:84%
The very special person that
you've lost is at peace,

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:57.230 align:middle line:84%
and if they may
have been suffering,

00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:01.970 align:middle line:84%
that suffering is over now,
and that loved one in your life

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:03.720 align:middle line:84%
will not have to go
through any more.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:08.480 align:middle line:90%


00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.180 align:middle line:84%
You may have beliefs of
your own that can help

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:14.610 align:middle line:90%
you get through this period.

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And some people believe
that the soul never

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:20.340 align:middle line:84%
dies, but goes back
to where it came from

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.350 align:middle line:84%
and to where one
day we will all go.

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:25.580 align:middle line:90%


00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:28.220 align:middle line:84%
One thing is for
certain, that there

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.340 align:middle line:84%
is a beginning and an end to
all our lives on this Earth,

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:34.085 align:middle line:84%
and the memories that you hold
in your heart are precious.

00:13:34.085 --> 00:13:37.190 align:middle line:90%


00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:39.550 align:middle line:84%
Although the person you
love is no longer here

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:43.930 align:middle line:84%
in a physical sense, you
remember that none of your past

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:46.990 align:middle line:84%
is physical anymore,
so your loved

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:50.450 align:middle line:90%
one will be with you forever.

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:55.370 align:middle line:84%
All your memories are there, and
you can take your memories out

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:57.960 align:middle line:84%
and look at them, feel
the presence of your loved

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:58.760 align:middle line:90%
one in your heart.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:01.280 align:middle line:90%


00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.410 align:middle line:84%
You can feel that
calm acceptance

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:06.215 align:middle line:84%
beginning to replace those
conflicting emotions.

00:14:06.215 --> 00:14:10.330 align:middle line:90%


00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And even now as you're
listening to this mind talk,

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:15.270 align:middle line:84%
you're already beginning
to feel calmer.

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:19.180 align:middle line:90%


00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And life becomes
brighter as you begin

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:23.920 align:middle line:84%
to see the light at
the end of the tunnel.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.450 align:middle line:90%


00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And you can allow that
light to guide you out

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.260 align:middle line:90%
of the dark tunnel of grief.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:35.970 align:middle line:90%


00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:38.430 align:middle line:84%
Imagine your loved one
is here by your side,

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:40.110 align:middle line:84%
and how sad they
would be to know

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:41.235 align:middle line:90%
that you're still grieving.

00:14:41.235 --> 00:14:44.030 align:middle line:90%


00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:46.430 align:middle line:84%
Hear the voice of that
loved one telling you

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:51.300 align:middle line:84%
that it's now time
for you to move on,

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:55.650 align:middle line:84%
to hold their memory
tight, and you

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:57.405 align:middle line:90%
learn to live with that memory.

00:14:57.405 --> 00:15:01.640 align:middle line:90%


00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And in time, your grieving
becomes far less painful,

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:09.970 align:middle line:84%
but the memory is just
as strong for you.

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it's now time to begin
living the rest of your life.

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And you've been carrying
the heavy burden of grief

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.070 align:middle line:90%
for too long.

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:25.220 align:middle line:84%
It's now time to release it
and to set yourself free,

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.470 align:middle line:84%
keeping the memory
close to your heart,

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:33.270 align:middle line:84%
but setting yourself free from
the heavy burden of grief.

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:38.810 align:middle line:84%
So imagine now that
burden being lifted away,

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:41.360 align:middle line:84%
and you feel yourself
becoming lighter.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And notice the opening at the
end of the tunnel becoming

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.800 align:middle line:90%
larger as you draw nearer.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:50.270 align:middle line:90%


00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:52.935 align:middle line:84%
You experience
this lightness now

00:15:52.935 --> 00:15:55.150 align:middle line:84%
and some quiet for
a moment or two.

00:15:55.150 --> 00:16:04.130 align:middle line:90%


00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:08.890 align:middle line:84%
And as you approach the opening
and the light grows brighter,

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:11.770 align:middle line:84%
you experience a sensation
of calm and peace.

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:15.640 align:middle line:90%


00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And these feelings
of calmness and peace

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:22.230 align:middle line:84%
tell you that you're now on
your way to accepting your loss.

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:25.350 align:middle line:90%


00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:27.900 align:middle line:84%
You know in your heart
that each day, you'll

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:31.370 align:middle line:84%
become a little
stronger, and each day

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:36.010 align:middle line:84%
will become a little
easier for you to bear.

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:38.850 align:middle line:84%
You will always
have your memories,

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:41.700 align:middle line:84%
and you'll always have
love in your heart,

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:44.145 align:middle line:84%
with each day becoming
a little bit easier.

00:16:44.145 --> 00:16:47.750 align:middle line:90%


00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:49.940 align:middle line:84%
You know that no one
could ever replace

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.400 align:middle line:84%
that person that
you lost, and that's

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.770 align:middle line:90%
exactly how it should be.

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:59.700 align:middle line:90%


00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And maybe one day you still
find happiness in other people's

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:05.980 align:middle line:84%
company, and that
doesn't lessen how

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:10.240 align:middle line:84%
you feel for those who
have departed this life.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:17.329 align:middle line:84%
But now it's time to live your
life, accepting that loss.

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And your loved one would be
urging you to do just that.

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:25.230 align:middle line:90%


00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:26.670 align:middle line:84%
The loved one that
you lost would

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:30.706 align:middle line:84%
be wanting you to find happiness
again when you're ready.

00:17:30.706 --> 00:17:32.320 align:middle line:90%
And you're ready now.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.270 align:middle line:84%
You have proved that
you're ready by using

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:37.360 align:middle line:84%
your wonderful
subconscious mind to help

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.680 align:middle line:90%
you to cope with your loss.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.990 align:middle line:90%


00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to immerse
yourself in other activities,

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.570 align:middle line:84%
finding enjoyment
in life once again.

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:52.450 align:middle line:90%


00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:55.090 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps you're able
to talk about your loss

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:58.990 align:middle line:84%
to people who instinctively
know or understand

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:01.640 align:middle line:90%
what you've been through.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And you can do this
without experiencing

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:07.370 align:middle line:84%
the pain that used to
accompany such conversations.

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:12.750 align:middle line:90%


00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Your memories focus
around little things that

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.840 align:middle line:84%
make you smile and
appreciate the good times

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:22.500 align:middle line:90%
you shared with your loved one.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And you realize that this
is an opportunity for you

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:29.130 align:middle line:84%
to grow, to become
much more independent,

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:31.770 align:middle line:84%
and you can pride yourself
on developing new skills.

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:34.570 align:middle line:90%


00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And each new skill
that you master

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:38.950 align:middle line:90%
is another step to recovery.

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:43.350 align:middle line:90%


00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:47.790 align:middle line:84%
You take one day at a time,
taking each day as it comes.

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And you're gentle with
yourself, allowing others

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:55.710 align:middle line:84%
to comfort you if necessary,
and offering solace

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:58.150 align:middle line:84%
to those who may be
facing similar emotions.

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:02.450 align:middle line:90%


00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:06.800 align:middle line:84%
You recognize there may be
days when your sadness returns.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And if this happens,
you don't fight it.

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Instead, you allow yourself
to feel as you do for a while,

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:17.990 align:middle line:84%
but you follow these
episodes with something good.

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:20.970 align:middle line:90%


00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:23.400 align:middle line:84%
Now is the time to
look after yourself,

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.640 align:middle line:84%
to take care of yourself,
to pamper yourself,

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.630 align:middle line:84%
because you know that you need
it, and that you're worth it.

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:33.200 align:middle line:90%


00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.360 align:middle line:84%
You know that you can't
change what happened,

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.850 align:middle line:90%
and you accept this.

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And what you can do is
to be kind to yourself,

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.280 align:middle line:90%
and you make sure that you are.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:48.220 align:middle line:90%


00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:51.525 align:middle line:84%
Every day becomes easier
and you become stronger.

00:19:51.525 --> 00:19:54.150 align:middle line:90%


00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:57.810 align:middle line:84%
You find yourself enjoying
different activities

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:00.240 align:middle line:84%
and lending yourself
in some way that

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.875 align:middle line:90%
makes life easier for others.

00:20:01.875 --> 00:20:08.070 align:middle line:90%


00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:10.170 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you plant
a tree or a shrub

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:12.570 align:middle line:84%
to symbolize how you
feel about the person

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:16.050 align:middle line:90%
that you loved and lost.

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And in doing this, you realize
you haven't lost your loved

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:21.582 align:middle line:90%
one at all.

00:20:21.582 --> 00:20:26.520 align:middle line:84%
They left you a legacy and will
always be with you, something

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:30.890 align:middle line:84%
to treasure for the
rest of your life.

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:35.610 align:middle line:84%
You're moving forward now,
moving further and further

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:36.780 align:middle line:90%
towards the light.

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And every day, you feel
happier and stronger.

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:43.180 align:middle line:84%
Every day becomes
easier for you.

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:48.900 align:middle line:90%


00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And these suggestions are firmly
embedded in your subconscious

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:57.450 align:middle line:84%
mind, and they grow stronger
and stronger day by day.

00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:00.150 align:middle line:84%
They grow stronger day by
day, stronger by the hour,

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:01.820 align:middle line:90%
and stronger by the minute.

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:04.730 align:middle line:90%


00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count up from one to five

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.220 align:middle line:90%
to awaken you.

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:12.690 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of five, you'll
be wide awake, fully refreshed,

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:17.390 align:middle line:84%
alert, bringing back with you
all the wonderful new feelings.

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:19.330 align:middle line:90%
So coming back now.

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:24.590 align:middle line:90%
One, two, three, four, and five.

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:27.190 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open when you're ready.

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:32.000 align:middle line:90%
