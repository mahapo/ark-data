00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>> You are listening to the
Timidity Mind Talk audio.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.500 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.110 align:middle line:84%
But before it
does, I'd just like

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.350 align:middle line:84%
to remind you that the
following audio contains

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.980 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic suggestions
that help you reach

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.750 align:middle line:90%
a deep level of relaxation.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.840 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.440 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place,

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.550 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.600 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.380 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.980 align:middle line:84%
will alert you, and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.680 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
there's nothing at all

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.750 align:middle line:84%
that you need to do apart
from close your eyes,

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.810 align:middle line:90%
relax, lie back, and let go.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And really enjoy those peaceful
feelings and all the benefits

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.110 align:middle line:90%
that come with it.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.320 align:middle line:90%


00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.560 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to
imagine that you're

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.850 align:middle line:84%
in a beautiful garden
with colorful flowers

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.930 align:middle line:90%
and immaculate manicured lawns.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.530 align:middle line:90%


00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.670 align:middle line:84%
The sun is shining, and
the sky is a clear blue.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.460 align:middle line:84%
The temperature is
just how you like it,

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.750 align:middle line:90%
and there's a cool breeze.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.340 align:middle line:90%


00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.470 align:middle line:84%
There's no pollen
in the air at all,

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.230 align:middle line:84%
and you feel happy
and comfortable

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.630 align:middle line:90%
in the clean, fresh, pure air.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.870 align:middle line:90%


00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.870 align:middle line:84%
You take a look around you
at all the beautiful colors.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And you hear the sounds of
the birds singing overhead.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.110 align:middle line:90%


00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.375 align:middle line:84%
You're calm and relaxed here,
and you feel safe and secure.

00:02:08.375 --> 00:02:11.220 align:middle line:90%


00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now to
take in a deep breath.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And as you breathe out, you can
relax deeper and deeper now.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.940 align:middle line:90%


00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.140 align:middle line:84%
You take a gentle walk
around the garden,

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.955 align:middle line:90%
and you're barefoot as you walk.

00:02:32.955 --> 00:02:35.590 align:middle line:90%


00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.040 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the lush
green grass underfoot,

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.770 align:middle line:84%
and you walk towards
some beautiful flowers.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.980 align:middle line:84%
And as you get nearer, you can
smell that beautiful fragrant

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:48.780 align:middle line:90%
scent.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.030 align:middle line:90%


00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.900 align:middle line:84%
The colors are magnificent,
and they grow brighter

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.060 align:middle line:90%
as you approach them.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.060 align:middle line:90%


00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And now take in another
long, deep breath.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And as you inhale the
rich, fragrant scent,

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.180 align:middle line:84%
you relax even deeper as
you exhale gently now.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.420 align:middle line:90%


00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.230 align:middle line:84%
You take another stroll
around the garden,

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.215 align:middle line:84%
and you find a pathway
leading down to a beach.

00:03:30.215 --> 00:03:33.780 align:middle line:90%


00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.850 align:middle line:84%
You follow the path, stepping
down easily onto the wide steps

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.070 align:middle line:90%
beneath you.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:49.370 align:middle line:84%
As you go deeper and deeper,
you relax more and more

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.885 align:middle line:90%
with every step you take.

00:03:50.885 --> 00:03:54.070 align:middle line:90%


00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And you soon reach the
beautiful beach, which is empty.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And it has a golden sand
like a fine powder underfoot.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.710 align:middle line:90%


00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:13.440 align:middle line:84%
You enjoy the feeling of soft,
powdery sand beneath your feet.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.614 align:middle line:84%
And you take a look
out at the horizon.

00:04:15.614 --> 00:04:20.000 align:middle line:90%


00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.930 align:middle line:84%
You take in the
vastness of the sea,

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.360 align:middle line:84%
and you watch as the waves
rhythmically roll in and out

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.030 align:middle line:90%
again, one after the other.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:41.240 align:middle line:84%
Gentle rhythmic waves
rolling towards the beach

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.930 align:middle line:84%
and back out again,
the sound of the waves

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.962 align:middle line:90%
peaceful and reassuring.

00:04:50.962 --> 00:04:56.340 align:middle line:90%


00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.360 align:middle line:84%
You feel a sense
of calm and peace

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:07.350 align:middle line:84%
as the sun gently shines down
on you with a warm sea air

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.380 align:middle line:90%
gently sweeping over you.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.300 align:middle line:90%


00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.070 align:middle line:84%
As you walk across the
beach, you feel your feet

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:25.160 align:middle line:84%
sinking further into the sand,
leaving a delicate footprint

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:36.200 align:middle line:84%
behind you as you walk onwards,
relaxing deeper and deeper

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.045 align:middle line:90%
with every step you take.

00:05:38.045 --> 00:05:44.480 align:middle line:90%


00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And as you reach the seas
edge, the waves gently rolling

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:57.340 align:middle line:84%
in and out, you notice how
your feet sink deeper than

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.025 align:middle line:90%
before into the wet sand.

00:06:00.025 --> 00:06:04.370 align:middle line:90%


00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.760 align:middle line:84%
You feel the water gently
lap at your ankles.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.450 align:middle line:90%


00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:14.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's warm and
inviting as you

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:23.210 align:middle line:84%
let your toes test the water
with every wave that rolls in

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.890 align:middle line:90%
and back out again.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:31.710 align:middle line:90%


00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And after a while
when you're ready,

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.390 align:middle line:90%
you walk back up the beach.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lovely deck
chair waiting just for you

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.910 align:middle line:84%
on the sand under an
umbrella, offering

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:48.740 align:middle line:90%
just the right amount of shade.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.960 align:middle line:90%


00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.250 align:middle line:84%
You take a seat, and
you relax deeply now.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.790 align:middle line:84%
You take in a deep
breath and take

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:06.280 align:middle line:84%
in your beautiful surroundings
as you gently exhale now.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:13.110 align:middle line:90%


00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:18.070 align:middle line:84%
You look out at the
calming sea again,

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:26.135 align:middle line:84%
and you notice the sky, a clear
blue sky without a cloud in it.

00:07:26.135 --> 00:07:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling so
relaxed now as you sit

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:34.130 align:middle line:84%
and relax comfortably and
deeply in your deck chair.

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:39.780 align:middle line:90%


00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:43.740 align:middle line:84%
As you rest in that chair,
you can allow your mind

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:47.040 align:middle line:90%
to imagine a staircase.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.850 align:middle line:84%
A beautiful staircase
with polished ornate

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:56.760 align:middle line:84%
banister running down alongside
a deep, rich carpet that

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.835 align:middle line:84%
feels soft to the touch
underneath your bare feet.

00:07:59.835 --> 00:08:05.990 align:middle line:90%


00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.750 align:middle line:84%
As you look down the
stairs, you notice

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.840 align:middle line:84%
that there are 10 steps
leading gently down.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.690 align:middle line:90%


00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:18.975 align:middle line:84%
10 steps leading
gently down and down.

00:08:18.975 --> 00:08:22.010 align:middle line:90%


00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And these are the steps
that will lead you

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.150 align:middle line:84%
into deep relaxation,
giving you access

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:31.810 align:middle line:84%
to that powerful
subconscious, allowing

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:35.470 align:middle line:84%
you to make those changes
that you want to make today.

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:41.240 align:middle line:90%


00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:46.320 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, I'd like you to
walk down those steps with me,

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.015 align:middle line:84%
and I'll count them off
for you one at a time.

00:08:49.015 --> 00:08:51.990 align:middle line:90%


00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find that
the deeper down you go,

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:59.760 align:middle line:84%
the more comfortable and the
more relaxed you'll become.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.200 align:middle line:90%


00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:08.470 align:middle line:84%
So when you're ready to
walk down the stairs,

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:13.440 align:middle line:84%
I want you to gently place
your hand onto the banister,

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:18.840 align:middle line:84%
and begin to slowly descend the
staircase as I count them off

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.981 align:middle line:90%
from 10 to one.

00:09:20.981 --> 00:09:24.669 align:middle line:90%


00:09:24.669 --> 00:09:30.170 align:middle line:84%
10, deeply relaxed,
deeply comfortable.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:34.170 align:middle line:90%


00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Nine, deeply relaxed,
deeply comfortable.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:42.330 align:middle line:90%


00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:47.570 align:middle line:84%
Eight, more and
more relaxed now,

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.110 align:middle line:84%
sinking even further
into relaxation.

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:54.980 align:middle line:90%


00:09:54.980 --> 00:10:01.730 align:middle line:84%
Seven, deeply comfortable,
feeling every muscle release

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:03.615 align:middle line:90%
as you go deeper and deeper.

00:10:03.615 --> 00:10:06.950 align:middle line:90%


00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Six, five, even further into
your deep state of relaxation

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:15.510 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:19.360 align:middle line:90%


00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.760 align:middle line:84%
Four, allowing
your mind and body

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:26.080 align:middle line:84%
to fully relax as you sink
further into deep relaxation.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:30.370 align:middle line:90%


00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:36.630 align:middle line:84%
Three, comfortable, heavy, any
tension completely gone now.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:40.090 align:middle line:90%


00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:42.610 align:middle line:90%
Two, almost at the bottom now.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:46.190 align:middle line:90%
Just one more step to go.

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:51.140 align:middle line:84%
And one, going deeper
and deeper down now into

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:56.400 align:middle line:84%
hypnosis, all the way down to
that deeper, healthier level

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.200 align:middle line:90%
of mind.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.600 align:middle line:90%
Deeper than you've ever been.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.580 align:middle line:90%


00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And as you reach the
bottom of the staircase,

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.600 align:middle line:84%
letting go of the
banister, you let

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.463 align:middle line:90%
go of any worries or concerns.

00:11:11.463 --> 00:11:14.590 align:middle line:90%


00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:19.590 align:middle line:84%
This is your time, and you let
nothing bother or concern you

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:21.540 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:24.410 align:middle line:84%
Nobody needs or wants
anything from you.

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:29.500 align:middle line:90%


00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And you're now standing at the
bottom of those steps feeling

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:37.465 align:middle line:84%
so very comfortable, very
relaxed and at peace.

00:11:37.465 --> 00:11:41.760 align:middle line:90%


00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:47.570 align:middle line:84%
You can allow those stairs and
the ordinary everyday world

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:51.470 align:middle line:84%
to just fade away, further
and further away now.

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:54.570 align:middle line:90%


00:11:54.570 --> 00:12:00.180 align:middle line:84%
As you sit deeply into the
comfortable relaxing state,

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:05.305 align:middle line:84%
deeply inside of you,
your subconscious mind

00:12:05.305 --> 00:12:09.160 align:middle line:90%
is still fully alert and aware.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.940 align:middle line:84%
But you're ready for the
changes about to come.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:16.950 align:middle line:90%


00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And as you relax
deeper still, you

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.650 align:middle line:84%
find your mind
expanding and opening up

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:30.470 align:middle line:90%
to new thoughts and new ideas.

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And your subconscious mind
is receptive and eager

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:38.270 align:middle line:84%
to act upon the
suggestions that it

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:42.702 align:middle line:84%
hears during this relaxing,
hypnotic experience.

00:12:42.702 --> 00:12:47.600 align:middle line:90%


00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:51.320 align:middle line:84%
In the past, or
maybe just recently,

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.410 align:middle line:84%
you found it quite
difficult to approach others

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:57.920 align:middle line:90%
in a calm and confident manner.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And you found yourself
being more shy and timid

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.585 align:middle line:90%
than you would have liked.

00:13:03.585 --> 00:13:06.850 align:middle line:90%


00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:12.220 align:middle line:84%
But deep within, within
your subconscious mind,

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:18.320 align:middle line:84%
you know that really, you're
just as good as anyone else.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.200 align:middle line:84%
There's no reason for
others not to welcome

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:26.645 align:middle line:84%
your ideas, thoughts, and
actions with open arms.

00:13:26.645 --> 00:13:30.490 align:middle line:90%


00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:35.340 align:middle line:84%
Imagine yourself now, and you're
with colleagues or friends.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling
confident and self-assured.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.200 align:middle line:90%


00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.560 align:middle line:84%
See yourself interacting
with others positively.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.880 align:middle line:90%


00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:54.170 align:middle line:84%
What would it be like if
you were so confident?

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Imagine now how
you would behave,

00:13:58.370 --> 00:13:59.805 align:middle line:90%
how you would carry yourself.

00:13:59.805 --> 00:14:03.730 align:middle line:90%


00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:09.760 align:middle line:84%
See in your mind your
confident facial expression,

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.485 align:middle line:90%
your self-assured posture.

00:14:11.485 --> 00:14:15.080 align:middle line:90%


00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.100 align:middle line:84%
Have a think about what your
inner monologue would be.

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:22.530 align:middle line:90%


00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And you know it would be
filled with positivity

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.170 align:middle line:90%
and affirmations.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.500 align:middle line:84%
This may be quite
a different picture

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.560 align:middle line:84%
to the current
version of yourself,

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.230 align:middle line:84%
but we're going to
change this here and now.

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:40.620 align:middle line:90%


00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:45.930 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to once again take
in a deep and powerful breath,

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:47.845 align:middle line:84%
filling your lower
and upper lungs.

00:14:47.845 --> 00:14:50.460 align:middle line:90%


00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And take a long,
slow exhalation out,

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.260 align:middle line:84%
allowing yourself
to relax deeply now.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.440 align:middle line:90%


00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And imagine yourself now
talking to others once again.

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:10.940 align:middle line:84%
You're confident
and self-assured.

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:14.180 align:middle line:84%
Notice your slow and
steady heart rate.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.720 align:middle line:90%


00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:24.550 align:middle line:84%
See how steady your hands are
and how smooth your voice is.

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:30.490 align:middle line:84%
See yourself smiling,
calm, speaking out loud

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:34.270 align:middle line:90%
to individuals or groups.

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And it feels good
to imagine yourself

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:43.020 align:middle line:84%
handling all kinds of social
situations positively.

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:46.920 align:middle line:84%
You show genuine interest
in others, and they like it.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And conversations flow
easily and naturally.

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:54.060 align:middle line:90%


00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And now, let's change the
visualization slightly

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:00.255 align:middle line:90%
to imagine the shyness itself.

00:16:00.255 --> 00:16:03.460 align:middle line:90%


00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:07.930 align:middle line:84%
Picture what it's
like to be shy.

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And what does shyness
mean to you specifically?

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:14.000 align:middle line:90%


00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.180 align:middle line:84%
Have a think about whether
shyness means difficulty

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:21.530 align:middle line:84%
in speaking to
others, or maybe it's

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:24.800 align:middle line:84%
a feeling of
embarrassment in public,

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.300 align:middle line:84%
or a tendency to be
quiet around people.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.260 align:middle line:90%


00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:34.010 align:middle line:84%
Have a think of what it means
to you to be shy for you

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:35.120 align:middle line:90%
as an individual.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:42.160 align:middle line:90%


00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.055 align:middle line:90%
And you can overcome shyness.

00:16:44.055 --> 00:16:46.740 align:middle line:90%


00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:51.000 align:middle line:84%
And the most effective
way for overcoming shyness

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.700 align:middle line:84%
is to challenge the
shyness by gently

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:57.150 align:middle line:84%
facing head-on the
situations that

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:58.790 align:middle line:90%
are most difficult for you.

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:02.340 align:middle line:90%


00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:06.599 align:middle line:84%
But we'll do this now so
your mind has a rehearsal,

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:08.430 align:middle line:84%
and you can allow
your confidence

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:10.395 align:middle line:90%
to build up slowly but surely.

00:17:10.395 --> 00:17:14.380 align:middle line:90%


00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:20.670 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to picture
your most difficult situation,

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:23.230 align:middle line:84%
the one where you
experience the most shyness.

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:27.500 align:middle line:90%


00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:32.690 align:middle line:84%
Walk yourself through the
situation now in your mind.

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:37.790 align:middle line:84%
Picture as many of the
details as you can.

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:40.940 align:middle line:90%
What can you say?

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:42.425 align:middle line:90%
Who is with you?

00:17:42.425 --> 00:17:44.750 align:middle line:90%
What can you smell?

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:48.750 align:middle line:90%
What time of day is it?

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And all the while,
still breathing

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:56.760 align:middle line:84%
in and out, deep, calm
breaths, still deeply relaxed.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:01.230 align:middle line:90%


00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And see yourself
handling that challenge,

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:11.910 align:middle line:84%
handling that situation,
facing directly the situation

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:13.845 align:middle line:90%
in which you feel the most shy.

00:18:13.845 --> 00:18:17.740 align:middle line:90%


00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:19.870 align:middle line:84%
Picture the confident
version of yourself.

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:23.410 align:middle line:90%


00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:28.360 align:middle line:84%
Picture that confident version
of yourself in that situation

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:31.450 align:middle line:90%
you saw just a few moments ago.

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And see yourself
facing a situation

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:35.780 align:middle line:90%
where you felt shy in the past.

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:39.550 align:middle line:90%


00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:43.990 align:middle line:84%
See that confident version
of yourself holding your body

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:50.470 align:middle line:84%
language assuredly,
speaking to others,

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:54.280 align:middle line:84%
holding yourself
confidently, and smiling

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.860 align:middle line:84%
as you're enjoying the
attention that you're receiving.

00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:00.880 align:middle line:90%


00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:03.100 align:middle line:84%
It may just be a
small change that's

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:07.190 align:middle line:84%
needed, whether
it's asking people

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:10.910 align:middle line:84%
questions about
themselves or the way

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:12.980 align:middle line:84%
you hold your new
confident body.

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.580 align:middle line:90%


00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:22.210 align:middle line:84%
The value you now give yourself,
the confidence you're exuding.

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:25.420 align:middle line:84%
But others are now
drawn to you, and you're

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:28.000 align:middle line:84%
thrilled with the changes
you see taking place.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.740 align:middle line:90%


00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:34.440 align:middle line:84%
You're now overcoming
that old shyness.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:38.010 align:middle line:90%


00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:41.580 align:middle line:84%
You're no longer
that old shy person,

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:45.960 align:middle line:84%
and you're able to handle
the situation positively,

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.970 align:middle line:90%
with confidence.

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And you no longer
welcome timidity.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:54.770 align:middle line:90%


00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:59.200 align:middle line:84%
Your mind has gone through
the mental rehearsal,

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.230 align:middle line:84%
and you know that next time
you face that situation,

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:06.340 align:middle line:84%
you can face it with
much more confidence.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.490 align:middle line:84%
You speak confidently
and clearly

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:11.560 align:middle line:84%
as you know you're
valued, and you

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:16.070 align:middle line:84%
respect what you have to say
to be heard and to be counted.

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:20.210 align:middle line:90%


00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And you know that it's
normal to feel nervous.

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And this same feeling
of nervousness

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:30.130 align:middle line:90%
is also linked to excitement.

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And you embrace it, for
you are a new person now,

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:38.140 align:middle line:84%
and you're capable
and confident.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:40.150 align:middle line:84%
You're much stronger
and much more

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:43.360 align:middle line:84%
capable of overcoming
shyness than you may realize.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:47.710 align:middle line:90%


00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:52.030 align:middle line:84%
So again, take a few
moments to mentally face

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:55.030 align:middle line:84%
the situation where you
experience the most shyness.

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:58.340 align:middle line:90%


00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:03.500 align:middle line:84%
Imagine your future self
now, a self who is not shy.

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And see that this exact same
person is present already

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.120 align:middle line:90%
within you.

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:10.940 align:middle line:90%


00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:15.560 align:middle line:84%
You have a confident,
positive self within you just

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:17.300 align:middle line:90%
waiting to come to the surface.

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.880 align:middle line:90%


00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And imagine how
good it will feel

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:26.610 align:middle line:84%
to overcome that shyness
from being filled

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:28.380 align:middle line:90%
with a feeling of confidence.

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:31.530 align:middle line:90%


00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:35.080 align:middle line:84%
Feeling confident
now, knowing you

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:39.090 align:middle line:84%
will achieve self-assurance
and the ability

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:41.500 align:middle line:84%
to interact with
others and feel great.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.070 align:middle line:90%


00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:49.760 align:middle line:84%
Overcoming shyness is possible,
and you are achieving it now.

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:53.350 align:middle line:90%


00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Experience and absorb those
feelings of self-assurance

00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:59.350 align:middle line:90%
and calm right now.

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:01.295 align:middle line:84%
And allow those
feelings to grow.

00:22:01.295 --> 00:22:04.150 align:middle line:90%


00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:07.800 align:middle line:84%
Enjoy how it feels to be
relaxed and confident.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:11.700 align:middle line:90%


00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And from this day
forward, you find

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:20.460 align:middle line:84%
yourself feeling calmer, more
relaxed, and more confident

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:24.830 align:middle line:84%
and fully at ease in the
company of others, maybe

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:26.465 align:middle line:90%
socially or maybe at work.

00:22:26.465 --> 00:22:29.630 align:middle line:90%


00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:32.985 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to take a genuine
interest in other people.

00:22:32.985 --> 00:22:35.560 align:middle line:90%


00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And because you're becoming
more absorbed in others,

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:43.850 align:middle line:84%
you become less and less
concerned with yourself

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:45.590 align:middle line:90%
and how others perceive you.

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:48.970 align:middle line:90%


00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And you know and recognize
that you're not necessarily

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:56.620 align:middle line:84%
the focus of other
people's attention.

00:22:56.620 --> 00:23:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And the more focus you put on
them and what they have to say,

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:03.850 align:middle line:84%
the less you focus
on yourself too.

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:08.200 align:middle line:90%


00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.230 align:middle line:84%
If you do focus
inwardly, then you

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:14.440 align:middle line:84%
remember not to
think negatively,

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:20.080 align:middle line:84%
as that will only fuel
the feelings of timidity.

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:24.640 align:middle line:84%
You immediately remind yourself
that you're valued, worthy,

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:28.000 align:middle line:84%
enough, and that
you're confident.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.370 align:middle line:84%
From now on, your mental
inner monologue is positive.

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:35.215 align:middle line:90%
No more negative self-talk.

00:23:35.215 --> 00:23:40.110 align:middle line:90%


00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:44.640 align:middle line:84%
You know that any time you're
about to face a situation where

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:48.540 align:middle line:84%
you experience shyness,
you can recall this feeling

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:53.280 align:middle line:84%
of confidence and relaxation
and experience this feeling

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.090 align:middle line:90%
once again.

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:59.050 align:middle line:90%


00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And you may find that
soon, maybe today

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:08.150 align:middle line:84%
or maybe tomorrow, you feel
motivated and excited to face

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:14.090 align:middle line:84%
a situation that's
challenging for you.

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:19.040 align:middle line:84%
You're excited to
face these situations.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And you know that they may have
been challenging previously,

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:25.730 align:middle line:84%
but you now embrace
those feelings

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:27.920 align:middle line:90%
of confidence and calm.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:33.610 align:middle line:90%


00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And every time
you hear my voice,

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:41.410 align:middle line:84%
these words will become
more and more profound.

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:44.830 align:middle line:90%
And they feel right for you.

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And these suggestions are deeply
embedded in your subconscious

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:52.360 align:middle line:84%
mind, where they can grow
stronger and stronger

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:59.250 align:middle line:84%
with each moment, each hour,
each day, week, and month

00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:00.050 align:middle line:90%
that passes.

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:03.690 align:middle line:90%


00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:06.090 align:middle line:84%
These hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:09.120 align:middle line:84%
embedded in your
subconscious mind

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.310 align:middle line:84%
and will become more
and more powerful

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:14.830 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count up from one to five

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:19.763 align:middle line:90%
to awaken you.

00:25:19.763 --> 00:25:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And at the count
of five, you will

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:26.830 align:middle line:84%
be wide awake, fully refreshed,
alert, and feeling fantastic,

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:29.140 align:middle line:84%
bringing back with you all
the wonderful new feelings.

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:30.990 align:middle line:90%
So coming back now.

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:37.410 align:middle line:90%
One, two, three, four, and five.

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:40.130 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open when you're ready.

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:48.000 align:middle line:90%
