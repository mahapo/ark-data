00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Hi, I'm Sophie from
the House of Wellbeing.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.310 align:middle line:10%
In our "Relationships Guided
Meditation and Hypnotherapy

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.520 align:middle line:10%
Series," you'll find audios to
help you improve your existing

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.520 align:middle line:10%
relationships, to help you
deal with any loss, perhaps

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.280 align:middle line:10%
bereavement, or
getting over an ex,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.900 align:middle line:10%
as well as confidence
to come out,

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.730 align:middle line:10%
confidence with
dating in general,

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.570 align:middle line:10%
or overcoming sexual
performance anxiety.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.240 align:middle line:84%
All of our audios are slightly
different to just meditation

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.070 align:middle line:84%
alone, because we
use a combination

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.680 align:middle line:84%
of powerful therapeutic
tools, including

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.490 align:middle line:84%
cognitive behavioral therapy,
neurolinguistic therapy,

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.620 align:middle line:84%
visualization, and of
course, hypnotherapy.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's that combination
of all of those tools

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.950 align:middle line:84%
put together which
makes them so powerful

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.500 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of the
negative thinking patterns

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.328 align:middle line:84%
and instead, replace with
positive thinking patterns.

00:00:53.328 --> 00:00:54.870 align:middle line:10%
When you listen to
our audios, you'll

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.208 align:middle line:10%
be put into a deep
state of relaxation.

00:00:57.208 --> 00:00:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's a state that's
really familiar to you.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.720 align:middle line:84%
It's the same
state of relaxation

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.950 align:middle line:90%
you go into as you fall asleep.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.013 align:middle line:84%
So it's a really natural
state and it's really safe.

00:01:07.013 --> 00:01:08.430 align:middle line:84%
When you're in
that relaxed state,

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.830 align:middle line:84%
you go through the
theta brainwave state,

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.230 align:middle line:84%
and that means we can
bypass your conscious mind

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.080 align:middle line:84%
and instead talk directly
to your subconscious mind.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.450 align:middle line:90%
And that's really important.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.550 align:middle line:10%
Your subconscious
mind is the place

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.050 align:middle line:10%
that holds all your permanent
thinking, your beliefs,

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.720 align:middle line:10%
your habits, and memories.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.700 align:middle line:10%
So we want to get into
your subconscious mind

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.980 align:middle line:10%
to really make those changes.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.190 align:middle line:10%
And we're then able to
retrain, reframe, and rewire

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.860 align:middle line:10%
your thinking, meaning
we can eliminate

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.160 align:middle line:10%
any of those unwanted fears
or negative thinking patterns.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And instead, we can replace
them with empowering

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.960 align:middle line:84%
positive, long-lasting,
powerful changes.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.850 align:middle line:10%
We recommend that you
listen to our audios

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.160 align:middle line:10%
at least four times
so you can override

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.900 align:middle line:10%
those old negative
thinking patterns

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.270 align:middle line:10%
and really compound
the positivity

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.150 align:middle line:10%
and create new positive
neural pathways.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And you should soon
start to see changes

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.270 align:middle line:84%
in the way you think
and feel about an issue.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.800 align:middle line:84%
When you listen
to our audios, you

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.050 align:middle line:84%
can listen to them at
any time of day or night.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.550 align:middle line:84%
But we suggest that
you don't listen

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.320 align:middle line:90%
to them when you're too tired.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.780 align:middle line:84%
Because if you fall into
a deep state of sleep,

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.640 align:middle line:84%
then your subconscious mind
just won't be listening.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.520 align:middle line:84%
Please make sure that when
you listen to our audios,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.560 align:middle line:84%
you're free from
any distractions.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.990 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to
them when you're actively

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.650 align:middle line:84%
doing anything, such as
driving or operating machinery.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.680 align:middle line:84%
We just want you to be lovely
and comfortable and just really

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.680 align:middle line:84%
relaxed, but free
from interruptions.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.650 align:middle line:84%
If there's an emergency and you
need to come out of hypnosis,

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.460 align:middle line:90%
that's no problem.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.630 align:middle line:90%
That's absolutely fine.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.730 align:middle line:84%
Your subconscious
mind will alert you

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.560 align:middle line:84%
and you'll easily
come out of hypnosis.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.620 align:middle line:10%
It will be just like waking
up from a nap or from a sleep.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.920 align:middle line:84%
So for now, please click
on any audio you think

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.990 align:middle line:84%
is relevant to
you in the series.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.690 align:middle line:84%
Find a comfortable position
where you can fully relax,

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.900 align:middle line:84%
and let go, maybe
on a bed or a chair.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.010 align:middle line:90%
And close your eyes to begin.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.000 align:middle line:90%
