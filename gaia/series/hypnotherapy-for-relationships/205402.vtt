00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Welcome to the
House of Wellbeing.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.380 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to the Open
to Love Hypnotherapy audio.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.370 align:middle line:84%
In a moment,
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:20.860 align:middle line:84%
But before it
does, I'd just like

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.990 align:middle line:84%
to remind you that the
following audio contains

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.510 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.015 align:middle line:84%
aim to help you reach a
deep level of relaxation.

00:00:29.015 --> 00:00:31.640 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.850 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.450 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.020 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.350 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.590 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.870 align:middle line:84%
will alert you, and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.670 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
there's nothing at all

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.790 align:middle line:84%
you need to do apart
from close your eyes,

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.630 align:middle line:84%
relax, and let go,
and really enjoy

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.930 align:middle line:84%
those peaceful feelings and all
the benefits that come with it.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:05.770 align:middle line:90%


00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.660 align:middle line:84%
Make yourself as
comfortable as possible,

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.045 align:middle line:84%
and concentrate on
the sound of my voice.

00:01:12.045 --> 00:01:14.690 align:middle line:90%


00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And begin by drawing in
a long, slow, deep breath

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.990 align:middle line:90%
in through your nose.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.620 align:middle line:84%
Hold the breath for a
moment, and now slightly

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.560 align:middle line:84%
open your mouth and
release all the air

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.020 align:middle line:84%
from your body in a
long, low, deep sigh.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And relax, allowing your
lungs to naturally deflate

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.630 align:middle line:84%
as your body sinks into
gentle relaxation now.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.100 align:middle line:90%


00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.300 align:middle line:90%
And you can release any tension.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.280 align:middle line:84%
Relax and let go as I
guide you through a journey

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:07.250 align:middle line:84%
of relaxation, a journey that
you will find very beneficial

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.850 align:middle line:90%
for your overall well-being.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.270 align:middle line:90%


00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.150 align:middle line:84%
You're going to start
this calming experience

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.340 align:middle line:84%
by first relaxing your
whole body mind system.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.100 align:middle line:90%


00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's true to say that the
simple act of relaxing the body

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.780 align:middle line:84%
and mind has a positive knock-on
effect, because how you think

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.040 align:middle line:90%
determines how you feel.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And how you feel influences
the world around you.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And how you choose
to think today

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.360 align:middle line:84%
affects your decisions
from here on in.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.010 align:middle line:84%
So to make my
assurances your reality,

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.050 align:middle line:84%
let's begin by
focusing your attention

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.460 align:middle line:90%
at the very top of your head.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:06.570 align:middle line:84%
Tension often starts at the
scalp and the neck, so mentally

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.510 align:middle line:84%
and physically allow
all the muscles

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.170 align:middle line:84%
around the top of your
head to relax now.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.260 align:middle line:90%


00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Letting all the
tension simply dissolve

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.160 align:middle line:84%
as you start to tune in
to your body mind system.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.330 align:middle line:90%


00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:36.800 align:middle line:84%
Just let any tension you may
be holding to release now.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.020 align:middle line:84%
Allow your brain to relax,
the left and the right

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.020 align:middle line:84%
lobes of the brain
just releasing.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Such a simple thought, yet so
profound and so significant.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.600 align:middle line:90%
Just letting go completely.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.400 align:middle line:90%


00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.010 align:middle line:84%
Drifting further and further
down, nobody wanting anything.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.720 align:middle line:90%
Nobody needing anything.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.430 align:middle line:90%
This is your time to relax.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.150 align:middle line:90%


00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Taking the relaxation
into the face

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:18.810 align:middle line:84%
now, allowing all of your
facial muscles to feel loose.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.900 align:middle line:84%
Feel your brow relaxing,
your forehead smoothing out,

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.720 align:middle line:90%
the back of your eyes relaxing.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.530 align:middle line:90%


00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.910 align:middle line:84%
Tiny muscles around
your eyes and eyelids,

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.070 align:middle line:84%
down into your cheeks and
into your jaw muscles,

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.010 align:middle line:90%
just releasing and letting go.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.060 align:middle line:90%


00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.370 align:middle line:84%
Allowing your
tongue to fall away

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.280 align:middle line:90%
from the roof of your mouth.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And should you find you need
to swallow, just do that now.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And drift down and
down deeper and deeper

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.240 align:middle line:90%
into blissful relaxation.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.860 align:middle line:90%


00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.590 align:middle line:84%
The more you physically
relax, the more

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.800 align:middle line:90%
you can mentally relax.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And when you can
mentally relax, you

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.990 align:middle line:90%
can think much more clearly.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And when you think more clearly,
your life becomes clearer.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.990 align:middle line:84%
You make better decisions,
and you're much more

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.265 align:middle line:90%
in control of your days.

00:05:27.265 --> 00:05:31.240 align:middle line:90%


00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.080 align:middle line:84%
So noticing now how
your neck feels,

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:41.860 align:middle line:84%
relaxing all the little muscles,
letting go of the strain,

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.025 align:middle line:90%
letting go of the tension.

00:05:43.025 --> 00:05:46.650 align:middle line:90%


00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.910 align:middle line:84%
Allow that tension and you
may be holding your shoulder

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.110 align:middle line:90%
to go now.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.740 align:middle line:84%
Feel those shoulders,
both of them sinking

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.690 align:middle line:90%
into the frame of your body.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.960 align:middle line:84%
Feel your neck lengthen
as you do this.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.360 align:middle line:90%


00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.740 align:middle line:84%
Feel or imagine all your
cares and worries just

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:15.460 align:middle line:84%
rolling off your shoulders now
as you take the relaxation down

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:21.700 align:middle line:84%
now into the tops of your
arms, letting any tension you

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.920 align:middle line:90%
may be holding just drain away.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.620 align:middle line:90%


00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And as your awareness flows
down through your upper arms,

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.870 align:middle line:84%
into your elbows, all the
muscles in your forearms

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:45.620 align:middle line:84%
relax, right down to your
wrists and into your hands.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.355 align:middle line:84%
And way down into the very tips
of your fingers and thumbs.

00:06:49.355 --> 00:06:53.330 align:middle line:90%


00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.000 align:middle line:90%
Your arms are feeling so heavy.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.215 align:middle line:90%
Your body's so comfortable.

00:06:59.215 --> 00:07:01.950 align:middle line:90%


00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.490 align:middle line:84%
Nothing whatsoever
to do but just

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:10.160 align:middle line:84%
relax and enjoy this feeling
of total release now.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:16.150 align:middle line:90%


00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:20.940 align:middle line:84%
As you let go of all the
tension in those muscles,

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:27.210 align:middle line:84%
you may experience them becoming
calmer and gently releasing.

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:30.170 align:middle line:90%


00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And just tune into the
feeling of simply letting go.

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:37.690 align:middle line:90%


00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:41.240 align:middle line:84%
As you become aware
of your breathing,

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:48.610 align:middle line:84%
notice that you are now
breathing steadily and slowly,

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:51.340 align:middle line:90%
rhythmically.

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And with each exhale,
you feel yourself just

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:59.660 align:middle line:84%
relaxing even more
deeply, allowing

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:05.210 align:middle line:84%
any tension in the chest area
now to simply drain away.

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:08.630 align:middle line:84%
Letting go completely
and totally.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.650 align:middle line:90%


00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:16.330 align:middle line:84%
Bring awareness into
your stomach now,

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:21.050 align:middle line:84%
and let all your
stomach muscles relax.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And as you do, I
want you to imagine

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:27.670 align:middle line:84%
a ball of sunlight passing
down from the top of your head

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:32.409 align:middle line:84%
down through your face, your
throat, and into your stomach.

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:36.370 align:middle line:90%


00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:39.490 align:middle line:84%
Visualize this healing
energy passing down

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:44.415 align:middle line:84%
through your throat and
chest and into your stomach.

00:08:44.415 --> 00:08:48.340 align:middle line:90%


00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:55.750 align:middle line:84%
So see and feel the sunlight
swirling and rotating.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:09:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And as the light glows, it
warms, and soothes, and heals.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And you release and relax and
drift down and further down.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:13.440 align:middle line:90%


00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And in your imagination,
you send the sunlight out

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.850 align:middle line:84%
now to every nerve cell,
bone, muscle, fiber,

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:26.380 align:middle line:90%
and system of the body.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:29.680 align:middle line:84%
See it flowing through
the bloodstream,

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.551 align:middle line:90%
and leave the light there.

00:09:32.551 --> 00:09:36.610 align:middle line:90%
It knows what to do.

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:42.110 align:middle line:84%
As you take the relaxation,
round into your back muscles.

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And from your back muscles,
it relaxes those muscles

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:49.510 align:middle line:90%
either side of the spine.

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:56.920 align:middle line:84%
Releasing, relaxing,
and just letting go now.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.420 align:middle line:90%
Deeper and deeper now.

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:03.590 align:middle line:90%


00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:08.770 align:middle line:84%
As you relax your waist and the
muscles of your lower stomach,

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:12.850 align:middle line:84%
and down into the
pelvic area, all the way

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:16.890 align:middle line:84%
down through the large
thigh muscles, down

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:24.120 align:middle line:84%
through your knees, your
shins and you calves, just

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:28.716 align:middle line:84%
allow those areas of
the body to relax.

00:10:28.716 --> 00:10:30.089 align:middle line:90%
And let go.

00:10:30.089 --> 00:10:35.250 align:middle line:90%


00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:40.180 align:middle line:84%
You're so relaxed, so
heavy, so comfortable.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.370 align:middle line:90%


00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And now tune into that
comfortable feeling

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:54.530 align:middle line:84%
as you think on down to your
ankles and to your feet,

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:57.155 align:middle line:84%
right down to the very
tips of your toes.

00:10:57.155 --> 00:11:00.104 align:middle line:90%


00:11:00.104 --> 00:11:05.330 align:middle line:84%
All the muscles of your body
are now so beautifully relaxed,

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:11.780 align:middle line:84%
and you feel very heavy
and very comfortable.

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:17.165 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling centered and
relaxed and fully in control.

00:11:17.165 --> 00:11:23.030 align:middle line:90%


00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:25.070 align:middle line:84%
If there are any
areas of your body

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:28.160 align:middle line:84%
that still feel
tight or tense, you

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.580 align:middle line:84%
find that you can relax them
simply by giving yourself

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.010 align:middle line:90%
permission to do so.

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:37.090 align:middle line:90%


00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And you can now go even
deeper as I count down

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:41.320 align:middle line:90%
from eight to zero.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.110 align:middle line:90%


00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And with every number, you
feel yourself drifting further

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.510 align:middle line:90%
into blissful relaxation.

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:52.680 align:middle line:90%


00:11:52.680 --> 00:12:10.860 align:middle line:84%
So eight, seven, six, five,
deeper now, four, three,

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:15.090 align:middle line:90%
two, one and zero.

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:17.920 align:middle line:90%
Deeply relaxed.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Letting go of all the cares
and worries, all the tension

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:24.720 align:middle line:84%
and pressure and
stresses and strains.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.330 align:middle line:90%


00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:33.180 align:middle line:84%
Let them all ease from your
body and ease on your mind.

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And allow yourself to drift down
into a deeper, more blissful

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:41.060 align:middle line:90%
state of creative relaxation.

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:54.820 align:middle line:90%


00:12:54.820 --> 00:13:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And now that you're in
a deeply relaxed state,

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:04.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk about
your feelings around love.

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And it may be that
in the past you

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.340 align:middle line:84%
felt unable to move
forward in love

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:11.380 align:middle line:90%
and be open to a relationship.

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:14.710 align:middle line:90%


00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:19.450 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you want to rebuild the
trust that you have in others,

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:22.330 align:middle line:84%
knowing that what's
happened in the past

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.780 align:middle line:84%
doesn't necessarily mean
it will happen again.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:29.690 align:middle line:90%


00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:31.585 align:middle line:84%
And you may have already
made the decision

00:13:31.585 --> 00:13:34.690 align:middle line:90%
that you want to find love.

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's all that you need
right now, to be open to love,

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:41.110 align:middle line:84%
to go back to being
in a relationship

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:44.530 align:middle line:90%
or to start a relationship.

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:49.320 align:middle line:84%
To be able to forgive
any past experiences.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.100 align:middle line:90%
To trust and to love.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.290 align:middle line:84%
To look forward to
wonderful feelings

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:56.290 align:middle line:90%
of being with a partner.

00:13:56.290 --> 00:14:01.030 align:middle line:90%


00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:05.720 align:middle line:84%
You know that a relationship
is worth working at,

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.990 align:middle line:84%
which is why you're
now using your mind

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:10.330 align:middle line:90%
power to attract love.

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And you manifest daily,
opening yourself up for love

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.410 align:middle line:84%
more and more each
and every day.

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:21.580 align:middle line:90%


00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:25.450 align:middle line:84%
You know that you
want to move on.

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:29.170 align:middle line:84%
You've already decided to
do so, allowing the higher

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:33.040 align:middle line:84%
part of your mind to
reinforce and strengthen

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.440 align:middle line:90%
this decision right now.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:38.310 align:middle line:90%


00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you can imagine
your inner resolve

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:43.990 align:middle line:90%
as a shape or color.

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:47.710 align:middle line:84%
Or it may be an emotion, or
simply a feeling of certainty

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:49.990 align:middle line:84%
about a new love
entering your life.

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.810 align:middle line:90%


00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:56.350 align:middle line:90%
Feel that resolve growing.

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:58.570 align:middle line:84%
See it brightening
and glimmering

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:06.180 align:middle line:84%
like a new star on the horizon,
shining brightly and giving you

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:09.690 align:middle line:84%
reason to believe that
going forward with a partner

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:11.820 align:middle line:84%
will bring you so
much happiness.

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:17.080 align:middle line:90%


00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.990 align:middle line:84%
You make your resolve as
strong as you possibly

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:25.030 align:middle line:84%
can as you begin to open up to
new possibilities of finding

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:26.870 align:middle line:90%
love.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:29.470 align:middle line:84%
All you need to do
is allow it to work.

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:35.390 align:middle line:90%


00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:38.420 align:middle line:84%
You forgive yourself
or others for

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:42.090 align:middle line:90%
any past negative experiences.

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:46.170 align:middle line:84%
That's all in the past now, and
you're ready to leave it there.

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:48.740 align:middle line:90%
You are a different person now.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:49.970 align:middle line:90%
You have changed now.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:54.620 align:middle line:84%
You're growing as a person more
and more each and every day.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:58.240 align:middle line:90%


00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:01.150 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps in a past
relationship it

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:05.670 align:middle line:84%
wasn't going as well as it
should have at the time.

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:07.460 align:middle line:84%
Or just maybe you
or your partner

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.065 align:middle line:90%
felt unloved or unwanted.

00:16:09.065 --> 00:16:12.390 align:middle line:90%


00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And although the
relationship didn't work out,

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:20.400 align:middle line:84%
it's time now to move
forward, to find someone new,

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.025 align:middle line:84%
acknowledging and closing
the door to the past.

00:16:23.025 --> 00:16:26.160 align:middle line:90%


00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:30.420 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to affirm
in your mind after me.

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.790 align:middle line:84%
All things that
have offended me,

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:35.160 align:middle line:84%
I forgive from
within and without.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:38.690 align:middle line:90%


00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:42.630 align:middle line:84%
I forgive all things and people
from the past, the present,

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:43.485 align:middle line:90%
and the future.

00:16:43.485 --> 00:16:44.285 align:middle line:90%
I forgive.

00:16:44.285 --> 00:16:47.940 align:middle line:90%


00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:52.530 align:middle line:84%
I forgive completely
and unconditionally.

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:53.800 align:middle line:90%
I am free.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.095 align:middle line:90%
I am open to love.

00:16:55.095 --> 00:17:00.790 align:middle line:90%


00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Realize that nobody
can avoid exposure

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:07.180 align:middle line:84%
to all negative
influences and still

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:09.670 align:middle line:90%
be a part of the ongoing scene.

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:14.260 align:middle line:84%
But you can avoid
entertaining those influences

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.619 align:middle line:90%
or taking these things to heart.

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:23.260 align:middle line:84%
In the same way that a gardener
avoids cultivating weeds,

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.540 align:middle line:84%
you can also avoid
carrying these things

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.427 align:middle line:90%
into a new relationship.

00:17:27.427 --> 00:17:33.760 align:middle line:90%


00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And if you've never been
in a relationship before,

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:40.100 align:middle line:90%
you now feel ready.

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:45.410 align:middle line:84%
It's time to let go of fear and
embrace being with someone new

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:48.620 align:middle line:84%
and letting someone
into your life.

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:52.710 align:middle line:90%
You feel ready and excited.

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:59.080 align:middle line:84%
You now feel a wonderful
sense of freedom and hope.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.270 align:middle line:84%
It's as though a
huge weight has been

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:04.750 align:middle line:90%
lifted from your shoulders.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:10.010 align:middle line:84%
Or a heavy black cloud
has just blown away,

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:14.110 align:middle line:84%
making your world brighter and
a much happier place in which

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:14.910 align:middle line:90%
to live.

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:18.770 align:middle line:90%


00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Being open to love is a
liberating experience,

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:25.350 align:middle line:84%
and it brings hope and the
anticipation of good times

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:26.150 align:middle line:90%
to come.

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:30.100 align:middle line:90%


00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:33.460 align:middle line:84%
It gives release from
negative unwanted feelings

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:36.280 align:middle line:84%
and eases your mind,
your body, and your soul.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:41.170 align:middle line:90%


00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:44.890 align:middle line:84%
You're excited about
the future and what

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:46.690 align:middle line:90%
a new relationship can bring.

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And you feel full
of hope knowing

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:54.880 align:middle line:84%
that the right person for you
is just around the corner.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.530 align:middle line:84%
Someone to keep you
company, someone to talk to,

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:02.380 align:middle line:84%
to go on dates with, to make
you feel good about yourself

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:04.220 align:middle line:84%
and to create good
times together.

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:07.230 align:middle line:90%


00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And as you think about
these good times,

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:14.120 align:middle line:84%
these good feelings grow
stronger and stronger still.

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:17.700 align:middle line:90%


00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:20.610 align:middle line:84%
You concentrate on
the present and laying

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:23.880 align:middle line:84%
the foundations of a perfect
future together with someone.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:29.030 align:middle line:90%


00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:31.940 align:middle line:84%
For a few brief
moments, I wonder

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:34.360 align:middle line:84%
if you can imagine yourself
with a new partner.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.570 align:middle line:90%


00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:40.810 align:middle line:84%
See yourself having
fun together,

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:46.180 align:middle line:84%
laughing, smiling,
feeling so happy.

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:48.190 align:middle line:90%
See yourself in that scene now.

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:51.280 align:middle line:90%
Imagine it.

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.645 align:middle line:84%
Visualize yourself now
growing old together.

00:19:53.645 --> 00:19:56.890 align:middle line:90%


00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:01.280 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you're grandparents
or even great grandparents.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And when you venture out
together, you still hold hands.

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:08.960 align:middle line:84%
You still show affection and
communicate with each other.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And everyone knows how
much you love each other.

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:15.900 align:middle line:90%


00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:18.120 align:middle line:84%
I'll be quiet for
a moment or two

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:23.490 align:middle line:84%
as your subconscious mind
prepares this image for you.

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:26.190 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps you'll just
experience or sense

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:28.740 align:middle line:90%
when the two of you meet.

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:32.890 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this image, sensation, or
feeling will come to you later.

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And if it does, that's
absolutely fine.

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:41.660 align:middle line:90%


00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:45.550 align:middle line:84%
You and your new partner
have a great future together,

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:47.920 align:middle line:84%
and you're determined
and motivated

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.890 align:middle line:90%
to be open to love now.

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:53.590 align:middle line:90%


00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:56.140 align:middle line:84%
These feelings will grow
stronger and stronger

00:20:56.140 --> 00:21:00.700 align:middle line:84%
with each and every day,
feeling excited now.

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:03.950 align:middle line:90%


00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:07.130 align:middle line:84%
These suggestions are now firmly
embedded in your subconscious

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:10.640 align:middle line:84%
mind, and they'll also
grow stronger day by day,

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.600 align:middle line:84%
stronger by the minute,
and stronger by the hour.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:17.460 align:middle line:90%


00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count from one to five.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of five,
you'll be wide awake.

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:29.110 align:middle line:84%
You'll have beautiful feelings
flowing through your body, calm

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:32.950 align:middle line:84%
and peaceful thoughts
flowing through your mind.

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And these calm and peaceful
thoughts and feelings

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.920 align:middle line:90%
are going to remain with you.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.980 align:middle line:84%
