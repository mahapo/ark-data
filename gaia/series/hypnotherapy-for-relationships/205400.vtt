00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Welcome to House
of Well-Being.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.129 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to the
Insecurity in a Relationship

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.530 align:middle line:90%
Mind Talk audio.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.280 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.670 align:middle line:84%
But before it
does, I'd just like

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.370 align:middle line:84%
to remind you that the
following audio contains

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.010 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.850 align:middle line:84%
aim to help you reach a
deep level of relaxation.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.840 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.590 align:middle line:84%
So please, be sure that wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.890 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.220 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.420 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.008 align:middle line:84%
will alert you, and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:55.008 --> 00:00:56.550 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
there's nothing at all

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.680 align:middle line:84%
you need to do apart
from close your eyes,

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.940 align:middle line:84%
relax, lie back, and
let go, and enjoy

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.030 align:middle line:84%
all those peaceful feelings
and benefits that come with it.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.070 align:middle line:90%


00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.460 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to
make sure that you're

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.400 align:middle line:84%
in a comfortable position
with your eyes closed.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And you inhale
deeply, and hold it

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.050 align:middle line:90%
for a count of three seconds.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.620 align:middle line:90%


00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.730 align:middle line:90%
And exhale slowly.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.470 align:middle line:90%


00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.510 align:middle line:90%
Again, breathe in.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready,
you exhale slowly.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.660 align:middle line:90%


00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And one more time,
inhaling deeply now,

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.410 align:middle line:90%
and exhaling when you're ready.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And you can start to feel
every part of your body

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.725 align:middle line:90%
releasing now and relaxing.

00:01:55.725 --> 00:01:59.630 align:middle line:90%


00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Each time you're inhaling,
you're bringing more oxygen

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.220 align:middle line:90%
into your body.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.740 align:middle line:90%


00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And each time you exhale,
it causes your body

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.685 align:middle line:90%
to keep relaxing more and more.

00:02:11.685 --> 00:02:16.720 align:middle line:90%


00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And now, you can continue
breathing easily and freely

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.420 align:middle line:90%
at your body's normal pace.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.780 align:middle line:84%
Gentle breaths in and out as
you normally would breathe,

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.495 align:middle line:84%
feeling yourself becoming
more calm and peaceful.

00:02:29.495 --> 00:02:36.610 align:middle line:90%


00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And your subconscious
mind will always

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.980 align:middle line:84%
be aware of what
I'm saying to you.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.400 align:middle line:84%
So it becomes less
and less important

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.695 align:middle line:84%
for you to consciously
listen to my voice.

00:02:47.695 --> 00:02:50.800 align:middle line:90%


00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.370 align:middle line:84%
Your subconscious mind and
all levels of your inner mind

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.200 align:middle line:84%
can hear and receive
everything I tell you.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And your conscious mind
can relax completely now.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.890 align:middle line:90%


00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And you're continuing
to experience

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.730 align:middle line:90%
perfect peace of mind.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.750 align:middle line:90%


00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And you can feel yourself
moving into the situation

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.700 align:middle line:90%
I described to you.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.540 align:middle line:84%
It's going to happen
automatically.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.200 align:middle line:84%
You don't even need to
think about it consciously.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.960 align:middle line:90%


00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.400 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to imagine yourself
lying in a comfortable position

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.860 align:middle line:84%
near a stream of fresh, clear
water in a beautiful forest

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.450 align:middle line:90%
on a perfect summer day.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.730 align:middle line:90%


00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:51.190 align:middle line:84%
There's a warm, gentle breeze,
and the air is fresh and clean.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.340 align:middle line:84%
The sound of the peaceful
stream is so relaxing now.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.480 align:middle line:90%


00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And it keeps becoming
less important

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.150 align:middle line:84%
for you to consciously
listen to my voice,

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.830 align:middle line:84%
because your subconscious
mind is hearing and receiving

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.140 align:middle line:90%
everything I'm saying.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And in your mind, you're
enjoying the beauty of nature

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.450 align:middle line:84%
as the sunlight shines
through the trees,

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.710 align:middle line:84%
and you listen to the
gentle flow of water

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.840 align:middle line:84%
and the birds
singing cheerfully.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.886 align:middle line:90%


00:04:35.886 --> 00:04:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And you're lying there
comfortably relaxing now,

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.910 align:middle line:90%
so peaceful.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And you continue feeling more
relaxed than ever before.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.630 align:middle line:84%
As you continue enjoying this
peaceful, pleasant experience,

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.620 align:middle line:84%
a soothing drowsiness is
coming over your whole body

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.040 align:middle line:84%
from the top of your head
to the bottom of your feet.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.960 align:middle line:90%


00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.870 align:middle line:84%
You continue feeling calmer,
more relaxed, and more secure.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:17.700 align:middle line:90%


00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And now, as you lie
with your eyes closed,

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.370 align:middle line:84%
you are so relaxed and
comfortable and happy

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.410 align:middle line:84%
that you continue moving into
a more peaceful, more detached

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:29.210 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.100 align:middle line:90%


00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.310 align:middle line:84%
It may seem like you're
drifting into a state of sleep.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.610 align:middle line:90%


00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And there may be times when
it seems like my voice is

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.170 align:middle line:90%
a long distance away.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.530 align:middle line:84%
There may be times
when I'm talking to you

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.750 align:middle line:84%
and you're not consciously
aware of my voice.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's fine, because
your subconscious mind

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.260 align:middle line:90%
is receiving every word I say.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.530 align:middle line:90%


00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And from now on you
will be influenced only

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.935 align:middle line:84%
by positive thoughts,
ideas, and feelings.

00:06:04.935 --> 00:06:07.530 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:11.880 align:middle line:90%
More calm, secure, and relaxed.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.020 align:middle line:90%
More comfortable and at ease.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.805 align:middle line:84%
More in control of
yourself at all times.

00:06:18.805 --> 00:06:23.430 align:middle line:90%


00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.950 align:middle line:84%
Your mind enables
you to be relaxed

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:30.280 align:middle line:84%
and calm as you go about the
activities of your daily life.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.010 align:middle line:90%


00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And now in a moment, I'm going
to count down from 10 to 1.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And when I get the
count of one, you'll

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.530 align:middle line:84%
have relaxed into a deep,
deep state of relaxation.

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.322 align:middle line:90%


00:06:48.322 --> 00:06:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And now, take a deep breath
in and exhale slowly when

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.600 align:middle line:90%
you're ready.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.200 align:middle line:90%


00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:02.030 align:middle line:84%
So 10, focusing your
attention on your feet.

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:07.690 align:middle line:84%
Think about your feet, about
those feet and toes and ankles.

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:13.150 align:middle line:84%
Allow them to tense and
then release and get loose.

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:17.710 align:middle line:90%


00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:23.540 align:middle line:84%
Nine, now all those
muscles in your legs,

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.190 align:middle line:84%
your calves, and your
knees, your thighs.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.830 align:middle line:90%
Releasing those muscles now.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.545 align:middle line:84%
Feeling your legs becoming
heavier and heavier.

00:07:32.545 --> 00:07:36.770 align:middle line:90%


00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Eight, now feeling that
relaxation spreading

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:44.055 align:middle line:90%
into your body and your chest.

00:07:44.055 --> 00:07:48.700 align:middle line:90%


00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:54.250 align:middle line:84%
Seven, now feel that
relaxation in your shoulders,

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:56.770 align:middle line:84%
spreading all the way
down into your arms,

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:00.530 align:middle line:84%
down into your hands
and your fingers.

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:03.400 align:middle line:90%
Your arms are feeling heavy.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.990 align:middle line:84%
So relaxed, as if they
belong to someone else now.

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:10.890 align:middle line:90%


00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And six, allow your
neck to release,

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:21.060 align:middle line:84%
aware of your face
relaxing, your cheeks

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:22.680 align:middle line:90%
and your jaw, your lips.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:29.130 align:middle line:90%


00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:33.140 align:middle line:90%
Five, let your eyes relax.

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:36.900 align:middle line:90%
Your eyebrows, your forehead.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And four, everything
feels loose and heavy

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:45.240 align:middle line:84%
as if your arms and
legs were made of stone.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.530 align:middle line:90%
Totally relaxed.

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:49.740 align:middle line:90%


00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:54.000 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the
weight pressing down

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.680 align:middle line:84%
and you can't be bothered to
move your arms and legs now.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.270 align:middle line:84%
You can enjoy the feeling
of total relaxation

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:03.720 align:middle line:90%
and letting go.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.470 align:middle line:84%
The more you relax,
the more you release.

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:11.160 align:middle line:90%


00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.350 align:middle line:84%
And three, as your
mind drifts off,

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:18.930 align:middle line:84%
you feel a wave of relaxation
traveling down your body.

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:22.090 align:middle line:84%
Down from the top of your
head, relaxing your face,

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:26.930 align:middle line:84%
your neck, your shoulders, your
body spreading down and down.

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:30.630 align:middle line:90%


00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And two, each
soft, gentle breath

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:37.660 align:middle line:90%
relaxing you more and more.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.070 align:middle line:90%
Nothing matters now.

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:40.240 align:middle line:90%
This is your time.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.820 align:middle line:90%


00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.320 align:middle line:90%
And one, totally relaxed now.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.400 align:middle line:90%
Totally at ease.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.330 align:middle line:84%
A place where you feel
relaxed and comfortable.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.040 align:middle line:90%


00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.600 align:middle line:84%
Think of what that
place is like.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:02.730 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a beach or a favorite
chair, or snuggled warm in bed

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:04.710 align:middle line:90%
on a stormy night.

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.320 align:middle line:84%
Maybe floating in
some warm water.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.860 align:middle line:90%


00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:14.640 align:middle line:84%
Allow your mind to drift
over these things, whatever

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.040 align:middle line:90%
feels right for you.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.240 align:middle line:90%
Nothing matters.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.480 align:middle line:90%
This is your time to relax.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.360 align:middle line:84%
Just being in the moment
and letting your mind

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.530 align:middle line:84%
empty as you enjoy the state
of deep relaxation now.

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:35.430 align:middle line:90%


00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:38.460 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to focus now on
your feelings of insecurity

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:39.500 align:middle line:90%
in your relationship.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.380 align:middle line:90%


00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And we know that many people
feel jealous and insecure

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.270 align:middle line:84%
in their relationships, even if
they're loved unconditionally

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:49.070 align:middle line:90%
by their partner.

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.980 align:middle line:90%


00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Whether you are in a
relatively new relationship

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.350 align:middle line:84%
or a long relationship,
today we're

00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:59.450 align:middle line:84%
going to help you start
to feel more secure.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:02.960 align:middle line:90%


00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.240 align:middle line:84%
Relationships in
particular may stir up

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:09.440 align:middle line:90%
past hurts and experiences.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.640 align:middle line:84%
They may awaken insecurities
that you've long buried.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.375 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps they'll bring up
emotions that you don't expect.

00:11:16.375 --> 00:11:19.800 align:middle line:90%


00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.670 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, when you feel
insecure in a relationship,

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:25.970 align:middle line:84%
it's because you haven't dealt
with whatever's putting you

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:26.945 align:middle line:90%
in a negative state.

00:11:26.945 --> 00:11:30.410 align:middle line:90%


00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:33.050 align:middle line:84%
For instance, is it
that your needs aren't

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:35.810 align:middle line:90%
being met by your relationship?

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Or could it be something
outside your union,

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:41.570 align:middle line:84%
perhaps a lack of
self-confidence

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:42.910 align:middle line:90%
or fear of the unknown?

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:45.860 align:middle line:90%


00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, there's
an internal dialogue

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.160 align:middle line:84%
that accompanies our
feelings of insecurity,

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.485 align:middle line:84%
and that's called our
critical inner voice.

00:11:54.485 --> 00:11:59.300 align:middle line:90%


00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Listening to this inner
critic can do serious damage

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.350 align:middle line:90%
to your relationship.

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:09.340 align:middle line:84%
It may cause you to feel
desperate towards your partner

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.710 align:middle line:84%
or pull back when things
start to get serious.

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:15.850 align:middle line:90%


00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:19.240 align:middle line:84%
So today, we're going
to start by interrupting

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.700 align:middle line:84%
that negative critical
inner voice within.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:26.240 align:middle line:90%


00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:29.570 align:middle line:84%
So from now on in, when
a negative thought comes

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:33.590 align:middle line:84%
into your mind about
your relationship,

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:36.900 align:middle line:84%
you firstly recognize when
the thought is taking over.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:41.870 align:middle line:90%


00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:44.600 align:middle line:84%
You then intentionally
stop that thought

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:49.950 align:middle line:84%
and replace it with positive,
happy thoughts immediately,

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:54.050 align:middle line:84%
happy times that you've
had with your partner.

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:57.260 align:middle line:84%
It may be kind or sweet things
that you've said or enjoyed

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.970 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:02.580 align:middle line:84%
You fuel your mind
with positive thinking

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:07.410 align:middle line:84%
about your relationship, which
in turn causes you to feel more

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:08.930 align:middle line:90%
positive about your partner.

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:15.440 align:middle line:90%


00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.590 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as you start
thinking those critical negative

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:21.860 align:middle line:84%
thoughts, you immediately
flip them on their head

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:25.730 align:middle line:84%
and replace with
positive thoughts.

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:29.210 align:middle line:84%
By doing this regularly,
you'll be rerouting

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:32.990 align:middle line:84%
those inner negative
thought patterns,

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And your thinking
will slowly start

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:39.200 align:middle line:84%
to become much more positive,
instinctively and naturally.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:44.390 align:middle line:90%


00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:47.700 align:middle line:84%
You know that negative thinking
isn't always based on facts.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:50.460 align:middle line:90%


00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.880 align:middle line:84%
It can be based on
your own insecurities

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:58.250 align:middle line:84%
from your past, a lack
of self-confidence,

00:13:58.250 --> 00:13:59.780 align:middle line:84%
and not always
something that might

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.625 align:middle line:90%
be wrong in your relationship.

00:14:01.625 --> 00:14:04.880 align:middle line:90%


00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:08.950 align:middle line:84%
So you start by building
up your self-confidence

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:12.210 align:middle line:84%
and not assuming the problem
in the relationship is you.

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:15.100 align:middle line:90%


00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:18.010 align:middle line:84%
If your partner doesn't
feel like going out,

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:20.830 align:middle line:84%
you believe and trust that
they simply are just too tired

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:22.767 align:middle line:90%
or have another reason.

00:14:22.767 --> 00:14:25.100 align:middle line:84%
It's not because they don't
want to spend time with you.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:29.100 align:middle line:90%


00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:32.100 align:middle line:84%
You no longer psychoanalyze
every word choice

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.260 align:middle line:84%
your partner makes as
you start to feel more

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:40.950 align:middle line:84%
present in the moment, noticing
other things like their tone,

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:44.270 align:middle line:84%
their physical
presence and posture,

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:47.210 align:middle line:84%
and how positive and welcoming
these other signs are.

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:54.620 align:middle line:90%


00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Instead of obsessing
about hidden meanings

00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:01.910 align:middle line:84%
in things that are being said
between you and your partner,

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:03.995 align:middle line:90%
you now only see the facts.

00:15:03.995 --> 00:15:06.770 align:middle line:90%


00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:09.980 align:middle line:84%
You no longer feel the
need to question every move

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:11.360 align:middle line:90%
or something your partner says.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:15.140 align:middle line:90%


00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:16.360 align:middle line:90%
You trust your partner.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.340 align:middle line:90%


00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:22.880 align:middle line:84%
You start to enjoy the
silences with your partner

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.820 align:middle line:84%
without the need to fill
every second with words.

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:33.300 align:middle line:90%


00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.500 align:middle line:84%
You try and keep the peace
in your relationship,

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:40.280 align:middle line:84%
no longer pointing blame,
confronting your partner

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.450 align:middle line:84%
over problems, which usually
leads to them being defensive.

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:47.140 align:middle line:90%


00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.570 align:middle line:84%
You approach any
tricky situations

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:53.990 align:middle line:84%
in a relaxed and
rational manner,

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:58.160 align:middle line:84%
communicating calmly to get
your point across and resolve

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.455 align:middle line:84%
any issues rather
than causing a fight.

00:16:00.455 --> 00:16:05.810 align:middle line:90%


00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:09.350 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you let go of
any bad past relationship

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:15.080 align:middle line:84%
experiences, realizing that
they belong in the past.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.310 align:middle line:90%
Things are different now.

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:19.670 align:middle line:90%
You are different now.

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Trust in why you're
in this relationship,

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:25.310 align:middle line:84%
knowing that you are
just where you need

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:28.010 align:middle line:90%
to be with who you need to be.

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:31.634 align:middle line:90%


00:16:31.634 --> 00:16:35.850 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to bring any past
baggage into your relationship,

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:40.070 align:middle line:84%
so you lighten the load and let
go of any past experience that

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:41.300 align:middle line:90%
no longer serves you.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:45.710 align:middle line:90%


00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:49.340 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you let go of
any self-doubt or insecurities

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:50.670 align:middle line:90%
that you have about yourself.

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:54.860 align:middle line:90%


00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:57.470 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to
visualize yourself putting

00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:01.010 align:middle line:84%
the words to describe your
past relationship baggage

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:05.470 align:middle line:84%
or self-doubt and
insecurities into a box.

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Pick up each word, and place it
gently in a box in front of you

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:19.819 align:middle line:90%
one by one.

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Take your time now to think
of all those past self

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.034 align:middle line:84%
doubts and insecurities as
you place them into a box.

00:17:27.034 --> 00:17:31.640 align:middle line:90%


00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And once all the words are
in the box, you close the lid

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:35.600 align:middle line:90%
and you lock it.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.990 align:middle line:90%


00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:43.130 align:middle line:84%
From now on in, you leave
those feelings behind.

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:45.080 align:middle line:84%
You're starting
afresh now as you

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.200 align:middle line:84%
realize now is a
great opportunity

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:52.250 align:middle line:84%
to put all of that behind
you and to move on,

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:57.080 align:middle line:84%
to start afresh as you feel
confident about yourself

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.210 align:middle line:90%
and your relationship.

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:03.570 align:middle line:90%


00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:06.150 align:middle line:84%
You know that if your
partner no longer wanted

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:10.980 align:middle line:84%
to be in a relationship,
then they would simply

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:14.570 align:middle line:90%
leave the relationship.

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:17.060 align:middle line:90%
They have chosen to be with you.

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:19.450 align:middle line:90%
They want to be with you.

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And that fills your heart
with love and self-confidence.

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:27.190 align:middle line:84%
You're an amazing
and smart individual,

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:30.393 align:middle line:84%
and you realize that any person
would be lucky to have you

00:18:30.393 --> 00:18:31.193 align:middle line:90%
as their partner.

00:18:31.193 --> 00:18:37.520 align:middle line:90%


00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.770 align:middle line:84%
You no longer assume
that you know everything

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:46.070 align:middle line:84%
that your partner is thinking or
wanting from the relationship.

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And you start asking them
and talking and communicating

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:50.630 align:middle line:90%
with them instead.

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:56.840 align:middle line:84%
No more assuming, knowing
that better communication

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.570 align:middle line:84%
will only strengthen
your relationship

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:02.590 align:middle line:84%
and improve trust and
security more and more.

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:07.510 align:middle line:90%


00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:09.550 align:middle line:84%
Having someone to
be affectionate with

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:14.440 align:middle line:84%
and to share your life with
is nothing short of wonderful.

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:17.950 align:middle line:84%
But before you need
that in a relationship,

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:19.900 align:middle line:84%
you now learn to
love yourself first.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:23.010 align:middle line:90%


00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:26.880 align:middle line:84%
Every day you make sure you
take a moment to appreciate

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.890 align:middle line:84%
all the good things you
know about yourself;

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:33.210 align:middle line:84%
what you like about
yourself, what you respect,

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:36.420 align:middle line:84%
what you've achieved in
life, how other people

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:38.077 align:middle line:90%
appreciate and need you.

00:19:38.077 --> 00:19:41.276 align:middle line:90%


00:19:41.276 --> 00:19:45.200 align:middle line:84%
You put love for yourself
front and center,

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.480 align:middle line:84%
knowing that in
order to love others,

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.100 align:middle line:90%
you need to love yourself first.

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:53.120 align:middle line:90%

you have as a couple,

00:20:15.805 --> 00:20:16.605 align:middle line:90%
through anything.

00:20:16.605 --> 00:20:21.830 align:middle line:90%

to awaken you.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of five, you'll
be wide awake, fully refreshed,

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:42.890 align:middle line:84%
alert, and feeling
fantastic, bringing back

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:45.410 align:middle line:84%
with you all the
wonderful new feelings.

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:52.610 align:middle line:84%
So coming back now with
one, two, three, four, five.

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:55.810 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open when you're ready.
