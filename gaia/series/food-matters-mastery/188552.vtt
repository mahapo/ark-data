00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:08.910 align:middle line:90%


00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>> My position on Western
medicine and the use of cut,

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.530 align:middle line:84%
burn, and poison
therapies, as I call them,

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.230 align:middle line:84%
is such that if it's
going to be lifesaving,

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.410 align:middle line:84%
or if it's going to arrest
symptomatology, then it--

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.840 align:middle line:90%
then it must be used.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.830 align:middle line:84%
But simultaneously,
the consideration

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.590 align:middle line:84%
of changes in terms of diet and
exercise are equally important

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.260 align:middle line:90%
and must be emphasized as well.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.625 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you prescribe a drug,
or surgery, or chemotherapy,

00:00:37.625 --> 00:00:39.000 align:middle line:84%
or radiotherapy,
and I've treated

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.740 align:middle line:90%
a lot of cancer patients.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.780 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you prescribe
a drug, you're actually

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.450 align:middle line:90%
compromised their health.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.220 align:middle line:84%
You're going to actually
obstruct an enzyme.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.170 align:middle line:84%
You're going to actually utilize
more nutrients than the patient

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.850 align:middle line:90%
can afford to spend.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Because most of
the drugs that are

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.020 align:middle line:90%
being used metabolic blockers.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.640 align:middle line:84%
They modify metabolic pathways
by consuming extra nutrients

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.230 align:middle line:84%
and increasing
requirements for nutrients.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's been well-documented
that drugs, including

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.090 align:middle line:84%
antibiotics, interfere
with metabolic processes,

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.620 align:middle line:84%
either in the
liver or in the gut

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.610 align:middle line:84%
or changing gut bacteria
balances and so on.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.620 align:middle line:84%
So it is always the
part of medicine

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.890 align:middle line:84%
that is an art
that's required when

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.170 align:middle line:84%
you decide on the
management of the patient.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.770 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody comes in
and they've got a cancer,

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.730 align:middle line:84%
it's going to obstruct
a major blood vessel

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.130 align:middle line:90%
or penetrate a major organ.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
give them chemotherapy.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.190 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to
operate at the same time.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.550 align:middle line:84%
The first thing I would
do with that patient

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.760 align:middle line:84%
is wait as long as I possibly
can before I give them

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.290 align:middle line:84%
chemotherapy and
operate on them.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'd have a drip up with
some nutrients going in

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.350 align:middle line:84%
at high levels, to actually
improve their ability

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.300 align:middle line:84%
to cope with the
chemotherapy and the surgery

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.730 align:middle line:90%
and or radiotherapy.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Now that model
applies whether it

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.720 align:middle line:84%
be somebody with cancer, or
somebody with heart disease,

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.490 align:middle line:84%
or somebody who's
simply broken a bone

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.470 align:middle line:90%
and going in for surgery.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.240 align:middle line:84%
You've got to look at
all of these things.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.070 align:middle line:84%
If they're low in
zinc, they're going

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.410 align:middle line:84%
to get infections, because
the immune system's going

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.863 align:middle line:90%
to be compromised.

00:02:17.863 --> 00:02:19.530 align:middle line:84%
If they're low in
essential fatty acids,

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.510 align:middle line:84%
they could end up
with depression.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.750 align:middle line:84%
If they're low in
vitamin B12, they

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.720 align:middle line:84%
could end up with anemia
and so on and so forth.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.650 align:middle line:84%
So the most important
thing is to optimize

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.590 align:middle line:84%
the health of that person before
you cut, burn, and poison.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Now that's going
to be, and will be,

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.100 align:middle line:84%
a part of a future
health system.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.130 align:middle line:84%
We just have to make
sure that the politicians

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.200 align:middle line:84%
and the regulators are
aware of what is needed.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And we have to deal with
the obstruction that

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.950 align:middle line:84%
will come from the
various vested interests

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.380 align:middle line:90%
in the professional arena.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.630 align:middle line:84%
But once we do that,
and it will happen,

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.050 align:middle line:84%
we will have a system whereby
people do get a fair deal out

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.850 align:middle line:90%
of health.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.730 align:middle line:84%
At the moment they're getting
the best in medical care

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.793 align:middle line:84%
in this country that can be
provided anywhere in the world,

00:03:08.793 --> 00:03:10.710 align:middle line:84%
but they're not getting
very good health care.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.320 align:middle line:90%


00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.400 align:middle line:84%
There is, in all cancer, a
disturbance in chromosomes.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.200 align:middle line:90%
They've broken up.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.165 align:middle line:84%
And they start
malfunctioning and the genes

00:03:23.165 --> 00:03:24.040 align:middle line:90%
start malfunctioning.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And cells won't die
when they should die.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.770 align:middle line:84%
So there is a misreading
of the genetic material.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:30.675 align:middle line:90%
Cells won't die.

00:03:30.675 --> 00:03:32.050 align:middle line:84%
They won't go
through the process

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.750 align:middle line:90%
of apoptosis, which is suicide.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.650 align:middle line:84%
When they get old, they just
basically replicate, multiply,

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.760 align:middle line:84%
and grow in an uncontrolled
and excessive manner.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.760 align:middle line:90%
That is what cancer is.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.340 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we can
prevent a lot of cancers

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:54.310 align:middle line:84%
with stress management,
with proper diet,

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.450 align:middle line:84%
therefore, feeding the genes
with the right nutrients.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.625 align:middle line:84%
And nutrients that will
repair damaged genes.

00:04:00.625 --> 00:04:03.910 align:middle line:90%


00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.440 align:middle line:84%
We can cause cancers with
viruses, with chemicals,

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.060 align:middle line:90%
with radiation.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.130 align:middle line:84%
But we can repair
the damage done

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.630 align:middle line:84%
by these things
with various enzymes

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:22.122 align:middle line:84%
in the nuclei that repair
the cancer genes or cancer.

00:04:22.122 --> 00:04:24.580 align:middle line:84%
But I don't believe that there's
any such thing as a cancer

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.170 align:middle line:90%
gene.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we were
meant to have cancer genes.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.960 align:middle line:84%
I think it's-- they're
malfunctioning genes, yes.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.780 align:middle line:84%
But there's no such thing
to me as a cancer gene.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.390 align:middle line:90%


00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.960 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the
population of patients

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.260 align:middle line:84%
who come in with cancer
in the early stages

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.840 align:middle line:84%
and look at levels of
nutrients in their system,

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.550 align:middle line:90%
you often find deficiencies.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.730 align:middle line:84%
They may be vitamin,
the antioxidant group,

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.160 align:middle line:84%
the As, Cs, and
Es and the family

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.710 align:middle line:84%
of nutrients related
to vitamin A, C and E,

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.570 align:middle line:90%
or B group vitamins.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.720 align:middle line:84%
But underlying it all, I think
there is an important role

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.980 align:middle line:90%
for trace elements.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Trace elements play a role in
enzymes that repair your genes.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And some of the work
that we have done,

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.800 align:middle line:84%
and still doing, in terms
of skin cancer, we are using

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.600 align:middle line:90%
trace elements.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.470 align:middle line:84%
That are toxic to skin
cancer cells but not toxic

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:18.640 align:middle line:90%
to normal cells.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And these are trace
elements that you and I

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.960 align:middle line:90%
get in our diet every day.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.740 align:middle line:84%
If you can get a particular
trace element into a cancer

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:32.050 align:middle line:84%
cell, the cancer cell
will read it in a way,

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.040 align:middle line:84%
probably through
protein metabolism,

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.830 align:middle line:84%
that will actually switch on
the so-called apoptotic gene.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.440 align:middle line:90%
And the cancer will die.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.860 align:middle line:84%
We're doing some work with
trace elements in skin cancer.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:50.860 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing skin
cancers disappearing

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.410 align:middle line:84%
without eroding the skin,
without burning the skin,

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.180 align:middle line:90%
without damaging the skin.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.240 align:middle line:84%
Basically the cancer
melts away slowly.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And the normal skin
moves in and replaces it.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.440 align:middle line:90%
Now this is very early work.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.350 align:middle line:84%
But basically, it's using an
anti-inflammatory substance

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.730 align:middle line:84%
from nature plus a trace
element, bond it together,

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:16.420 align:middle line:84%
and then taking the trace
element inside the cell

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.160 align:middle line:90%
to correct its metabolism.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm not saying
that that's necessarily

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.550 align:middle line:90%
a cure for all cancers.

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.580 align:middle line:84%
But it's a very, very
interesting observation.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's an observation
that we made in our clinics

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.760 align:middle line:84%
by accident, which is where a
lot of scientific discoveries

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.560 align:middle line:90%
are made.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.380 align:middle line:90%


00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.490 align:middle line:84%
I think we have to
look at the statement,

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:43.090 align:middle line:84%
it's illegal to cure cancer
without using chemotherapy,

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.870 align:middle line:90%
radiotherapy and surgery.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:49.880 align:middle line:84%
But it's not illegal to give
somebody who's got cancer

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.040 align:middle line:90%
a dietary and lifestyle program.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And if that helps
them, then so be it.

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:01.110 align:middle line:84%
Nobody can say that's
illegal and have a go at you.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:05.850 align:middle line:84%
In our clinics, we had
doctors and natural therapists

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:11.640 align:middle line:84%
who treat patients with cancer,
with diet, with meditation,

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.270 align:middle line:90%
with exercise.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:18.060 align:middle line:84%
You have a right to
self-care and self-help.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.090 align:middle line:84%
We need to, again, teach the
regulators, the politicians,

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.220 align:middle line:84%
the doctors, and get
to the universities,

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.670 align:middle line:84%
and the people
training in medicine

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:30.150 align:middle line:84%
to understand that
there are plants

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:31.620 align:middle line:90%
with anti-cancer properties.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.690 align:middle line:84%
There are plants with
anti-nausea and anti-vomiting

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:35.490 align:middle line:90%
properties.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:37.900 align:middle line:84%
There are plants that
will help with [rashes.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:41.190 align:middle line:84%
There are plants that
will help with headaches

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:44.490 align:middle line:84%
and tiredness that occur as
a result of chemotherapy.

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And we've got to make
sure that the public know

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.290 align:middle line:90%
that if you're having a chemo--

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:51.330 align:middle line:84%
chemo drug, that
some of the drugs

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.960 align:middle line:84%
are helped in terms of
reducing their toxicity

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:59.640 align:middle line:84%
with trace elements like zinc
and copper or with herbs.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:05.610 align:middle line:84%
In particular, licorice root
extract can be of assistance.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:10.710 align:middle line:84%
