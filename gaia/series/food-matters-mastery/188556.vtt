00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>> I relate the problem with
our foods in a very similar way

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.630 align:middle line:84%
to relating the problem with
the globe and global warming,

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.600 align:middle line:90%
that it is a serious problem.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.980 align:middle line:90%
There are solutions to it.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.960 align:middle line:84%
But we've got to look
at the right solutions.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.630 align:middle line:84%
But before we do, we've
got to actually define

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.250 align:middle line:90%
what the problem is.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And part of the problem is
modern agricultural systems,

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.920 align:middle line:84%
monoculture, where soils
are used and used and used,

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.710 align:middle line:84%
and nutrients are
drawn out of the soils,

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.600 align:middle line:84%
and the soils
become new deserts.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.670 align:middle line:90%
And that's happening worldwide.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And we do really need to look
at our systems of agriculture

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.690 align:middle line:84%
and what we are really eating
and how we're producing food.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.390 align:middle line:90%


00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.670 align:middle line:84%
Nearly every food that you will
find in the shops in a big city

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.500 align:middle line:90%
has been processed.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.210 align:middle line:90%
It has been delayed to market.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.010 align:middle line:90%
It's been picked ripe.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Quite often, nutrients have
deteriorated or disappeared

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.010 align:middle line:84%
from the food by the time
it gets onto the plate.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And you might
think you're eating

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.340 align:middle line:84%
a well-balanced Australian
or American diet,

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.300 align:middle line:84%
but it's more than likely
unbalanced, often deficient,

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.610 align:middle line:84%
but quite often, also,
there are additives

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.230 align:middle line:84%
that contribute to a range
of diseases-- salt, sugar,

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.000 align:middle line:84%
saturated fats, colorings,
flavorings, preservatives,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.025 align:middle line:84%
things that have an adverse
effect on the immune system,

00:01:33.025 --> 00:01:35.400 align:middle line:84%
the communication system, the
nervous system, the defense

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.690 align:middle line:84%
systems in our body, things
that really, in the long term,

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.780 align:middle line:84%
can cause massive
damage to cells

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.060 align:middle line:84%
and subcellular
structures in the body.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.010 align:middle line:84%
If you look at fertilizers, for
example, synthetic fertilizers,

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.140 align:middle line:84%
you can make a wheat plant grow
with very low levels of protein

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.760 align:middle line:84%
in almost a desert
in this country

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.180 align:middle line:84%
simply by putting synthetic
fertilizers on the ground.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.350 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is slowly
we're producing newer deserts.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.662 align:middle line:84%
To turn that soil into
a functional soil again,

00:02:06.662 --> 00:02:08.620 align:middle line:84%
you've got to put nutrients
back into the soil.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.759 align:middle line:84%
You've got to put worms
back into the soil.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.980 align:middle line:84%
You've got to put probiotics
back into the soil.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.397 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got to start
cultivating it properly again

00:02:14.397 --> 00:02:15.840 align:middle line:90%
and really looking after it.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.550 align:middle line:90%
The same with organics.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.157 align:middle line:84%
If you don't put the nutrients
into the soil and the nutrients

00:02:26.157 --> 00:02:27.990 align:middle line:84%
that go into the soil
are the nutrients that

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.573 align:middle line:84%
come from the compost, from the
breakdown of the previous crop

00:02:30.573 --> 00:02:34.140 align:middle line:84%
or the previous plant that was
there, if that humus doesn't

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.390 align:middle line:84%
get back into the
soil, then the plants

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.240 align:middle line:84%
will not produce all
of the ingredients that

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.810 align:middle line:84%
are required for it to
grow well and produce

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.710 align:middle line:84%
all the necessary phytochemicals
or plant chemicals that

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.810 align:middle line:84%
are going to make us
healthy or the animals that

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.370 align:middle line:90%
eat them healthy.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.430 align:middle line:90%
And I'll give an example.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.610 align:middle line:84%
If you, for example, grow
tomatoes artificially

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.340 align:middle line:84%
and pick them green,
they flavorless

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.960 align:middle line:90%
by the time they turn red.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.250 align:middle line:84%
You leave a tomato on the
bush in organic compost,

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.570 align:middle line:84%
you end up with a tomato that
you can smell at about 3 meters

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.760 align:middle line:84%
away, and it's ripe and red and
contains all of the ingredients

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.000 align:middle line:84%
that are important in protecting
you against prostate cancer,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.010 align:middle line:84%
whereas the green tomato
picked early doesn't.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.430 align:middle line:84%
So it's not only a
matter of the fertilizer,

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.810 align:middle line:84%
but it's also the
time of picking

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.270 align:middle line:90%
and the ripening of the fruit.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And that applies right across
the board to all of the foods

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.220 align:middle line:90%
that we consume.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.720 align:middle line:84%
Most of the foods
that we consume

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.540 align:middle line:84%
are picked before they
ripen, and they're not

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.790 align:middle line:90%
grown organically.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.610 align:middle line:84%
Organic, there is
a big difference

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.420 align:middle line:84%
both in flavor,
taste, life force,

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.470 align:middle line:84%
and the ingredients and
levels of ingredients in them.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.780 align:middle line:90%


00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.320 align:middle line:84%
It surprised me in
my clinical years

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.120 align:middle line:84%
that nobody was interested
in the patients' diets.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.930 align:middle line:84%
When I spoke to my profs, they
weren't interested in diets.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.670 align:middle line:84%
The patients weren't
interested in diets

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.962 align:middle line:90%
and neither were the hospitals.

00:04:01.962 --> 00:04:05.530 align:middle line:84%
So diet didn't come into it,
and whenever I mentioned it,

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.450 align:middle line:84%
nutrition, it was
basically put to the side.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.080 align:middle line:84%
Yet, the patients in the
beds that I was treating

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.870 align:middle line:84%
were obviously malnourished,
underweight quite often,

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.790 align:middle line:84%
sometimes obese, but definitely
showing signs of deficiencies,

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.340 align:middle line:90%
and these were not treated.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Classical case was
a cancer patient.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.420 align:middle line:90%
She'd just been operated on.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.810 align:middle line:84%
She was underweight, and she
was receiving intravenous salt

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.990 align:middle line:84%
and sugar solutions and
no nutrients at all,

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.790 align:middle line:84%
and we were
wondering why she was

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.040 align:middle line:84%
getting wound
infections and chest

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.690 align:middle line:90%
infections and poor immunity.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And you point out the obvious
deficiencies to the students

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.610 align:middle line:84%
and to the teachers, and
it just basically went

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:50.410 align:middle line:90%
over their heads.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.930 align:middle line:90%


00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.910 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of studies
in animal nutrition

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.390 align:middle line:84%
that can be related back to
human health and human illness

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.330 align:middle line:90%
and human disease.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.210 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
classical ones was

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:08.180 align:middle line:84%
one where calves were purposely
fed a selenium-deficient diet

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.140 align:middle line:84%
to produce white muscle disease,
because back in the '60s,

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.670 align:middle line:84%
some of the
restaurants and hotels

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.703 align:middle line:84%
wanted white meat to put
on the tables, white veal,

00:05:17.703 --> 00:05:19.370 align:middle line:84%
and the best way of
producing white veal

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.680 align:middle line:84%
was to produce animals
with white muscle disease.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.180 align:middle line:84%
When these animals
were slaughtered,

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.870 align:middle line:84%
of course, their meat
was white and what

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.570 align:middle line:90%
the restaurants wanted.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.440 align:middle line:84%
The thing that didn't ring
a bell with me at the time

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.800 align:middle line:84%
was that their hearts were
very, very much enlarged,

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.930 align:middle line:84%
and it took me three years
into medicine to realize,

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.220 align:middle line:84%
after studying heart disease
and seeing some patients

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:48.860 align:middle line:84%
with cardiomyopathies, which are
enlarged hearts, that there was

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.900 align:middle line:84%
a relationship between
the selenium deficiency

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.950 align:middle line:84%
that we caused the white
muscle disease in the animal

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.132 align:middle line:84%
and selenium deficiency and
cardiomyopathy in humans.

00:05:57.132 --> 00:05:59.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, there has been some
documentation of that,

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:00.980 align:middle line:90%
but it's very rare.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.140 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it never
happens in this country

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.690 align:middle line:84%
that a cardiologist
or a cardiac surgeon

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.150 align:middle line:84%
would look at a selenium
deficiency in a patient

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.840 align:middle line:90%
with cardiomyopathy.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And usually patients
with cardiomyopathy,

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:17.450 align:middle line:84%
if it's serious enough and
their heart failure regime

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:21.550 align:middle line:84%
fails, that they go on the
list for a cardiac transplant.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And we have actually
prevented a number of patients

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.510 align:middle line:84%
from going on to
transplant simply

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.450 align:middle line:84%
by boosting up their
heart muscle with selenium

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.290 align:middle line:84%
and appropriate
antioxidants, Coenzyme q10.

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.100 align:middle line:84%
So massive savings in
terms of human suffering,

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.890 align:middle line:84%
life, cost of health
care delivery.

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very,
very important lesson

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.930 align:middle line:84%
that we should not be
ignoring the importance

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:46.730 align:middle line:90%
of trace elements.

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.780 align:middle line:90%
