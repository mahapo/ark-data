00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:10.410 align:middle line:90%


00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Culturally, we've been
conditioned to overuse

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.940 align:middle line:90%
our mind.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.290 align:middle line:84%
People are always too
much in their head.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Their mind's running a
million miles an hour.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.370 align:middle line:84%
We see that outwardly as
mental illness or neuroses.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And we're going into the
future is more feeling

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.050 align:middle line:90%
and which is a heart experience.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.950 align:middle line:84%
So we're taking the focus of
our attention out of our brain

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.200 align:middle line:84%
and moving it more
into our heart.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And that seems to get us
more in touch with intuition,

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.250 align:middle line:84%
intuitive understanding,
and also the ability

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.260 align:middle line:90%
to guide ourselves.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.210 align:middle line:84%
We have found in
nutrition that if you're

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.790 align:middle line:84%
too much in your head, and
you're counting calories,

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.870 align:middle line:84%
and you're measuring stuff out
that it becomes overbearing.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.375 align:middle line:90%
It's no longer fun.

00:00:54.375 --> 00:00:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, if you're not--
if what you're doing isn't fun,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.650 align:middle line:84%
you need to stop
doing it immediately.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.410 align:middle line:84%
If you're on some diet
that actually is not fun,

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.582 align:middle line:84%
get on a diet that
is fun because that

00:01:03.582 --> 00:01:04.540 align:middle line:90%
is what it's all about.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.540 align:middle line:84%
If you're not having fun
with what you're doing,

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.220 align:middle line:84%
you might as well
stop immediately.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.350 align:middle line:84%
When we get into our
heart, then we actually

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.360 align:middle line:84%
get a new experience
where we can have

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.640 align:middle line:90%
more fun, more entertainment.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.725 align:middle line:84%
There's no thinking
about anything.

00:01:16.725 --> 00:01:18.100 align:middle line:84%
You can walk into
a store and go,

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.500 align:middle line:84%
I want that, that,
that, and that,

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.083 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want
that, that, and that.

00:01:21.083 --> 00:01:23.270 align:middle line:90%
Because you feel it.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.760 align:middle line:84%
Having said that, it
is true that as we--

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.550 align:middle line:90%
what's the word I'm looking for?

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.450 align:middle line:84%
It is true that as
we detoxify ourselves

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.660 align:middle line:84%
that our intuition
becomes more accurate

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.960 align:middle line:84%
and that if we've been filled
up with a lot of insulation

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.770 align:middle line:84%
that we're not as in
tune with our intuition

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.467 align:middle line:90%
as a general rule.

00:01:46.467 --> 00:01:48.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, some people, it doesn't
matter what they eat,

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.460 align:middle line:84%
their intuition is still
pretty darn good, like my mom.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.640 align:middle line:84%
She always knew like when I was
out late at night or whatever.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.680 align:middle line:84%
Her intuition would
always fire off.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.360 align:middle line:84%
So I can't say for sure that
intuition is 100% related

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.460 align:middle line:84%
to food, but it
definitely affects it.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And if you're detoxified,
and cleansed, and eating

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.160 align:middle line:84%
the right kind of a food, your
feeling states are different,

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.660 align:middle line:90%
and you can feel more.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And the subtle energies
of food and the subtleties

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.560 align:middle line:84%
of food choices
is more apparent.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.740 align:middle line:84%
The lifestyle, and diet,
and nutrition program

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:27.800 align:middle line:84%
that I advocate is a raw,
organic, plant-based type

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.850 align:middle line:90%
of a diet.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And the work that I've done
with Dr. Gabriel Cousens

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.530 align:middle line:84%
has led us to the conclusion
that, really, it's about 80%

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.380 align:middle line:84%
raw, organic, plant-based
foods in your diet

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.540 align:middle line:84%
is what you need to eat
in order to really get

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.660 align:middle line:84%
the benefits of
those great foods.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And in that other
20% is like leeway.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.300 align:middle line:84%
It gives you a chance to
accommodate the raw foods in

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.090 align:middle line:84%
and still maintain some of
your old diet habits and foods

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.080 align:middle line:90%
that you really like.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.900 align:middle line:84%
It also allows you to
accommodate different theories,

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.520 align:middle line:90%
Chinese medicine theories.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And whatever that looks like
for each individual, whatever

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.900 align:middle line:84%
they need to accommodate, we
accommodate that in that 20%.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And that creates a
nice, balanced approach.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.320 align:middle line:90%
It's not overbearing.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And then you don't
progress to 80%

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.950 align:middle line:84%
instantaneously
unless you're ready.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.580 align:middle line:84%
You kind of gradually go
there, and it becomes more

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.060 align:middle line:90%
of a direction, not a diet.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.620 align:middle line:84%
The way that we can add
these things in most

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.550 align:middle line:84%
effectively is to be aware
of what is being added in.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.360 align:middle line:90%
And this is what we recommend--

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:40.680 align:middle line:84%
add in fruits, vegetables,
nuts, seeds, seaweed, sprouts,

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.510 align:middle line:84%
wheatgrass, herbs,
and superfoods.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Those are what's
on the table now.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.130 align:middle line:84%
These are what we
get to choose from,

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.320 align:middle line:84%
and that's our-- part
of our new selection.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.030 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we
recommend everything

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.210 align:middle line:84%
be the highest quality possible,
as organic as possible,

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:58.830 align:middle line:90%
as raw as possible.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And then we go into a store,
and we have that little list.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.800 align:middle line:84%
OK, I've got to get a fruit,
a vegetable, a nut, a seed,

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.870 align:middle line:84%
a seaweed, a sprout, wheatgrass,
herbs, and superfoods?

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.300 align:middle line:84%
Pretty soon, that's
a lot of stuff.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.540 align:middle line:90%
You start eating that.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And there's only so much
we can eat in a day,

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.839 align:middle line:84%
and that gradually just starts
crowding out everything else.

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And then the feeling
that you get from it

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.090 align:middle line:90%
is something that doesn't lie.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.950 align:middle line:84%
You feel good, and you want
to have what feels good.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:27.990 align:middle line:90%
That's human nature.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And this way, we can
guide ourselves out

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.700 align:middle line:84%
of the dietary trap
of "This is good.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.750 align:middle line:84%
That's bad" with ease,
without pain and suffering.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.690 align:middle line:84%
The idea that you
can tell someone "no"

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.090 align:middle line:84%
and that they're going
to listen to that

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.460 align:middle line:84%
is something that we need
to let go of forever.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.220 align:middle line:84%
You tell a child, no,
don't go into that cabinet,

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.803 align:middle line:84%
they are going to
be into that cabinet

00:04:48.803 --> 00:04:50.053 align:middle line:90%
as soon as you're not looking.

00:04:50.053 --> 00:04:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Or, no, don't eat this food,
and then they see you eating it.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.052 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
be eating it too.

00:04:55.052 --> 00:04:56.760 align:middle line:84%
We've got to get out
of that whole thing.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.610 align:middle line:84%
We've got to get more into
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:00.615 align:middle line:90%
adding, adding, adding.

00:05:00.615 --> 00:05:01.740 align:middle line:90%
Here, you get to have this.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:02.370 align:middle line:90%
You get to try this.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.910 align:middle line:90%
You get to have this.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:03.750 align:middle line:90%
You get to try this.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, it just
becomes easier for people

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.300 align:middle line:84%
to transform their diet
because they want to.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.000 align:middle line:84%
They're eating food that tastes
better than the other food.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And why would you
consciously choose

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.560 align:middle line:90%
to eat something that's worse?

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.360 align:middle line:90%
You wouldn't.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.020 align:middle line:84%
You're guided towards
pleasure and away from pain

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.120 align:middle line:90%
by human nature.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.210 align:middle line:84%
We need to avail ourselves of
what the current technology is.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:31.480 align:middle line:84%
For example, in all the history
of nutrition and medicine,

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.110 align:middle line:84%
clay has been used
as a detoxifier.

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.320 align:middle line:84%
All vegetarian mammals
use clay to detoxify.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.820 align:middle line:90%
They actually eat clay.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:40.960 align:middle line:90%
Birds eat clay.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.980 align:middle line:90%
Reptiles eat clay.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.340 align:middle line:84%
The only mammals that really
you never heard of eating clay

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.480 align:middle line:90%
are humans.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why is because
we weren't educated about it.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.760 align:middle line:84%
We lost our
indigenous connections

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.050 align:middle line:90%
to natural medicines.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And we're now understanding
the power of clay

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.010 align:middle line:90%
as an adsorptive substance.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:01.600 align:middle line:84%
When you put clay in your body,
it pulls toxins out of you.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.320 align:middle line:84%
Animals use it to remove
cellular metabolic waste that

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.920 align:middle line:84%
accumulates over
a period of time.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.295 align:middle line:84%
So it can cleanse
you even if you

00:06:08.295 --> 00:06:13.390 align:middle line:84%
have no toxicity from chemicals,
human-made, artificial stuff.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.080 align:middle line:84%
Just cellular metal--
metabolic wastes,

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.370 align:middle line:84%
clay helps to pull
that stuff out.

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.732 align:middle line:84%
Clay is difficult to
talk to people about.

00:06:20.732 --> 00:06:21.940 align:middle line:90%
And what are you going to do?

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.800 align:middle line:84%
You're going to serve
people a clay shake?

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.750 align:middle line:84%
Or you're going to take a
ball of clay [AUDIO OUT] hey,

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:26.680 align:middle line:90%
eat this?

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.380 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to make it simpler
for people, and that's my role.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.110 align:middle line:84%
So I not only want to make
it simpler for people,

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:37.970 align:middle line:84%
but I also want to make it
easier and more effective.

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And so what we've learned over
the last 150 years of research

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.410 align:middle line:84%
on clay is that there
are gradations of clay.

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.330 align:middle line:84%
For example, clay and fulvic
acid is more powerful than clay

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:48.130 align:middle line:90%
alone.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Fulvic acid and humic acid
is more powerful than clay

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:51.875 align:middle line:90%
and fulvic acid.

00:06:51.875 --> 00:06:53.500 align:middle line:84%
We've eventually
worked our way to what

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.010 align:middle line:84%
we call "super clays"
that are easy to consume,

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:58.570 align:middle line:90%
and those are zeolites.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And zeolites are extremely
capable of drawing out

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.860 align:middle line:84%
not only metabolic
waste but also

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.490 align:middle line:84%
the toxicity of our times,
which can include things

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.460 align:middle line:90%
as extreme as uranium-238.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.150 align:middle line:84%
It can be things as
common as mercury, which

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.190 align:middle line:84%
is put in everyone's
mouth and is still

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.530 align:middle line:90%
the most toxic metal known.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.115 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that, what
about all the pesticides?

00:07:23.115 --> 00:07:25.240 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything that help
get the pesticides out?

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Zeolites can help
get pesticides out

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.260 align:middle line:84%
and can do a better
job than clay can.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.230 align:middle line:84%
So we've moved towards
zeolite, and then we've

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:35.630 align:middle line:84%
moved to the liquid zeolites
to make it as easy as possible

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:36.430 align:middle line:90%
for people.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:37.660 align:middle line:84%
They just-- when they're
drinking their water

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.343 align:middle line:84%
in the morning, they pull out
a dropper full of zeolites,

00:07:40.343 --> 00:07:41.260 align:middle line:90%
put it in their water.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.670 align:middle line:90%
It's almost tasteless liquid.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:43.878 align:middle line:90%
You drink it with your water.

00:07:43.878 --> 00:07:45.520 align:middle line:84%
You never even have
to think about it.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:46.990 align:middle line:90%
That is awesome.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:48.370 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that, to me, is like--

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:50.530 align:middle line:90%
that's technology.

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:52.210 align:middle line:84%
We've taken something
that's difficult.

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.070 align:middle line:84%
We've made it easy
for everyone to do,

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:57.670 align:middle line:84%
and then they can
reap the benefits.

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Raw food nutrition, super herbal
nutrition, superfood nutrition,

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:08.260 align:middle line:84%
and chocolate nutrition holds
a tremendous promise in the way

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.960 align:middle line:84%
that it can affect
our consciousness.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And I've personally noticed that
it's a very powerful catalyst

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:20.050 align:middle line:84%
to get us into
abundance consciousness

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:24.340 align:middle line:84%
and to get us out of
scarcity consciousness.

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:28.370 align:middle line:84%
Because we live in a world where
we're being sold limited goods.

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:29.170 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:30.370 align:middle line:90%
We're going to run out of oil.

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:32.495 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, they can just
keep jacking the price up.

00:08:32.495 --> 00:08:36.140 align:middle line:84%
They're selling us really
subconsciously on scarcity

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.200 align:middle line:84%
and that scarcity is
the law of the universe.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.600 align:middle line:90%
And that's entirely untrue.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.400 align:middle line:90%
And raw food teaches you that.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.020 align:middle line:84%
You could put me in any
location in the world,

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.080 align:middle line:84%
even in the tundra, and I
could survive on wild food.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.230 align:middle line:84%
So there is no situation
I could find myself

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:51.820 align:middle line:90%
in where I would starve.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:54.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, that is really
powerful information

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:58.050 align:middle line:84%
because what it indicates
is that everything's always

00:08:58.050 --> 00:08:58.850 align:middle line:90%
available.

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:01.810 align:middle line:84%
The Native Americans had a
saying that within 5 miles

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:04.127 align:middle line:84%
of where you live,
maybe that's--

00:09:04.127 --> 00:09:04.960 align:middle line:90%
how many kilometers?

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.040 align:middle line:84%
12 kilometers of
where you live--

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:07.840 align:middle line:90%
no, it's less.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.540 align:middle line:84%
It's 8 kilometers--
is everything

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.040 align:middle line:90%
that you need to survive.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.740 align:middle line:84%
All the food is there, all
the herbs, the superfoods.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:16.180 align:middle line:90%
Everything is there.

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you want to
just resay that?

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:17.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:18.857 align:middle line:90%
>> That's great, yeah.

00:09:18.857 --> 00:09:20.020 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:21.850 align:middle line:84%
The Native Americans
have a saying

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.520 align:middle line:84%
that within 5 miles
of where you live

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:28.930 align:middle line:84%
or about 8 kilometers from
where you live is everything

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:29.860 align:middle line:90%
that you need.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:34.040 align:middle line:84%
All the foods are available,
the superfoods, the herbs,

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:34.840 align:middle line:90%
the water.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.370 align:middle line:90%
It's all there.

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:39.760 align:middle line:84%
It's just an awareness
that it's there.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.650 align:middle line:90%
My thing is about awareness.

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:45.943 align:middle line:84%
If you are aware that you can
actually eat grass to survive,

00:09:45.943 --> 00:09:47.860 align:middle line:84%
wow, you're in a lot
better shape than someone

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.540 align:middle line:90%
who's not aware of that.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:53.170 align:middle line:84%
If you are aware that you
can have a polluted stream

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:55.630 align:middle line:84%
and dig a hole 10 feet
away from the stream,

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:59.437 align:middle line:84%
and let the water filter through
all those rocks and minerals

00:09:59.437 --> 00:10:02.020 align:middle line:84%
and fill up a little hole over
here, and then drink that water

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.850 align:middle line:84%
and that will actually
be clean water,

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:05.920 align:middle line:84%
well, you've really got
some power there even

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.670 align:middle line:84%
in a polluted
environment to survive.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:14.770 align:middle line:84%
The abundance consciousness that
raw food catalyzes within us

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:18.810 align:middle line:84%
is a consciousness that
is solution-oriented,

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:22.270 align:middle line:84%
that in every situation
where there is no choice,

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:25.240 align:middle line:84%
there is a choice, where every
situation where there's no way,

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.000 align:middle line:84%
there is a way,
that no matter what

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.230 align:middle line:84%
is in front of us, a solution
is always presenting itself.

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:35.980 align:middle line:84%
It brings us to a complete
understanding that there cannot

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:37.750 align:middle line:90%
be a problem without a solution.

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:39.520 align:middle line:84%
One can't exist
without the other.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:43.250 align:middle line:84%
When we had the advent
of nuclear power,

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:46.300 align:middle line:84%
we also had the discovery
that zeolites can detoxify us

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:48.211 align:middle line:90%
of nuclear waste.

00:10:48.211 --> 00:10:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, zeolites
were sprayed--

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:53.980 align:middle line:84%
that foam that was sprayed on
Chernobyl, that's zeolites.

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:59.430 align:middle line:84%
They sprayed it on Chernobyl
to kill all the radiation.

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:01.740 align:middle line:84%
No matter how much pollution
we have in our world,

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.720 align:middle line:84%
all the solutions are
here to clean it up out

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.490 align:middle line:90%
of us and off the whole planet.

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:09.450 align:middle line:84%
I am a fervent believer
that we can clean up

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:12.540 align:middle line:84%
every bit of toxicity we've
left on the entire planet,

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.510 align:middle line:84%
every problem, everything
in the atmosphere

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:19.560 align:middle line:84%
in less than two
weeks if we apply

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.020 align:middle line:90%
the technology that works.

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.880 align:middle line:84%
For example, a
friend of mine runs

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.590 align:middle line:90%
an operation called Planktose.

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And Planktose has figured
out that the biggest

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:31.050 align:middle line:84%
lever to pull carbon
out of the atmosphere

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:32.940 align:middle line:90%
is to grow more plankton.

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:35.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, they've then gone
to study as to what

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.720 align:middle line:90%
helps grow more plankton.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.540 align:middle line:84%
They found out that iron
filings, if you grind them down

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:42.300 align:middle line:84%
to fine dust and then dump it
out in the middle of the ocean,

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.570 align:middle line:84%
plankton eat that for lunch,
and they grow like crazy.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, if every family
decided that they

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:52.650 align:middle line:84%
were going to help contribute
and pull the carbon footprint

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:55.092 align:middle line:84%
off of their car, and
their house, and the things

00:11:55.092 --> 00:11:56.550 align:middle line:84%
that they're doing
that's affecting

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:59.340 align:middle line:84%
the environment by putting
a little bit of money

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:03.720 align:middle line:84%
into having a little tray of
iron dust dumped into the ocean

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.690 align:middle line:84%
by a tanker ship that goes
out there in the ocean,

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:08.340 align:middle line:84%
we could reverse
all the problems

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:14.280 align:middle line:84%
in the world with our atmosphere
with a half of a tanker-load

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.290 align:middle line:90%
of iron dust filings.

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:19.200 align:middle line:84%
To give you an idea of how
insignificant that number is,

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:24.270 align:middle line:84%
there are 40,000 tankers on
the world's oceans today.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:27.878 align:middle line:84%
One tanker with a half a load
of iron dust filings just out

00:12:27.878 --> 00:12:30.420 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the ocean just
dumping out iron dust filings

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:34.050 align:middle line:84%
and growing plankton that will
then suck in all the carbon

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:36.090 align:middle line:84%
gases out of the
atmosphere will completely

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:38.250 align:middle line:84%
reverse all the
environmental damage

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:39.820 align:middle line:90%
we've done to our atmosphere.

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.720 align:middle line:84%
That's just one example,
and I could list dozens.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.860 align:middle line:90%
So the solutions are here.

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:46.530 align:middle line:90%
They've always been here.

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:48.607 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that's left
is just the education.

00:12:48.607 --> 00:12:50.190 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm convinced
that once people

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:52.710 align:middle line:84%
know what the solution
is, they'll act on it.

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:56.370 align:middle line:84%
They will decide,
yep, we're doing it.

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:59.890 align:middle line:84%
When we choose raw,
organic, plant-based foods,

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:02.580 align:middle line:84%
we take our power
back, and we decide

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.770 align:middle line:84%
that we are going
to have quality

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:09.187 align:middle line:84%
and that we are not going
to suffer from some 50

00:13:09.187 --> 00:13:11.520 align:middle line:84%
ingredients that are in there
of chemicals we never even

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.000 align:middle line:90%
heard of before.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.670 align:middle line:84%
We're going to completely
erase that, and get that

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:22.680 align:middle line:84%
off the table, and get onto one
ingredient-- raw, organic goji

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:23.680 align:middle line:90%
berries.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.480 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.390 align:middle line:84%
How about one ingredient--
raw, organic cocoa

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:31.590 align:middle line:84%
beans, or raw,
organic spirulina,

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:34.530 align:middle line:90%
or raw, organic celery.

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:35.820 align:middle line:90%
That's taking our power back.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.310 align:middle line:84%
That's saying, yeah, we've
had enough of the chemicals.

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:40.290 align:middle line:90%
Better living through chemistry?

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:41.492 align:middle line:90%
No, we don't think so.

00:13:41.492 --> 00:13:43.950 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go better living
through the best food ever.

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:46.200 align:middle line:90%
