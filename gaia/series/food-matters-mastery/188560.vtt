00:00:03.332 --> 00:00:10.010 align:middle line:90%


00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.770 align:middle line:84%
>> The big problem is, and
you're looking at somebody who

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.750 align:middle line:84%
was very overweight
when he was young.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.930 align:middle line:84%
So I know all about a troubled
interaction with nourishment

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.173 align:middle line:90%
as my psychologist used to say.

00:00:20.173 --> 00:00:21.590 align:middle line:84%
The point is,
though, that we live

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.440 align:middle line:84%
in a very affluent
society, and there

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.615 align:middle line:90%
are lots of comfort foods.

00:00:24.615 --> 00:00:26.240 align:middle line:84%
And we are bitten by
the taste monster.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.460 align:middle line:84%
So lots of people are
eating lots of sugary foods.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.230 align:middle line:90%
This is hardly news.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.470 align:middle line:84%
What is news to some people is
that a lot of the foods that we

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.390 align:middle line:84%
eat break down into sugar, even
though we think they don't.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Bread breaks down into
glucose in the body.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.530 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't necessarily
make bread evil.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.540 align:middle line:84%
White bread is a
problem, because it's

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.450 align:middle line:84%
made from sugar, water,
flour and bleach.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.270 align:middle line:84%
But when we look at grain
products in general,

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.410 align:middle line:90%
they're high energy foods.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.147 align:middle line:90%
Nothing wrong with that.

00:00:53.147 --> 00:00:54.980 align:middle line:84%
For instance, if you
look at a baked potato,

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.397 align:middle line:84%
that's one of the highest items
on the glycemic index that

00:00:57.397 --> 00:00:59.000 align:middle line:84%
breaks down into
glucose, pure energy.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.020 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.150 align:middle line:84%
Carrot juice tastes
so great, because it's

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.458 align:middle line:90%
full of glucose, sugar.

00:01:04.458 --> 00:01:06.750 align:middle line:84%
So there are a number of
these foods, pasta, of course,

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.460 align:middle line:90%
we know about.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.600 align:middle line:84%
Number of these
foods that people

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.225 align:middle line:84%
are eating that
they're not immediately

00:01:10.225 --> 00:01:13.243 align:middle line:84%
linking with the fact that
this is going to make them big.

00:01:13.243 --> 00:01:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And on their own, these
foods wouldn't be a problem.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.790 align:middle line:84%
People say to me,
well, what about honey?

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.373 align:middle line:84%
People have eaten
honey for centuries.

00:01:18.373 --> 00:01:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Surely honey can't
contribute towards diabetes.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.540 align:middle line:84%
On its own, honey was the
only sweet thing the Saxons

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.080 align:middle line:84%
and the medieval
people used to eat.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.000 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing else around.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.560 align:middle line:84%
There weren't Mars
bars or anything.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.630 align:middle line:84%
But here we see now when
we look at the diets today,

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.050 align:middle line:84%
honey just now becomes
another part of the problem.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.930 align:middle line:90%
When you look at--

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.470 align:middle line:84%
and in fact, any of you that
are watching this program, just

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.090 align:middle line:84%
think about the
amount of foods you've

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.965 align:middle line:84%
eaten over the last week
that are broken down

00:01:39.965 --> 00:01:43.320 align:middle line:84%
into sugar and all of the
energy going into the body.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And now the next
question is fine,

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.083 align:middle line:90%
you've taken all this energy in.

00:01:46.083 --> 00:01:47.690 align:middle line:84%
Now how many marathons
a week are you

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.070 align:middle line:90%
running to burn it all off?

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.510 align:middle line:90%
Two?

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.940 align:middle line:90%
Three?

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.455 align:middle line:90%
None?

00:01:53.455 --> 00:01:55.080 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is,
of course, the body

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.320 align:middle line:84%
is producing all this insulin
to metabolize the sugar.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And of course, all
of this insulin

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.890 align:middle line:84%
is causing a problem
for the cells.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.712 align:middle line:84%
The cells become
resistant to the insulin,

00:02:04.712 --> 00:02:07.170 align:middle line:84%
and then we move into this very
common condition now called

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.103 align:middle line:90%
type 2 diabetes.

00:02:08.103 --> 00:02:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Let's not forget, there
are millions of people

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.960 align:middle line:84%
out there in the threshold
of going into type 2 syndrome

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.780 align:middle line:84%
x, what we call insulin
resistance, dry mouth, peeing

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.190 align:middle line:90%
a little and often.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.900 align:middle line:84%
These types of, you
know, tunnel vision,

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.230 align:middle line:84%
blurry vision, this
type of thing happening.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.600 align:middle line:84%
Having the desire
to get in your car

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.640 align:middle line:84%
and drive down to a
24 hour petrol station

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.810 align:middle line:84%
to buy a fruit and nut
bar the size of Tasmania

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.460 align:middle line:90%
because you've got a sugar fix.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.980 align:middle line:84%
So on top of diabetes, we
now get loads of problems

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.670 align:middle line:84%
with yeast, fungi,
candida breaking out.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.390 align:middle line:84%
So the answer is with diabetes
is, again, diet and lifestyle.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the sheer idiocy
of just giving type

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.160 align:middle line:84%
2 diabetics more
insulin, more of what

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.425 align:middle line:84%
they're resistant to
to start with is dumb.

00:02:51.425 --> 00:02:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And what we should
be doing again

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.870 align:middle line:84%
is, and they are
starting to do this,

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.580 align:middle line:84%
is to concentrate
on diet, put them

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.220 align:middle line:84%
on these anti-candida diets
to strip the glucose out

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.150 align:middle line:90%
of the diet.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.200 align:middle line:90%
Exercise is very important.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.380 align:middle line:84%
Remember, type 2 diabetes
is when the cells

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.730 align:middle line:90%
are resistant to insulin.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.230 align:middle line:84%
So now what we've
got to do is we've

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.020 align:middle line:84%
got to be able to free
up the insulin pathway.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And the way we do that
is we exercise that body

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.070 align:middle line:90%
so the cells burn the energy.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, they
require more sugar,

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.300 align:middle line:84%
so that frees up
that whole problem.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.970 align:middle line:84%
And in early type 2 diabetes,
diet supplementation,

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.970 align:middle line:84%
we use chromium, vanadium,
number of supplements

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:24.810 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And also the
straightforward dietary

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.610 align:middle line:84%
changes that we
discuss in the books.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.260 align:middle line:84%
This should be part of
every household's education.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.250 align:middle line:84%
But you see, diabetes
is still the preserve

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.493 align:middle line:90%
of the medical doctor.

00:03:36.493 --> 00:03:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're not
doing is we're not

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.170 align:middle line:84%
educating the
public enough to be

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.400 align:middle line:90%
able to avoid these problems.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Believe it or not,
they're willing to listen

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.403 align:middle line:90%
once they start suffering.

00:03:44.403 --> 00:03:46.362 align:middle line:84%
But the big problem is
we've got lots of people

00:03:46.362 --> 00:03:49.110 align:middle line:84%
out there living the life of
Riley, having a great life,

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.950 align:middle line:90%
and that's good.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.570 align:middle line:84%
But they're doing
wrong by themselves.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And so nature's going to
sharpen her sword for them.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.320 align:middle line:84%
If I was diagnosed
with diabetes type 2,

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.457 align:middle line:84%
the very first thing
that I would think about

00:04:01.457 --> 00:04:03.540 align:middle line:84%
would I'd first of all go
back and read my chapter

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.096 align:middle line:84%
on diabetes, which discusses--
and this is what they found.

00:04:08.096 --> 00:04:11.910 align:middle line:84%
That we strip the
refined high glycemic

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.280 align:middle line:84%
carbohydrates out of
the diet first thing.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.570 align:middle line:84%
Because what's happening is
that if you have diabetes,

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.237 align:middle line:84%
you have a condition
where the cells are

00:04:18.237 --> 00:04:19.350 align:middle line:90%
resistant to the insulin.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.907 align:middle line:84%
So simply by giving the
body more sugar to process

00:04:21.907 --> 00:04:23.490 align:middle line:84%
is just going to
compound the problem,

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.280 align:middle line:84%
requiring more insulin
to be put into the body.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.950 align:middle line:84%
So the studies that we've looked
at are pretty unequivocal.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.560 align:middle line:84%
First thing to do if
you have type 2 diabetes

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.620 align:middle line:84%
is to change your
diet, to remove

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.750 align:middle line:84%
a lot of these high
sugar foods, and to start

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.830 align:middle line:84%
to put the emphasis on a lot
of the raw natural whole foods,

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.420 align:middle line:90%
lots of greens.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Greens are great because
they contain chlorophyll,

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.460 align:middle line:84%
which increases the amount of
oxygen uptake in the blood.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.220 align:middle line:84%
Converts the hemoglobin, which
is very useful for the body.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.200 align:middle line:84%
The next thing I'd
do is exercise.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.172 align:middle line:90%
And I'd start off by--

00:04:54.172 --> 00:04:56.130 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people think
that walking is exercise.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.040 align:middle line:84%
Walking is not exercise from the
cardiovascular point of view,

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.500 align:middle line:84%
because it's not putting
the cardiovascular system

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.240 align:middle line:84%
under any kind of
significant strain.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.770 align:middle line:84%
What we need to do is get
slightly out of breath.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.300 align:middle line:90%
So I'd be doing stair climbing.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.050 align:middle line:84%
I'd be using those horrendous
machines in the gym.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.270 align:middle line:84%
They never go anywhere,
have you noticed that?

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And just exercising,
getting out of breath.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.220 align:middle line:84%
When I lived in Santa
Monica, California,

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.910 align:middle line:84%
they had these stairways,
200 steps going up

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.210 align:middle line:90%
the side of the hill.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And often when I'd go down
there and run up them myself,

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.510 align:middle line:84%
there was diabetics there who
were exercising specifically

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.130 align:middle line:90%
for their condition.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And lastly, the supplementation,
minerals, antioxidants,

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.655 align:middle line:84%
and things like vanadium and
chromium supplements, chromium

00:05:34.655 --> 00:05:37.260 align:middle line:84%
picolinate have
been shown to help

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.030 align:middle line:90%
cells recognize the insulin.

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And generally in the
early stages of type 2,

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.940 align:middle line:84%
there is every chance that
people can come out of it.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.080 align:middle line:84%
As the disease
progresses, in fact

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.950 align:middle line:84%
the more the disease progresses,
the uglier your options become.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.060 align:middle line:84%
So it's very important to get
into diabetes nice and early

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.560 align:middle line:90%
and to not fool around.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Just get the diet
sorted out, exercise,

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.740 align:middle line:84%
and get the whole mindset
completely changed.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.480 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back to basics.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.530 align:middle line:90%
You are what you eat.

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.660 align:middle line:90%
Who really believes that?

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:07.860 align:middle line:90%
Who believes that?

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.630 align:middle line:90%
Angel mood.

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.340 align:middle line:90%
Valentine's Day depends on it.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you
have a look at us

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.180 align:middle line:84%
and we see people just
eating a lot of sugary foods

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.910 align:middle line:84%
and then they're climbing the
walls and getting violent,

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they did studies
in the prison, in fact,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Steven Shontar I think was
the researcher in America.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.400 align:middle line:84%
Went into American prisons,
rounded up a test group,

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.730 align:middle line:84%
I believe somewhere in
the couple of thousands,

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.220 align:middle line:84%
3,000 maybe, and
changed their diets out.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And changed their diets out,
gave them some supplementation,

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.848 align:middle line:90%
changed their diets out.

00:06:34.848 --> 00:06:36.390 align:middle line:84%
In other words, what
he wanted to see

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.295 align:middle line:84%
was, and these were the
criminals beating up

00:06:38.295 --> 00:06:40.170 align:middle line:84%
other criminals, these
were the violent ones.

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.003 align:middle line:84%
What he wanted to find
out was whether there

00:06:42.003 --> 00:06:46.230 align:middle line:84%
was a correlation between
diet and violent behavior.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.000 align:middle line:90%
And this is the case.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.650 align:middle line:84%
How many people
believe that if they're

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.620 align:middle line:84%
watching bad news on
the TV all day long,

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.340 align:middle line:84%
they're not going
to get depressed?

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.250 align:middle line:84%
That what we focus on
becomes our reality?

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:00.047 align:middle line:84%
If you're watching these
news programs all day long,

00:07:00.047 --> 00:07:02.130 align:middle line:84%
then is that going to
affect your mental attitude?

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.602 align:middle line:90%
Of course it's going to do that.

00:07:03.602 --> 00:07:06.060 align:middle line:84%
I tried to get everybody to go
through tomorrow's newspaper

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.850 align:middle line:84%
with a red pen, put a big red
X next to every single article

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:10.222 align:middle line:90%
that is bad news.

00:07:10.222 --> 00:07:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And when you're done
that, do all the programs,

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.060 align:middle line:84%
Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Murder
She Wrote, Midsummer's Murder,

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.220 align:middle line:84%
Murder With Frost,
Murder in Suburbia,

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.993 align:middle line:84%
Dead Like Us, Cult
of the Coffin.

00:07:19.993 --> 00:07:21.910 align:middle line:84%
You're looking at these
programs all the time.

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.160 align:middle line:84%
Now go back through the same
newspaper with a blue pen

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.790 align:middle line:84%
and put a big blue X next
to every single article that

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:29.677 align:middle line:84%
is absolutely none
of your business.

00:07:29.677 --> 00:07:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And what you realize
is you're looking

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.630 align:middle line:84%
at a whole bunch of bad news
every day, none of which

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.153 align:middle line:84%
has anything to do
with you at all.

00:07:35.153 --> 00:07:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of
it is the weather,

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.370 align:middle line:84%
and you know how
they lie about that.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.500 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people will
blame obesity on genes.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:47.220 align:middle line:84%
In other words, Granddad was
fat, Dad was fat, Mom was fat,

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm fat, my brother's
fat, my sister's fat.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.030 align:middle line:90%
Therefore, we're a fat family.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.488 align:middle line:84%
The answer is well, there's
another way of looking at that.

00:07:53.488 --> 00:07:55.550 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're all
eating the same stuff.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:58.660 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're all sitting in
armchairs and not exercising.

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.520 align:middle line:90%
They thought this about scurvy.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.190 align:middle line:84%
Jim went to sea, he
got scurvy and died.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.000 align:middle line:84%
His son, Bob, went to
sea, got scurvy, and died.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.083 align:middle line:84%
His son, Frank, went to
sea, got scurvy, and died.

00:08:06.083 --> 00:08:07.810 align:middle line:90%
Oh, scurvy is genetic.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:09.190 align:middle line:90%
No, it just looks that way.

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.200 align:middle line:90%
