00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.050 align:middle line:84%
>> The big drawback and the
reason for all the attacks we

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:19.170 align:middle line:84%
get on the Gerson therapy is
that the pharmaceutical medical

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.500 align:middle line:90%
trust is huge, huge.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.420 align:middle line:84%
Most important
industry, it's one

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.630 align:middle line:84%
of the most powerful industries
in the country, in America.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.000 align:middle line:84%
They make a lot of
money on cancer,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.220 align:middle line:84%
according to Ralph Moss, PhD,
who was an insider for awhile

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.380 align:middle line:84%
at Sloan Kettering, one
of the biggest cancer

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.110 align:middle line:90%
hospitals in the US.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.900 align:middle line:90%
He studied this.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.420 align:middle line:84%
After he left Sloan
Kettering, he studied it.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote a book,
which came out in 1996.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.710 align:middle line:84%
That he called-- in other
words, 11 years ago--

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.030 align:middle line:84%
that he called The
Cancer Industry,

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.240 align:middle line:90%
The Politics of Cancer subtitle.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And the problem with
cancer and the amount

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.260 align:middle line:84%
that is earned with
cancer is a huge industry.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And he found that,
at that time, cancer

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.780 align:middle line:84%
amounted to approximately
an annual income

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:29.210 align:middle line:84%
of hundred billion US
dollars in the US alone.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.150 align:middle line:90%
It has gone up in the meantime.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And they keep coming out with
more and more expensive drugs.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And they have-- OK,
there's another thing, too.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.980 align:middle line:84%
In 1972, our then
President Nixon

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.830 align:middle line:84%
stated that, if we throw enough
money at this cancer problem,

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:48.630 align:middle line:90%
we'll solve it.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.670 align:middle line:84%
We were able to put
a man on the moon.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And we ought to be able
to solve the problem.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And in 1972, he agreed to make
a great deal of money available.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.639 align:middle line:84%
That year, 220,000
Americans died of cancer.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:14.730 align:middle line:84%
Exactly 25 years later, USA
Today, the big newspaper,

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.720 align:middle line:84%
I think it was also in
Newsweek, published the figures

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.750 align:middle line:90%
what actually did happen.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.080 align:middle line:84%
What happened was
the US government,

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:34.020 align:middle line:84%
us taxpayers, put out over 39
billion US dollars for research

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.790 align:middle line:90%
on cancer.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:45.900 align:middle line:84%
The result was, 25 years
later in 1996, 560,000 people

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.560 align:middle line:90%
died of cancer more than double.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And more were getting
sick with cancer.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And of course, more
money was spent.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And more chemotherapy
drugs came on the market.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And chances are that nowadays
from $100 billion in 1996,

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:15.930 align:middle line:84%
the cancer industry is worth
more than $140 to $150 billion

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.780 align:middle line:90%
a year in the US.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.030 align:middle line:84%
The problem with the Gerson
therapy is it heals with food.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.790 align:middle line:84%
It heals with organic
vegetarian food.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.680 align:middle line:90%
It heals with juices.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.730 align:middle line:84%
A sack of carrots,
25 pounds, probably

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.530 align:middle line:90%
only last a patient for a week.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.660 align:middle line:90%
It maybe cost $12.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And the medical
pharmaceutical industry

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.860 align:middle line:90%
can't make money on that.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.460 align:middle line:84%
If the patients recover, they
don't need any more painkillers

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.510 align:middle line:84%
and don't touch any more chemo
drugs that are poisonous.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.310 align:middle line:84%
By the way, did you know
that the information that

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.370 align:middle line:84%
comes along with the chemo
drugs, usually the paper that

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.510 align:middle line:84%
goes along with it, clearly
states that the chemo

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.210 align:middle line:90%
drug is known to cause cancer.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.520 align:middle line:84%
It's a wonderful cancer
drug that can cause cancer.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:16.019 align:middle line:90%


00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's very important
to get raw food.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.670 align:middle line:84%
We give the patient somewhere
between 10 and 13 eight ounce

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:31.220 align:middle line:84%
glasses of fresh raw juice
from organic produce.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.180 align:middle line:84%
They get tremendous amounts
of raw enzymes, raw nutrients,

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.500 align:middle line:90%
raw minerals, raw vitamins.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.010 align:middle line:84%
But my father found early on
that, especially the very sick

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.880 align:middle line:90%
patients, have poor appetite.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.440 align:middle line:84%
They can't-- they don't really
care to eat all raw food.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.810 align:middle line:84%
When they get all raw
juice, particularly

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.520 align:middle line:90%
let's visualize winter.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.510 align:middle line:90%
And it's cold.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:57.740 align:middle line:90%
And the food is cold.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.090 align:middle line:90%
And the juices are cold.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.940 align:middle line:90%
And they were-- they really--

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.910 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't do much for them.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.080 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but
the intestinal tract

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.010 align:middle line:84%
is damaged with all the
bad food and all the damage

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.850 align:middle line:84%
they have done over the years
to the intestinal tract.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And if they suddenly
get only raw food,

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.550 align:middle line:90%
it causes poor digestion.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:20.630 align:middle line:90%
It causes gas.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:21.980 align:middle line:90%
It causes diarrhea.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.290 align:middle line:90%
It causes cramping and spasming.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:25.830 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.380 align:middle line:84%
So what we actually do is a
very interesting question,

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.800 align:middle line:84%
because we get similar
questions from the patients.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.090 align:middle line:90%
Breakfast is made up of oatmeal.

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.920 align:middle line:84%
It's a nice soft,
bulky cereal, which

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.800 align:middle line:84%
not only is high in
vegetarian protein

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.560 align:middle line:84%
but it's high in the
B-complex vitamin.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And it gives the
stomach a cushion

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:56.820 align:middle line:84%
of soft, cooked substance
for the juices that follow.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:57.620 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.920 align:middle line:84%
Then lunch, well
lunch, and it always

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.200 align:middle line:84%
starts with a nice
big raw salad.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.050 align:middle line:84%
But then there's a
special hippocrates soup,

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.740 align:middle line:84%
which the special combination
of herbs, hippocrates,

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.740 align:middle line:84%
already found helps to
cleanse the kidneys.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.610 align:middle line:84%
While we work a lot
on the liver, well,

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.020 align:middle line:90%
what about the kidneys?

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.340 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the juices
do a lot of that.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.530 align:middle line:84%
But the herbs help the
kidneys to release all this.

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.600 align:middle line:84%
So we get a nice
big plate of soup.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.760 align:middle line:84%
First salad, then
soup, then they

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.290 align:middle line:84%
get a vegetable plate and
potatoes, and it feels good.

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:31.790 align:middle line:90%
And they'll eat it.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.470 align:middle line:90%
And they're hungry.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.290 align:middle line:90%
And it gives soft bulk.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.340 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.820 align:middle line:84%
So then dessert is
either a piece of fruit,

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.150 align:middle line:84%
or it could be stewed
fruit or whatever.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:48.350 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting is the
patients even occasionally

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:52.640 align:middle line:84%
remark, well, how can we get
well and this is all cooked

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.550 align:middle line:90%
food?

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.050 align:middle line:84%
Actually the cooked food,
the oatmeal, the vegetables

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:05.900 align:middle line:84%
and potatoes, comprise
less than 3 pounds

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.580 align:middle line:90%
of the patient's intake.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.240 align:middle line:84%
The raw food, in the form of
salads, fruit, and juices,

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.120 align:middle line:90%
comprise like 17 pounds.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:15.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:21.440 align:middle line:84%
But the patients think they're
getting all cooked foods.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.670 align:middle line:84%
But the point is, with the
soft bulk of the cooked food,

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.410 align:middle line:84%
which also have
minerals and still

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.340 align:middle line:84%
have nutrients and
still have proteins,

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.290 align:middle line:90%
they are able to digest.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And the intestinal
tract functions better.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:36.170 align:middle line:90%
And they don't get gas.

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:38.960 align:middle line:90%
And they're able to function.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.770 align:middle line:84%
But on raw foods, they
don't function well.

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:43.580 align:middle line:90%
They get gas.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.320 align:middle line:90%
They get difficulty digesting.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.880 align:middle line:90%
They don't have appetite.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.140 align:middle line:90%
And it's all raw.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:49.370 align:middle line:90%
And it's all cold.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, psychologically,
it's important.

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:56.450 align:middle line:84%
But physically,
it's also important.

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And they do, I mean, the
cooked food is not just dead.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:00.070 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:02.030 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there are
no enzymes in it.

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:07.250 align:middle line:84%
But get-- they get 17
pounds worth of enzymes

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:08.900 align:middle line:84%
that they forget
they're drinking.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.730 align:middle line:90%
It's not eating.

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.114 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:08:12.114 --> 00:08:14.580 align:middle line:90%


00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:15.380 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course,
that's part of my job

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:21.200 align:middle line:84%
is to help the patients
understand what they're doing

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.760 align:middle line:90%
and make it practical.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And of course, being
at the hospital,

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.540 align:middle line:90%
they get the food prepared.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.060 align:middle line:90%
And they learn what it's like.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And we do something
else at the hospital.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.679 align:middle line:84%
We urge the patients
to bring a companion.

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:41.809 align:middle line:84%
We literally sometimes refuse to
admit them without a companion.

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And the companion
is free of charge.

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:46.310 align:middle line:84%
We don't charge
for the companion,

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:49.450 align:middle line:84%
because a companion is
such an important person.

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:52.790 align:middle line:84%
The companion has to learn
the food preparation,

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:55.940 align:middle line:84%
what the meals consist of,
how the patients respond,

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:58.250 align:middle line:84%
how, you know, the
medication is given,

00:08:58.250 --> 00:08:59.900 align:middle line:90%
how the enemas are given.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And what happens when patients
go into this typical flare up,

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:06.100 align:middle line:84%
these healing
reactions, all of this,

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.840 align:middle line:84%
the companion has to
learn, understand.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Because they are going to
be the caregivers at home.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Again, the patients generally
stay only three weeks.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:18.800 align:middle line:90%
But the therapy lasts two years.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.230 align:middle line:90%
They have to carry on at home.

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And they shouldn't
make mistakes.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:26.360 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very difficult.
Because there's so many

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.430 align:middle line:90%
do's and don'ts in the book.

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:31.110 align:middle line:90%


00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And people have to learn
how and why and what to do.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:42.390 align:middle line:84%
That's why these companions
are so important, so much so

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.400 align:middle line:90%
that they're not even charged.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.660 align:middle line:90%
We urge them to come.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.270 align:middle line:90%
We literally make them come.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:51.030 align:middle line:84%
But we can't do that
and charge them, OK.

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:53.460 align:middle line:90%
So we don't.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.360 align:middle line:90%
>> That's great.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.230 align:middle line:84%
>> By the way, I do not
own or operate the clinic.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:02.370 align:middle line:84%
It's owned and operated by
two Mexican physicians that

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:06.360 align:middle line:84%
have worked with us, one from
the start of the treatment 30

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.170 align:middle line:90%
years ago.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:10.170 align:middle line:84%
This July, it'll
be exactly 30 years

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:14.940 align:middle line:84%
since we opened the first
Gerson clinic in Mexico.

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And the other doctor came on
board just a little bit later.

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:20.870 align:middle line:84%
I think for her
it's like 24 years.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:24.970 align:middle line:90%
And they do a wonderful job.

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:28.010 align:middle line:84%
In a nutshell you know
where it came from,

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:32.740 align:middle line:84%
it came from World
War I. At the time,

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.380 align:middle line:84%
Germany was surrounded
by the Allies.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the important
tropical materials

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:40.630 align:middle line:90%
didn't reach Germany.

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.600 align:middle line:84%
That included
coffee and morphine.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And you know, then there
were the field hospitals,

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:50.800 align:middle line:84%
where constant train loads
of injured and shot patients,

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.112 align:middle line:90%
you know, soldiers came in.

00:10:52.112 --> 00:10:53.320 align:middle line:90%
And they had to have surgery.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And they had to
be taken care of.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And it was very difficult.
Because there was virtually no

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.530 align:middle line:84%
morphine, just maybe
barely enough to go.

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:06.130 align:middle line:84%
But not after the pain was
started, after the surgery,

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:08.480 align:middle line:90%
they wouldn't get it.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly, not
rarely, the surgeons

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:17.110 align:middle line:84%
would order enemas
for such patients.

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:20.740 align:middle line:84%
But it was usually
water or soap enemas.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And on the other
hand, there was always

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.370 align:middle line:90%
enough coffee for the surgeons.

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Because they often had to
work around the clock, 24,

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.950 align:middle line:90%
36 hours without sleep.

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:35.200 align:middle line:84%
So there was always
enough coffee for them.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:39.230 align:middle line:84%
But nobody out to
keep them awake.

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:44.710 align:middle line:84%
So occasionally, there
was some coffee leftover.

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And the nurses who had
to prepare these enemas

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:55.090 align:middle line:84%
for the operated patients,
they said the coffee

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.015 align:middle line:90%
is doing the surgeons good.

00:11:57.015 --> 00:11:58.390 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it'll do
the patients good.

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And they poured coffee
into their enema buckets.

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And the patients reported
that it relieved their pain.

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:08.760 align:middle line:90%
And that was interesting.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And this report came to the
ears of two doctors, scientists

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:19.210 align:middle line:84%
at the University of Gottingen
in Germany, after the war.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:22.110 align:middle line:90%
And they tested it on animals.

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And they put caffeine into
the rectum of animals.

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And they found that, yes,
it travels to the liver,

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.640 align:middle line:84%
to the bile ducts,
and opens these ducts.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And they could see the flow
of bile with the caffeine

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.370 align:middle line:90%
into the rectum.

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:44.130 align:middle line:84%
Then a different doctor
hearing about this research

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:45.720 align:middle line:84%
and apparently he
claimed that he

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:51.010 align:middle line:84%
heard my father lecture one time
in Berlin many, many years ago.

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:52.950 align:middle line:90%
And he was interested.

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:54.750 align:middle line:90%
And he was a researcher.

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:57.300 align:middle line:84%
So he swallowed, not
swallowed, actually put it

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:01.110 align:middle line:84%
through his nose, a tube
that goes down the esophagus.

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And he released it
to go up to the place

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:12.660 align:middle line:84%
where the bile flows
into the small intestine.

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.510 align:middle line:84%
He had that tube
all the way down.

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:18.090 align:middle line:90%


00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And he could see that when
he was drinking the coffee,

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:30.000 align:middle line:84%
that these same bile ducts
would close, cramp, spasm

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.400 align:middle line:90%
and soap over.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:37.050 align:middle line:84%
Then on himself, he put
caffeine into the rectum.

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And he could see
that they opened up.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.180 align:middle line:90%
And the bile would flow.

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:48.450 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there was
proof that rectum coffee

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:51.480 align:middle line:84%
works quite opposite and
differently than coffee

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.450 align:middle line:90%
you drink.

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we
still got doctors

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:58.380 align:middle line:84%
who love to make fun
of the Gerson therapy,

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.120 align:middle line:90%
ha ha, coffee, rectum.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.147 align:middle line:90%
Do you use cream and sugar?

00:14:02.147 --> 00:14:03.480 align:middle line:90%
You know, this sort of nonsense.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.800 align:middle line:90%
They don't understand.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.830 align:middle line:90%
They want to make it ridiculous.

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:11.430 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, I don't
know if you know about this,

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:13.620 align:middle line:84%
but there is such a
thing as the Merck

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:17.130 align:middle line:90%
Manual for Medical Procedures.

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And coffee enemas were described
in the Merck Manual until 1973,

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.310 align:middle line:90%
then it disappeared.

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:29.110 align:middle line:90%
Disappeared.

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:32.980 align:middle line:90%
But it was in the Merck Manual.

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And we find now that, you
know, we give the patients,

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:44.710 align:middle line:84%
in many cases, especially in
severe cancer and severe pain,

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:47.920 align:middle line:90%
as many as five enemas a day.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:53.480 align:middle line:84%
In other words, enemas are not
designed to move the bowel.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.840 align:middle line:84%
They do that anyway,
and that's important.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.330 align:middle line:84%
But that's not
their main function.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:01.480 align:middle line:84%
The main function is to
keep these bile ducts open,

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:05.590 align:middle line:84%
so that with all the release
that we force with the juices

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:08.260 align:middle line:84%
and enzymes, the
release of toxins

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.540 align:middle line:84%
that we force into
the bloodstream that

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.750 align:middle line:84%
are filtered out through
the liver to help the liver

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.600 align:middle line:90%
get rid of it.

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Or else, if it
doesn't get rid of it,

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.060 align:middle line:84%
it does more damage
to the liver.

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's the importance
of coffee enemas.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And you should not--
nobody should do the Gerson

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:31.210 align:middle line:90%
therapy without enemas.

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And you know, when you
have patients that say,

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.190 align:middle line:84%
well, you know, I don't mind
juices and the vegetarian food.

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:36.990 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:38.950 align:middle line:90%
But enemas?

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:42.280 align:middle line:84%
That's very often a
problem for patients.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.610 align:middle line:84%
Or it also goes the
other way around.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:46.420 align:middle line:84%
They say, I don't
mind taking an enema.

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.370 align:middle line:84%
But I want to eat
the food I enjoy.

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:51.790 align:middle line:84%
I want to eat my meat or steak
or whatever they want to eat.

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:53.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do that.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can't do
a half a therapy.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.370 align:middle line:84%
The Gerson therapy
is a total approach

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:02.530 align:middle line:90%
to all the body's systems.

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And it works with all of the
systems, the enzyme system,

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:09.060 align:middle line:84%
the hormone system, the mineral
balances, the immune system.

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:11.340 align:middle line:84%
It works with the
essential organ system.

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:13.720 align:middle line:90%
It works with everything.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And you can't do
a half a therapy.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's very, very important
to keep that in mind.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the food,
the juices, the enemas,

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:27.250 align:middle line:84%
and the enzymes that we add in
addition, because the patients

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:29.800 align:middle line:84%
don't have anything
to work with,

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:34.420 align:middle line:84%
what little they had is dead
and gone with the chemotherapy.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.770 align:middle line:90%
The doctors add to the problem.

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:40.000 align:middle line:90%
