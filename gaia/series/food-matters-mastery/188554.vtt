[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:10.240 align:middle line:90%


00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.270 align:middle line:84%
>> In a nutshell, do you
know where it came from?

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:18.040 align:middle line:84%
It came from World
War I. At the time,

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.650 align:middle line:84%
Germany was surrounded
by the Allies.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the important
topical materials

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.830 align:middle line:84%
didn't reach Germany that
included coffee and morphine.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And then there were
the field hospitals

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.350 align:middle line:84%
where constant train
loads of injured and shot

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.590 align:middle line:84%
patients, soldiers came in,
and they had to have surgery,

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.150 align:middle line:84%
and they had to
be taken care of.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
difficult because there

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.090 align:middle line:84%
was virtually no
morphine-- just maybe

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.480 align:middle line:84%
barely enough to go [AUDIO OUT]
but not after the pain was

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.400 align:middle line:90%
started, after the surgery.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.780 align:middle line:90%
They wouldn't get it.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly, not
rarely the surgeons

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.380 align:middle line:84%
would order enemas
for such patients.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.010 align:middle line:84%
But it was usually
water or soap enemas.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And on the other
hand, there was always

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.640 align:middle line:90%
enough coffee for the surgeons.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Because they often had to
work around the clock--

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.250 align:middle line:90%
24, 36 hours-- without sleep.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.470 align:middle line:84%
So there was always
enough coffee for them,

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.490 align:middle line:84%
but nobody else,
to keep them awake.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.980 align:middle line:84%
So occasionally there was
some coffee left over.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And the nurses who had
to prepare these enemas

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:40.350 align:middle line:84%
for the operated patients,
they said, the coffee

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.535 align:middle line:84%
is doing the
surgeons good, maybe

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:43.660 align:middle line:90%
it'll do the patients good.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And they poured coffee
into their enema buckets.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And the patients reported
that it relieved their pain.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.040 align:middle line:90%
And that was interesting.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And this report came to the
ears of two doctors, scientists

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.450 align:middle line:84%
at the University of Gottingen
in Germany after the war.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.390 align:middle line:90%
And they tested it on animals.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And they put caffeine into
the rectum of animals.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And they found that, yes,
it travels to the liver,

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.920 align:middle line:84%
to the bile ducts,
and opens these ducts.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And they could see the flow
of bile with the caffeine

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.650 align:middle line:90%
into the rectum.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.410 align:middle line:84%
Then a different doctor,
hearing about this research--

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.000 align:middle line:84%
and apparently he
claimed that he

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.290 align:middle line:84%
heard my father lecture one time
in Berlin many, many years ago.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And he was interested,
and he was a researcher.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.580 align:middle line:84%
So he swallowed-- not
swallowed, actually put it

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.390 align:middle line:84%
through his nose, a tube
that goes down the esophagus.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And he released it
to go up to the place

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.940 align:middle line:84%
where the bile flows
into the small intestine.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.790 align:middle line:84%
He had that tube
all the way down.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.370 align:middle line:90%


00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And he could see that when
he was drinking the coffee,

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.250 align:middle line:84%
that these same bile ducts
would close, clamp, spasm

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.680 align:middle line:90%
and soap over.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.330 align:middle line:84%
Then on himself, he put
caffeine into the rectum.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And he could see
that they opened up

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.460 align:middle line:90%
and the bile would flow.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.730 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there was
proof that rectum coffee

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.760 align:middle line:84%
works quite opposite and
differently than coffee

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.730 align:middle line:90%
you drink.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, we
still get doctors

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.670 align:middle line:84%
who love to make fun
of the Gerson Therapy.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.400 align:middle line:90%
Ha-ha, coffee rectum.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.427 align:middle line:90%
Do you use cream and sugar?

00:03:47.427 --> 00:03:48.760 align:middle line:90%
You know, that sort of nonsense.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.080 align:middle line:90%
They don't understand.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.110 align:middle line:90%
They want to make it ridiculous.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.710 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, I don't
know if you know about this,

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.460 align:middle line:84%
but there is such a thing as
the Merck Manual for Medical

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.470 align:middle line:84%
Procedures, and coffee
enemas were described

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.160 align:middle line:90%
in the Merck Manual until 1973.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.390 align:middle line:90%
Then it disappeared.

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.390 align:middle line:90%
Disappeared.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.260 align:middle line:90%
But it was in the Merck Manual.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And we find now that we give
the patients in many cases,

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.990 align:middle line:84%
especially in severe
cancer and severe pain,

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.200 align:middle line:90%
as many as five enemas a day.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.760 align:middle line:84%
In other words, enemas are not
designed to move the bowel.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.120 align:middle line:84%
They do that anyway,
and that's important,

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.610 align:middle line:84%
but that's not
their main function.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.600 align:middle line:84%
The main function is to keep
these bile ducts open so that

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.870 align:middle line:84%
with all the release that
we force with the juices

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.540 align:middle line:84%
and enzymes, the
release of toxins

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.820 align:middle line:84%
that we force into
the bloodstream that

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.270 align:middle line:84%
are filtered out through the
liver to help the liver get

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.880 align:middle line:90%
rid of it.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.340 align:middle line:84%
Or else, if it
doesn't get rid of it,

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.290 align:middle line:84%
it does more damage
to the liver.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's the importance
of the coffee enemas.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And you should not--
nobody should do the Gerson

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.490 align:middle line:90%
Therapy without enemas.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And you know, when you
have patients that say,

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.450 align:middle line:84%
well, you know, I don't mind
juices and the vegetarian food,

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:22.250 align:middle line:90%
that's OK.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.230 align:middle line:90%
But enemas?

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.560 align:middle line:84%
That's very often a
problem for patients.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.740 align:middle line:84%
Or it also goes the
other way around.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.700 align:middle line:84%
They say, I don't
mind taking an enema,

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.650 align:middle line:84%
but I want to eat
the food I enjoy.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.070 align:middle line:84%
I want to eat my meat or steak
or whatever they want to eat.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.120 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do that.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can't do
a half a therapy.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.650 align:middle line:84%
The Gerson Therapy
is a total approach

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.810 align:middle line:90%
to all the body's systems.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And it works with
all of the system--

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.300 align:middle line:84%
the enzyme system, the hormone
system, the mineral balances,

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.340 align:middle line:90%
the immune system.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.780 align:middle line:84%
It works with the
essential organ system.

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.000 align:middle line:90%
It works with everything.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And you can't do
a half a therapy.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's very, very important
to keep that in mind.

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the food,
the juices, the enemas,

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.610 align:middle line:84%
and the enzymes that
we add in addition--

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.170 align:middle line:84%
because the patients don't
have anything to work with.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.700 align:middle line:84%
What little they had is dead
and gone with the chemotherapy.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.680 align:middle line:90%
The doctors add to the problem.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.060 align:middle line:90%


00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.550 align:middle line:84%
We had a patient, a young
man, only 42 years old.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.090 align:middle line:84%
He had had a massive
heart attack at 38.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:39.810 align:middle line:84%
By the way, did you know that
especially in younger people,

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:46.170 align:middle line:84%
very often the very, very
first symptom of heart disease

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.000 align:middle line:90%
is a fatal heart attack.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:55.210 align:middle line:84%
First, [AUDIO OUT] fatal
in 38% of the patients.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.430 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this young man had
had-- at the age of 38

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.060 align:middle line:84%
had had a massive
heart attack, survived.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.510 align:middle line:90%
And he came in obese--

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:05.990 align:middle line:90%
very.

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:07.250 align:middle line:90%
He was 6 foot 2.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:12.090 align:middle line:84%
I know that was quite
tall, but 300 pounds.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And besides the hard
problem, very high blood

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:21.260 align:middle line:84%
pressure which didn't respond
to drugs for blood pressure.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.720 align:middle line:90%
He had very high diabetes.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.400 align:middle line:84%
He had blood sugar of over 230,
and they couldn't bring it down

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.900 align:middle line:90%
with all their drugs.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.560 align:middle line:90%
And he had gout.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And if he stopped the gout
medication for only one day,

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.730 align:middle line:84%
he'd have a breakdown of
gout all over his body, all

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.660 align:middle line:90%
his joints, OK?

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:47.990 align:middle line:84%
Now we could not take him off
the blood pressure medication

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:49.120 align:middle line:90%
from one day to the next.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.390 align:middle line:90%
You can't do that.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:53.690 align:middle line:84%
We could not take him
down off of the insulin

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:54.840 align:middle line:90%
from one day to the next.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:55.820 align:middle line:90%
We couldn't do that.

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:59.720 align:middle line:84%
But the gout medication
one day to the next, gone.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.820 align:middle line:90%
Never had another gout attack.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.814 align:middle line:90%
What does gout come from?

00:08:03.814 --> 00:08:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Animal protein.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.860 align:middle line:90%
No animal protein, no gout.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.100 align:middle line:90%
That's very simple.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:15.050 align:middle line:84%
OK, so it depends very much
on what drugs they're using,

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.760 align:middle line:90%
what drugs they are on.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.640 align:middle line:84%
Also like if they
are on morphine plus

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.730 align:middle line:84%
codeine, plus patches,
plus, plus, plus, we

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:27.080 align:middle line:84%
can't stop the pain killers
from one moment to the next

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.590 align:middle line:84%
because the pain
is so agonizing.

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.870 align:middle line:90%
And we don't torture people, OK?

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:36.590 align:middle line:84%
So with the juices,
with the enemas

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:38.960 align:middle line:84%
and doing everything
that needs to be done,

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.260 align:middle line:90%
the pain comes down.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.700 align:middle line:84%
Then the medication
comes down, OK?

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.130 align:middle line:90%
So it depends on what it is.

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:46.720 align:middle line:90%
I can't make a straight rule.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So what happened
with this guy?

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Did he get on the
full Gerson Therapy?

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:54.260 align:middle line:84%
>> In six weeks, he
lost 100 pounds--

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:59.390 align:middle line:84%
never was hungry,
never a moment, OK?

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And at first, we let him
have only one potato a day.

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:11.090 align:middle line:84%
After 4 and 1/2 weeks,
his diabetes was gone.

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:13.430 align:middle line:90%
So he got potatoes.

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:16.730 align:middle line:84%
Usually patients also
get a fresh fruit plate

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:20.750 align:middle line:84%
in their room, so if they're
hungry they can snack on fruit.

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:23.290 align:middle line:84%
You can't give a fresh
fruit plate to a diabetic,

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:24.950 align:middle line:84%
so he had a fresh
vegetable plate.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:26.200 align:middle line:90%
He had the little cauliflower.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.860 align:middle line:84%
He had the little
tomatoes-- you know,

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:32.510 align:middle line:84%
the little cherry tomatoes--
and the little cut-up carrot

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:34.460 align:middle line:90%
sticks and cut-up celery sticks.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.290 align:middle line:84%
All kinds-- big
plate so he could

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:37.610 align:middle line:90%
eat whenever he wanted to.

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:41.420 align:middle line:84%
He was never hungry one
moment because this food truly

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:42.860 align:middle line:90%
satisfied him.

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.115 align:middle line:90%
He had no appetite.

00:09:44.115 --> 00:09:44.915 align:middle line:90%
He had no craving.

00:09:44.915 --> 00:09:47.240 align:middle line:90%
He had no problem.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And in five weeks, he
was past the diabetes.

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And slowly, slowly, the
blood pressure and everything

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.010 align:middle line:90%
came down.

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:59.210 align:middle line:84%
By the end of I think
it was eight weeks,

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:01.550 align:middle line:90%
he had lost 100 pounds.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And he was-- at 6 foot
2, he was 205 or so.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.940 align:middle line:84%
He was a little bit chubby
but fairly normal, OK,

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:14.420 align:middle line:90%
without ever being hungry.

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And we had him off
drugs and everything.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.750 align:middle line:90%
