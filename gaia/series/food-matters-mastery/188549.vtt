00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>> The vaccination issue is
interesting from a social point

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.890 align:middle line:90%
of view.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.520 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting from a
medical point of view.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Our research has shown
that vaccinations are not

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.750 align:middle line:84%
only not helping a child's
immune system form naturally,

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.750 align:middle line:84%
but can be a serious damage and
impediment to them, especially

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.320 align:middle line:90%
in the early years.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.740 align:middle line:84%
If we look at
nations like America

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.830 align:middle line:84%
relentlessly vaccinate
their kids up to 18,

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.320 align:middle line:84%
and we see a lot of
immune system problems.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.750 align:middle line:84%
We see a lot of
autism has sprung up.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.460 align:middle line:84%
There have been
investigations done

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.880 align:middle line:84%
to see if this has been caused
by the thimerosal that's

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.740 align:middle line:90%
included in the vaccinations.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.140 align:middle line:84%
The whole vaccine
theory has always

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.000 align:middle line:90%
sat uncomfortably with me.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.850 align:middle line:84%
It's the idea that
you can introduce

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.420 align:middle line:84%
part of the contaminant
into the body

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.390 align:middle line:84%
to force the body to
produce antibodies,

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.380 align:middle line:84%
thereby giving you immunity,
rather than doing it

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.120 align:middle line:84%
the way that the
body likes to do it,

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.430 align:middle line:84%
and that is to allow people
to develop naturally,

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.010 align:middle line:90%
kids to develop naturally.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.320 align:middle line:84%
In the old days when
I was growing up,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.300 align:middle line:84%
if measles came to
Maidstone, all the mums

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.300 align:middle line:90%
would get on the phone--

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.520 align:middle line:90%
measles is in town.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.228 align:middle line:84%
All the kids would
get in the front room.

00:01:20.228 --> 00:01:22.168 align:middle line:84%
[EXHALES] We'd breathe
over everybody.

00:01:22.168 --> 00:01:23.960 align:middle line:84%
You'd get the measles,
I'd get the measles,

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.300 align:middle line:84%
and we'd listless and
disinterested for 10 days,

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.860 align:middle line:90%
but that's how the body learned.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.500 align:middle line:84%
That's how the immune
system formed antibodies,

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.060 align:middle line:84%
and so you now had
lifetime immunity.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.398 align:middle line:84%
But today the whole ethos is,
no, no, no, you can't suffer.

00:01:35.398 --> 00:01:36.690 align:middle line:90%
You can't even get the disease.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.090 align:middle line:90%
That's out of the question.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Today you can have the MMR and
be listless and disinterested

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.350 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of your life.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And we have huge numbers of
people around the world now

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.210 align:middle line:84%
suffering from autism,
and this whole epidemic

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.370 align:middle line:84%
appears to have
come out of nowhere.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And if you start scratching the
surface of this oily subject,

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.140 align:middle line:84%
you will start to see some
tremendous liberties being

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.250 align:middle line:84%
taken with the public's trust in
what they should and should not

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.140 align:middle line:84%
do to their kids to enable
them to avoid these diseases.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.430 align:middle line:90%
Yes, measles can kill.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.949 align:middle line:84%
Yes, these other
diseases can kill.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:13.910 align:middle line:84%
But when you look at
the historical record

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.700 align:middle line:84%
of vaccinations, if you
look at a graph of smallpox,

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.720 align:middle line:84%
smallpox was in decline
long before they introduced

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.620 align:middle line:90%
the smallpox vaccine.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.500 align:middle line:84%
We started introducing
social reforms in Britain

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.410 align:middle line:84%
in the mid 1800s that
began cleaning up

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.140 align:middle line:84%
the environment, piping,
the sewage, and smallpox

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.150 align:middle line:90%
was already on the decline.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And what they did
was they came in

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.130 align:middle line:84%
and started introducing
smallpox vaccinations, which

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.800 align:middle line:84%
actually started causing
smallpox epidemics.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.870 align:middle line:90%
And this happened twice.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.730 align:middle line:84%
When the Americans went
into the Philippines

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.830 align:middle line:84%
in the first part
of the 1900s, there

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.510 align:middle line:84%
were three separate
epidemics that

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.030 align:middle line:84%
were treated as a result
of vaccination there.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And today, of course, we see
that vaccination is de rigueur

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.220 align:middle line:90%
for kids.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, there
are countries where

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.608 align:middle line:84%
you don't get to go to
school unless your book has

00:02:59.608 --> 00:03:02.150 align:middle line:84%
been stamped, a bit like a car
having been through a service.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.120 align:middle line:90%
You got a vaccination stamp.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And the parents need to
look into this subject.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.680 align:middle line:90%
We've done whole books on it.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.315 align:middle line:84%
Parents need to
feel easy about what

00:03:11.315 --> 00:03:12.440 align:middle line:90%
they decide for their kids.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.330 align:middle line:84%
What I'm against is this strong
arming of the public, as well,

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.210 align:middle line:84%
that you see happening,
doctors coercing parents,

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.005 align:middle line:84%
frightening parents into
having these vaccinations,

00:03:23.005 --> 00:03:24.380 align:middle line:84%
and then these
doctors don't want

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.860 align:middle line:84%
to know when these kids
suddenly become deaf or have

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.710 align:middle line:84%
epileptic fits in the car on
the way back from the surgery

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.397 align:middle line:84%
or whatever else
happens to them.

00:03:32.397 --> 00:03:33.980 align:middle line:84%
But, again, clearly
there are millions

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.433 align:middle line:84%
of kids who get vaccinated
who don't have a problem.

00:03:36.433 --> 00:03:37.850 align:middle line:84%
But I'm interested
in the ones who

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.905 align:middle line:84%
do have a problem, which can
be traced back to the period

00:03:41.905 --> 00:03:43.280 align:middle line:84%
when they had
these vaccinations.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.712 align:middle line:84%
And you ask any of the
hundreds of couples

00:03:45.712 --> 00:03:48.170 align:middle line:84%
that have come to me over the
years with these woeful tales

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.300 align:middle line:84%
of their kids being
damaged by vaccines,

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.860 align:middle line:84%
and they'll say there was
nothing wrong with my child

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.180 align:middle line:84%
up until I took
him to the doctor,

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.190 align:middle line:84%
and I took him to the
doctor because I believe

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.320 align:middle line:84%
I was doing the best
thing for my child,

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.850 align:middle line:84%
and now my child has got
autism, my child is deaf,

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.430 align:middle line:84%
my child is not
behaving properly,

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.650 align:middle line:84%
my child has stopped growing,
these types of things.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.150 align:middle line:84%
So I think citizens need to
look into these questions

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.947 align:middle line:84%
and not just accept
at face value

00:04:12.947 --> 00:04:14.780 align:middle line:84%
what they're told by
the medical profession.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.780 align:middle line:84%
We'd like to trust our
professionals, of course,

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.070 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not here to paint
the medical industry

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.060 align:middle line:84%
as some sort of evil, wicked
witches stirring brews for us.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.900 align:middle line:84%
But there is a lot
of money at stake,

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.350 align:middle line:84%
and there are
economic dynamos that

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.260 align:middle line:84%
depend on the public behaving
a certain way if they

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.760 align:middle line:84%
feel that they are threatened
or if they have an illness.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.968 align:middle line:84%
So I think the public need
to make up their own minds

00:04:34.968 --> 00:04:36.080 align:middle line:90%
about these issues.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.230 align:middle line:84%
I think anybody who decides
to get a flu vaccine

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.870 align:middle line:84%
should actually find out
what's in the flu vaccine

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.485 align:middle line:84%
and be surprised when you
start to find that out.

00:04:45.485 --> 00:04:47.360 align:middle line:84%
We've looked at the
various vaccine cocktails

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.985 align:middle line:84%
over the years that
will include things

00:04:48.985 --> 00:04:51.950 align:middle line:84%
like aluminum hydroxide,
thimerosal, which

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:59.660 align:middle line:84%
is a type of mercury, aborted
human fetus cells, washed sheep

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.880 align:middle line:84%
cells, just things
you wouldn't really

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.190 align:middle line:90%
want to put into your newborn.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.810 align:middle line:84%
You really wouldn't
want to do that.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.230 align:middle line:84%
What you would want
to do is to breastfeed

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.930 align:middle line:84%
your newborn to give them all
of the immune factors required

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.700 align:middle line:84%
to form their immune
system properly

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.640 align:middle line:84%
and to breastfeed for
as long as is reasonable

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.990 align:middle line:84%
and, once that child
is off the breast,

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.410 align:middle line:84%
to put them onto good,
wholesome, organic foods.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Let them learn good
habits to start with.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And allow the body
to cope with disease

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:26.890 align:middle line:90%
the way nature intended.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.570 align:middle line:84%
But, again, nature is
apparently not good enough,

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.840 align:middle line:84%
so we need to have the
drug industry come in

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.715 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, nature's
messed it up.

00:05:33.715 --> 00:05:35.590 align:middle line:84%
We need to give them
this vaccine or them him

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:36.610 align:middle line:90%
that vaccine.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.440 align:middle line:90%
And kids are getting sick.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.270 align:middle line:84%
And there's been lots
of books done on it.

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.270 align:middle line:90%
We've done a book on it.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.080 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of credible
information on the web.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.920 align:middle line:84%
Whole organizations have
formed around parents

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.250 align:middle line:84%
who have kids who are just
not working properly anymore.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.680 align:middle line:84%
They just don't
work right, and they

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.470 align:middle line:84%
were working fine before they
went and had the vaccination.

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.000 align:middle line:84%
So the public
needs to feel easy.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.880 align:middle line:84%
Many citizens I
speak to say, no,

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.410 align:middle line:84%
we've decided to
vaccinate our kids,

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.552 align:middle line:84%
and we want to do what's
right, and I wouldn't dream

00:06:05.552 --> 00:06:06.760 align:middle line:90%
of persuading them otherwise.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.740 align:middle line:84%
But I do recommend
that everybody

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:09.950 align:middle line:90%
looks into the subject.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And if you are unsure
about the subject,

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.020 align:middle line:84%
then do some reading on both
sides of the fence with it.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.540 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, the medical
establishment

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.900 align:middle line:84%
believes in vaccinations
wholeheartedly,

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.120 align:middle line:84%
and I take my hat off to them
to have that kind of belief

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.470 align:middle line:90%
in some pretty shoddy science.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.710 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at the
doctors who are speaking out--

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.480 align:middle line:84%
against a great personal
cost, by the way--

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.230 align:middle line:84%
to warn the public
about some dangers that

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:34.322 align:middle line:84%
can await their
children, then I think

00:06:34.322 --> 00:06:36.280 align:middle line:84%
the parents should really
read that and make up

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.080 align:middle line:90%
their own minds.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.870 align:middle line:90%
