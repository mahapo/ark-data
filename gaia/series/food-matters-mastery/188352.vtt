00:00:02.928 --> 00:00:09.280 align:middle line:90%


00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:16.190 align:middle line:84%
>> 1860s, place called Europe,
started using mercury based

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.130 align:middle line:84%
fillings was brought to this
country, big controversy.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.550 align:middle line:84%
The dental society at the
time, the American physicians

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.150 align:middle line:84%
and dentists,
physicians and surgeons,

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.970 align:middle line:84%
refused to have anything to
do with mercury fillings,

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.410 align:middle line:90%
saying it was toxic.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And any of their
members who were

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.360 align:middle line:84%
found using mercury fillings
would be thrown out of society.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.920 align:middle line:84%
However, there was this
left wing radical group

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.800 align:middle line:84%
of dentists that felt that
this was a good thing,

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.380 align:middle line:90%
and they prevailed.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And their group was called the
American Dental Association.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.020 align:middle line:90%
And their views prevailed.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.720 align:middle line:84%
1920s, a German chemist was
poisoned by mercury fillings.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And again, a big controversy
erupted over the things.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.290 align:middle line:90%
And again, the ADA won.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And they're still used
today, and something

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.180 align:middle line:84%
like 79 million
Americans are getting

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.790 align:middle line:84%
mercury fillings put in their
mouths every day right now.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.790 align:middle line:84%
Legally we're not supposed
to say they're toxic.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.740 align:middle line:84%
So I never mention
that to patients.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.600 align:middle line:90%
But for a documentary, are they?

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.820 align:middle line:90%
You betcha.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.900 align:middle line:84%
I've treated thousands
of people who

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.610 align:middle line:90%
had mercury fillings removed.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And I cannot tell you the amount
of changes I've seen in human

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.550 align:middle line:90%
beings over the years.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.380 align:middle line:84%
What I found interesting
was when we first

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.080 align:middle line:84%
started taking them out,
people would say things like,

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.500 align:middle line:84%
my memory's better, or
I'm sleeping better,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.730 align:middle line:84%
or it feels like I used to have
my finger in an electric socket

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.780 align:middle line:84%
and now I don't feel
that way anymore.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And I used to think
those were odd comments.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And they stuck in
my mind because gee,

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't see why it would affect
your memory or sleeping better.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.420 align:middle line:84%
But after hearing that a few
hundred times, it's like,

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.710 align:middle line:84%
you know, there's probably
a connection with this.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very good
film in the sense it just

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.820 align:middle line:84%
shows an extracted tooth,
which is put right in front

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.949 align:middle line:90%
of a phosphorescent screen.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And what you see is the vapors
from the mercury coming off,

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.600 align:middle line:84%
which is constant, which
goes on all the time

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.290 align:middle line:84%
as long as you have a mercury
filling in your mouth.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.720 align:middle line:84%
Suffice it to say that if
you have it in your mouth,

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.700 align:middle line:90%
you're being poisoned by it.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.590 align:middle line:90%
End of story.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:31.160 align:middle line:84%
A problem with it is it is so
diverse a toxin that it's not

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.090 align:middle line:90%
one or two things.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.660 align:middle line:84%
If every time you had a mercury
filling your left pinky finger

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.170 align:middle line:84%
turned black and fell off,
then people could say, oh yeah,

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.180 align:middle line:90%
there's a definite correlation.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.320 align:middle line:90%
But it's insidious.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.950 align:middle line:84%
Chronic fatigue is
related to this.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.440 align:middle line:84%
So is periodontal
disease by the way.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.780 align:middle line:84%
In terms of chronic
fatigue, depression,

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.180 align:middle line:84%
they're now showing possible
links with Alzheimer's,

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.700 align:middle line:84%
psoriasis, MS. It's countless
the amount of things

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.910 align:middle line:84%
that happen when you take
mercury fillings out.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.330 align:middle line:84%
Memory comes back, sleep gets
better, and so forth and so on.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.030 align:middle line:84%
The list just goes
on and on and on.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.900 align:middle line:90%


00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.910 align:middle line:84%
It's not so much
chronic fatigue.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.710 align:middle line:84%
Think of it as
chronic malnutrition,

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.630 align:middle line:90%
because that's what's going on.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.890 align:middle line:90%
That's why people are tired.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.980 align:middle line:84%
You're not supposed to be
tired in the afternoon.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.190 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to
be alive and vibrant.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.850 align:middle line:84%
It's like you don't need to get
older and have aches and pains

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.860 align:middle line:84%
and slow down and
lose your energy.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.540 align:middle line:90%
Now, yes, some of that happens.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't party all night
like I would do when I'm 19.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.130 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't have
to be a bad thing.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.130 align:middle line:84%
You know, God didn't
make you to fall apart.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.420 align:middle line:90%
He made you to enjoy your life.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's like you wouldn't
go to temple or church

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.080 align:middle line:90%
and throw garbage on the floor.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.880 align:middle line:90%
Would you?

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.340 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And yet, why do we do
that with our bodies?

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.080 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that our own
personal temple?

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you live
here for God's sakes.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.310 align:middle line:84%
Why do you want
to foul your nest?

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.170 align:middle line:84%
We were at a dental
meeting one time.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.740 align:middle line:84%
We have a school and
we had brochures out,

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:09.873 align:middle line:90%
talking about these things.

00:04:09.873 --> 00:04:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And a dentist came by and
he looked at our brochure.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden he goes,
you drink water, don't you?

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And we started backing
away saying, yeah.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.720 align:middle line:84%
He said, well water's made
from hydrogen and oxygen.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.020 align:middle line:90%
They're explosive.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.500 align:middle line:90%
Why don't we blow up?

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.180 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well it's because
they're combined.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.380 align:middle line:84%
But look, mercury fillings,
mercury and mercury fillings,

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.260 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't combine.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.550 align:middle line:90%
It's not inert, see?

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.272 align:middle line:84%
Here's an article
from the Lancet,

00:04:35.272 --> 00:04:36.730 align:middle line:84%
that's the British
Medical Journal.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.130 align:middle line:84%
It's the most prestigious
journal in the world.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.170 align:middle line:90%
See, they say right here.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.560 align:middle line:84%
They did this studies and they
say mercury is still mercury.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.490 align:middle line:90%
It is not inert.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.730 align:middle line:84%
It is reactive throughout
the lifetime of the filling.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.088 align:middle line:84%
And the man read it,
looked at it, looked at us,

00:04:52.088 --> 00:04:54.130 align:middle line:84%
and took the book and just
threw it on the ground

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.900 align:middle line:90%
and walked away.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's a common
reaction when

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.260 align:middle line:84%
you talk to people about
their belief systems.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.760 align:middle line:84%
When I was in dental
school, we were

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.590 align:middle line:84%
taught that gum disease
was not that common.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And it really happened more
and more in people over 55,

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.510 align:middle line:90%
primarily women.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.570 align:middle line:84%
It was thought to be somehow
related to menopause.

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, again it's 80%
of the population,

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.260 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking about
people 18 and over.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's also in
30% of our children.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.170 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about our
children and our young.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about
linkages to, again,

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:40.180 align:middle line:84%
heart disease, stroke,
diabetes, obesity, cancers.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.920 align:middle line:84%
You name it and
it's there, and it's

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.050 align:middle line:84%
because gum disease
can be looked

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.580 align:middle line:84%
at as a poorly functioning
immune system responds

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.810 align:middle line:90%
to all the stresses.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.050 align:middle line:84%
Now you're going to stick known
poisons in someone's mouth,

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.020 align:middle line:90%
terms of mercury fillings?

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.650 align:middle line:90%
Give me a break.

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what are we
doing to our population?

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.260 align:middle line:90%
This is not healing.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.370 align:middle line:84%
It's not even keeping
them where they are.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.620 align:middle line:90%
It's actually doing damage.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Now there's a place called
China for people not aware of it

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.290 align:middle line:84%
who've been doing a
ton of assessments

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:20.590 align:middle line:84%
for Disease Control for a
little over 5,000 years.

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.510 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't work that
well in this country

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.130 align:middle line:84%
because they use a
different method.

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.480 align:middle line:84%
But suffice it to say that most
people who have a cold or a flu

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.040 align:middle line:84%
or going on a
cleansing diet will

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.498 align:middle line:84%
notice that their
tongue is turning

00:06:31.498 --> 00:06:35.170 align:middle line:84%
white, which is an indication
of toxins coming out.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.922 align:middle line:84%
There used to be a time
when physicians knowing

00:06:37.922 --> 00:06:39.880 align:middle line:84%
you were sick would
actually come to your house

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.052 align:middle line:90%
and make house calls.

00:06:41.052 --> 00:06:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And one of the first
things they would do

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.180 align:middle line:84%
is stick out your tongue
to look at the color.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.830 align:middle line:90%


00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.580 align:middle line:84%
Chinese medicine doesn't quite
work in a Western population,

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.660 align:middle line:84%
which I found out when I first
started doing this around 1980.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.630 align:middle line:84%
Because people here don't
understand when you say

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:02.200 align:middle line:84%
you have internal heat, and
your ying energy is too low.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.520 align:middle line:90%
They go, great.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.010 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much, bye.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.290 align:middle line:84%
So I started doing my
own research on this

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:11.170 align:middle line:84%
and started westernizing
my own stuff, which

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.720 align:middle line:84%
is why I wrote the book
"Your Tongue Never Lies".

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.020 align:middle line:84%
But suffice it to say,
if your tongue is yellow

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.500 align:middle line:84%
or yellowish green it's usually
indicative of liver gallbladder

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.340 align:middle line:90%
problem.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.140 align:middle line:84%
If it's gray or
grayish brown, it

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.890 align:middle line:84%
can be stomach or
large intestine.

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:31.180 align:middle line:84%
If the tip of the tongue is
red it's usually heart disease.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.490 align:middle line:84%
If the sides of the
tongue are reddish

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:37.270 align:middle line:84%
it can be either intestinal
problems or thyroid problems.

If you've got scalloping
on the sides of your tongue

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.220 align:middle line:84%
it's usually mineral
deficiencies.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And if you've got cracks on the
top it's vitamin deficiencies.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a
coating on the tongue,

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.360 align:middle line:84%
the thicker the coating, the
more chronic the problem is.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.790 align:middle line:90%
So what do we do now?

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:58.090 align:middle line:90%
We give people tongue scrapers.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Hey folks, you wake
up in the morning,

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:02.200 align:middle line:84%
you got crap all
over your tongue.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.270 align:middle line:84%
Your tongue looks like
your neighbor's doormat.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:06.160 align:middle line:84%
You can take your
scraper and scrape it off

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.755 align:middle line:90%
and think that's good?

00:08:08.755 --> 00:08:10.630 align:middle line:84%
Why are you getting this
stuff on your tongue

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:11.960 align:middle line:90%
in the first place?

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.420 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.200 align:middle line:90%
