00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:13.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Cancer is probably a
disease of civilization.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.310 align:middle line:84%
When we look at so-called
primitive or native societies

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.000 align:middle line:84%
that eat a lot of
plant-based diet

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.410 align:middle line:84%
and have a relatively brief
transit time, their food goes

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.080 align:middle line:84%
from ingestion to elimination
in maybe 20 hours,

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.310 align:middle line:84%
like it would be in Africa,
maybe even 18 or 15 hours,

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.010 align:middle line:84%
compared to Western
diets which have

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.590 align:middle line:84%
very little fiber, a lot more
fat, processed foods, starches,

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.190 align:middle line:84%
where our elimination time,
our transit time might be 48

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.080 align:middle line:84%
or even 72 hours, I think
there is a good chance

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.130 align:middle line:84%
that the longer waste products
and toxins stay in the colon,

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.820 align:middle line:84%
the more chance there is to
do damage and maybe even be

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.090 align:middle line:90%
reabsorbed into the body.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.950 align:middle line:84%
When we look at
simple eaters, people

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.760 align:middle line:84%
who eat a lot of fresh food,
and a lot of raw food, a lot

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.820 align:middle line:84%
of plant-based food, we
find that colon cancer

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.220 align:middle line:90%
is virtually nonexistent.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.980 align:middle line:84%
Colon cancer is a good place
to start because it's not

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:18.940 align:middle line:90%
very easy to treat.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.550 align:middle line:84%
Colon cancer is a
very serious disease.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that it's
100% preventable by having

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.620 align:middle line:84%
a high-fiber diet
and avoiding things

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.500 align:middle line:84%
that we know that
aggravate cancer,

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.800 align:middle line:84%
such as certain additives,
food preservatives,

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.180 align:middle line:90%
environmental chemicals.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.860 align:middle line:84%
They could be a cause of
any number of cancers.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Mostly, I would
meet with clients

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.840 align:middle line:84%
who had cancer, who were under
the care of an oncologist, who

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.330 align:middle line:84%
were getting
conventional therapy.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And I would say to
them what I would

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.910 align:middle line:84%
say to anyone, which
is, when you have

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.790 align:middle line:84%
a serious illness like cancer
for which there is no sure

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.210 align:middle line:84%
cure, you should do
everything you possibly can

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.130 align:middle line:84%
and stack the deck
in your favor.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And that means building the
immune system nutritionally

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.810 align:middle line:84%
and using vitamins to help
the body fight the disease.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Because being malnourished can't
possibly help you beat cancer.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.070 align:middle line:84%
So in addition to
conventional therapy,

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.950 align:middle line:84%
you use nutrition as
an adjunctive therapy.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And they start taking
high doses of nutrients,

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.100 align:middle line:90%
and you notice three things.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.265 align:middle line:84%
The first is people on chemo
don't lose their appetite.

00:02:32.265 --> 00:02:34.390 align:middle line:84%
The second thing you notice
when people are getting

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.530 align:middle line:84%
lots of nutrition, lots of
vitamins is their hair loss

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:39.800 align:middle line:90%
is reduced.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.040 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they don't
even lose their hair.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And the third thing
that you notice

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.380 align:middle line:90%
is that they don't have nausea.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.310 align:middle line:84%
People that are on
chemotherapy do not

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.960 align:middle line:84%
like to have their appetite go
away, and to lose their hair,

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.640 align:middle line:90%
and to feel nauseous.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.920 align:middle line:84%
Just that alone is enough
reason for every cancer patient,

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.840 align:middle line:84%
in addition to
conventional therapy,

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.790 align:middle line:90%
to take high doses of vitamins.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.170 align:middle line:90%
But it gets better than that.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.600 align:middle line:84%
Because we find that
high doses of vitamin

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.920 align:middle line:84%
C are actually as good or
better than chemotherapy

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.560 align:middle line:84%
in terms of killing
cancer cells,

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.930 align:middle line:84%
and vitamin C is
infinitely safer.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And while we're at it,
it's also less expensive.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.300 align:middle line:84%
Nutrient therapy is safe,
effective, and inexpensive.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's the problem
because we've all

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.430 align:middle line:84%
been taught that nothing
can be safe, effective,

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.590 align:middle line:90%
and inexpensive.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:44.740 align:middle line:84%
Things are dangerous, sometimes
helpful, and really costly.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.780 align:middle line:84%
That would describe
cancer therapy.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.640 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it works.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.930 align:middle line:84%
It's always expensive,
and it's always dangerous.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.110 align:middle line:84%
So when you come along and
say, instead of treating cancer

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.240 align:middle line:84%
with chemotherapy, you can give
intravenous vitamin C, 30, 60,

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:07.480 align:middle line:84%
100,000 milligrams a day
directly into the bloodstream,

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.780 align:middle line:84%
and that will kill
cancer cells--

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.060 align:middle line:84%
vitamin C at that high
dose is selectively

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.500 align:middle line:84%
toxic to cancer
cells, and that's

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.329 align:middle line:90%
exactly what chemotherapy is.

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.140 align:middle line:84%
But with vitamin C, there's
no damage to healthy cells,

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.910 align:middle line:90%
and people don't get nauseous.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.410 align:middle line:90%
They don't lose their hair.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.360 align:middle line:90%
All they do is get better.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.710 align:middle line:90%
Now, we wonder, why is this?

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.020 align:middle line:90%
And why isn't this being done?

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.070 align:middle line:84%
Because the next assumption
is if this were so good,

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.500 align:middle line:84%
my doctor would
already know about it.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.650 align:middle line:84%
If this were so good, it
would be on television.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.830 align:middle line:84%
If this were so good, it would
be taught in medical school.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's another one
of those assumptions.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.230 align:middle line:84%
Why would you want to
teach about vitamins

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.800 align:middle line:90%
in medical school?

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.970 align:middle line:84%
Why would medical doctors who
studied medicine, and practiced

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.710 align:middle line:84%
medicine, and are heavily funded
by pharmaceutical companies,

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.990 align:middle line:84%
why would they go and
look into vitamins?

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.690 align:middle line:84%
The pharmaceutical companies are
not going to advocate vitamins.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.070 align:middle line:90%
That's not going to work.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.570 align:middle line:84%
The government
doesn't know anything

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.880 align:middle line:84%
that it isn't told by the
pharmaceutical companies,

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.890 align:middle line:84%
and other lobbies, and
by medical lobbies.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.780 align:middle line:84%
The people don't
know because they

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.300 align:middle line:84%
had an education that
never had the word

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.160 align:middle line:90%
"orthomolecular" in it.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.610 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Hugh Riordan said
that "orthomolecular,"

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.460 align:middle line:84%
which is therapeutic nutrition,
orthomolecular medicine,

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.610 align:middle line:84%
is not the answer to
any question posed

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.830 align:middle line:90%
in medical school.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.030 align:middle line:84%
So what you're set here
with is two divergent views

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.410 align:middle line:90%
on health care.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And whenever you
have that, you have

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.630 align:middle line:84%
what we are experiencing
today, an impossible dichotomy.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.570 align:middle line:84%
When you talk to people about
using high-dose vitamin C

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.930 align:middle line:84%
for cancer, and then you tell
them that it's been heavily

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.400 align:middle line:90%
tested--

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.260 align:middle line:84%
even the National
Institutes of Health

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.390 align:middle line:84%
are showing that
this is working.

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Riordan's team has been
doing this for 25 years or more

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.180 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.480 align:middle line:84%
I've seen for 30 years
that high doses of vitamins

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.470 align:middle line:84%
greatly improve a cancer
patient's quality of life

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.310 align:middle line:84%
and greatly improve a cancer
patient's length of life.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And there is many, many
places in the literature where

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.950 align:middle line:84%
you can look and find support
for high-dose nutrient therapy

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.440 align:middle line:84%
to arrest or even
reverse cancer.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.960 align:middle line:90%
It's an impossible question.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.330 align:middle line:90%
Why isn't it being done?

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And the answer, of course, is
until enough people complain,

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.140 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] it won't be done.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.050 align:middle line:84%
But if everyone demands
nutritional therapy,

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.010 align:middle line:90%
it will change.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.232 align:middle line:84%
Right now, if you want
nutritional therapy,

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:40.940 align:middle line:84%
and you go to your
doctor and ask for it,

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.860 align:middle line:84%
it's sort of like ordering chow
mein in a French restaurant.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.250 align:middle line:84%
It's not on the menu, and they
don't know how to make it,

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.210 align:middle line:90%
and you're not going to get it.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.210 align:middle line:84%
So what people need
to do, in my view,

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:57.110 align:middle line:84%
is to become their own case
manager or, as I call it,

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.580 align:middle line:90%
"doctor yourself."

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, the question
is, doctor yourself?

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm not smart
enough to do that.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.250 align:middle line:90%
Well, sure you are.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.790 align:middle line:84%
It is, after all, your
body, and it is not

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:10.730 align:middle line:84%
impossible to learn
about your illness.

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:11.903 align:middle line:90%
Everyone does that.

00:07:11.903 --> 00:07:13.820 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the number-one
search on the internet

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.230 align:middle line:90%
is for an illness.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And when people actually
read with an open mind,

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.910 align:middle line:84%
they will discover
these alternatives.

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.490 align:middle line:84%
We're now finding that
patients are teaching

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.830 align:middle line:90%
the doctors about nutrition.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:31.820 align:middle line:84%
It's likely that most
people you talk to

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:36.080 align:middle line:84%
will know more about therapeutic
nutrition than most doctors

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.910 align:middle line:90%
that you talk to.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:40.280 align:middle line:84%
So here we have the
lay public becoming

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.650 align:middle line:84%
more knowledgeable about
vitamins than the health

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:43.700 align:middle line:90%
professionals.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.500 align:middle line:90%
And that's kind of dumb.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.260 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't make
any sense at all.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:53.570 align:middle line:84%
We have the precedent set by Dr.
Max Gerson, back in the 1930s

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:57.350 align:middle line:84%
and '40s, who showed that
vitamins and especially

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.300 align:middle line:84%
large quantities
of fresh vegetable

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:03.950 align:middle line:84%
juices and organic foods
would help to reverse cancer.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And Gerson had about
a 50% cure rate

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.320 align:middle line:90%
with terminally ill patients.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.180 align:middle line:90%
That's extremely high.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.780 align:middle line:84%
With malignant melanoma, the
Gerson Therapy is spectacular.
