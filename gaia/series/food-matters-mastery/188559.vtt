00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Nobody benefits
from poor health care.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.379 align:middle line:84%
Nobody benefits from
adverse reactions

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.940 align:middle line:90%
to drugs and medicines.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And nobody benefits
from the wrong diagnosis

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.570 align:middle line:90%
and the wrong treatment.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.760 align:middle line:84%
What we need to do
is look at the system

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.780 align:middle line:90%
and try and improve it.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.230 align:middle line:84%
All systems do need improving
and reviewing from time

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.610 align:middle line:90%
to time.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.260 align:middle line:84%
We do need to use surgery and
chemotherapy and radiotherapy

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.300 align:middle line:90%
and drugs.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.770 align:middle line:84%
But we, I think, from the
evidence that's available,

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.595 align:middle line:84%
use it too soon
and too frequently.

00:00:43.595 --> 00:00:44.970 align:middle line:84%
There are many
things that we can

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.670 align:middle line:84%
do for many patients
and individuals

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.060 align:middle line:84%
either in the clinic or in the
hospital that don't require

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.740 align:middle line:90%
drugs and surgery.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And we can prevent a lot
of unnecessary surgery

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.600 align:middle line:84%
and unnecessary prescriptions
if we look at changing a diet,

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.600 align:middle line:84%
doing a bit of exercise, and
looking at natural health

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.489 align:middle line:84%
products or
complementary medicines

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.050 align:middle line:84%
if you like that have some good
scientific evidence for using

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.960 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.002 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example.

00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:14.220 align:middle line:90%


00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.700 align:middle line:84%
In arthritis, the
new breed of drug

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.100 align:middle line:84%
has been called the
COX-2 Inhibitor.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.700 align:middle line:84%
Now these COX-2 Inhibitors
are very powerful drugs.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.690 align:middle line:84%
They're very good
anti-inflammatory drugs,

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.670 align:middle line:84%
they're very good at
reducing pain in arthritis.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.502 align:middle line:84%
However, it's been
shown with some of them

00:01:32.502 --> 00:01:33.960 align:middle line:84%
that they are so
powerful that they

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.460 align:middle line:90%
cause the blood to thicken.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And you end up with a
heart attack or somebody

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.310 align:middle line:90%
with a stroke.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And there has been
some deaths from it.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.560 align:middle line:84%
We know that
turmeric, for example,

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.740 align:middle line:84%
which is a spice, a
bright orange spice.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.550 align:middle line:84%
It contains COX-2 Inhibitors
that do the same thing.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.050 align:middle line:84%
Turmeric has been
used traditionally

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.680 align:middle line:84%
for arthritis and a whole
range of other diseases.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.340 align:middle line:84%
The extracts of turmeric
have the ability

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.230 align:middle line:84%
to inhibit COX, that
is they're COX-2

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.250 align:middle line:90%
Inhibitors like the drugs.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.000 align:middle line:84%
We can make it so that
it's safe, it's effective,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.530 align:middle line:90%
and it is fast acting.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.880 align:middle line:84%
So if it's the
right preparation,

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.470 align:middle line:84%
you can end up using something
that's natural, safe,

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.230 align:middle line:84%
and reliably effective instead
of going to the drug, which

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.680 align:middle line:90%
is more powerful in its effect.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.580 align:middle line:90%
This makes more sense.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.390 align:middle line:84%
But it's not to
say that we don't

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.300 align:middle line:84%
keep the drug on the shelf
and available to people

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.290 align:middle line:84%
who don't respond to the
natural health product.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.040 align:middle line:84%
With regard to the
natural health product,

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.290 align:middle line:90%
it has other benefits as well.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.860 align:middle line:84%
That is what we call a
broad spectrum effect.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.270 align:middle line:84%
So you get some other
benefits from the turmeric

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.930 align:middle line:84%
or the Curcuma
from the turmeric,

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.600 align:middle line:90%
compared to the ordinary drug.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.110 align:middle line:84%
One of them is the management
of psoriasis, which is

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.160 align:middle line:90%
an inflammatory skin condition.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.090 align:middle line:84%
So if you'd had
arthritis and psoriasis,

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.820 align:middle line:84%
you're killing two birds with
the one stone so to speak.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.580 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.430 align:middle line:84%
Peptic ulcers, for
example, gastric ulcers,

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.070 align:middle line:90%
duodenal ulcers.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.140 align:middle line:90%
We've used antacids.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.650 align:middle line:84%
We've used agents to block
the production of acid.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.740 align:middle line:84%
We have used a whole range of
anti-anxiety agents and drugs

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.640 align:middle line:90%
and chemical substances.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And therefore when they fail,
we resort to surgery and cut

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.550 align:middle line:84%
nerves to the stomach and the
duodenum, or even cut it out.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And very rarely
in a hospital does

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.760 align:middle line:84%
a gastric surgeon or
gastroenterologist

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.760 align:middle line:84%
take a history, a dietary
history of the patient

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.010 align:middle line:84%
and find out what
they're eating.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.520 align:middle line:84%
Then somebody discovers
that the ulcers

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.320 align:middle line:84%
are associated with
helicobacter, a bacteria that

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.750 align:middle line:84%
gets in the air and
weakens the stomach lining

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.570 align:middle line:90%
and causes an ulcer.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, my approach to this is you
strengthen up the stomach wall,

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.703 align:middle line:84%
you get rid of the
adverse bacteria,

00:04:07.703 --> 00:04:09.120 align:middle line:84%
and you look at
the patient's diet

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.330 align:middle line:84%
and remove the offending
foods that cause

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.900 align:middle line:90%
inflammation in the stomach.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's well documented
that allergic foods

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.065 align:middle line:90%
can cause inflammation.

00:04:18.065 --> 00:04:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And you eat
something that you're

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.029 align:middle line:84%
allergic to or drink something
you're allergic to, like milk

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:24.000 align:middle line:84%
for example, which
is traditionally

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.328 align:middle line:90%
used to treat ulcers.

00:04:25.328 --> 00:04:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And you're just producing
more inflammation

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.470 align:middle line:90%
in the stomach lining.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Once the inflammation is
there, there is weakness.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.000 align:middle line:84%
The bacteria get there,
they start growing.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.790 align:middle line:84%
You end up with
further weakening

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.182 align:middle line:90%
dead tissue and an ulcer.

00:04:38.182 --> 00:04:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Now the logical thing to
do is to strengthen up

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.940 align:middle line:90%
the stomach wall.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.990 align:middle line:84%
We know we can do that
with vitamin A and zinc

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.680 align:middle line:84%
and vitamin C,
very simple things.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.770 align:middle line:84%
We know that we can modify
the inflammatory response

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.540 align:middle line:84%
with a number of herbs,
licorice is one of them.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And we know that we can
get rid of the bacteria

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.350 align:middle line:84%
with probiotics or
the friendly bacteria.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And we know we can reduce
the inflammation by going off

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.570 align:middle line:84%
the foods that are causing the
problem in the first place.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.380 align:middle line:84%
So one or two
visits to my clinic,

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.310 align:middle line:84%
and people with gastric ulcers
and duodenal ulcers were fixed.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And for 34 years in my clinical
practice, that's the way

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:14.550 align:middle line:90%
we did it.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.650 align:middle line:84%
We never treated
them with a drug.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.327 align:middle line:84%
Yet the drug industry
has changed so many drugs

00:05:19.327 --> 00:05:20.910 align:middle line:84%
in that period of
time, and now people

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.710 align:middle line:84%
are being put on
the triple therapies

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.630 align:middle line:90%
to kill off these bacteria.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening
is the antibiotics,

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.180 align:middle line:84%
because of the overuse
of them, are producing

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.490 align:middle line:90%
antibiotic resistant bacteria.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.820 align:middle line:84%
So antibiotics in the future
are not going to be useful.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore,
all the science

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.220 align:middle line:84%
that's gone into those
with valuable antibiotics

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.040 align:middle line:90%
is going to be wasted.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.185 align:middle line:84%
And we're not going to have too
many more unique antibiotics

00:05:48.185 --> 00:05:49.560 align:middle line:84%
come into the
marketplace the way

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.852 align:middle line:90%
things are going at the moment.

00:05:50.852 --> 00:05:55.830 align:middle line:84%
So really we are not looking
at the cause of the problem.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.750 align:middle line:84%
Certainly looking
at the bacteria

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.260 align:middle line:84%
was closest to the cause of
the problem, but not really

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.910 align:middle line:84%
the underlying cause
of the problem.

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.220 align:middle line:84%
Why were the bacteria
there in the first place?

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.970 align:middle line:84%
Another case comes to mind
of a baby two-year-old child

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.060 align:middle line:84%
readmitted to the children's
hospital on many occasions

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.180 align:middle line:84%
with sterile abscesses,
huge big abscesses

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.650 align:middle line:90%
on the arms and legs and body.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Every time a culture
was made, there

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.070 align:middle line:84%
was no bacteria found at
all in these abscesses.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.820 align:middle line:84%
But the child was undergoing
surgery, incision and drainage

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.370 align:middle line:84%
of the abscesses,
and being discharged.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.690 align:middle line:84%
That child was actually being
fed fortified milk, cow's milk

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:34.950 align:middle line:90%
in the hospital.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.440 align:middle line:84%
That child had an
allergy to cow's milk.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.670 align:middle line:84%
The hospital hadn't
recognized it.

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as that child
went off the fortified milk,

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.090 align:middle line:90%
the abscesses stopped forming.

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.490 align:middle line:84%
All that was happening was
there was a massive challenge

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.440 align:middle line:84%
on that child's immune
system, was producing

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.290 align:middle line:90%
huge amounts of white cells.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And they were depositing
abscesses in the skin.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.760 align:middle line:84%
To me, a serious
case of burying one's

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.830 align:middle line:84%
head in the sand and
back in the days,

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.240 align:middle line:84%
and it's still occurring
in most of the hospitals.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.430 align:middle line:84%
Doctors don't recognize allergy
and sensitivity to foods.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:12.480 align:middle line:84%
In the same hospital, they were
giving children fortified milk

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.190 align:middle line:90%
who had severe eczema.

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:15.910 align:middle line:90%
Take them off the milk.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:20.540 align:middle line:84%
Give them some primrose oil and
some zinc and a few B vitamins.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.420 align:middle line:84%
And their skin dramatically
changes back to normal.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.727 align:middle line:90%


00:07:27.727 --> 00:07:30.310 align:middle line:84%
We've still got a health system
which really is a disease care

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.520 align:middle line:84%
system, and dominated by
doctors, and hospitals,

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.160 align:middle line:84%
pathologists, and
pharmacologists.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And that sort of a system is
going to look after itself.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.948 align:middle line:84%
It wants more work, and it's
not interested in reducing

00:07:43.948 --> 00:07:46.240 align:middle line:84%
the amount, truly not interested
in reducing the amount

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.460 align:middle line:90%
of illness and disease.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.620 align:middle line:84%
The more work they get,
the more profit there is.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And so that's part of
the medical industry.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:55.640 align:middle line:90%
And it does need to be there.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.340 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very important.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:02.080 align:middle line:84%
But we do need to have a
Prime Minister and a Health

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Minister who are
going to take up

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.310 align:middle line:84%
the responsibility
of doing something

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:09.000 align:middle line:90%
about our internal environment.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.053 align:middle line:84%
I'm not just simply talking
about global warming.

00:08:12.053 --> 00:08:13.720 align:middle line:84%
Look how long it took
for the government

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.610 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that
global warming,

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:20.740 align:middle line:84%
despite the fact that
the miner's canary was

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.420 align:middle line:90%
falling over.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And there was scientific
evidence 15 to 20 years ago.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.590 align:middle line:84%
We told the government
25 years ago,

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.830 align:middle line:84%
at least I told the
government 25 years ago,

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:35.500 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to have a
cancer epidemic and an obesity

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:36.510 align:middle line:90%
and diabetes epidemic.

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:37.510 align:middle line:90%
And what do we got now?

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:43.978 align:middle line:84%
We've got a a diabesity, or an
obesity and diabetes epidemic.

00:08:43.978 --> 00:08:45.520 align:middle line:84%
The only change
that's going to occur

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.510 align:middle line:84%
is if there is an established
Center of Excellence

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.600 align:middle line:84%
for health outside of
the Department of Health,

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.500 align:middle line:84%
because that still is
dominated by medical interests.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.470 align:middle line:84%
We need to have a
Center of Excellence

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:04.000 align:middle line:84%
where the experts in health
are gathered together.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.890 align:middle line:90%
Not just the medical doctors.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:09.020 align:middle line:84%
They don't know very
much about health.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.790 align:middle line:84%
They treat high
cholesterol with a drug,

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:14.710 align:middle line:84%
whereas I treat high cholesterol
with some exercise, fish oils,

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:16.600 align:middle line:90%
and a diet.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.350 align:middle line:90%
We need to do it cheaply.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:19.792 align:middle line:90%
We need to do it efficiently.

00:09:19.792 --> 00:09:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And we need to do it with
the best minds and the best

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.500 align:middle line:90%
information that's available.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And we need to
remove the prejudice.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:29.500 align:middle line:84%
We need to remove the
bias from the discussion.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And we need to quell the noise
that comes from the vested

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:34.930 align:middle line:90%
interests.

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And if we establish a
Center of Excellence,

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:40.240 align:middle line:84%
we need a Center of
Excellence in which

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.790 align:middle line:84%
a website can be
established that's got

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:47.590 align:middle line:84%
highly reliable information that
has been derived from doctors

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:50.290 align:middle line:84%
who practice nutritional
medicine, doctors who practice

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:53.340 align:middle line:84%
environmental medicine,
natural therapists who practice

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:55.720 align:middle line:84%
naturopathy,
herbalists who practice

00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:00.130 align:middle line:84%
highly responsible herbal
and scientific and ethical

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:04.150 align:middle line:84%
herbal medicine,
exercise physiologists.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:07.870 align:middle line:84%
We need information
from people who

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:11.530 align:middle line:84%
can give advice on stress
management and working

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:12.730 align:middle line:90%
with the mind.

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And we need to have a part
of our so-called health care

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:21.760 align:middle line:84%
system funding these areas,
whether it be private,

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.980 align:middle line:90%
which is starting to happen.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:26.890 align:middle line:84%
Where alternative practitioners
or complementary medicine

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:29.890 align:middle line:84%
practitioners are being funded
by private health insurance.

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:33.550 align:middle line:84%
We need the government to
fund some of this as well.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:35.410 align:middle line:84%
We need to have
not only a website,

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:37.300 align:middle line:84%
but we need to have
proper education

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:41.200 align:middle line:84%
campaigns, public education
campaigns, public awareness

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.470 align:middle line:90%
campaigns.

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:45.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, the public should
know that 25% of them

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:46.840 align:middle line:90%
are deficient in vitamin D.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And next time they
go to the doctor,

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.343 align:middle line:84%
if they're not tested
for vitamin D deficiency

00:10:50.343 --> 00:10:51.760 align:middle line:84%
and that's corrected,
that they're

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.210 align:middle line:84%
going to end up with arthritis,
osteoporosis, and some cancers.

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:56.245 align:middle line:90%
They need to know that.

00:10:56.245 --> 00:10:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And they need to know
what to do about it.

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.550 align:middle line:84%
They need to know that
every time, they'd

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:03.670 align:middle line:84%
be educated every time you walk
into a restaurant or takeaway

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.950 align:middle line:84%
shop or whatever, you need
to be able to recognize

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:08.050 align:middle line:84%
the foods that are
going to be killing you,

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:10.210 align:middle line:84%
and those foods that are
going to be saving you.

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And to be able to
find a balance and be

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.170 align:middle line:90%
able to make a proper choice.

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:17.800 align:middle line:84%
We need to put taxes on
some ingredients in foods.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.840 align:middle line:84%
We need to put taxes
on cholesterol.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.550 align:middle line:84%
We need to put
more taxes on wine.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:24.370 align:middle line:84%
We need to put more
taxes on alcohol.

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:26.020 align:middle line:84%
We need to put more
taxes on tobacco.

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And we need to do something
about the drug problem.

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:31.190 align:middle line:84%
We need to do something
about the sugar problem.

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:33.430 align:middle line:84%
So these are all part of
the education package.

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:37.630 align:middle line:84%
So education, public
information system, and we

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:40.900 align:middle line:84%
need to have proper
research done and conducted

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.530 align:middle line:90%
by proper researchers.

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:45.760 align:middle line:84%
Research that's being done by
complementary practitioners

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:49.720 align:middle line:84%
in this country at the
moment is rudimentary.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And funding is still
dominated by the interests

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:59.360 align:middle line:84%
that are involved in disease
care and medical care delivery.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.520 align:middle line:90%
We need to separate that.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.550 align:middle line:84%
The two need to
talk to one another,

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:07.600 align:middle line:84%
but health care needs to be
separated from medical care

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.490 align:middle line:90%
and disease care.

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:12.170 align:middle line:90%


00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:14.950 align:middle line:90%
My mother developed diabetes.

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:18.370 align:middle line:84%
So I did a bit of research
in vitamins and diabetes

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:19.990 align:middle line:90%
back in the 70s.

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to reduce
her insulin requirements

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.170 align:middle line:84%
from 80 units a day
to 20 units a day

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:31.030 align:middle line:84%
and turn her into a
happier, healthier person.

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:34.070 align:middle line:90%
So that was the start of it.

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:39.250 align:middle line:84%
But once you start asking
questions, you can't stop.

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's got to a
point where I can't

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:49.540 align:middle line:84%
believe that we have people
who are leaders in our country

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:53.050 align:middle line:84%
who only listen to small
sectors of the community,

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:56.320 align:middle line:84%
and take advice from small
sectors of the community,

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.970 align:middle line:84%
and leave large sections
of the community out of it.

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And there are too many
pecuniary interests involved

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:04.390 align:middle line:90%
in decision making in Canberra.

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.610 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we've got
some very good regulators,

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:09.740 align:middle line:84%
but we have some very
incompetent regulators as well,

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:13.090 align:middle line:90%
and the same with politicians.

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:16.310 align:middle line:84%
They should open up more
to the evidence that's

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:17.110 align:middle line:90%
available to them.

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:20.560 align:middle line:90%


00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:24.630 align:middle line:84%
It comes back to the whole
problem of the global warming.

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:26.863 align:middle line:84%
You know, they
didn't believe it.

00:13:26.863 --> 00:13:28.030 align:middle line:90%
They still don't believe it.

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Now whether man is
contributing to it or not,

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:31.865 align:middle line:90%
it's a fact of life.

00:13:31.865 --> 00:13:32.740 align:middle line:90%
It could be sunspots.

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.270 align:middle line:84%
It could be the
wobble of the earth.

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:36.550 align:middle line:84%
It could be the change
in the orbit that occurs

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:38.170 align:middle line:90%
every half a million years.

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:40.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, but you
know, it's a fact of life.

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:42.043 align:middle line:90%
There are those changes.

00:13:42.043 --> 00:13:43.460 align:middle line:84%
There's a fact of
life in medicine

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:46.480 align:middle line:84%
that if I take your
bone and measure it,

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.060 align:middle line:84%
you've got 5,000
times more lead in it

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:53.980 align:middle line:84%
than you would have if you'd
been an Egyptian Pharaoh.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.020 align:middle line:84%
If I take some fat
samples, you've

00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:00.190 align:middle line:84%
still got DDT, DDE, and
DDD in your fat samples,

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:03.970 align:middle line:84%
even though DDT has been
banned a long time ago, as well

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:05.770 align:middle line:84%
as a whole range
of other chemicals.

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:07.840 align:middle line:84%
But does anybody want
to hear about them?

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:08.890 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:12.020 align:middle line:84%
If I look at your brain
and do a brain biopsy,

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.750 align:middle line:84%
I'll find a large amount
of mercury in your system

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:17.000 align:middle line:84%
if you've had a amalgam
fillings put in your mouth.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.245 align:middle line:84%
You know, what makes amalgam
mercury so much safer when

00:14:20.245 --> 00:14:22.120 align:middle line:84%
you put it into a tooth
compared to when it's

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.713 align:middle line:90%
sitting on a dentist's tray?

00:14:25.713 --> 00:14:27.130 align:middle line:84%
It's highly toxic,
and the dentist

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:30.400 align:middle line:84%
has to handle it as one of the
most toxic substances known

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.270 align:middle line:90%
to man.

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:34.180 align:middle line:84%
But it's made safe when it's
put into your tooth, which

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.070 align:middle line:90%
is nonsense.

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:37.690 align:middle line:84%
Nobody wants to
hear these things.

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:39.070 align:middle line:90%
Nobody wants to really listen.

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:40.955 align:middle line:84%
Nobody wants to believe
that our food chain,

00:14:40.955 --> 00:14:43.330 align:middle line:84%
in spite of the fact that
we've got one of the wealthiest

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:44.830 align:middle line:84%
countries in the
world and we've got

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:47.140 align:middle line:84%
a wonderful agricultural
system, we're

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:50.560 align:middle line:84%
poisoning ourselves with
unbalanced, highly processed,

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.640 align:middle line:84%
high calorie, nutrient
depleted foods,

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.740 align:middle line:90%
ruining our immune systems.

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:58.420 align:middle line:84%
I'll ask one of our
top immunologists

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.850 align:middle line:84%
in this country about the
important role of zinc

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:03.710 align:middle line:90%
in the immune system.

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:06.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he's been a

And in a group of
people, he said,

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:13.890 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Brighthope, if you put zinc
on your Wheaties every morning,

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:15.940 align:middle line:84%
it won't make an
iota of difference

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.357 align:middle line:90%
to your immune system.

00:15:18.357 --> 00:15:20.440 align:middle line:84%
If you go and have a look
at the literature that's

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.200 align:middle line:84%
been published, the
deficiencies of zinc

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.350 align:middle line:84%
are contributing to enormous
problems with immunity.

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And supplementation
will correct it.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:32.290 align:middle line:84%
Now this man is an
eminent scientist

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:34.930 align:middle line:84%
in this country who
believes that the best we've

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:39.790 align:middle line:84%
done for prevention is stopping
smoking, wearing seat belts,

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:42.450 align:middle line:90%
and vaccination.

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:47.022 align:middle line:84%
Exercise and diet don't
come into his equation,

00:15:47.022 --> 00:15:47.855 align:middle line:90%
which is a disgrace.

00:15:47.855 --> 00:15:50.970 align:middle line:90%


00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:52.250 align:middle line:90%
It's really a disgrace.

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:55.200 align:middle line:90%
