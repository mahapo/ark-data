00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Look at the cure, I think,
tells us something of costs.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.960 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Dean Ornish has
done a really good job

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.770 align:middle line:84%
with people who have severe
cardiovascular disease.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And he puts them on
a strict diet, which

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.750 align:middle line:90%
is basically a vegetarian diet.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.260 align:middle line:84%
That means a plant-based
diet, a high fiber diet loaded

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.500 align:middle line:84%
with vitamins and
nutrients and good things

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.250 align:middle line:84%
that grow on the ground
or at least ground

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.920 align:middle line:90%
that's organically tended.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.280 align:middle line:84%
Ornish also has them
do stress reduction.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And these people are
able to arrest or reverse

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:49.440 align:middle line:84%
cardiovascular disease in a
year or two without surgery.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.470 align:middle line:84%
That's impossible,
and yet it isn't.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.230 align:middle line:84%
Ornish has published a number
of papers, a number of books

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.080 align:middle line:90%
on this.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.730 align:middle line:84%
He's a fully
qualified physician.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.420 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he's an eminently
qualified doctor.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And all he's doing is giving
people a plant-based diet

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.460 align:middle line:84%
and having them do
stress reduction.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And these people are
arresting and reversing

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.580 align:middle line:84%
cardiovascular disease, that
kind of cardiovascular disease

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.160 align:middle line:84%
that would normally
require open heart surgery,

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.235 align:middle line:84%
that would require
multiple bypass grafts.

00:01:20.235 --> 00:01:22.740 align:middle line:90%


00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.590 align:middle line:90%
Did I mention it was safer?

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.860 align:middle line:90%
Did I mention it was cheaper?

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.110 align:middle line:90%
And it works very well.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.980 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, why don't
all cardiologists

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.180 align:middle line:90%
recommend this approach?

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, in fairness, not all
of them have studied it.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.180 align:middle line:84%
In fairness, not all their
patients would do it.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And in fairness,
the drug companies

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.220 align:middle line:90%
have something to say about it.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.700 align:middle line:84%
Did you notice there are
no drugs in there at all?

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.930 align:middle line:84%
There's just no
drug therapy at all.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.530 align:middle line:84%
It's just meditation
and vegetarian diet.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.020 align:middle line:90%
There's no profit in this.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.790 align:middle line:84%
So the money is in disease,
cardiovascular disease

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.770 align:middle line:90%
the number one killer.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.570 align:middle line:90%
It isn't cancer.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:09.990 align:middle line:90%
It's cardiovascular disease.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.890 align:middle line:84%
It's the number one
killer of women, too.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.710 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not breast cancer.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.300 align:middle line:90%
It's cardiovascular disease.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.890 align:middle line:84%
Women just die of cardiovascular
disease a little older

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:18.690 align:middle line:90%
than men do.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.870 align:middle line:84%
But cardiovascular disease
is the number one killer.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.975 align:middle line:84%
In fact, about
half of all deaths

00:02:23.975 --> 00:02:26.420 align:middle line:90%
are from cardiovascular disease.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And in half of those deaths,
the first symptom is death.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.790 align:middle line:84%
So people can go
through their life

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.330 align:middle line:84%
for decades with no symptoms
at all and then drop dead.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And then of course,
it's too late.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.290 align:middle line:90%
It's too late for a drug.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.760 align:middle line:90%
It's too late for a bypass.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.200 align:middle line:90%
It's too late for the ambulance.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.180 align:middle line:90%
It's too late for resuscitation.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.030 align:middle line:84%
The only way to
win is not to play.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And that requires that
they change their life.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And Ornish has shown that
cardiovascular disease

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.650 align:middle line:90%
is a disease of civilization.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.830 align:middle line:84%
It is a lifestyle
disease, because we're

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.250 align:middle line:84%
eating too much of the
wrong thing and not enough

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.340 align:middle line:90%
of the right thing.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.020 align:middle line:90%
And your grandmother said it.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.670 align:middle line:90%
And her grandmother said it.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.560 align:middle line:90%
And everybody knows it's true.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.840 align:middle line:84%
But instead, it's fast food
and meat and fat and sugar

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.200 align:middle line:84%
and starch and processed
food that has few vitamins.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And don't take
vitamin supplements

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.520 align:middle line:90%
because they might hurt you.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.100 align:middle line:84%
Of course, cardiovascular
disease, that's not the risk.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.520 align:middle line:90%
We have to change this around.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.320 align:middle line:84%
The solution to
cardiovascular disease

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.040 align:middle line:90%
is embarrassingly simple.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.650 align:middle line:84%
If we look at
animal research, we

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.960 align:middle line:84%
know how to make an
animal get a heart attack.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.110 align:middle line:84%
We know how to make an animal
have hardened arteries,

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.190 align:middle line:90%
clogged arteries.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.210 align:middle line:90%
It's true with people.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.860 align:middle line:90%
This is not new knowledge.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.630 align:middle line:84%
Doctors Wilfred
and Evan Shute were

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.660 align:middle line:84%
reversing cardiovascular
disease with vitamin E,

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.510 align:middle line:84%
E as in Edward,
back in the 1930s.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.420 align:middle line:84%
Before Pearl Harbor,
the Shutes were

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.680 align:middle line:84%
treating cardiovascular disease
with wheat germ oil and then

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.720 align:middle line:90%
with purified vitamin E.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.510 align:middle line:84%
And then in the '40s
and '50s, the Shutes

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.350 align:middle line:84%
were treating all kinds of
other illnesses with vitamin E.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And then in around 1960, the
United States Post Office

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:17.089 align:middle line:84%
convicted them of mail fraud
for mailing vitamin E to people.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:20.540 align:middle line:84%
The fact that it was
curing people for decades

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.900 align:middle line:90%
did not really seem to matter.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.130 align:middle line:84%
But the audacity of sending 30
international unit vitamin E

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.670 align:middle line:84%
capsules through the
mail, that was naughty.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Dying from
cardiovascular disease,

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.710 align:middle line:84%
our government has nothing
but sympathy for the people

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.480 align:middle line:90%
who are dead.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.210 align:middle line:84%
But now if you want
to try and cure it,

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.800 align:middle line:90%
no one is going to help you.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.670 align:middle line:84%
Physicians have been taught that
nutrients are not scientific.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:47.630 align:middle line:90%
They're not medical.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.040 align:middle line:90%
They're not therapeutic.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And high doses, the doses
that work, are rarely tested.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.490 align:middle line:84%
When nutrients are
tested as therapy,

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.020 align:middle line:90%
they use very low doses.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
public and physicians

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.180 align:middle line:84%
see all these research papers
that show ambiguous results.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.570 align:middle line:84%
One study is published and says,
vitamins help a little bit.

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.640 align:middle line:84%
Another study is
published that says,

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.130 align:middle line:90%
vitamins don't help very much.

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And you have this
back and forth.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.640 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is because
all of those studies

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.920 align:middle line:90%
are low dose studies.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:25.670 align:middle line:84%
The Shutes were using 1,600
to 3,600 international units

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.520 align:middle line:90%
of vitamin E a day.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.630 align:middle line:84%
In the most perfectly
designed diet,

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.450 align:middle line:84%
you can't possibly get more
than 100 units of vitamin E.

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And that would be
almost impossible to do.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.910 align:middle line:84%
You'd have to consume a lot
of olive oil, a lot of nuts,

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.210 align:middle line:90%
a lot of sprouted grains.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.120 align:middle line:84%
To say that the cure for
cardiovascular disease

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.060 align:middle line:84%
is something along the line
of eating right and taking

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.220 align:middle line:90%
vitamins is new knowledge.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.690 align:middle line:90%
But that's the answer.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.520 align:middle line:84%
The cause of
cardiovascular disease,

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.330 align:middle line:84%
therefore, is a failure to
take the vitamins and a failure

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:57.380 align:middle line:90%
to eat right.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.630 align:middle line:84%
The good news is
that even people

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.110 align:middle line:84%
with advanced cardiovascular
disease, when they start

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.570 align:middle line:84%
taking the nutrients and
they change their diet,

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.010 align:middle line:84%
they can arrest it or
reverse it without surgery.

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.000 align:middle line:90%
