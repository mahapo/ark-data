00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>> The perfect drug from the
point of view of a drug company

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.560 align:middle line:84%
is one, first of all,
that doesn't kill people

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.010 align:middle line:84%
because you-- people need to
take the drug for a long period

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.350 align:middle line:84%
of time in order for
it to be profitable.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.980 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, it needs
to be patentable,

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.490 align:middle line:84%
which means that the drug
company has exclusive right

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.853 align:middle line:84%
to sell it, and it can market
it at a much higher price, which

00:00:33.853 --> 00:00:36.270 align:middle line:84%
means that there are large
numbers of drugs which may well

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.820 align:middle line:84%
be perfectly useful,
but no one is

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.230 align:middle line:84%
going to do research on them
because they're out of patent.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.190 align:middle line:84%
And thirdly, it must
be reasonably safe.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.450 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, what
we've seen is the drug

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.300 align:middle line:84%
companies are not too
concerned about the side

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.100 align:middle line:90%
effects of drugs.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.780 align:middle line:84%
Because the feeling is that,
by the time that the side

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.860 align:middle line:84%
effects become obvious, the drug
has usually run out of patent,

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.930 align:middle line:84%
and so it's not too
much of a problem.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.530 align:middle line:90%
And you can see the--

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.080 align:middle line:84%
this happening in
drugs like the SSRIs,

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.860 align:middle line:84%
the antidepressant
drugs, where it's now

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.380 align:middle line:84%
emerging that there are
problems with suicide

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.180 align:middle line:90%
and with addiction.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And there have been
court cases on where

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.880 align:middle line:84%
people have sued the dru--
the manufacturers over them.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.980 align:middle line:84%
But in the meantime,
the drug company--

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.550 align:middle line:84%
that the drug has racked up
enormous amounts of money.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And the problems
with side effects

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.470 align:middle line:84%
are really just kind of
operating costs, the kind

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.320 align:middle line:84%
of things that you factor in and
you don't worry about too much.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Because the main aim is to get
the drug out there and it be--

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.910 align:middle line:84%
gets to be used by as
many people as possible.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who's
interested in producing

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.865 align:middle line:84%
a nonpatentable
medical treatment,

00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:57.240 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking
about something

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.270 align:middle line:84%
like fish oils, or vitamins,
or minerals, or any other--

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.190 align:middle line:84%
breathing techniques,
any other kind

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.090 align:middle line:84%
of way of dealing
with people's illness,

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.030 align:middle line:84%
the major problem with it
is that it's not patentable.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.245 align:middle line:84%
You can't say, I have
invented this new treatment,

00:02:16.245 --> 00:02:20.880 align:middle line:84%
and no one else can use it, and
I can charge large sums for it.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.970 align:middle line:84%
In the case of perhaps
diabetes, well,

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.610 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of evidence to
show that if you put people

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:33.840 align:middle line:84%
on a low glycemic diet and you
give them certain supplements

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.000 align:middle line:84%
that you can bring
down their blood sugar,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.600 align:middle line:84%
and they will be
enormously improved.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.890 align:middle line:84%
One of the other big problems
with the drug approach

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.330 align:middle line:84%
is the issue of side effects,
adverse drug reactions.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.340 align:middle line:84%
Just for a start, in the UK,
the generally accepted figure

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.220 align:middle line:84%
of the number of people
who die each year

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.710 align:middle line:84%
as a result of adverse drug
reactions is about 10,000.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.820 align:middle line:84%
To put that in some
sort of perspective,

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.250 align:middle line:84%
the number of people who
die from motor car accidents

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.290 align:middle line:90%
is about 3,500.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.740 align:middle line:84%
We're all very worried
about motor car accidents.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.070 align:middle line:84%
We don't seem to be so worried
about adverse drug reactions.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.130 align:middle line:84%
The number of people who die
as a result of prostate cancer,

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.070 align:middle line:84%
which is of enormous
concern, and we

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.600 align:middle line:84%
have campaigns, and so
on, is round about 9,000

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.820 align:middle line:90%
in this country.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.900 align:middle line:84%
So the number of
people killed by drug--

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.710 align:middle line:84%
adverse drug reactions is
really quite significantly high.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
factor into that

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.850 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be probably
four or five times that many

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.740 align:middle line:84%
affected but they're
not actually killed,

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.323 align:middle line:84%
but they're just made rather ill
and have to go into hospital,

00:03:46.323 --> 00:03:48.750 align:middle line:84%
and so on, and then
you add into that that

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.130 align:middle line:84%
as a general rule,
which has been accepted

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:59.130 align:middle line:84%
by all sorts of studies, the
proportion of adverse drug

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.200 align:middle line:84%
reactions which are
actually reported

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.510 align:middle line:84%
runs at somewhere
between 1% and 10%.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.030 align:middle line:84%
So if we've got figures of
10,000 people being killed,

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.510 align:middle line:84%
it's almost certain that it's
considerably more than that.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.940 align:middle line:84%
So that is your
baseline is that we

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.990 align:middle line:84%
have a large number of people
being damaged by drugs.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.820 align:middle line:84%
The doctors will tell
you that the drugs

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.010 align:middle line:90%
have been trialed and tested.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.120 align:middle line:84%
But what you have to realize
when you take a new drug

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.910 align:middle line:84%
is that you're
essentially embarking

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.450 align:middle line:90%
on an uncontrolled experiment.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.580 align:middle line:84%
The drugs will only
have been tested

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.050 align:middle line:84%
for the purposes of getting
their license on maybe a few--

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.950 align:middle line:84%
on a few hundred, at most
a few thousand people.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And they are then going to be
given to literally to millions.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And within those
millions of people,

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.790 align:middle line:84%
there is going to be an
enormous range of the way

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.120 align:middle line:84%
that their systems work, the way
that they react to the drugs.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And so people are going
to have side effects.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And nobody knows who's going
to be damaged by those side

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.780 align:middle line:84%
effects or what
they-- what they're

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.370 align:middle line:84%
going to be until the drug has
been out there in the market

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:08.660 align:middle line:90%
for several years.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And then you have a
system of reporting

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.480 align:middle line:84%
which only picks up 5% or
10% of these side effects.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And you have a problem
with a large number

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.340 align:middle line:84%
of people having difficulties
with the drugs which

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.190 align:middle line:90%
are not even recognized.

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.980 align:middle line:84%
An essential part of
any drug is that it's--

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.680 align:middle line:84%
because it's targeting
a single pathway

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.920 align:middle line:84%
in a complicated system, it's
going to mess up other pathways

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.590 align:middle line:90%
to a greater or lesser degree.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.460 align:middle line:90%
And that's just inevitable.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.200 align:middle line:84%
The great advantage of
the nondrug approach

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.520 align:middle line:84%
is that it uses body
systems which are--

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.460 align:middle line:84%
were designed-- we are
designed to work in that way.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.780 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you take
something like hypertension,

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.940 align:middle line:84%
there is a complicated
system to do with breathing.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.370 align:middle line:84%
If you breathe in a certain
way, in a certain rhythm, which

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.640 align:middle line:84%
is a rhythm actually which is
rather similar to what you get

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.970 align:middle line:84%
with chanting, in
long traditions

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.280 align:middle line:84%
of religious chanting,
it gets people

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.170 align:middle line:84%
to breathe in a
particular way, which

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.560 align:middle line:84%
brings into sync both
your heart rhythms

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:21.650 align:middle line:84%
and the rhythms that are
controlling your blood

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.150 align:middle line:90%
pressure.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And you can bring down
blood pressure simply

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.680 align:middle line:90%
by this form of breathing.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.760 align:middle line:84%
But who is going to
run large-scale trials

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.710 align:middle line:84%
on religious
breathing techniques

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.890 align:middle line:84%
in order to bring down your
hypertension levels when you

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.350 align:middle line:84%
can make billions of pounds
by selling them hypertension

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.960 align:middle line:84%
medication, which almost
certainly will have effect

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.940 align:middle line:90%
on other pathways in the body.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.170 align:middle line:84%
One of the big myths
which is peddled

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.980 align:middle line:84%
in relation to
drug-based medicine

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.740 align:middle line:90%
is that it's firmly scientific.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.440 align:middle line:84%
It certainly has a lot of
the trappings of science.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.660 align:middle line:84%
There are large-scale
trials that

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.090 align:middle line:90%
are written up in journals.

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And we have a lot of evidence
that they perform more

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:09.980 align:middle line:90%
effectively than a placebo.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.940 align:middle line:84%
But the idea that
all drugs are firmly

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:18.680 align:middle line:84%
based in the evidence and
all of the nondrug treatments

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.510 align:middle line:84%
are just a mixture of hope, and
delusion, and placebo effect,

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:27.320 align:middle line:84%
and charlatans just doesn't
really stand up to examination.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:33.680 align:middle line:84%
For example, in order for
a drug to be licensed,

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:38.630 align:middle line:84%
it has to show that it is more
effective than a placebo in two

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:39.430 align:middle line:90%
trials.

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:41.597 align:middle line:84%
This doesn't mean to say
that the drug company can't

00:07:41.597 --> 00:07:43.490 align:middle line:84%
do lots of other trials
in which it doesn't

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:45.027 align:middle line:90%
prove to be more effective.

00:07:45.027 --> 00:07:46.610 align:middle line:84%
It just doesn't need
to publish those.

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.370 align:middle line:84%
What it needs to do is to go
along to the regulator and say,

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:52.400 align:middle line:84%
we have these two trials
which show that the drug is

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.110 align:middle line:90%
more effective than a placebo.

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:56.540 align:middle line:84%
Can we have a license
to market it, please?

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And assuming that
all goes well, they

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:00.530 align:middle line:90%
get their license to market.

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:02.990 align:middle line:84%
So you then have
an official license

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.130 align:middle line:84%
to use that drug for a
particular treatment.

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.430 align:middle line:84%
It may be to lower
blood pressure.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:10.910 align:middle line:84%
It may be to low
cholesterol, so on.

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And then that is what we
call evidence-based medicine.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.270 align:middle line:84%
There is evidence that
this treatment works

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:19.280 align:middle line:84%
to do a particular
thing, and that's

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.950 align:middle line:84%
why we know that
drug-based medicine is

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:22.920 align:middle line:90%
based on the evidence.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, there was a
trial, a study that

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.600 align:middle line:84%
came out about 18
months ago which

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.260 align:middle line:84%
looked at the extent to
which doctors in America

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:39.890 align:middle line:84%
prescribe drugs for what they
had received their license for.

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And they found that 20% of
the prescriptions written

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:50.540 align:middle line:84%
by doctors were not
for the condition

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.460 align:middle line:84%
that the drug had been
given the license for.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And this is called
"off-label prescribing."

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
useful thing to do.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.320 align:middle line:84%
It's a perfectly legitimate
part of medical practice

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.550 align:middle line:90%
is you have a patient.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:04.280 align:middle line:84%
They haven't responded
to various other drugs.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.690 align:middle line:84%
You say, well, we'll
try this oth-- this one.

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:07.760 align:middle line:90%
It may be a new drug.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.770 align:middle line:84%
It hasn't had a license
for this condition.

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Or it may be an
older drug, but it

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.970 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have it specifically,
but it might work.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.770 align:middle line:84%
There's good
scientific reasons why

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:17.570 align:middle line:84%
we think it's targeting
the same pathways.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:20.960 align:middle line:84%
It might work--
perfectly legitimate.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.460 align:middle line:84%
But the analysis that the
authors of this research

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:30.350 align:middle line:84%
then went on to point out that
in 70% of this, these cases

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:33.090 align:middle line:84%
where the drugs were
licensed without--

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:34.940 align:middle line:84%
the drugs were
prescribed without having

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:38.280 align:middle line:84%
a proper license,
in 70% of the cases,

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.160 align:middle line:84%
there was no scientific
evidence that this

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.490 align:middle line:90%
would do any good whatsoever.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And I came across a particularly
striking example of this,

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:50.330 align:middle line:84%
what's called
"off-label prescribing,"

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:55.280 align:middle line:84%
here in the UK where I was
looking at what was happening

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.960 align:middle line:90%
to people with dementia.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.597 align:middle line:84%
Alzheimer's the
best known example,

00:10:00.597 --> 00:10:02.180 align:middle line:84%
but there are other
forms of dementia.

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's obviously in
all Western countries

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:05.570 align:middle line:90%
a big problem.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:08.600 align:middle line:84%
We have something
like 700,000 people

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.840 align:middle line:84%
in this country who have been
diagnosed with having dementia.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And I found that something
like 200,000 of them,

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:21.170 align:middle line:84%
so about over a third of them,
were receiving drugs which

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:23.390 align:middle line:90%
are antipsychotic medication.

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.300 align:middle line:84%
These are very
heavy tranquilizers

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.790 align:middle line:84%
which are officially
licensed to treat people

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:31.870 align:middle line:84%
with schizophrenia, I
think, bipolar disorder,

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:35.350 align:middle line:84%
but that they have a range of
very unpleasant side effects.

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:38.500 align:middle line:84%
They cause muscular tension
and a shuffling gait,

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:44.380 align:middle line:84%
and they also do terrible
things to your metabolism,

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:48.100 align:middle line:84%
and they cause people to put
on weight at a fantastic rate.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:51.085 align:middle line:84%
And they can lead to
early signs of diabetes.

00:10:51.085 --> 00:10:53.890 align:middle line:90%


00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:57.340 align:middle line:84%
These drugs have
never been licensed

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:00.190 align:middle line:90%
for use in dementia patients.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:03.340 align:middle line:84%
There are no trials, large
scale or small scale,

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.320 align:middle line:84%
showing that dementia
patients benefit

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.670 align:middle line:90%
from being given these drugs.

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:09.070 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there have
been several warnings

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:12.550 align:middle line:84%
issued by the regulatory bodies
saying that they should not

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:16.030 align:middle line:84%
be used on dementia patients
because they increase

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:19.490 align:middle line:84%
their risk of having
strokes or heart attacks.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but
the one justification

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.700 align:middle line:84%
for using it which is
sometimes used by commissions

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:28.870 align:middle line:84%
is they say, well, they are
useful to control behavior

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:32.230 align:middle line:84%
in the case of people who, these
patients, they get agitated.

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:33.040 align:middle line:90%
They get upset.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.498 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know
where they are,

00:11:34.498 --> 00:11:36.250 align:middle line:84%
and these drugs
are useful to help

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:38.020 align:middle line:90%
with their behavioral problems.

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:41.470 align:middle line:84%
There have been now been two
large-scale, double-blind,

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:43.960 align:middle line:84%
placebo, proper
scientific trials showing

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.500 align:middle line:90%
that this is not the case.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.950 align:middle line:84%
These drugs are not
beneficial for treat--

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:49.690 align:middle line:90%
for treating behavior.

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:52.630 align:middle line:84%
So we have drugs which
are known to be dangerous,

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:55.030 align:middle line:84%
which are not licensed,
which have studies

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:57.160 align:middle line:90%
showing that they don't work.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And yet they are being
prescribed to 200,000

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.170 align:middle line:90%
elderly people in this country.

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And this is what's called
"scientific medicine."
