00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:07.780 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.990 align:middle line:84%
>> If someone had
cancer, if I had cancer,

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.170 align:middle line:84%
if a family member had cancer,
the first thing that I would

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.170 align:middle line:84%
recommend that they do is
get on the Gerson program,

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.590 align:middle line:84%
which is basically a
glass of fresh, raw,

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.350 align:middle line:84%
organic vegetable
juice about every hour,

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.550 align:middle line:84%
around eight to 15 glasses
of vegetable juice a day.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.490 align:middle line:84%
Very high in antioxidants,
this is a liver cleansing,

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.940 align:middle line:84%
body cleansing
detoxification program.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.830 align:middle line:84%
In addition to that, it's very
high in vitamins, and minerals,

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:37.630 align:middle line:90%
and nutrients.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.922 align:middle line:84%
Things we don't even know
are in these good vegetables.

00:00:39.922 --> 00:00:42.640 align:middle line:84%
But just to take an
example, carrots,

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.500 align:middle line:84%
and not only orange
vegetables, but also

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.110 align:middle line:84%
green vegetables are
high in the carotenes.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.140 align:middle line:90%
Tomatoes are high in lycopene.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.060 align:middle line:90%
These are cancer fighters.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.590 align:middle line:84%
Broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower,
kale, the cruciform vegetables

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.430 align:middle line:84%
are very high in sulforaphane
and other chemicals,

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.349 align:middle line:84%
which actually make
cancer cells want to die.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:08.980 align:middle line:84%
So when people
consume these juices,

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.020 align:middle line:84%
they are doing
something very positive

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.060 align:middle line:84%
to strengthen their
body and to kill cancer.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.370 align:middle line:84%
Cancer patients should
avoid salt. Again,

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.690 align:middle line:84%
this is Dr. Max Gerson's view,
that the cancer cells love

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.540 align:middle line:84%
salt. Vegetables and
plant-based foods

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.910 align:middle line:84%
are very high in
potassium, processed foods

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.430 align:middle line:84%
are very high in
salt, end of story.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.290 align:middle line:84%
As soon as we eat right and
avoid a lot of processed foods,

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.120 align:middle line:84%
we immediately
make it more likely

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.410 align:middle line:90%
that you're going to live.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Intravenous vitamin
C, as developed

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.130 align:middle line:84%
by Dr. Riordan and
his colleagues,

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.180 align:middle line:84%
of 50,000 to 100,000 milligrams
of vitamin C every other day

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.560 align:middle line:84%
for two weeks, followed by
maintained oral doses of 50,000

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.030 align:middle line:84%
to 100,000 milligrams
orally in divided doses,

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.380 align:middle line:90%
to bowel tolerance.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And bowel tolerance is
exactly what you think it is.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.520 align:middle line:84%
You take as much
as you can hold,

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.180 align:middle line:84%
but not so much as gives
you too loose bowels.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.310 align:middle line:84%
Vitamin C builds
the immune system.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.440 align:middle line:84%
It strengthens
good cells, builds

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.270 align:middle line:90%
collagen between the cells.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.070 align:middle line:90%
It's an antitoxin.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And it also improves
mood and appetite.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.970 align:middle line:84%
Vitamin C is
inexpensive and safe.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.400 align:middle line:84%
Vegetable juices are not
particularly inexpensive,

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.670 align:middle line:84%
but they're a whole
lot cheaper than chemo.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.190 align:middle line:84%
In addition to that very
high doses of selenium

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.050 align:middle line:84%
should be taken by
a cancer patient.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's generally assumed
that selenium is very toxic.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.890 align:middle line:84%
It is toxic relative
to the amount you need.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.120 align:middle line:90%
Selenium is a trace mineral.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.930 align:middle line:84%
If you take bottles and
bottles of selenium,

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.250 align:middle line:90%
you can have toxicity.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.280 align:middle line:84%
But there are doctors
that are giving

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.970 align:middle line:84%
1,000 or 2,000 micrograms
of selenium a day.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.480 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, 500 to 800
micrograms of selenium a day

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.730 align:middle line:84%
for a cancer patient
is a good idea.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.730 align:middle line:84%
There is a direct correlation
between populations that

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.650 align:middle line:90%
live in parts of the globe.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Where selenium levels
in the soil are low,

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.950 align:middle line:90%
the cancer rates are high.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.740 align:middle line:84%
Where selenium content
of soils is high,

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.270 align:middle line:90%
cancer rates are lower.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.530 align:middle line:84%
So this is very
simple, simple to do.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.020 align:middle line:84%
To get selenium, people
can take a supplement.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.080 align:middle line:84%
That they can consume
Brewer's yeast.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And there are other
sources that they can use.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.490 align:middle line:90%
In addition to that--

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.360 align:middle line:84%
well, that would be a good
start for almost anyone.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.030 align:middle line:84%
I had a client who
was a dry cleaner.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.180 align:middle line:84%
He owned a chain, in fact, of
dry cleaning establishments.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.580 align:middle line:90%
And he had cancer of the liver.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.070 align:middle line:84%
Tragically, this is
a very clear example

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.800 align:middle line:84%
of how industrial chemicals,
environmental chemicals,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.620 align:middle line:90%
can cause cancer.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.430 align:middle line:90%
He came to see me.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And he wondered if
anything could be done.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.210 align:middle line:84%
He was told that there
was no hope for him,

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.390 align:middle line:90%
that they could not use surgery.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean they can't
take your liver out.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.840 align:middle line:84%
They could not treat
it with radiation,

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.030 align:middle line:90%
could not treat it with chemo.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And a transplant I
guess involved time.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.600 align:middle line:84%
You know how long it can
take I guess to provide that.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.470 align:middle line:84%
So I said to him,
there is no downside

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.700 align:middle line:90%
to trying the Gerson therapy.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean the vegetable
juices can't kill you.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.100 align:middle line:84%
There's really no way you can
hurt yourself with produce.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.130 align:middle line:84%
So why not get going on
that and see how you feel?

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And start taking your
vitamins and see how you feel?

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.370 align:middle line:84%
The upshot was he did a modified
version of the Gerson program.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.380 align:middle line:90%
He didn't even do half of it.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.240 align:middle line:84%
But he did drink a lot
of vegetable juices.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And he did take a
lot of vitamins.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And he and his family started
going on world cruises,

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.420 align:middle line:90%
and tours, and traveling.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.550 align:middle line:90%
And he did this for years.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.100 align:middle line:84%
He was supposed to be dead
in three to six months.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.300 align:middle line:84%
But for years, he and his
family kept traveling.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And for him, every
week was a gift.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.285 align:middle line:84%
So they just went,
and went, and went.

00:04:54.285 --> 00:04:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And he took his juice
with him and all.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And he lived much, much
longer than anyone expected.

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And no one even
knew he had cancer.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.460 align:middle line:90%
And then eventually he died.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.620 align:middle line:84%
So he had longer life and
better quality of life.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.580 align:middle line:90%
We want cure.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.100 align:middle line:90%
Cure is best.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.460 align:middle line:84%
But there's something to be
said for longer life and better

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.750 align:middle line:90%
quality of life.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.430 align:middle line:90%
And I'm very sure--

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.920 align:middle line:84%
and I've seen this
for three decades--

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.690 align:middle line:84%
that using vitamin supplements,
high doses in nutrition,

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.680 align:middle line:84%
using vegetable juices,
these very prosaic,

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.440 align:middle line:84%
unromantic therapies, very
simple, very safe, almost

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:40.030 align:middle line:84%
old-fashioned, I have never seen
them not help a cancer patient.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.810 align:middle line:84%
Everyone that I've worked
with has said to me,

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.820 align:middle line:84%
and their doctors,
their oncologists,

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.830 align:middle line:84%
have also said that they are the
healthiest sick people they've

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:50.745 align:middle line:90%
ever seen.

00:05:50.745 --> 00:05:51.835 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:51.835 --> 00:05:52.710 align:middle line:90%
And they live longer.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.030 align:middle line:90%
And they feel better.

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.770 align:middle line:84%
So this is where I would
focus the attention.

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:04.080 align:middle line:84%
I had another client who was
a rather famous sports coach.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And it was almost
exactly the same.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.050 align:middle line:90%
He had cancer.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.220 align:middle line:90%
And there was no hope.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And they told him
there was no hope.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.303 align:middle line:84%
And they told him
he was going to die.

00:06:11.303 --> 00:06:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And they told him it would be
a matter of less than a year.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.300 align:middle line:84%
So he wondered, like any
sensible person would,

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.530 align:middle line:90%
have I missed something?

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, did they
tell you about vegetable juices

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.070 align:middle line:90%
and vitamins?

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And he said no, but
I'm open to anything.

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.700 align:middle line:84%
He was not in any
way going to lose

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.990 align:middle line:90%
this game if he could help it.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.640 align:middle line:84%
So I suggested to him that he
drank lots of vegetable juices,

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.710 align:middle line:84%
and eat a really good
diet, and lots of fiber,

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.540 align:middle line:84%
and take large
quantities of vitamins,

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.130 align:middle line:84%
as Linus Pauling,
and Abraham Hoffer,

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:39.782 align:middle line:90%
and others have indicated.

00:06:39.782 --> 00:06:40.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm not making this stuff up.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.810 align:middle line:84%
I am not smart enough
to make this up.

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:44.430 align:middle line:84%
But I am just
barely smart enough

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.770 align:middle line:84%
to know that these
doctors, these clinicians,

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.790 align:middle line:84%
these researchers, can't
all be a bunch of dummies.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:52.290 align:middle line:90%
They can't all be wrong.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:54.030 align:middle line:90%
So we distill this down.

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And the bottom line is,
take lots of vitamins

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.440 align:middle line:90%
and eat a good diet.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.150 align:middle line:90%
There is no downside to that.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:01.260 align:middle line:90%
So he did.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And he lived much, much
longer than anyone thought.

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.060 align:middle line:90%
And nobody knew he was sick.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.680 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I was at
a grocery store

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.240 align:middle line:90%
one day, talking to the manager.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And the manager, who didn't
know that this sports

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.300 align:middle line:84%
coach had been my
client, said to me

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.970 align:middle line:90%
did you hear so-and-so died?
