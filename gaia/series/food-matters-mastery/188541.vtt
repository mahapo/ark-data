00:00:03.848 --> 00:00:08.660 align:middle line:90%


00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.100 align:middle line:90%
>> I was in Peru recently.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And I was staying
at a friend's house.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And a group of young
people came over.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.010 align:middle line:90%
And they had kids with them.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And they were financially
not very well off.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.365 align:middle line:84%
And I could clearly see that
their intention was right.

00:00:23.365 --> 00:00:25.490 align:middle line:84%
These were individuals who
wanted to be vegetarian.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.670 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to have
a right relationship

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.520 align:middle line:84%
with plants, and with
animals, and with everybody.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And I could see that financial
challenges had actually

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.360 align:middle line:84%
probably led them to not
really being able to access

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.370 align:middle line:90%
a holistic nutrition program.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And I had the
incredible opportunity

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.692 align:middle line:84%
of feeding my
chocolate to a child.

00:00:45.692 --> 00:00:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And I knew it was the first
time in that child's life

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.680 align:middle line:84%
that they'd ever had
something like that.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.270 align:middle line:90%
And it was beyond incredible.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.910 align:middle line:84%
It was beyond
incredible because you

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.800 align:middle line:84%
could see what happened
moment to moment, not

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.810 align:middle line:84%
only in the child's mind,
that flavor experience.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, all
these thoughts came in.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.960 align:middle line:84%
But then physically,
that level of nutrition,

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.950 align:middle line:84%
to suddenly go from kind of poor
nutrition to rich nutrition,

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.180 align:middle line:84%
how it filled in gaps
instantly in that child's diet

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.110 align:middle line:90%
and nutritional requirements.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.540 align:middle line:84%
That is to me what
it's all about.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.070 align:middle line:84%
It's about touching people's
lives in a real way.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.890 align:middle line:84%
Touching kids' lives wherever
they are at in their journey.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.140 align:middle line:84%
Just because I'm an expert in
organic and raw foods and herbs

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.530 align:middle line:84%
and that kind of thing, I
don't expect anyone else to be.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.710 align:middle line:84%
My job is to take the
best that I know and feed

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.100 align:middle line:84%
it to the business leaders of
the world, who are too busy

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.900 align:middle line:90%
doing what they do.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.920 align:middle line:84%
They don't have time
to think about food.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.940 align:middle line:84%
They just call me up and say
look, you figure it out for me.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.097 align:middle line:90%
This is the calls I get.

00:01:54.097 --> 00:01:56.180 align:middle line:84%
People call me up and they
say look, I'm too busy.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.490 align:middle line:90%
You figure it out for me.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.550 align:middle line:90%
Just send me the stuff.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.750 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what to do.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.130 align:middle line:90%
That's the program that I'm on.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.120 align:middle line:90%
That's what I do for people.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.287 align:middle line:90%
And we just send it to them.

00:02:03.287 --> 00:02:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And then the feedback that we
get is incredible because what

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:14.500 align:middle line:84%
it is is something that we
actually cannot put into words.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Let's do a little
imaginative exercise.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.250 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that we never actually
in our whole life ever

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.490 align:middle line:84%
had the exact correct
food for ourselves.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.430 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that our parents
never had that either.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.320 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that our
great-grandparents never

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.490 align:middle line:90%
had it, even going back.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.133 align:middle line:84%
That we never really had it
completely dialed in perfectly.

00:02:35.133 --> 00:02:36.800 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we had enough
nutrition so we could

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.080 align:middle line:90%
go through the life cycle.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.180 align:middle line:84%
It reminds me of
this salamander.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.940 align:middle line:84%
There's a type of
salamander that

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.070 align:middle line:84%
can actually go through
its complete life

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.430 align:middle line:90%
cycle in the tadpole stage.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.030 align:middle line:84%
So it can actually sexually
reproduce in an immature stage

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.820 align:middle line:90%
and go through that life cycle.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.538 align:middle line:84%
But when all the conditions are
right, when the food is right,

00:02:58.538 --> 00:03:00.080 align:middle line:84%
the environments
are right, the rains

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.140 align:middle line:84%
are right, that salamander
will go completely

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.250 align:middle line:84%
into its salamander stage and
can reproduce at that stage.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And I look at the human
condition, something

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.265 align:middle line:84%
like that, where we
have never really

00:03:11.265 --> 00:03:12.890 align:middle line:84%
had all the pieces
of the puzzle there.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.390 align:middle line:84%
We've never had
all the right food

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.822 align:middle line:84%
and the nutrition
requirements met completely.

00:03:16.822 --> 00:03:18.905 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's been some
great herbalist in history

00:03:18.905 --> 00:03:20.150 align:middle line:90%
who figured it out.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.160 align:middle line:84%
And maybe there
were great cultures

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.680 align:middle line:84%
of people that had it
figured out for a while.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.800 align:middle line:84%
But we have this
opportunity in front of us,

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.910 align:middle line:84%
where all of a sudden we broke
apart all the old traditions

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.980 align:middle line:84%
and we're able to reconfigure
what our real dietary

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:35.780 align:middle line:90%
needs are.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.930 align:middle line:84%
Not something that's contrived
in chemical laboratories,

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.910 align:middle line:90%
but is real and works.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.330 align:middle line:90%
And you can physically feel it.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.030 align:middle line:84%
You can feel it in
your consciousness.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.130 align:middle line:90%
And you can see it.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.920 align:middle line:84%
That to me is the
truth of the matter.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.690 align:middle line:90%
Seeing is believing.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.450 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've been a
raw foodist for 13 years.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And I've eaten raw organic foods
and superfoods for 13 years,

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:57.810 align:middle line:90%
and herbs.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And I feel better now than I
did when I was 16 years old.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.940 align:middle line:90%
That's important news.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.320 align:middle line:90%
That is the news.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what are they
talking about on the news?

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.110 align:middle line:84%
It's like death, pain, fire,
destruction, disasters.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.050 align:middle line:84%
How about scientists
have discovered

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.450 align:middle line:90%
that they are completely wrong?

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Real herbalists
and nutritionists

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.730 align:middle line:84%
have actually made shocking
breakthroughs, which

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.830 align:middle line:84%
have led to the discovery that
we can have the best day ever,

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:26.630 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.340 align:middle line:90%
And we can feel great forever.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And we'll never be
sick ever again.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.940 align:middle line:90%
That is where we are at.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.690 align:middle line:84%
If we actually want
to, if we choose,

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.910 align:middle line:84%
we can actually design
a diet for ourselves

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.950 align:middle line:84%
where we feel
great all the time.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.500 align:middle line:84%
We never have any
digestive disturbances.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.400 align:middle line:84%
We feel completely
in balance always.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.040 align:middle line:84%
We're having enough
energy in our body,

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.110 align:middle line:84%
where we don't feel depressive
states; states of sadness,

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.760 align:middle line:84%
morbidity,
negativity, et cetera,

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.150 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, and on, and on.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.190 align:middle line:84%
This is to me one of the
great discoveries of our time.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.140 align:middle line:90%
What is more powerful than that.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And am I saying that
food is the answer

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.930 align:middle line:84%
and that you eat this food
and suddenly you become

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.760 align:middle line:90%
like Superman or something?

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is,
that's not exactly true.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.110 align:middle line:90%
But it's partially true.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.890 align:middle line:90%
It is partially true.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And that is a truth
that needs to be heard,

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.245 align:middle line:84%
that if you eat junk
food your thoughts are

00:05:27.245 --> 00:05:28.370 align:middle line:90%
going to tend towards junk.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.140 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean always
they'll be junk.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.210 align:middle line:90%
But they'll tend that way.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And if you eat the
best food ever,

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.620 align:middle line:84%
your thoughts will
tend towards totally

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.170 align:middle line:84%
unique and original
thought forms,

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.450 align:middle line:90%
that empower you and others.
