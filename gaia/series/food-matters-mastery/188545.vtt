00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.010 align:middle line:84%
>> So you might ask, given
the fact that there are these

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.280 align:middle line:84%
problems with drugs, we know
they cause side effects.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.180 align:middle line:84%
We know that they only
treat the symptoms.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.210 align:middle line:84%
We know that people need to take
them for a long period of time.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.630 align:middle line:84%
You might ask, why
aren't doctors looking

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.910 align:middle line:90%
at some sort of alternatives?

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, part of the reason
is that drug companies

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.520 align:middle line:84%
are one of the major sources of
further education for doctors.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.360 align:middle line:84%
The speed of medical advance
is increasing all the time,

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.880 align:middle line:84%
and there's huge amounts
of data coming out

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.510 align:middle line:84%
and new trials, new studies,
new findings, cutting edge

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.960 align:middle line:84%
research, and no doctor can
possibly keep up with it,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.840 align:middle line:84%
especially as they're also
being asked to work longer hours

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.780 align:middle line:84%
and to do more
paperwork and so on.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.490 align:middle line:84%
So doctors are
massively overworked,

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.150 align:middle line:84%
and so they need to
have further education.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.780 align:middle line:84%
But the question then comes-- as
always comes up with everything

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.428 align:middle line:84%
to do with medicine and
drugs is, who pays for it?

00:01:17.428 --> 00:01:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is, it's
the drug companies.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.600 align:middle line:84%
So the doctors go off
regularly to training sessions,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.590 align:middle line:84%
and it's part of their
contract-- they need to do it.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And they get extra
points for it and so on.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And they go to sessions where
they told about the new drug,

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.740 align:middle line:84%
the new treatment for, and
they also are regularly visited

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.560 align:middle line:84%
by drug reps, who
are very attractive,

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:50.180 align:middle line:84%
well-trained young men
and women who target--

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.820 align:middle line:84%
each doctor has their
own team of reps

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.560 align:middle line:90%
that are targeted on them.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And they go, and they will
provide them with the latest

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.730 align:middle line:90%
information about the drugs.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And so there is a huge
pressure on doctors to simply--

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.530 align:middle line:84%
all the sources of
information, which

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.860 align:middle line:84%
are easily accessible to them,
come from the drug companies.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And so not
surprisingly, they have

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.230 align:middle line:84%
a view that this is
the appropriate way

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.140 align:middle line:90%
to treat almost any disorder.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.950 align:middle line:84%
But the problem
goes a bit deeper

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.430 align:middle line:84%
than that, which
is that there is

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.890 align:middle line:84%
this tradition that
what we're practicing

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.230 align:middle line:90%
is scientific medicine.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And in the medical
schools, they learn

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.190 align:middle line:84%
all about the body and
pathways and drug treatments,

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.380 align:middle line:84%
and they receive no training
about nutrition or other ways

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.680 align:middle line:90%
that you can influence health.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.350 align:middle line:84%
There's also the
fact that the problem

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.500 align:middle line:84%
that most people
in the West face

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.407 align:middle line:84%
are not really acute
disorders, which

00:02:55.407 --> 00:02:56.990 align:middle line:84%
medicine is very
good at dealing with,

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.490 align:middle line:90%
but they are chronic disorders.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.060 align:middle line:84%
They're disorders like
depression, diabetes, heart,

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.020 align:middle line:90%
arthritis, and so on.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.000 align:middle line:84%
They're things which
don't kill you.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.740 align:middle line:84%
They just make you
rather miserable

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.720 align:middle line:84%
and feel rather
terrible and they go

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.620 align:middle line:90%
on for a long period of time.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
kind of conditions

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.130 align:middle line:84%
that all of the drugs
are targeted at,

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.180 align:middle line:84%
but they're the conditions that
drugs don't treat very well.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.730 align:middle line:84%
So where might
medicine go in order

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.940 align:middle line:84%
to incorporate some of
this non-drug approach?

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first thing is
that we are at a stage

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.780 align:middle line:84%
now where there's a
major change in what's

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.800 align:middle line:84%
happening with medicine, which
is that medicine no longer has

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.930 align:middle line:90%
a lock on all the information.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.550 align:middle line:90%
The internet has changed that.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.900 align:middle line:84%
No longer is
medicine a castle up

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.160 align:middle line:84%
on a hill, firmly fortified,
powerful, professional people

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.980 align:middle line:84%
inside, and the patient
goes up and asks

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.130 align:middle line:84%
for some treatment
for their malady

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.338 align:middle line:84%
and a prescription
is handed out.

00:03:57.338 --> 00:03:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And off they go,
and they have no way

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.440 align:middle line:84%
of knowing whether it's
the best thing or not.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course,
that's all changed.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.880 align:middle line:84%
Internet is changing
everything hugely.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.460 align:middle line:84%
All of the information
that the doctors are using

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.190 align:middle line:84%
is available out
there on the web.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.250 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
that people can do

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.630 align:middle line:84%
is to ask questions
of their doctors

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.330 align:middle line:84%
about what is the case with the
drug that they're being given.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.020 align:middle line:84%
So they can ask questions
about how many people

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.810 align:middle line:84%
need to be treated with a
drug in order for one person

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:30.690 align:middle line:90%
to benefit.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And as we've seen,
in some cases,

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.640 align:middle line:84%
up to 200 people may have to
be treated with a drug for one

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.670 align:middle line:90%
person to benefit.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And then you might decide
that perhaps this is not

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.210 align:middle line:90%
the drug for you.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.800 align:middle line:84%
You might want to ask
questions about what are

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.050 align:middle line:90%
the side effects of this drug.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.820 align:middle line:84%
What are the trials that
have been done on it?

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.610 align:middle line:84%
Were the trials all run
by the drug companies,

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.550 align:middle line:84%
or where there some independent
trials of this drug?

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:58.400 align:middle line:84%
We know, for example, that the
trials run by drug companies

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.140 align:middle line:84%
are four times more
likely to come up

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.810 align:middle line:84%
with a positive
finding than ones run

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.980 align:middle line:90%
by independent investigators.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.370 align:middle line:84%
You might want to know
whether the drug has recently

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.740 align:middle line:84%
been put out on the market,
because the mechanisms

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.040 align:middle line:84%
for picking up on problems
with drugs are not very good.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And so there are likely to
be all sorts of side effects,

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.492 align:middle line:90%
which will emerge gradually.

00:05:18.492 --> 00:05:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And you might decide
you don't want

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.670 align:middle line:84%
to be a person who's taking
part in this big experiment.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Are they the best way to treat
everything from the start?

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And the answer would seem
very clearly to be not.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And so for a lot of
the chronic conditions,

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.620 align:middle line:84%
it seems to make a lot
of sense to start off

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.500 align:middle line:84%
by doing what you can
with non-drug approaches,

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.600 align:middle line:84%
firstly because they're
very unlikely to have

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.820 align:middle line:90%
the same range of side effects.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.108 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, because
in a number of cases,

00:05:44.108 --> 00:05:45.900 align:middle line:84%
it looks as though they
would have a better

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.270 align:middle line:84%
chance of tackling
the underlying problem

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.240 align:middle line:84%
rather than simply
dealing with the symptoms.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.700 align:middle line:84%
The underlying approach of the
non-drug treatment is to say,

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.690 align:middle line:84%
let's look at what's going
on in the entire system.

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And this idea,
it's been rather--

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.305 align:middle line:84%
and the term "holism"
or "holistic"

00:06:06.305 --> 00:06:07.680 align:middle line:84%
has been rather
debased, and it's

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.110 align:middle line:84%
associated with hippies
and sandals and incense

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.770 align:middle line:84%
and a whole range of rather
silly woolly vague things.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.270 align:middle line:84%
But there's nothing woolly
or vague about it at all.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.080 align:middle line:84%
We now know that there's a lot
of very good and interesting

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.890 align:middle line:84%
studies showing the direct
way that psychological states

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.350 align:middle line:84%
affect your physical
functioning.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And physical functioning affects
your psychological states.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And in any sensible
system of medicine,

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.050 align:middle line:84%
the two would be brought
to bear on the way

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.780 align:middle line:90%
that people are treated.

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.310 align:middle line:84%
I still find it very
difficult to understand

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.640 align:middle line:84%
why this fantastically
simple and very obvious

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.560 align:middle line:90%
message is resisted so fiercely.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And I'm now in a
position where I

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.840 align:middle line:84%
think that it will do a large
number of people a lot of--

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.290 align:middle line:84%
it will help a lot of people
to lead rather better lives

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:03.840 align:middle line:84%
and more fulfilled
lives if they can

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.450 align:middle line:84%
make use of this medicine,
which is out there,

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:10.080 align:middle line:84%
but which just isn't
made available to them

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.610 align:middle line:90%
in the same way that drugs are.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.480 align:middle line:90%


00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.660 align:middle line:84%
The reason I got involved in
this whole area to begin with

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.010 align:middle line:90%
was simply as a journalist.

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:23.790 align:middle line:84%
I came across what seemed to me
to be an extraordinary story.

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:27.620 align:middle line:84%
The fact that here
was this single man

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:32.030 align:middle line:84%
talking about dangers with a
drug which were being ignored,

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.210 align:middle line:84%
and he was subsequently
vindicated.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And then I've came
across similar stories

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:40.910 align:middle line:84%
where the same pattern
emerged, and it was obvious

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:43.880 align:middle line:84%
that there was something
wrong in the way

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.943 align:middle line:84%
that drug-based
medicine was being run.

00:07:45.943 --> 00:07:47.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't think this
was necessarily

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.160 align:middle line:84%
to do with the fault
of the drug companies.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.640 align:middle line:84%
It's the fault of the way
the whole thing is regulated.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And the more I
looked into it, it

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:59.450 align:middle line:84%
was very clear that there
was another way of treating

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:01.400 align:middle line:84%
a lot of chronic
disorders, which

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.610 align:middle line:84%
made an awful lot of sense,
which didn't seem to have

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:07.550 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the problems that
were involved with drugs,

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:12.030 align:middle line:84%
and which had really quite a
lot of evidence to support it.

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:13.490 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't really--

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.110 align:middle line:84%
I still can't really
understand why

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:16.920 align:middle line:90%
something that is so simple--

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.500 align:middle line:84%
it's very obvious
that if you get

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.800 align:middle line:84%
people to eat rather better, if
you get them to breathe better,

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.770 align:middle line:84%
if you get them
to take exercise,

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:28.590 align:middle line:84%
if you get them to change
the way that they live,

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.850 align:middle line:84%
and if you treat
specific areas that

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:36.740 align:middle line:84%
are a problem with food or with
products which our bodies are

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.299 align:middle line:84%
designed to cope
with-- our bodies

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:43.400 align:middle line:84%
are designed to run on
particular sorts of lipids,

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.530 align:middle line:84%
on vitamins, on minerals,
and so on, they're

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:48.620 align:middle line:84%
not going to have
anything like the effects

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:49.910 align:middle line:90%
that drugs will have.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:53.230 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
promote health,

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:55.222 align:middle line:84%
that which seems
to me so obvious,

00:08:55.222 --> 00:08:56.180 align:middle line:90%
That's where you start.

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:59.230 align:middle line:90%
