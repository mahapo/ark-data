00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.100 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a lot more that
we don't know about raw foods

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.210 align:middle line:90%
and super foods than we do know.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:22.580 align:middle line:84%
However, it's quite evident
that raw foods, for example,

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.500 align:middle line:84%
contain nutrients that are
susceptible to heating that

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.830 align:middle line:84%
will change if we cook and
heat them or process them

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:30.700 align:middle line:90%
in any way.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it's
important that raw foods

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.800 align:middle line:84%
be a part of the
individual's diet.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.300 align:middle line:84%
The simplest thing
is that there are

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:44.020 align:middle line:84%
live enzymes or live
workers inside of our foods

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.980 align:middle line:84%
that help with your
body's digestion of foods

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.520 align:middle line:84%
and the use of the
nutrients that are there.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.450 align:middle line:84%
So raw foods should be a
part of everybody's diet.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.290 align:middle line:84%
The superfoods are
foods with nutrients

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.430 align:middle line:84%
that are very high
in concentration,

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.780 align:middle line:84%
whether they be the vitamins
or minerals or enzymes

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.630 align:middle line:84%
or special chemicals
that are found

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.200 align:middle line:84%
in foods that help our
bodies and cells to function.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.470 align:middle line:84%
Superfoods include things
like spirulina and yeast

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.340 align:middle line:84%
and so on, because
these are nutrient--

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.100 align:middle line:84%
as we'd say--
nutrient-dense foods.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And they provide us with
unique nutrients that

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.420 align:middle line:90%
can help us to function better.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.350 align:middle line:90%
A very simple case is--

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.830 align:middle line:84%
or example is in
my own family, we

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.600 align:middle line:84%
know that if you expose yourself
to the sun for too long,

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.890 align:middle line:90%
you can burn.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.830 align:middle line:84%
There is a superfood
like spirulina

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.050 align:middle line:84%
and barley grass,
which you've taken,

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.890 align:middle line:84%
can actually reduce the burning
and convert it into a tan.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's if it's done
very, very carefully.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.070 align:middle line:90%
So we don't know how this works.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.670 align:middle line:90%
We don't know why it happens.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.730 align:middle line:84%
But we do know that
these superfoods

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.580 align:middle line:84%
can confer exceptional
properties to your health

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.440 align:middle line:90%
and well-being.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.520 align:middle line:84%
The recommended daily
allowance is the amount

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.060 align:middle line:84%
of a nutrient that's required by
the majority of the population

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.030 align:middle line:84%
to prevent an overt
deficiency disease.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.450 align:middle line:84%
That is, if we give
everybody in Australia

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.980 align:middle line:84%
the recommended
intake of vitamin

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.830 align:middle line:84%
C at 60 milligrams per
day, then we should not

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.180 align:middle line:90%
see scurvy in this country.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.070 align:middle line:84%
However, we still see scurvy in
this country, despite the fact

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.530 align:middle line:84%
we're wealthy, and that
we're all on a good diet,

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.590 align:middle line:84%
and we've got fresh fruit
and vegetables available.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.290 align:middle line:84%
More importantly,
we see pre-scurvy.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.430 align:middle line:84%
That is, illness before
the full disease occurs.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And that illness can go on
for a long period of time.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.090 align:middle line:84%
That illness being,
tiredness, aches and pains,

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.990 align:middle line:84%
paleness in the face, a
little bit of irritability,

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.120 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of depression, some
tiredness, and some weakness,

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.650 align:middle line:90%
and some poor sleep habits.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.090 align:middle line:84%
Now that is-- those symptoms
are all very non-specific.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And if you go to a doctor
with those symptoms

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.660 align:middle line:84%
and repeatedly go to a
doctor with those symptoms,

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.400 align:middle line:84%
he will put you on
an antidepressant

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.620 align:middle line:84%
because he can't find
anything wrong with you.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.300 align:middle line:84%
But what your
problem is, is you've

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.310 align:middle line:84%
got a low level of
vitamin C intake.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And your stores of
vitamin C are too low.

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.620 align:middle line:84%
So the recommended
daily allowance

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.930 align:middle line:84%
is going to prevent you from
getting scurvy and dying

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:29.920 align:middle line:90%
from scurvy--

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.960 align:middle line:90%
that is, the bleeding disease.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.623 align:middle line:84%
But it's not going to make
you optimally healthy.

00:03:34.623 --> 00:03:36.040 align:middle line:84%
So the recommended
daily allowance

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.730 align:middle line:84%
came from the study of
reasonably healthy subjects,

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.010 align:middle line:84%
and the requirements they
needed to prevent them

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.360 align:middle line:84%
from getting an overt or
basic deficiency disease.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think many
of these studies

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.690 align:middle line:84%
were done in the army with
reasonably healthy individuals.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.150 align:middle line:84%
But when you look at hospital
populations and populations

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.490 align:middle line:84%
going to doctors,
and populations

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.940 align:middle line:84%
of people who are sick, a
very different situation

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.100 align:middle line:90%
compared to healthy soldiers.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And the requirements for these
populations are much higher.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.740 align:middle line:84%
You only have to
smoke a cigarette

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:14.430 align:middle line:84%
or drink a glass of wine,
and your daily intake

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.138 align:middle line:84%
or daily recommend daily
intake, much of it is destroyed.

00:04:19.138 --> 00:04:20.680 align:middle line:84%
So you we're going
to end up that day

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.050 align:middle line:84%
with a deficiency of
vitamin C, vitamin

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.600 align:middle line:84%
B1, and a few other
nutrients as well.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And if you drink
some alcohol, you

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.000 align:middle line:84%
might end up with a
low level folic acid.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you drink alcohol every
day, and you're a young woman,

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.120 align:middle line:84%
and you have a low
level folic acid,

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.760 align:middle line:84%
you might get a lesion on your
cervix, which is precancerous.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.430 align:middle line:84%
Or if that doesn't show
up, and you get pregnant,

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.970 align:middle line:84%
you might have a baby that's got
a neural tube defect or a hair

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.450 align:middle line:84%
lip or cleft palate or some
minor congenital abnormality

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.250 align:middle line:90%
that's gone unrecognized.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.050 align:middle line:90%
Or you may not even conceive.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And folic acid
deficiencies are well

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.270 align:middle line:90%
known cause of infertility.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Well known amongst people
who are aware of it,

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.270 align:middle line:84%
but not well known amongst
the general medical community.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.720 align:middle line:90%


00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.840 align:middle line:90%
Are vitamins expensive urine?

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:21.410 align:middle line:90%
We need air, oxygen, water.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.880 align:middle line:84%
We breathe out oxygen.
We pee out water.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.290 align:middle line:84%
It's what the substances do
when they're inside the body.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.600 align:middle line:84%
That's the important
issue and whether or not

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.660 align:middle line:84%
we get high enough
levels of these things.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:41.540 align:middle line:84%
If I go up, say,
8,000 meters, that

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.330 align:middle line:84%
is nearly to the top
of Mount Everest, I'm

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.790 align:middle line:84%
going to have a huge
deficiency of oxygen.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:54.290 align:middle line:84%
So I need supplemental oxygen.
If I eat a lousy bread roll

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.870 align:middle line:84%
every day, have a cup
of tea for breakfast,

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.910 align:middle line:84%
and a piece of toast, a
sugary drink for mid-morning,

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:07.760 align:middle line:84%
a donut for lunch, and takeaway
fried chicken at night,

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be
massively deficient

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.890 align:middle line:90%
in a whole range of nutrients.

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.410 align:middle line:90%
And that's only one day.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.460 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to need something
in the way of supplements.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.340 align:middle line:84%
So the next day, I
eat salad until it's

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.900 align:middle line:84%
coming out of my ears to
try and make up for it.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.170 align:middle line:84%
But I never ever
correct the deficiency

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.100 align:middle line:90%
that occurred the day before.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.870 align:middle line:84%
There's always going to be a
residual problem somewhere.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.040 align:middle line:84%
So you cannot punish yourselves
without having to pay for it

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.390 align:middle line:90%
sooner or later.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Your liver, to get rid
of toxic chemicals,

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:43.610 align:middle line:84%
needs vitamins and minerals
to move the toxic chemicals

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.660 align:middle line:90%
outside of your body.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:50.015 align:middle line:84%
So if you live in
a polluted society,

00:06:50.015 --> 00:06:53.240 align:middle line:84%
if you live in a modern
Western city or Eastern city

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.130 align:middle line:84%
for that matter, if
you eat food that's

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.930 align:middle line:84%
been processed in
any way or gone

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.370 align:middle line:84%
through our agricultural system,
and it contains pesticide

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.010 align:middle line:84%
and herbicide residues,
it's wise to make

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:07.678 align:middle line:84%
sure your vitamins are at a
slightly higher level than what

00:07:07.678 --> 00:07:08.720 align:middle line:90%
you get out of your diet.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.590 align:middle line:90%


00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Natural therapies and natural
remedies are extremely safe.

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:20.570 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they're probably
safer than drinking our water

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.520 align:middle line:90%
supply out of the tap.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And certainly safer than
eating foods, especially

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:27.800 align:middle line:90%
take away foods.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.230 align:middle line:84%
In Australia, we have
120,000 admissions

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:35.570 align:middle line:84%
every year as a result of food
toxicity and food poisonings.

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.750 align:middle line:84%
We have 16,000
deaths in hospital

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.750 align:middle line:84%
because of the wrong diagnosis
and/or the wrong treatment.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.880 align:middle line:84%
We have something
like 12,000 admissions

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:48.110 align:middle line:84%
as a result of the adverse
reactions from medicines

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:49.670 align:middle line:90%
and drugs.

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:53.540 align:middle line:84%
Very few, if any,
serious adverse reactions

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.570 align:middle line:84%
to complementary medicines,
herbal medicines,

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.130 align:middle line:90%
and vitamins and minerals.

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:02.090 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they are
extremely, extremely safe.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:05.200 align:middle line:90%
