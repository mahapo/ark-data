00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>> We live in the most
extraordinary time

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.300 align:middle line:84%
in the entire
history of the world.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.710 align:middle line:84%
We know, based on the geological
record, that nothing like this

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.360 align:middle line:84%
has ever happened
before on earth.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.220 align:middle line:84%
There's been great civilizations
that have come and gone,

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.450 align:middle line:84%
but what we have now, with
our cars and our radios

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.280 align:middle line:84%
and our stereos
and our computers

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.520 align:middle line:84%
and our calculators
is unprecedented.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's brought about
unprecedented levels

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.470 align:middle line:90%
of challenges and opportunities.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.940 align:middle line:84%
Because we can focus on
anything at any time,

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.150 align:middle line:84%
I choose to focus on what
are the opportunities.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.630 align:middle line:84%
What is being created
out of, for example,

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.110 align:middle line:84%
the environmental disasters that
have occurred on the planet?

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.420 align:middle line:84%
What opportunities
are being opened up

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.420 align:middle line:84%
by the nutritional
disasters that

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.850 align:middle line:84%
have happened due to the
proliferation of junk food

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.110 align:middle line:84%
and candy and all kinds
of artificial ingredients?

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And what has emerged out
of those kinds of questions

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.330 align:middle line:84%
and that type of focus is
an absolutely extraordinary

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.570 align:middle line:84%
option, which is
the option to now

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.900 align:middle line:84%
be able to have the
greatest food ever

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.450 align:middle line:90%
in the history of the world.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.340 align:middle line:84%
The food choices
that are before us

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.960 align:middle line:84%
are completely
diverse and varied.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.630 align:middle line:84%
It goes everything
from chemicals

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.930 align:middle line:84%
all the way to the most
extraordinary foods

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.540 align:middle line:84%
grown by the great medicine
schools in Tibet ever.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.600 align:middle line:84%
You know, this is how
wide our choices can be.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And any food that we
eat can literally just

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.550 align:middle line:90%
take this much work.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.820 align:middle line:84%
It's either going to be
this, and then we eat,

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.100 align:middle line:84%
or it's going to be
this, and then we eat.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And this right here could
be the most horrid chemical

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.570 align:middle line:84%
soup of all time, or it could
be the most extraordinary

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.640 align:middle line:90%
superfood of all time.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same amount of
work to get it into our mouths.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.980 align:middle line:84%
We're just creating an
awareness about these choices,

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.630 align:middle line:84%
because awareness is really
the beginning of consciousness.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.380 align:middle line:84%
If we aren't aware that we
have the best food ever, then

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.610 align:middle line:90%
we're never going to have it.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.277 align:middle line:84%
It's not like the
universe is just going

00:02:19.277 --> 00:02:20.400 align:middle line:90%
to dump that into our lap.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.580 align:middle line:84%
But the awareness suddenly
creates the possibility

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.960 align:middle line:90%
of choice.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And then we start looking at
all these choices and going,

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.560 align:middle line:84%
you know, instead of the
chemical pizza over here,

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have the
superfood lasagna over here.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.020 align:middle line:84%
That's, to me, an
extraordinary possibility,

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:46.050 align:middle line:84%
because there is one thing
that trumps everything.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.830 align:middle line:84%
It's the one super
law of all reality.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.380 align:middle line:84%
It's a phrase that
every single person

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.360 align:middle line:84%
in the world, every culture,
every language, every country,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.940 align:middle line:90%
every person the world knows it.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And it actually trumps, you are
what you think about all day

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.080 align:middle line:90%
long.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.840 align:middle line:84%
It trumps Earl Nightingale's
strangest secret.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.090 align:middle line:84%
Every single success
principle rests upon this one.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.960 align:middle line:84%
And that is you
are what you eat.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.460 align:middle line:84%
You are what you eat is of
such profound significance

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.070 align:middle line:84%
that it was actually
impossible for me,

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.140 align:middle line:84%
personally, to understand
the import of that phrase

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.640 align:middle line:84%
until many, many years of
leading a lifestyle of eating

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.402 align:middle line:84%
really incredibly powerful
superfoods and raw foods

00:03:36.402 --> 00:03:37.860 align:middle line:84%
and some of the
most powerful foods

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.020 align:middle line:84%
that are available
on the entire planet.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And from those experiences,
I realized just how far

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.520 align:middle line:84%
off track our diet has
become, culturally, at least.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.830 align:middle line:84%
We, for whatever
reason, decided we're

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.200 align:middle line:84%
going to spread everything
with every kind of pesticide,

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.220 align:middle line:84%
herbicide, larvicide,
fungicide, suicide.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.130 align:middle line:84%
We decided we're going to
genetically modify things

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.690 align:middle line:90%
we don't know anything about.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.385 align:middle line:84%
We decided, for
some reason, that we

00:04:05.385 --> 00:04:08.430 align:middle line:84%
were going to inject
hormones into cows

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.070 align:middle line:84%
and then pasteurize
that milk to death

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.815 align:middle line:84%
and then serve it to
millions of people.

00:04:12.815 --> 00:04:14.190 align:middle line:84%
We just decided
we're going to go

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.310 align:middle line:84%
into this crazy
world of the unknown

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.870 align:middle line:90%
and experiment on ourselves.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.269 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting
is that experiment has

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.770 align:middle line:90%
led to an incredible discovery.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.400 align:middle line:90%
And that is food does matter.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.130 align:middle line:84%
The food that we eat creates
the tissues of our body,

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.250 align:middle line:84%
creates the quality of
the energy of our cells,

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:38.670 align:middle line:84%
and very deliberately affects
the quality of our thoughts.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.950 align:middle line:84%
If we are eating
the best food ever,

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.150 align:middle line:84%
and if I can be allowed
to list what that is,

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.445 align:middle line:84%
that would include things like
raw chocolate nuts or cacao

00:04:48.445 --> 00:04:50.820 align:middle line:84%
beans-- the food that all
chocolate is made out of in its

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.400 align:middle line:84%
natural state, not
in a processed state,

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.800 align:middle line:90%
in its original state as a nut--

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:02.430 align:middle line:84%
goji berries, spirulina,
bee pollen, wild honey,

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:09.980 align:middle line:84%
blue green algae, hemp
seeds, aloe vera, fresh noni.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.400 align:middle line:84%
When you have that
food, you can no longer

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.330 align:middle line:90%
be thinking about greed.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.210 align:middle line:84%
You can no longer
be in an environment

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.060 align:middle line:84%
where you can
tolerate people lying.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.180 align:middle line:84%
You become pure in
thought, word, and deed.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And that has been a truth that
I've experienced personally.

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.340 align:middle line:90%
And it is a shocking truth.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.360 align:middle line:84%
The world is the way that it
is, primarily, because the food

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.630 align:middle line:90%
that we eat.

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.530 align:middle line:84%
The architecture is the way
that it is because of the food

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:40.700 align:middle line:90%
that we eat.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.920 align:middle line:84%
Our artistic
expression is the way

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.870 align:middle line:84%
that it is because of
the food that we eat.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.430 align:middle line:84%
Our literature is the way
that it is because of the food

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:50.330 align:middle line:90%
that we eat.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And if we shift our food
choices by doing the most simple

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.240 align:middle line:84%
discovery, really, ever in
the whole history of diet,

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.820 align:middle line:84%
which is adding
the good stuff in--

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.070 align:middle line:84%
no longer are we in a state
of taking something away

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.040 align:middle line:84%
from somebody, but just
adding the good stuff in, we

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.030 align:middle line:84%
can then shift, literally,
our consciousness by food.

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:16.170 align:middle line:84%
That, to me, is just a
monumental breakthrough.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.010 align:middle line:90%
It's a breakthrough.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.150 align:middle line:84%
It's a technological
discovery, because

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.140 align:middle line:84%
of what it allows
us to do is leverage

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.770 align:middle line:84%
our abilities, our
time, our skills.

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.370 align:middle line:84%
Before I really got
oriented into natural foods,

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:34.580 align:middle line:84%
organic foods, raw
foods, superfoods, a lot

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.890 align:middle line:84%
of the success principles
that I'd learned and studied

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.750 align:middle line:90%
as a kid, since the age of 14--

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.090 align:middle line:84%
and I really started
studying success principles

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.380 align:middle line:90%
from that point on.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.630 align:middle line:84%
I met Tony Robbins when
I was 14 years old,

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.450 align:middle line:84%
did the 10-day program,
and got deeply into it.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.290 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of it was
unusable until I actually

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.180 align:middle line:84%
got control of my
body by getting

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.440 align:middle line:90%
on the proper nutrition.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.370 align:middle line:90%
Because I used to not feel well.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.310 align:middle line:84%
I'd be 20 years old
and I'd be like,

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:59.990 align:middle line:90%
something's not working here.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:01.550 align:middle line:90%
Something is not right.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And the discovery was
that, hey, it's the food.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:09.410 align:middle line:84%
There's something in our food
that's incomplete or is not

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.920 align:middle line:84%
making us feel well
or is not allowing us

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.890 align:middle line:90%
to reach our highest potential.

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:20.630 align:middle line:84%
Any discussion going into the
future of human potential,

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.620 align:middle line:84%
the success equation,
personal development,

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:29.510 align:middle line:84%
self-help technology,
spiritual transformation

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:34.130 align:middle line:84%
must now include a
deep and in depth

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:38.570 align:middle line:84%
discussion of the
power of real food.

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.540 align:middle line:84%
The power of food that
actually has minerals in it.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Food that has love in it,
that's grown with love,

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:46.820 align:middle line:84%
raised with love, picked
with love, served with love,

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.070 align:middle line:90%
and eaten with love.

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:52.640 align:middle line:84%
Food that has an
incredible history,

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:57.270 align:middle line:84%
so that the historical nature
of food is a major factor.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:58.700 align:middle line:90%
For example, chocolate.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.740 align:middle line:84%
The history of chocolate
is not the history

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.660 align:middle line:90%
of some type of bar.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.320 align:middle line:84%
Chocolate bars were invented
in 1838 in Massachusetts.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.470 align:middle line:84%
Before that, chocolate had been
eaten in its natural state,

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:12.140 align:middle line:90%
which was as a bean, as a nut.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.090 align:middle line:90%
It's actually botanically a nut.

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And this food, for 5,000 years
of history, in Mexico City

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.690 align:middle line:90%
was the money.

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:22.550 align:middle line:90%
It was the currency.

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:24.680 align:middle line:84%
So when you go buy something,
you buy an avocado,

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.540 align:middle line:90%
you'd spend two cacao beans.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.730 align:middle line:84%
You'd buy a tomato and
you'd spend one cacao bean.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:30.830 align:middle line:84%
You'd go buy a
brand new wardrobe,

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.610 align:middle line:90%
you'd spend 50 cacao beans.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.510 align:middle line:84%
This was a food, a superfood
that was used as money.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:38.059 align:middle line:84%
That's how precious
it was to them.

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:40.640 align:middle line:84%
This is what we're
reconnecting to now.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:44.870 align:middle line:84%
This is what's keeping the
excitement level of what

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.140 align:middle line:84%
is happening on the
frontiers of nutrition

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:51.970 align:middle line:90%
at an unbelievable pace.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And the excitement is
allowing the inspiration

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:56.840 align:middle line:90%
to flow through.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.827 align:middle line:84%
And it's also allowing
individuals who never knew

00:08:59.827 --> 00:09:01.910 align:middle line:84%
anything about nutrition--
never even heard of it,

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:05.030 align:middle line:84%
never heard of organic food,
never eaten organic food,

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:07.010 align:middle line:84%
had basically been
on a junk food diet--

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:11.600 align:middle line:84%
to be able to access
the best stuff ever,

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.210 align:middle line:84%
quickly, without having to
go through this whole process

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:17.030 align:middle line:84%
of going, oh my god, how
do I make bulgur wheat,

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:19.007 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it had
been like before.

00:09:19.007 --> 00:09:20.840 align:middle line:84%
Which was just, who
wants to do that anyway?

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:21.830 align:middle line:90%
It's a mess.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:24.470 align:middle line:84%
We want to make it
as easy as possible.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And the inspiration that's
flowing through right

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.130 align:middle line:84%
now, at the frontiers
of nutrition,

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:30.020 align:middle line:84%
is not only making
it great for people

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:34.100 align:middle line:84%
who are advanced
gastronauts, people

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:38.180 align:middle line:84%
who are explorers of food,
but it's also making it easier

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:40.100 align:middle line:84%
for people who are
brand new, to get

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.620 align:middle line:84%
right to the front
of the line and get

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.620 align:middle line:90%
right past that learning curve.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:49.680 align:middle line:84%
This is what keeps
me up at night.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:53.690 align:middle line:84%
This is where the fun really
is, because I can sit there

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:56.960 align:middle line:84%
and I can give, for
example, goji berries

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:02.328 align:middle line:84%
to a child who has never had
normal, natural food before.

00:10:02.328 --> 00:10:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean
normal, natural food.

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:05.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
food that's grown out

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.190 align:middle line:84%
of the earth, that's
in its original state,

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.190 align:middle line:84%
and has never had
chemicals on it.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And they can eat that food
and be totally delighted.

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:14.200 align:middle line:90%
