00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.790 align:middle line:90%
>> What constitutes raw food?

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.440 align:middle line:84%
There has been a
general consensus

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.250 align:middle line:84%
amongst a number of doctors,
nutritionists, raw food

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:24.070 align:middle line:84%
enthusiasts, that somewhere
around 40 degrees centigrade

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.710 align:middle line:84%
or 120 to 125 Fahrenheit,
the heat that's

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.300 align:middle line:84%
being applied to the food begins
to degrade critical factors

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.840 align:middle line:84%
in the food, the number one
of which we call enzymes.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.180 align:middle line:84%
This is a life force factor
that causes the plant

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.180 align:middle line:84%
to be able to grow,
reproduce, and to properly

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.460 align:middle line:90%
fulfill its lifecycle.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.650 align:middle line:84%
For example, if we heat a
seed or a nut over 150 degrees

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.253 align:middle line:84%
Fahrenheit for
several hours, it's

00:00:55.253 --> 00:00:56.920 align:middle line:84%
very likely that we've
completely killed

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.570 align:middle line:90%
that nut's ability to grow.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.810 align:middle line:84%
It will no longer be
able to sprout and grow

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.170 align:middle line:84%
into a tree or a
plant or whatever.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.730 align:middle line:84%
If we can keep our food
temperature and even

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.110 align:middle line:84%
the processing of our food down
below 40 degrees centigrade

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.500 align:middle line:84%
or about 100 to 125
Fahrenheit, then there

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.330 align:middle line:84%
is some intrinsic
factor that's retained.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.120 align:middle line:90%
Now I know that experientially.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.160 align:middle line:84%
Scientifically we
call it enzymes,

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.410 align:middle line:84%
but it's actually
deeper than that.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.480 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with the
oils in the food, which

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.550 align:middle line:84%
begin to actually break
down and oxidize under heat.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.540 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with oxygen turning
aggressive at high temperatures

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.380 align:middle line:84%
and creating free radical
damage to the food itself.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.020 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with
the overall cascade

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.910 align:middle line:84%
of different co-enzymes,
co-factors, co-minerals,

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.600 align:middle line:84%
that help the plant to
actually either grow, maintain

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.100 align:middle line:84%
life, keep the chlorophyll
intact, et cetera, et cetera.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that 100%
of every flax seed that you

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.120 align:middle line:90%
heat over 125 degrees is dead.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.330 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.180 align:middle line:90%
But it's a good general rule.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And if you follow it out
and use your intuition,

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.670 align:middle line:84%
then you've got a tool
that you can apply.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.040 align:middle line:84%
With water we found that
the critical temperature

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.480 align:middle line:84%
is actually higher, and
that it's around 160,

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:30.720 align:middle line:84%
170 Fahrenheit, which is
around 60 degrees centigrade.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.740 align:middle line:84%
If you heat water up to
about 150 Fahrenheit,

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.340 align:middle line:84%
maybe 50 degrees
centigrade, it's OK.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.990 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to actually
cause any reaction in your body.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.900 align:middle line:84%
But if you go over
that critical limit,

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.780 align:middle line:84%
it will actually cause
a white blood cell

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.850 align:middle line:90%
reaction in your body.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.400 align:middle line:84%
There was a Swiss doctor by
the name of Paul Kouchakoff who

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.160 align:middle line:84%
showed, he was the first
to show in the 1930s,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.600 align:middle line:84%
that if you ate a diet
that was more than 51%

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.870 align:middle line:84%
cooked food that your body
would react to the food

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.410 align:middle line:84%
as if it was being invaded
by a foreign organism.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.560 align:middle line:84%
Meaning it would cause
leukocytosis or white blood

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.910 align:middle line:90%
cell reaction.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.850 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Kouchakoff was the
first to demonstrate

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.650 align:middle line:84%
that if 51% of your
diet and or meals

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.320 align:middle line:84%
were raw, that you would
have no leukocytosis

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.270 align:middle line:84%
or you would actually have
no white blood cell reaction.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.890 align:middle line:84%
So your immune
system would not be

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.728 align:middle line:90%
activated with a false alarm.

00:03:27.728 --> 00:03:30.020 align:middle line:84%
Because we're dealing with
so many immune system issues

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.230 align:middle line:84%
today, we have to make
sure that at least 51%

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.230 align:middle line:84%
of every meal that
we have is raw

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.160 align:middle line:84%
so that we don't overburden that
already burdened immune system.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.130 align:middle line:84%
OK, so if you're a
beginner and you're

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.930 align:middle line:84%
wanting to get into
raw organic food

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.150 align:middle line:84%
and you're looking as
to how to structure

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.370 align:middle line:84%
your day and your
meals, a good idea

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.030 align:middle line:84%
is to not abandon everything
you're doing right now,

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.780 align:middle line:84%
but to look at what
you're doing right now

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.905 align:middle line:84%
and decide which of the
things you're going to keep

00:03:55.905 --> 00:03:57.530 align:middle line:84%
and what is no
longer serving you

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.360 align:middle line:90%
and shouldn't be there anyway.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.460 align:middle line:84%
You start off in the
morning with lots of water.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.710 align:middle line:84%
Drink one to two
liters of water,

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.520 align:middle line:84%
preferably two liters of water
on an empty stomach before you

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.660 align:middle line:90%
have anything.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.640 align:middle line:90%
Let that water move through you.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And usually it causes a
bowel movement to occur.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And it hydrates you
and gives you hydration

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.490 align:middle line:90%
throughout the whole day.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:19.190 align:middle line:84%
The next step is we need to
start looking at lightening

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.050 align:middle line:90%
that morning meal.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:24.560 align:middle line:84%
What I mean by lightening is I'm
saying no more bacon and eggs.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.170 align:middle line:84%
Let's try to move towards
a liquid breakfast.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.825 align:middle line:84%
And that would look like
a super food smoothie.

00:04:29.825 --> 00:04:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Lots of people are
already doing this anyway.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.710 align:middle line:90%
They call it a protein shake.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.390 align:middle line:84%
We're saying, do your
protein shake now.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.240 align:middle line:84%
But instead of using some kind
of chemically manufactured

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.370 align:middle line:84%
protein complex
that's not organic

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.100 align:middle line:84%
and is filled with chemicals
to actually move over

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.870 align:middle line:84%
towards raw organic plant based
super food protein substances.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.080 align:middle line:84%
For example, you could
fill up a blender

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.540 align:middle line:84%
with water, coconut
water, orange juice.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.020 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you like to do a
tea, something like that,

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.760 align:middle line:84%
and then blend in
hemp seed protein.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.810 align:middle line:90%
Blend in spirulina.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:07.893 align:middle line:90%
Blend in goji berries.

00:05:07.893 --> 00:05:09.560 align:middle line:84%
Throw whole goji
berries right in there.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And if you really want to have
fun, throw chocolate beans

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.740 align:middle line:84%
in there, cacao nibs in there,
and make the whole thing

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:16.910 align:middle line:90%
a chocolate smoothie.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And start off your morning
having the best morning ever.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's a great
shift for the morning.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.488 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it takes people
longer than others.

00:05:26.488 --> 00:05:28.530 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you're a coffee
drinker in the morning.

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Take your coffee, throw
that in the blender,

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.370 align:middle line:84%
and throw the super
foods in with the coffee.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.880 align:middle line:84%
For example, you could
take coffee, cacao nibs.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.940 align:middle line:84%
You could take maca, which
is an incredible super food

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:41.900 align:middle line:90%
from South America.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.730 align:middle line:84%
You could take a
little bit of honey.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.250 align:middle line:84%
Honey helps to bind all these
disparate elements together,

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.810 align:middle line:90%
make it taste better.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.420 align:middle line:84%
Just a little bit of honey,
and then use some herbs,

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.820 align:middle line:84%
especially I recommend
the medicinal mushrooms

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.080 align:middle line:90%
if you're a coffee drinker.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.791 align:middle line:84%
Because coffee is
very acidifying.

00:05:57.791 --> 00:06:01.910 align:middle line:84%
It has a very long term
dangerous effect on us

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.370 align:middle line:84%
if we drink too much coffee
due to the acid nature.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.120 align:middle line:84%
But it's been found out that
if you eat or you drink coffee

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.610 align:middle line:84%
with the medicinal
mushrooms like rishi,

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.755 align:middle line:84%
cordyceps, maitake,
shiitake, coriolis, agaricus.

00:06:14.755 --> 00:06:16.130 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
know all those.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.030 align:middle line:84%
You just walk into
the health food store

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.863 align:middle line:84%
and just go, get me the
medicinal mushrooms.

00:06:18.863 --> 00:06:19.870 align:middle line:90%
They'll know what to do.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And you put those
in with the coffee.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:23.770 align:middle line:90%
It neutralizes the acidity.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:24.980 align:middle line:90%
You have no acid effect.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.310 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you can sometimes
get a slightly alkaline effect

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.990 align:middle line:84%
and improve the
alkalinity of your body.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.157 align:middle line:90%
So look at that right there.

00:06:31.157 --> 00:06:32.570 align:middle line:90%
We've not really changed much.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:33.770 align:middle line:90%
You still get your coffee.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.120 align:middle line:84%
You've got your
chocolate in there now,

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.810 align:middle line:90%
so you've got a mocha.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's a real mocha, because
it's made with real chocolate.

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.180 align:middle line:84%
You've got your
herbal rishi, you

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.110 align:middle line:84%
know, super alkalizing thing
going on with the mushrooms.

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.360 align:middle line:84%
You've got the maca, which
is really nice to round out

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.160 align:middle line:90%
the flavor.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's a super food in
its own right, you know,

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.380 align:middle line:84%
if I have to tell you it's
an aphrodisiac as well.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.588 align:middle line:84%
And then honey, which binds
the whole thing together.

00:06:56.588 --> 00:06:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And you can live on
that and literally just

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.040 align:middle line:84%
suddenly like that quick be
in paradise every morning,

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.440 align:middle line:84%
going I can't believe
I get to have this.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And I get to have it with
no guilt, fear, or shame.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.300 align:middle line:84%
As you move later
into the morning,

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.860 align:middle line:84%
if you're used to
a big breakfast

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:12.840 align:middle line:84%
you might want to start
thinking about snacking

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.200 align:middle line:84%
on goji berries in the
morning instead of reaching

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.840 align:middle line:84%
for other things
that hunger might

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.400 align:middle line:90%
start stimulating you to do.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're used
to bacon and eggs,

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.362 align:middle line:90%
that's a lot of calories.

00:07:23.362 --> 00:07:24.778 align:middle line:84%
And you know, your
body's probably

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:26.050 align:middle line:90%
used to dealing with all that.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And you're probably
going to be hungry

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.070 align:middle line:84%
an hour or two after
your protein shake

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.440 align:middle line:84%
smoothie, whatever liquid
you're doing in the morning.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.450 align:middle line:84%
Reach for goji berries,
reach for fruit,

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:36.000 align:middle line:84%
and just try to get yourself
all the way to lunch.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.443 align:middle line:84%
If you find that you're
getting a little glycemic

00:07:38.443 --> 00:07:40.860 align:middle line:84%
in the morning because you're
just doing like goji berries

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.150 align:middle line:84%
and fruit, have
something that has

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:43.500 align:middle line:90%
a high amount of protein in it.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And that might mean
sprinkling hemp seed protein

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:47.928 align:middle line:90%
right on top of your fruit.

00:07:47.928 --> 00:07:49.220 align:middle line:90%
Just put it right on top there.

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:50.310 align:middle line:90%
It goes well together.

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:53.612 align:middle line:84%
Lunchtime have a nice
big salad and a sandwich.

00:07:53.612 --> 00:07:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Usually that's what people do
anyway, they have a sandwich.

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:57.990 align:middle line:84%
We're saying here,
add the salad in.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:59.640 align:middle line:84%
Have a little bit
less of the sandwich.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.675 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to get that
meal more than 50% raw.

00:08:02.675 --> 00:08:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Once you move into
the afternoon,

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.402 align:middle line:90%
that's important snack time.

00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:07.110 align:middle line:84%
But two or three in
the afternoon, people

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:08.280 align:middle line:90%
usually have a crash.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.040 align:middle line:84%
That's when we recommend
getting onto pumpkin seeds

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.250 align:middle line:84%
as a snack, hemp seeds as
a snack, more goji berries,

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:16.980 align:middle line:84%
raisins as a snack,
switching over

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:19.230 align:middle line:84%
to some of the berries that
are in season at the time.

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:22.182 align:middle line:84%
Like blueberries are great to
eat throughout the afternoon.

00:08:22.182 --> 00:08:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And you can literally
just eat them

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.290 align:middle line:84%
while you're working
at the computer.

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:28.710 align:middle line:84%
I've eaten five pounds of
blueberries in one day before.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:30.210 align:middle line:90%
Five pounds.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.510 align:middle line:90%
It was incredible.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:34.289 align:middle line:84%
And I felt better than ever,
literally the best ever.

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:36.487 align:middle line:84%
And then if you can work
your way into the afternoon

00:08:36.487 --> 00:08:38.279 align:middle line:84%
and you really feel
like you need something

00:08:38.279 --> 00:08:39.870 align:middle line:84%
to kind of give you
some more punch,

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:41.287 align:middle line:84%
you might want to
go for some kind

00:08:41.287 --> 00:08:43.240 align:middle line:84%
of a bar, some
kind of a raw bar,

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:47.910 align:middle line:84%
like a power bar kind of a thing
or a Cliff bar type of thing.

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:49.532 align:middle line:84%
But a raw form of
that, something

00:08:49.532 --> 00:08:50.490 align:middle line:90%
that's not been cooked.

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:52.198 align:middle line:84%
And there's plenty of
them out there now,

00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:53.470 align:middle line:90%
energy bar of some sort.

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And then you move into the
evening part of your day.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we recommend
you have a big vegetable juice.

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's really calming
at the end of the day,

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:04.950 align:middle line:84%
especially if you do a
celery juice, something

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.470 align:middle line:84%
that has a lot of green
in it, some green color.

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.127 align:middle line:84%
That's going to indicate that
this has a calming effect.

00:09:10.127 --> 00:09:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And if you can do that
towards the end of the day,

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:15.540 align:middle line:84%
generally it's going to calm
you down, relax you, and get

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.030 align:middle line:84%
you ready for an evening
with your family, an evening

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:21.510 align:middle line:84%
of reading, catching up with
the news, whatever you're doing.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:23.790 align:middle line:84%
On top of that, make sure
you have a big salad.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And then if you're
doing the cooked food,

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.510 align:middle line:90%
you do one type of cooked food.

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:28.980 align:middle line:90%
Let's say it's going to be--

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.140 align:middle line:84%
let's say you're having
fish and potato and rice.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.190 align:middle line:84%
You would just have
rice and a big salad.

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:34.860 align:middle line:84%
But you can have
a lot more rice.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Or you could just have
the fish and get rid

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.900 align:middle line:84%
of the rice and the potato
and have a big salad.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And we start
simplifying that meal

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:45.500 align:middle line:90%
and then adding a salad to it.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And then in the evening,
let's say you're really hungry

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:49.010 align:middle line:90%
late at night.

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:50.010 align:middle line:90%
Eat fruit late at night.

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Have raw food snacks
late at night.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.020 align:middle line:90%
Raw food is not fattening.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:54.645 align:middle line:84%
You can have as much
of it as you want.

00:09:54.645 --> 00:09:57.870 align:middle line:84%
The most fattening raw food
out there is macadamia nuts.

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:00.342 align:middle line:84%
And if you eat massive amounts
of macadamia nuts, which

00:10:00.342 --> 00:10:01.800 align:middle line:84%
I have done, I
can't do it anymore,

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.330 align:middle line:90%
but I have done it in the past.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.360 align:middle line:84%
The maximum weight you can
gain pigging out on that stuff

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.860 align:middle line:90%
all the time is 10 pounds.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And if you're
already overweight,

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:13.243 align:middle line:84%
you'll lose weight
eating macadamia nuts.

00:10:13.243 --> 00:10:14.160 align:middle line:90%
I want to add that in.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.040 align:middle line:84%
Because people think,
avocados, fattening!

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.270 align:middle line:90%
I can't eat avocados.

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.820 align:middle line:84%
I saw my cousin lose
150 pounds eating

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.690 align:middle line:90%
8 to 16 avocados every day.

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:27.090 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a guy who had
a lifelong eating disorder.

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And he just decided
that he was going

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:31.770 align:middle line:84%
to switch his eating
habits over to raw food.

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:34.057 align:middle line:84%
And sure, he was going
to overeat as he'd always

00:10:34.057 --> 00:10:34.890 align:middle line:90%
done his whole life.

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:38.280 align:middle line:84%
But no longer had to suffer
for the side effects.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.555 align:middle line:84%
And that is a valuable
tool of raw food.

00:10:40.555 --> 00:10:42.180 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you might have
an eating disorder

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.710 align:middle line:90%
or might have some problems.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:46.680 align:middle line:84%
But raw food at least
allows you to eat the food

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.768 align:middle line:84%
and not suffer with side
effects as a result.

00:10:50.768 --> 00:10:53.310 align:middle line:84%
If you do this program just what
we've kind of laid out there

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:56.370 align:middle line:84%
as a day, the transformational
qualities of that

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:58.780 align:middle line:90%
alone are outrageous.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.930 align:middle line:84%
It's almost impossible
to describe.

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.970 align:middle line:90%
It's an experiential phenomenon.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:04.950 align:middle line:90%
And you start there.

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:08.070 align:middle line:84%
From there, you're going to want
to know more and go for more.

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And then you just
continue the education.

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.980 align:middle line:90%


00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:18.090 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to protein,
in the future, and even now,

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:21.180 align:middle line:84%
the best sources of protein
are raw organic plant

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.470 align:middle line:90%
based super foods.

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:24.540 align:middle line:84%
Because we can get all
the protein that we

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:25.920 align:middle line:90%
need from those sources.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.950 align:middle line:84%
They've been undamaged
by heat, and they

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:32.320 align:middle line:90%
are completely absorbable.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.230 align:middle line:90%
They can be liquefied easily.

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:35.850 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm
saying by absorbable.

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:37.500 align:middle line:84%
How much energy do
you think it takes

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.375 align:middle line:84%
to turn spirulina into a
liquid and get in your body?

00:11:40.375 --> 00:11:42.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, you put spirulina in
water, it's already liquefied.

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:45.150 align:middle line:84%
You drink it, it'll go right
into your cells like that.

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:50.130 align:middle line:84%
But a steak requires a
massive amount of energy

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.770 align:middle line:84%
to liquefy it and
make it absorbable

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:54.450 align:middle line:90%
by your digestive system.

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's a waste
of time and energy.

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:59.970 align:middle line:84%
I am not a big advocate
of preaching vegetarianism

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:02.910 align:middle line:84%
to everybody or veganism
or even raw foodism.

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:09.120 align:middle line:84%
But we do know for a fact that
an 80% raw organic plant based

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:12.760 align:middle line:84%
diet that covers all the
different facets of fruits,

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:16.740 align:middle line:84%
vegetables, nuts, seeds,
seaweed, sprouts, grasses,

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:22.800 align:middle line:84%
super foods, and herbs is
a massively valuable part

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:28.440 align:middle line:84%
of a healthy and wonderfully
abundant lifestyle.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.960 align:middle line:84%
So from that
perspective, we just

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.600 align:middle line:84%
let people look at
all the information

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.993 align:middle line:90%
and decide for themselves.

00:12:34.993 --> 00:12:36.660 align:middle line:84%
If I got on a whole
track of like you've

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.630 align:middle line:84%
got to be this or that or
you need to be a vegetarian,

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:41.520 align:middle line:84%
this is not
appropriate for people.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Because it turns
people off, it doesn't

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:46.440 align:middle line:84%
allow them to come to
their own conclusions.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm a vegetarian.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.470 align:middle line:84%
I've been a vegetarian
for 16 or 17 years.

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:53.233 align:middle line:84%
I'm a blood type O
as well, you know?

00:12:53.233 --> 00:12:54.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean if I had
listened to the experts,

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.970 align:middle line:90%
I'd probably be dead right now.

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:58.350 align:middle line:90%
Don't listen to experts.

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:02.970 align:middle line:84%
Listen to your body first,
then experts second.

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:04.080 align:middle line:90%
Your body will tell you.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And if you're having
too much meat, you know.

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.380 align:middle line:90%
You will know.

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And if you actually need
meat, you'll know that too.

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:13.710 align:middle line:84%
You just have to be
sensible about these things

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:17.250 align:middle line:90%
and really take your power back.

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:19.800 align:middle line:84%
Instead of giving your
power away to advertisers

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.770 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, the meat
industry and the dairy industry,

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:24.362 align:middle line:84%
take your power
back and understand

00:13:24.362 --> 00:13:25.320 align:middle line:90%
what's working for you.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And of course, always
organic no matter what.

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:29.820 align:middle line:90%
At the very least organic.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:32.070 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to have any
kind of meat in your diet,

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:33.600 align:middle line:90%
let's have it be organic.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.200 align:middle line:90%

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.000 align:middle line:90%
