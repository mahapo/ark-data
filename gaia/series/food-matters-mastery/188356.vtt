00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Another area is mental
illness and the problems

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.850 align:middle line:90%
of schizophrenia and depression.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.620 align:middle line:84%
I remember in the
early days of my career

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.050 align:middle line:84%
when I was giving anesthetics
for shock treatment

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:30.040 align:middle line:84%
in the hospitals, I was referred
a young schizophrenic fellow

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.920 align:middle line:84%
who had had a lot
of shock treatment.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And there was nothing
happening with him.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.950 align:middle line:90%
He was violent.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:39.890 align:middle line:90%
He was aggressive.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.580 align:middle line:84%
He was locked up
in a padded cell.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.750 align:middle line:90%
He was straight-jacketed.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And every drug that he
was given was basically

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.750 align:middle line:90%
something to quiet him down.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.720 align:middle line:90%
And he would get quite wild--

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.780 align:middle line:84%
and severely paranoid
schizophrenic.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.390 align:middle line:84%
But he had some insight
when he was lucid.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And during the lucid
periods, the insight

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.450 align:middle line:84%
was sufficient for him to say,
yes, he'd like to go on a fast

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.910 align:middle line:84%
and stop eating
what he was eating

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.530 align:middle line:84%
and to take some vitamins and
have some vitamin injections.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.140 align:middle line:84%
He was fasted for a
period of four days.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.760 align:middle line:84%
He was given some
vitamin injections.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.750 align:middle line:84%
At the end of another four days,
he was quite lucid and good

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.887 align:middle line:90%
most of the time.

00:01:21.887 --> 00:01:24.220 align:middle line:84%
We challenged him with foods
over the next three or four

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.620 align:middle line:84%
weeks, three foods
a day, measuring

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.660 align:middle line:84%
his symptoms and
blood sugar levels,

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.510 align:middle line:84%
and a range of other
parameters and discovered

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.680 align:middle line:84%
that he was reacting
very adversely when

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.520 align:middle line:84%
he was challenged with
dairy products, grains,

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.470 align:middle line:84%
in particular wheat, yeast,
and a couple of fruits.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.960 align:middle line:90%
We gave him an elimination diet.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.540 align:middle line:84%
We put him on his high
doses of B-group vitamins

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.970 align:middle line:90%
and some other nutrients.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And he became well
and stayed well.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.410 align:middle line:84%
The foods that he was eating
when he was in the padded cell

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:07.360 align:middle line:84%
was bread and milk and Vegemite,
wheat, dairy, and yeast.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.930 align:middle line:90%
And that's all he ate.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.920 align:middle line:84%
When he stayed off these
foods, he was well.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.820 align:middle line:84%
If he would have a little
of either of the foods,

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.510 align:middle line:84%
he would start getting
strange feelings

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.730 align:middle line:84%
in the head and
strange thoughts again

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.875 align:middle line:90%
and start having hallucinations.

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:23.500 align:middle line:84%
He stayed on his
vitamins and his diet.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.110 align:middle line:84%
He went back to university,
got himself an honors degree

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.640 align:middle line:84%
in computing
science, and ended up

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.360 align:middle line:84%
working in a major
institution in this country.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.830 align:middle line:84%
His father was told
he would end up

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.900 align:middle line:84%
in the backwoods of
a mental institution

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.990 align:middle line:84%
by three consultant
psychiatrists in this country.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.090 align:middle line:90%
And this was over 30 years ago.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.620 align:middle line:84%
So what's going on in
the mind and the brain?

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.500 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the mind is can be
influenced by the nutrients

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.778 align:middle line:84%
and chemicals going into it
and what is happening as well.

00:02:54.778 --> 00:02:57.070 align:middle line:84%
This is not to say that
psychological treatments aren't

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.870 align:middle line:90%
important.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:58.900 align:middle line:90%
They are.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.420 align:middle line:84%
But you can't get anywhere
with a patient who's

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.140 align:middle line:84%
got psychological and
psychiatric symptomatology

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.990 align:middle line:84%
if their brain is
hungry, if it's starved,

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.600 align:middle line:90%
or if it's poisoned.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
important lesson

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.440 align:middle line:84%
for our community to
learn because it's

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.660 align:middle line:90%
going to get worse.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.370 align:middle line:90%
Violence is going to get worse.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.090 align:middle line:84%
Schizophrenia is
going to get worse.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.465 align:middle line:84%
Depression is
going to get worse.

00:03:20.465 --> 00:03:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking down
the barrel of an epidemic

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.510 align:middle line:90%
of depression and suicide.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's again related to
the garbage that's going

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.310 align:middle line:90%
into our young people's bodies.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sorry to
say, but that garbage

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.820 align:middle line:84%
is being provided by
the food industry.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.980 align:middle line:84%
Indirectly, the food
industry is contributing

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.980 align:middle line:84%
to epidemics of nutritionally
related disorders and disorders

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.540 align:middle line:84%
that are of an inheritable
nature that may not

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.050 align:middle line:84%
have been expressed if the
population was eating properly.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.750 align:middle line:90%


00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.830 align:middle line:84%
In the psychiatric hospital and
medical hospital, where I was--

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.190 align:middle line:84%
one of the ones where
I had admitting rights,

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.830 align:middle line:84%
it was a typical
revolving door syndrome.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.290 align:middle line:84%
People would come back every
three months, every six months

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.600 align:middle line:84%
for more shock treatment or
more psychotherapy or more

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.829 align:middle line:90%
stress management.

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was just
horrible to see people

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.330 align:middle line:84%
who had obvious nutritional
problems being readmitted

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.950 align:middle line:84%
for these nasty therapies that
were, in my opinion, necessary.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.680 align:middle line:84%
once, but after that should
not have been required

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.350 align:middle line:84%
in the majority of cases
because some fish oils,

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.820 align:middle line:84%
some B vitamins, correcting
a magnesium deficiency,

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.730 align:middle line:84%
correcting a zinc
deficiency, correcting

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:56.250 align:middle line:84%
the allergies that were causing
their brain to malfunction--

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.275 align:middle line:84%
these approaches can make people
healthy and more functional

00:05:01.275 --> 00:05:05.340 align:middle line:84%
or more useful in society
rather than being dependent

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.680 align:middle line:84%
on a medical system
that is becoming

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.560 align:middle line:84%
less and less sustainable
and more and more expensive.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Even our previous health
minister, Mr. Tony Abbott,

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.840 align:middle line:84%
admitted he was-- he
told me in a group

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.970 align:middle line:84%
that he was not a
health minister.

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.400 align:middle line:84%
He was really the minister
for illness and disease.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And so he's really
running a department

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.440 align:middle line:90%
of illness and disease.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And we need a
department like that.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.710 align:middle line:84%
We need to have good doctors
and surgeons and psychiatrists.

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.550 align:middle line:84%
But we also need to balance
that with health optimisation.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's the only
way we're going to get

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.467 align:middle line:90%
a sustainable health system.

00:05:37.467 --> 00:05:42.460 align:middle line:90%


00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.540 align:middle line:84%
My position on Western
medicine and the use of cut,

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.100 align:middle line:84%
burn, and poison
therapies, as I call them,

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.780 align:middle line:84%
is such that if it's
going to be lifesaving

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.990 align:middle line:84%
or if it's going to
arrest symptomatology,

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.420 align:middle line:90%
then it must be used.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.410 align:middle line:84%
But simultaneously,
the consideration

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:05.170 align:middle line:84%
of changes in terms of diet and
exercise are equally important

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.840 align:middle line:90%
and must be emphasized as well.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.163 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you prescribe a drug
or a surgery or chemotherapy

00:06:11.163 --> 00:06:12.580 align:middle line:84%
or radiotherapy--
and I've treated

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.320 align:middle line:90%
a lot of cancer patients.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.360 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you prescribe
a drug, you actually

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.990 align:middle line:90%
compromise their health.

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.780 align:middle line:84%
You're going to actually
obstruct an enzyme.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.160 align:middle line:84%
You're going to actually
utilize more nutrients

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.430 align:middle line:84%
than the patient
can afford to spend

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.570 align:middle line:84%
because most of the drugs that
we used are metabolic blockers.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:36.220 align:middle line:84%
They modify metabolic pathways
by consuming extra nutrients

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.950 align:middle line:84%
and increasing
requirements for nutrients.

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's been well-documented
that drugs, including

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.670 align:middle line:84%
antibiotics, interfere with
your metabolic processes,

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:48.610 align:middle line:84%
either in the liver or in
the gut or changing gut

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.190 align:middle line:90%
bacteria, balances, and so on.

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.170 align:middle line:84%
So it is always the
part of medicine

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.470 align:middle line:84%
that is an art
that's required when

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.750 align:middle line:84%
you decide on the
management of the patient.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.350 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody comes in
and they've got a cancer,

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.310 align:middle line:84%
it's going to obstruct
a major blood vessel

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.950 align:middle line:84%
or penetrate a major
organ, and you're

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:13.870 align:middle line:84%
going to give them
chemotherapy, but you've

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.270 align:middle line:84%
got to operate at the
same time, the first thing

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.960 align:middle line:84%
I would do with that patient
is wait as long as I possibly

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:24.050 align:middle line:84%
can before I give them
chemotherapy and operate

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:24.850 align:middle line:90%
on them.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'd have a drip
up with some nutrients

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.930 align:middle line:84%
going in at high levels to
actually improve their ability

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.990 align:middle line:84%
to cope with the chemotherapy
and the surgery and/or

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:36.310 align:middle line:90%
radiotherapy.

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, that model
applies whether it

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:40.270 align:middle line:84%
be somebody with cancer or
somebody with heart disease

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.070 align:middle line:84%
or somebody who's
simply broken a bone

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.040 align:middle line:90%
and going in for surgery.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.790 align:middle line:84%
You've got to look at
all of these things.

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:47.650 align:middle line:84%
If they're low in
zinc, they're going

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:49.780 align:middle line:84%
to get infections because
the immune system is

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.453 align:middle line:90%
going to be compromised.

00:07:51.453 --> 00:07:53.120 align:middle line:84%
If they're low in
essential fatty acids,

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.060 align:middle line:84%
they could end up
with depression.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:58.330 align:middle line:84%
If they're low in
vitamin B12, they

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:02.300 align:middle line:84%
could end up with anemia,
and so on and so forth.

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.230 align:middle line:84%
So the most important
thing is to optimize

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:09.170 align:middle line:84%
the health of that person before
you cut, burn, and poison.

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:13.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's going to be and will
be a part of a future health

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:14.690 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:17.680 align:middle line:84%
We just have to make
sure that the politicians

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.780 align:middle line:84%
and the regulators are
aware of what is needed.

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And we have to deal with
the obstruction that

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:26.530 align:middle line:84%
will come from the
various vested interests

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:28.930 align:middle line:90%
in the professional arena.

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:32.210 align:middle line:84%
But once we do that--
and it will happen--

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:35.629 align:middle line:84%
we will have a system whereby
people do get a fair deal out

00:08:35.629 --> 00:08:36.429 align:middle line:90%
of health.

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:39.309 align:middle line:84%
At the moment they're getting
the best in medical care

00:08:39.309 --> 00:08:41.862 align:middle line:84%
in this country that can be
provided anywhere in the world,

00:08:41.862 --> 00:08:43.779 align:middle line:84%
but they're not getting
very good health care.
