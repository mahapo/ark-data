00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>> I never really quite bought
the whole spiritual trip that,

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.810 align:middle line:84%
oh, we're just a spirit in this
body and the material reality

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:18.620 align:middle line:90%
doesn't matter.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And I also never bought
the other side equation,

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.780 align:middle line:84%
which is we're all
material and no spirit.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.490 align:middle line:84%
We're some kind of
combination of those things.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And [AUDIO OUT] knows
that intuitively.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Everyone kind of knows
we're part angel, part ape,

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.130 align:middle line:84%
we have kind of this
duality within us,

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.120 align:middle line:84%
and the idea is how do we get
to be more angel and less ape?

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've got to
go more towards food

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.630 align:middle line:84%
that has high ethereal
vibrations in it,

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.940 align:middle line:90%
metaphysical power.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.120 align:middle line:84%
The power of chocolate
is overwhelming.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.710 align:middle line:90%
It is overwhelming.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.100 align:middle line:84%
If you actually get onto the
truth about chocolate, which

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.500 align:middle line:84%
is all the chocolates
you've been eating probably

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.060 align:middle line:84%
by everybody
forever has all been

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.160 align:middle line:84%
processed, massively
chemicalized,

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.310 align:middle line:84%
has very, very little
actual cacao in it, which

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.380 align:middle line:84%
is the food that all
chocolate is made out of,

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.780 align:middle line:84%
and has sugar and
all kinds of stuff,

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.380 align:middle line:84%
but even then still able to
create a twinkle in a child's

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.090 align:middle line:90%
eye, even then, after all that.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.340 align:middle line:84%
If you actually move
that out of the way

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.520 align:middle line:84%
and get onto the real food,
which is the raw chocolate,

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.910 align:middle line:84%
and you start eating that,
the metaphysical power of it

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.170 align:middle line:90%
is overwhelming.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.690 align:middle line:90%


00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.780 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a joke compared
to what we grew up with,

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.380 align:middle line:90%
like cheeseburgers.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it really is a time
of tremendous divergence

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.110 align:middle line:84%
between the best of the best
and the worst of the worst.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And anybody who's watching this
right now has at some level

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.000 align:middle line:84%
made a choice that
they want to do

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.873 align:middle line:84%
something that is going
to improve their lives,

00:01:52.873 --> 00:01:54.290 align:middle line:84%
their families'
lives, their kids'

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.020 align:middle line:84%
lives, and the life
of the planet itself

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.070 align:middle line:84%
and the life of all the
plants and everything.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.040 align:middle line:84%
If that is our choice,
then our food choices

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.680 align:middle line:84%
must correlate with that,
because if you've ever

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.199 align:middle line:84%
flown in a plane and you look
out the window of the plane

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.590 align:middle line:84%
and you see what's down there,
you'll see it's all farms.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.050 align:middle line:84%
The primary way that we're
interacting with our planet

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.730 align:middle line:90%
is through agriculture.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And if we change our food
choices, we change agriculture,

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.140 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden we shift
away from, for example, corn,

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.730 align:middle line:84%
wheat, soy diets over to, quote,
unquote, "superfood" diets

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.550 align:middle line:84%
and "organic" diets
and "raw food" diets,

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.300 align:middle line:84%
and we shift the whole
way that we literally

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.130 align:middle line:90%
interact with the planet.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.410 align:middle line:84%
The number one thing
we're doing on this planet

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.150 align:middle line:90%
is growing things.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.820 align:middle line:84%
In spite of all the
chemical-controlled, giant

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.020 align:middle line:84%
agricultural businesses,
we're still growing stuff.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.300 align:middle line:84%
We could grow
genetically-modified corn

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.910 align:middle line:84%
or we could grow the most
extraordinary goji berries

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:56.990 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.890 align:middle line:84%
We could grow
genetically-modified soybeans

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.540 align:middle line:84%
or we could grow the
most powerful aloe

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.690 align:middle line:84%
vera that's ever been seen
in the history of the world.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.020 align:middle line:90%
And that choice is 100% ours.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.670 align:middle line:84%
My feeling about it is I
need to put all my attention

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.740 align:middle line:90%
on the solutions.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.720 align:middle line:84%
We are no longer
pointing at problems.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.540 align:middle line:90%
That's over with.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.340 align:middle line:90%
That's done.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.820 align:middle line:84%
We know that we can't continue
to blow massive amounts of soot

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.060 align:middle line:90%
into the atmosphere anymore.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.630 align:middle line:84%
We know that we can't continue
to bomb each other anymore.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:27.950 align:middle line:90%
Everybody knows that.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.970 align:middle line:84%
So now we need to put all
our focus on solutions,

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.020 align:middle line:84%
and diet and nutrition
is an intrinsic part

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.710 align:middle line:84%
of every solution because it's
where the rubber hits the road.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.680 align:middle line:84%
If you think about a car, you've
got everything in the car,

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.170 align:middle line:84%
all the torque in the engine,
the power of the engine,

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.650 align:middle line:84%
the engine itself, the
steering wheel, the seats.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.490 align:middle line:84%
Everything about that car
comes down to a little spot

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.900 align:middle line:84%
under each tire wear the
rubber hits the road.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.688 align:middle line:84%
And if there's no rubber,
that car ain't going anywhere.

00:04:00.688 --> 00:04:01.730 align:middle line:90%
You don't have any tires?

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if you've got the
most incredible Lamborghini

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:04.600 align:middle line:90%
ever.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.930 align:middle line:84%
If you have no rubber on
that tire or no tire at all,

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.190 align:middle line:90%
you're not going anywhere.

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.320 align:middle line:90%
That's nutrition.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.040 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
rubber hits the road.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.720 align:middle line:84%
That's where we're
interacting with what's real.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And nutrition has this
incredible ability

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.510 align:middle line:84%
to connect us and reconnect
us to what is valuable

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.030 align:middle line:90%
and what is important.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.800 align:middle line:84%
We probably as a culture
have got our values inverted.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.910 align:middle line:84%
We'd rather spend money on rent
than we would on the best food

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:37.710 align:middle line:90%
ever.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.700 align:middle line:84%
We'd rather spend money
on a car or a house

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.550 align:middle line:84%
than on feeding our children
the greatest superfoods that

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.750 align:middle line:84%
have ever been discovered in the
world, because we don't know.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.250 align:middle line:84%
It's just a values inversion
because we just got confused.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.518 align:middle line:84%
We saw some program that
sold us on buying this car,

00:04:53.518 --> 00:04:55.560 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly we're buying
that car when really we

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.060 align:middle line:84%
should take that
money and invest it

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.610 align:middle line:84%
into our family's
health by the best food

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:00.660 align:middle line:90%
ever, which is the basis.
