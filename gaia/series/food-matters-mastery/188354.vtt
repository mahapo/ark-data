00:00:03.416 --> 00:00:10.250 align:middle line:90%


00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Unfortunately, most of us
are not starting with a blank

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.600 align:middle line:90%
slate.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.270 align:middle line:84%
We've accumulated
debris, toxins,

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.120 align:middle line:84%
residues of foods
that we've eaten,

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.760 align:middle line:84%
perhaps heavy
metals, pesticides.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we've got to do
some cleansing action in order

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.230 align:middle line:84%
to move that stuff out of us
and allow the really good food

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.009 align:middle line:90%
to do its work.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.040 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole strategy
for detoxification

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.130 align:middle line:84%
that has been developed
over the last 150 years

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.605 align:middle line:84%
which we find to be very
effective and very simple.

00:00:42.605 --> 00:00:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And the basic idea is
you've got to start

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.730 align:middle line:84%
by doing the simplest thing
ever, which is upon rising,

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.120 align:middle line:90%
drink lots of water.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.700 align:middle line:84%
As simple as that
is, it's amazing

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.180 align:middle line:84%
how many, how few
people actually do that.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.050 align:middle line:84%
Drink a liter, two liters of
water before you have any food,

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.630 align:middle line:84%
before you have any
coffee, before whatever,

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.520 align:middle line:84%
tea, whatever you start
your morning with.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Drink a liter, two
liters sometimes.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.510 align:middle line:84%
In fact, for most people,
they need two liters.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.260 align:middle line:84%
Just drink water, and
then begin your day.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.150 align:middle line:84%
What we notice
first is initially,

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.525 align:middle line:90%
boom, things flow out.

00:01:19.525 --> 00:01:20.900 align:middle line:84%
There is a cleansing
that occurs.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.650 align:middle line:90%
Bowel movements occur.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And if we really look at
what's going on in our culture,

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.050 align:middle line:84%
the real problem is not
some war over there.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.910 align:middle line:90%
It's not crime.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.360 align:middle line:90%
It's not the economy.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Those are all symptoms
of a much deeper issue,

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.450 align:middle line:90%
which is constipation.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.950 align:middle line:84%
Constipation is an epidemic
that is ravaging society,

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.520 align:middle line:84%
but it's completely hidden
and not talked about.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.450 align:middle line:84%
Colonics, enemas, things
that help to move stuff out,

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.330 align:middle line:84%
herbs that help to
move things out, water

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.100 align:middle line:90%
that helps to move things out.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.520 align:middle line:84%
These are critical factors
in the cleansing equation,

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.650 align:middle line:84%
because our body's
primary method

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.880 align:middle line:84%
of cleansing and detoxification
is through the bowels.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And that is-- it is the best
way to get the toxins out.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.080 align:middle line:84%
Because if you try to
get the toxins out by,

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.120 align:middle line:84%
for example, taking a bunch
of herbs and you know,

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.360 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of super cleansing
accouterments, what ends up

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.890 align:middle line:84%
happening is your
body might go hey,

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.390 align:middle line:84%
you know, the bowels
are clogged up.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.890 align:middle line:84%
We'd better get it
out through the skin.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.557 align:middle line:84%
And stuff starts
coming out of your skin

00:02:26.557 --> 00:02:29.570 align:middle line:84%
or you start sweating
it out or rashes appear.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And nobody wants
to go through that.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.528 align:middle line:90%
That's a nightmare.

00:02:32.528 --> 00:02:34.070 align:middle line:84%
How do you want to
get the stuff out?

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.540 align:middle line:84%
You want to get it out through
your bowels and get it out,

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.980 align:middle line:90%
as much out as possible.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.730 align:middle line:90%
I had a cousin, I have a cousin.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.740 align:middle line:84%
My cousin lost 150 pounds
in about an 18 month period

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.020 align:middle line:84%
on our program, raw,
organic, natural foods

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.800 align:middle line:84%
across a selection that
we've been talking about.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And he actually moved all
that toxicity out of his body

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.650 align:middle line:90%
through his bowels.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.360 align:middle line:90%
12 bowel movements a day.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.040 align:middle line:84%
One day he lost 15
pounds in one day.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.580 align:middle line:84%
That is really interesting,
but really difficult

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.260 align:middle line:84%
to talk about to
the general public.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.877 align:middle line:84%
Because when we
think of weight loss,

00:03:10.877 --> 00:03:13.460 align:middle line:84%
we think we're going to go work
out and convert it into muscle

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:14.390 align:middle line:90%
and sweat it off.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.440 align:middle line:84%
But actually in this day and
age with the toxicity that's

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.357 align:middle line:84%
in the average fat cell
of the average person,

00:03:21.357 --> 00:03:23.690 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to move that
stuff out through your skin.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.440 align:middle line:84%
You want to get it out
through your bowels

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.290 align:middle line:90%
as quickly as possible.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.400 align:middle line:90%
What else is effective?

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.310 align:middle line:84%
Well herbs are really
important as an adjunctive part

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.110 align:middle line:90%
of the cleansing process.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.310 align:middle line:84%
Certain herbs are capable
of affecting great changes

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.210 align:middle line:90%
in our toxicity level.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:47.030 align:middle line:84%
For example, if we take
in lots of powdered

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.990 align:middle line:84%
cloves, black walnut, and
the final piece of that

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:57.470 align:middle line:84%
is wormwood, those three
herbs, cloves, black walnut,

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.350 align:middle line:84%
and wormwood, are extremely
effective at knocking out

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.350 align:middle line:84%
hitchhikers in our
digestive tract.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And those hitchhikers
themselves are not toxic.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.610 align:middle line:84%
It's their waste
products that are toxic.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.440 align:middle line:90%
Viruses are not toxic.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.959 align:middle line:84%
It's their waste
products that are toxic.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.730 align:middle line:90%
Bacteria is not toxic.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.520 align:middle line:84%
It's its waste products
that are toxic.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And flukes, worms, et
cetera, are not toxic.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.180 align:middle line:90%
It's their waste products.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.097 align:middle line:84%
So if we really want to
move the toxicity out,

00:04:29.097 --> 00:04:32.600 align:middle line:84%
we have to move out
the toxicity producers,

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.640 align:middle line:84%
and those can be hitchhikers,
otherwise known as parasites.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.820 align:middle line:84%
We've been sold the idea that
parasites happen somewhere else

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.618 align:middle line:84%
in some far off country where
there's lots of humidity,

00:04:44.618 --> 00:04:46.910 align:middle line:84%
and things come through the
ground and get in your food

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:47.710 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.077 align:middle line:84%
And that is something
that is not true.

00:04:51.077 --> 00:04:52.160 align:middle line:90%
People can have parasites.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.910 align:middle line:90%
I had a good friend of mine.

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.280 align:middle line:84%
He's been on raw food,
herbs, the whole program

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.810 align:middle line:90%
for about a year.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.190 align:middle line:84%
And he recently had a tapeworm
come out, 10 foot tapeworm.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.490 align:middle line:84%
And that gets people's
attention instantly.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.550 align:middle line:84%
Because it's all fine and
dandy, but when something like

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.520 align:middle line:84%
that comes out of your body,
your whole life changes.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Because you realize
it's possible

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.370 align:middle line:84%
that what we've been told
or sold is inaccurate.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.162 align:middle line:84%
And it's something you
experience yourself.

00:05:18.162 --> 00:05:19.745 align:middle line:84%
Again, getting back
to feeling, right?

00:05:19.745 --> 00:05:20.720 align:middle line:90%
You're your own doctor.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.220 align:middle line:84%
You see something like
that come out of you,

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.450 align:middle line:90%
you're going to be motivated.

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.670 align:middle line:84%
You're going to suddenly
go, wait a second,

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.140 align:middle line:90%
let me get that film back on.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.400 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's something
I need to see in there.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.270 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm going to go
to the bookstore.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.062 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm going back to
the health food store.

00:05:31.062 --> 00:05:33.341 align:middle line:90%
I need to really look into this.

00:05:33.341 --> 00:05:36.860 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the reasons why
I recommend colonics and enemas.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.060 align:middle line:84%
Because colonics and enemas can
help move that toxicity out.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
little tube when

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.160 align:middle line:90%
you go and have a colonic done.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And that tube shows you
what's coming out of you.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Now for people who don't
know what a colonic is,

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.240 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of like
a glorified enema.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.990 align:middle line:84%
You basically have a
tube put in your rectum,

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.350 align:middle line:84%
and then water comes in and then
out, in and out, in and out.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And it allows your lymphatic
system to completely drain out.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.800 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, you can see
what's coming out

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.450 align:middle line:90%
through this little tube.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:09.530 align:middle line:90%
Whoa.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.535 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've seen people who
come out of a colonic and said,

00:06:12.535 --> 00:06:13.910 align:middle line:84%
I just saw a penny
come out of me

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.550 align:middle line:84%
or I just saw this really,
like, hard rock come out.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.440 align:middle line:84%
Or you know, flukes, or things
that look like an octopus.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:28.772 align:middle line:84%
Or, I mean, crazy stuff that
cause you to go, uh oh, whoa.

00:06:28.772 --> 00:06:30.730 align:middle line:84%
It's why I'm an advocate
of colon hydrotherapy.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.080 align:middle line:84%
Now obviously, you want to
seek out a reputable colon

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.980 align:middle line:90%
hydrotherapist.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And you want to be
careful as with anything

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.100 align:middle line:84%
with a health care practitioner
and find someone who is not

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.728 align:middle line:84%
only reputable, but
has a long history

00:06:41.728 --> 00:06:43.270 align:middle line:84%
of doing the work
that they're doing.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And talk to some
of their patients.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm a very, very big advocate,
by the way, of acupuncture

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.700 align:middle line:84%
and opening up the meridian
system as part of the cleansing

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.100 align:middle line:90%
and detoxification process.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.800 align:middle line:90%
Why is it that we have toxicity?

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.170 align:middle line:84%
How is it possible that
toxicity could damage us?

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have energy that
flows through our heart,

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.450 align:middle line:84%
out all our meridians,
energy systems of the body,

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:06.980 align:middle line:90%
subtle energies, things that--

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.310 align:middle line:84%
yeah, you cut somebody open,
you don't see an energy freeway

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.280 align:middle line:90%
going through.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.400 align:middle line:84%
But if you find out that
someone, for example,

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.980 align:middle line:84%
has extreme stomach problems
and you start working on them,

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.710 align:middle line:84%
you know, stomach 36 point
right here with an acupuncture

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.920 align:middle line:84%
needle, you will find out that
that spot is extremely tense

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:25.910 align:middle line:90%
and has lots of pain.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.130 align:middle line:84%
So they are holding
energy there.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And if there's toxins moving
through the environment,

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.040 align:middle line:84%
those toxins back
up in that dam.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And they'll back up in
that energy blockage zone.

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it can
create a real problem.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And eventually in the
case of the stomach,

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:43.010 align:middle line:84%
it could create
ulcers, stomach cancer.

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And it cascades into worse and
worse problems down the road.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.440 align:middle line:84%
So we need to open up the
meridians through acupuncture,

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.510 align:middle line:84%
and generally through
body work and massage

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.800 align:middle line:84%
as well to allow that
stuff to flow through.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.600 align:middle line:90%
What else?

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.200 align:middle line:90%
