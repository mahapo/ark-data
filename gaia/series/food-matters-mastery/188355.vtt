00:00:02.862 --> 00:00:08.119 align:middle line:90%


00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>> There's been an awful lot
of research out, the fat gene,

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.123 align:middle line:84%
you know, the
non-blame hypothesis.

00:00:13.123 --> 00:00:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Most of what we're seeing
in terms of obesity,

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.100 align:middle line:84%
take Britain as a classic
example, Australia also.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.010 align:middle line:84%
We see a situation where if you
go back and look at the stats

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.830 align:middle line:84%
during World War II when there
was a lot of studies done

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.740 align:middle line:84%
on the nation's health
back during the war,

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.820 align:middle line:84%
there was simply
not the obesity.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.070 align:middle line:90%
There was not the food around.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.300 align:middle line:90%
But there wasn't the obesity.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.250 align:middle line:84%
Something clearly has happened
between World War II and 2007.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And there isn't some new gene
stalking the neighborhood.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.650 align:middle line:84%
This is because we have a
lot of highly processed foods

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.410 align:middle line:84%
devoid of nutrition, empty
calories, lots of sugar.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.770 align:middle line:90%
People eat more of them.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.670 align:middle line:84%
So they're simply taking in more
energy than they're expending.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And so the body is simply taking
all this extra excess energy

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.920 align:middle line:84%
and hanging it where
they put their six guns.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.708 align:middle line:84%
And so the problem here is going
to be just changing the diet,

00:00:56.708 --> 00:00:58.750 align:middle line:84%
restricting the amount of
food people are eating.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And people who are either
willing to do that or they're

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.180 align:middle line:90%
not.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.388 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we get contacted by
an awful lot of teenagers

00:01:03.388 --> 00:01:04.330 align:middle line:90%
who want to get dates.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.110 align:middle line:84%
But they can't, because
they are overweight,

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.440 align:middle line:90%
they don't look right.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.510 align:middle line:84%
What can I do,
anything I can do?

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.560 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, when we look at
programs like Gillian McKeith's

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.915 align:middle line:90%
and others.

00:01:15.915 --> 00:01:17.290 align:middle line:84%
Jamie Oliver, of
course, has been

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.123 align:middle line:84%
trying to tackle a lot
of the obesity that's

00:01:19.123 --> 00:01:20.590 align:middle line:90%
going on in schools.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.530 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to do that.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.310 align:middle line:84%
There was that whole amazing
newspaper article the other day

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.485 align:middle line:84%
where Jamie Oliver was
going into the schools,

00:01:26.485 --> 00:01:28.360 align:middle line:84%
the celebrity chef was
going into the schools

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.030 align:middle line:84%
and trying to change these
wretched school dinners.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.210 align:middle line:84%
But some of the parents
were objecting to this.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.350 align:middle line:84%
You know, my kid needs
to have a good meal.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.350 align:middle line:84%
So they are forcing fast
food through the grills

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.020 align:middle line:90%
of the gates at the school.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.200 align:middle line:84%
Until we change
attitudes, let's face it,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.630 align:middle line:84%
people are allowed to
eat what they like.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.220 align:middle line:84%
But there is a responsibility
that comes with that.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the
political discussion

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.380 align:middle line:84%
that has been banded
about has been,

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.570 align:middle line:84%
well, really should
the taxpayer pay

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.807 align:middle line:84%
for people who are
wanting the abusing food,

00:01:57.807 --> 00:01:59.890 align:middle line:84%
and then end up with these
problems like diabetes,

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.800 align:middle line:84%
and heart, and cancer that
cost thousands to treat

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.600 align:middle line:90%
in hospitals.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Is it fair that under
a tax payer system

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.150 align:middle line:84%
other people should
pay for that.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm not here to make
that kind of judgment.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.830 align:middle line:84%
What I'm here to do is to
tell the public the great news

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.702 align:middle line:84%
that if you are unhappy
with how you look,

00:02:14.702 --> 00:02:16.660 align:middle line:84%
you are the sum total of
everything you've ever

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.980 align:middle line:90%
done to yourself.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.540 align:middle line:84%
So you either
change your attitude

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.030 align:middle line:84%
or continue to suffer
what you must suffer.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.200 align:middle line:84%
Depression, which can be
caused by chromium deficiency.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.530 align:middle line:84%
There was a study done at the
University of North Virginia

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.690 align:middle line:84%
done by Professor
Malcolm McLeod that

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.960 align:middle line:84%
showed that between 25
to 42% of all depressives

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.438 align:middle line:84%
are chromium
deficient in some way.

00:02:38.438 --> 00:02:40.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't read any articles
about that in the newspapers.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.410 align:middle line:84%
When you think about
the amount of depression

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.070 align:middle line:84%
there is out there and the
amount of anti-depressants

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.270 align:middle line:84%
that are prescribed with severe
side effects being caused

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.190 align:middle line:90%
by those patients taking those.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.650 align:middle line:84%
So there are simpler
ways to do it.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.780 align:middle line:84%
As Evel Knievel said
before his abortive leap

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.590 align:middle line:84%
across the Grand Canyon,
there must be an easier way.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.700 align:middle line:84%
There's been a huge
amount on fat written

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.365 align:middle line:84%
about in the popular
press and a lot of studies

00:03:07.365 --> 00:03:08.240 align:middle line:90%
have been done on it.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.200 align:middle line:84%
The short version is that
there are some harmful fats.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.120 align:middle line:84%
There are some trans
fats, there are partially

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.600 align:middle line:84%
hydrogenated oils that
cause tremendous problems

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.890 align:middle line:90%
for the body.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.520 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these fake butters,
a lot of these fake margarines

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.380 align:middle line:84%
that are put onto
the market can create

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.032 align:middle line:84%
problems have been linked,
these types of hydrogenated oils

00:03:27.032 --> 00:03:29.240 align:middle line:84%
have been linked to macular
degeneration and problems

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.560 align:middle line:90%
with eyesight.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.335 align:middle line:84%
There are clearly
the trans fats that

00:03:32.335 --> 00:03:33.710 align:middle line:84%
can create all
kinds of problems,

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.377 align:middle line:84%
and we've read an
awful lot about those.

00:03:35.377 --> 00:03:38.758 align:middle line:84%
Then we have the healthy
fats, the so-called omegas,

00:03:38.758 --> 00:03:40.550 align:middle line:84%
which are contained in
a lot of these foods

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.970 align:middle line:84%
that we've been talking about,
which should be consumed.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Two fish dinners a
week are advised.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.200 align:middle line:84%
There's been a recent warning
on the amount of methyl mercury

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.680 align:middle line:84%
in fish, which is hitting
certain areas of the planet

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.640 align:middle line:90%
quite strongly.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.305 align:middle line:84%
Several researchers
go quite hard on this

00:03:58.305 --> 00:03:59.930 align:middle line:84%
and say you shouldn't
eat fish anymore.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm not quite there yet.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.160 align:middle line:84%
I think that fish
needs to be cold caught

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.780 align:middle line:84%
and deep so that we can
get natural fish which

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.750 align:middle line:84%
will have the minimum of
this type of contamination.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:09.680 align:middle line:90%
But fish is great.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.260 align:middle line:84%
Things like flax and
hemp oils are great,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.810 align:middle line:84%
which mimic these types of oil,
which are these types of oils

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:15.950 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And just generally eating a
lot of good healthy foods,

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.329 align:middle line:90%
we'll cover the basics.

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.760 align:middle line:84%
When we look at hyperactive
kids for instance

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.100 align:middle line:84%
where we see an
inability for these kids

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.230 align:middle line:84%
to be able to manufacture
prostaglandins which

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.580 align:middle line:90%
are chemical mood modulators.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.670 align:middle line:84%
Then very often just spreading
some evening primrose

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.440 align:middle line:84%
oil on their body
or just getting

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.698 align:middle line:84%
them to take cod liver oil and
various of these omega sources

00:04:37.698 --> 00:04:38.990 align:middle line:90%
can straighten the problem out.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.930 align:middle line:84%
We've had tremendous
testimonies over the years

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.510 align:middle line:84%
with uncontrollable kids
ripping classrooms apart.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And then the parents will
change their diets out,

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:48.950 align:middle line:84%
and then the teachers
will go, never

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.798 align:middle line:84%
have we seen such amazing
changes in children.

00:04:51.798 --> 00:04:53.840 align:middle line:84%
What have you done, put
them in straight jackets?

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.780 align:middle line:90%
I wish.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.960 align:middle line:84%
But we see that
just simply, again,

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.140 align:middle line:84%
dietary changes will win
through and will help

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.820 align:middle line:90%
people to overcome problems.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how much better is
that than drugging them up

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.340 align:middle line:84%
on these things like
Ritalin and Prozac.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.400 align:middle line:84%
We have over 8 million
kids apparently in America

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.040 align:middle line:84%
drugged up every day
before they go to school.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And these types of drugs
can produce some severe side

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.672 align:middle line:84%
effects, homicidal
rages, grabbing the Uzi

00:05:22.672 --> 00:05:23.880 align:middle line:90%
and climbing the clock tower.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:24.890 align:middle line:84%
You know we've looked
at these school

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.350 align:middle line:84%
shootings and the implications
of a lot of these drugs

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:28.630 align:middle line:90%
in these shootings.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And you know, how much easier
it is for the school just

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.340 align:middle line:84%
to be able to feed these
pupils correctly to begin with,

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.340 align:middle line:84%
if they're boarding, or
the parents to send them

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.215 align:middle line:84%
to school with some
decent food in their bag.

00:05:39.215 --> 00:05:43.340 align:middle line:90%


00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.110 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back to basics.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.160 align:middle line:90%
You are what you eat.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.330 align:middle line:90%
Who really believes that?

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.230 align:middle line:90%
Who believes that angel mood?

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.898 align:middle line:90%
Valentine's Day depends on it.

00:05:52.898 --> 00:05:54.440 align:middle line:84%
You know, let me
have a look at this,

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.780 align:middle line:84%
and we see people just
eating a lot of sugary foods

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.510 align:middle line:84%
and then they're climbing the
walls and getting violent.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they did
studies in the prison.

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.720 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Stephen Shaw, I think
was the researcher in America,

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.030 align:middle line:84%
went into American prisons,
rounded up a test group,

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.330 align:middle line:84%
I believe somewhere a couple
of thousand, 3,000 maybe,

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.850 align:middle line:90%
and changed their diets out.

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And changed their diets out,
gave them some supplementation,

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.478 align:middle line:90%
changed their diets out.

00:06:16.478 --> 00:06:18.020 align:middle line:84%
In other words, what
he wanted to see

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.895 align:middle line:84%
was, and these were the
criminals beating up

00:06:19.895 --> 00:06:21.770 align:middle line:84%
other criminals, these
were the violent ones.

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.603 align:middle line:84%
What he wanted to find
out was whether there

00:06:23.603 --> 00:06:27.860 align:middle line:84%
was a correlation between
diet and violent behavior.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.625 align:middle line:90%
And this is the case.

00:06:29.625 --> 00:06:31.250 align:middle line:84%
How many people
believe that if they're

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.220 align:middle line:84%
watching bad news on
the TV all day long,

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.940 align:middle line:84%
they're not going
to get depressed?

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.880 align:middle line:84%
That what we focus on
becomes our reality.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.660 align:middle line:84%
If you are watching these
news programs all day long,

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.760 align:middle line:84%
then is that going to
affect your mental attitude?

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.202 align:middle line:90%
Of course it's going to do that.

00:06:45.202 --> 00:06:47.660 align:middle line:84%
I tried to get everybody to go
through tomorrow's newspaper

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.450 align:middle line:84%
with a red pen, put a big red
X next to every single article

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:51.822 align:middle line:90%
that is bad news.

00:06:51.822 --> 00:06:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And when you're done
that, do all the programs,

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.690 align:middle line:84%
Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Murder
She Wrote, Midsummer's Murder,

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.820 align:middle line:84%
Murder With Frost,
Murder in Suburbia,

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.703 align:middle line:84%
Dead Like Us, Cult
of the Coffin.

00:07:01.703 --> 00:07:03.620 align:middle line:84%
You're looking at these
programs all the time.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Now go back through the same
newspaper with a blue pen

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.420 align:middle line:84%
and put a big blue X next
to every single article that

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.277 align:middle line:84%
is absolutely none
of your business.

00:07:11.277 --> 00:07:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And what you realize
is you're looking

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.230 align:middle line:84%
at a whole bunch of bad news
every day, none of which

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:16.753 align:middle line:84%
has anything to do
with you at all.

00:07:16.753 --> 00:07:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of
it is the weather.

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:21.125 align:middle line:84%
And you know how
they lie about that.

00:07:21.125 --> 00:07:22.790 align:middle line:90%
And what are you eating?

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:24.480 align:middle line:90%
What is your whole life story?

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.710 align:middle line:90%
What is your environment?

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:27.290 align:middle line:84%
There are people who are
depressed for good reason.

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:28.915 align:middle line:84%
You know, they're
not making ends meet.

00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:32.280 align:middle line:84%
But the answer to a
financial problem is what?

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.080 align:middle line:90%
Money.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.570 align:middle line:84%
It's not Prozac, it's
not an antidepressant.

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:37.010 align:middle line:84%
The answer to a
financial problem

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.410 align:middle line:84%
is to reduce your expenses
and increase your income,

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.252 align:middle line:90%
preferably at the same time.

00:07:41.252 --> 00:07:42.710 align:middle line:84%
So when we look at
depression, it's

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.698 align:middle line:84%
a multifactorial
exercise with depression.

00:07:45.698 --> 00:07:47.990 align:middle line:84%
There are a number of things
that can cause depression.

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:49.700 align:middle line:90%
It can be chemical.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.740 align:middle line:90%
A lot of it can be social.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.120 align:middle line:90%
A lot of it can be social.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.060 align:middle line:84%
We look at problems with
electromagnetic frequency

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.830 align:middle line:84%
stress, people
living around pylons,

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:01.580 align:middle line:84%
people living within 200
meters of a mobile phone mast.

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.220 align:middle line:84%
The lies that were banded
about by the telecommunications

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.040 align:middle line:84%
industry when they were
busy putting a mobile phone

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:12.120 align:middle line:84%
mast on every treetop and
every hillside around Britain.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.690 align:middle line:84%
We're unconscionable,
the idea that this thing

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:16.350 align:middle line:90%
wasn't going to hurt people.

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:19.640 align:middle line:84%
But it's causing all kinds of
problems with people's attitude

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.600 align:middle line:84%
with memory recall,
things like that.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.150 align:middle line:84%
Cancer, again, has been
traced back to this.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.030 align:middle line:84%
We've done a lot of publishing
over the years on depression,

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:32.733 align:middle line:84%
looking at other
aspects of hormones,

00:08:32.733 --> 00:08:34.400 align:middle line:84%
looking at a lot of
the work that people

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.169 align:middle line:84%
like Patrick Halford
have done over the years.

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:39.950 align:middle line:84%
Depression being linked
into certain irregularities

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.242 align:middle line:84%
in the body, which can be
corrected with nutrition.

00:08:42.242 --> 00:08:43.700 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very
interesting subject.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.225 align:middle line:84%
But I like starting on the
easy end of it and working in.

00:08:47.225 --> 00:08:48.980 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if
somebody is depressed,

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.447 align:middle line:84%
let's see if we
can find out why.

00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:52.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, let's look at
their life for a start

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.300 align:middle line:84%
and see if there's
anything there

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.010 align:middle line:84%
where there is a
legitimate cause for why

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:56.222 align:middle line:90%
they would be depressed.

00:08:56.222 --> 00:08:58.430 align:middle line:84%
I get interested when I find
people who are depressed

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:02.078 align:middle line:84%
and there's no obvious reason
why that should be the case.

00:09:02.078 --> 00:09:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And then we look at Professor
Malcolm MacLeod's studies

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:06.410 align:middle line:84%
on chromium
deficiency, which can

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:09.170 align:middle line:84%
cause that and several
others of these [INAUDIBLE]..

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:12.200 align:middle line:90%

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.000 align:middle line:90%
