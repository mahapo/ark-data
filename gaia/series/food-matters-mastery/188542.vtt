00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Father was a medical student
and he was in medical school

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.650 align:middle line:84%
and learned what everybody
else learned in medical school,

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.130 align:middle line:84%
namely you diagnose and
then you treat the disease.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.920 align:middle line:90%
And that's what he was doing.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.480 align:middle line:90%
But he had a problem.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And his problem was he had
very severe migraine headaches.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And by the time he
was through residency,

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.500 align:middle line:84%
he was sometimes laid up with
migraines two and three days

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.360 align:middle line:84%
a week in a dark room
with horrible, you know,

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.430 align:middle line:84%
light sensitivity, dark room
and nausea and all of that.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.700 align:middle line:84%
So he-- he had these
terrible migraines,

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.040 align:middle line:84%
and he asked his doctors
and teachers and professors

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.960 align:middle line:84%
and they all said,
"Well, just look it up.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.000 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing you can do.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000 align:middle line:84%
You'll feel better
when you're 55."

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.960 align:middle line:90%
"But I'm 25.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.090 align:middle line:90%
I can't face life like this."

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.780 align:middle line:84%
"Well, learn to live with it,"
which people still hear today

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.080 align:middle line:84%
from their doctors when the
doctors don't know what to do.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.480 align:middle line:84%
But he refused to
do that, decided

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.740 align:middle line:90%
he would have to find a way.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.430 align:middle line:90%
Well, he searched and searched.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.430 align:middle line:84%
He went to many
doctors and professors.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.450 align:middle line:90%
He studied.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.250 align:middle line:90%
He read.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.170 align:middle line:84%
He had literature translated
from other languages.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.610 align:middle line:90%
He really worked at it.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And finally, he found one
obscure little Italian journal

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.580 align:middle line:84%
talking about a woman
changing her diet

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.050 align:middle line:90%
and her migraines improved.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.850 align:middle line:90%
Diet?

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:34.030 align:middle line:90%
Diet?

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.100 align:middle line:84%
Nobody taught him
anything about diet.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.280 align:middle line:84%
He knew nothing
specific about diet.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.110 align:middle line:84%
But he thought, "No,
that's a new idea.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.330 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's an allergy
that's bothering me."

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.180 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so he started to play
around and change his diet.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And he decided that every
baby can digest milk.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.660 align:middle line:84%
He ought to be able to
do much better if he

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.520 align:middle line:90%
drank nothing but milk.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.690 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, he
didn't do at all better

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.670 align:middle line:84%
and was just as sick as before,
because milk is not for adults.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.290 align:middle line:90%
Milk is for babies.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.259 align:middle line:90%
And cow's milk is for baby cows.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.830 align:middle line:90%
So he looked for something else.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And they looked at our
physiological ancestors--

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't want any
religious problems here--

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.910 align:middle line:84%
and the simian animals
and vegetarians.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.130 align:middle line:84%
They ate roots
and nuts and seeds

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.740 align:middle line:84%
and they ate greens and leaves
and fruit and things like that.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.700 align:middle line:90%
So he decided he'd try that.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And living in Germany, apples
were always all year round,

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.540 align:middle line:90%
always ample and plentiful.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.520 align:middle line:84%
So he lived on nothing
but apples for a few days.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.630 align:middle line:90%
And he was free of migraines.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.390 align:middle line:84%
Baked apples and raw
apples and cooked apples

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.010 align:middle line:84%
and applesauce and apple
juice, nothing but apples.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Then he added one
thing after another.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes if he
added the wrong thing,

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.930 align:middle line:84%
he could have a headache, a
migraine within 20 minutes.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.300 align:middle line:84%
So he found out very quickly
these and these and these foods

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.880 align:middle line:84%
I can handle without being
sick, and these foods give me

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:11.680 align:middle line:90%
migraine.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.480 align:middle line:90%
Fine.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.280 align:middle line:84%
So he called it
his migraine diet.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.970 align:middle line:84%
Years later, when he settled
in his own private practice,

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.140 align:middle line:90%
people would come to him.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.170 align:middle line:84%
Among other things, some were
complaining of migraines.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And he told them,
"Look, all the books

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.300 align:middle line:84%
all the texts say that
migraine is incurable.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.040 align:middle line:90%
I had migraine.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing so and
so and so and so.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.230 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you try it?"

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And invariably the patients
would come back three,

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.600 align:middle line:84%
four weeks later and
say, "Yes, Doctor,

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.080 align:middle line:84%
as long as I stick to what
you told me, I'm fine.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.100 align:middle line:84%
But if I cheat, I
get a migraine."

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.270 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.660 align:middle line:84%
Until one patient
came to him and said,

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.130 align:middle line:84%
"Dr. Gerson, my migraines
are gone, and that's fine.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.160 align:middle line:84%
But I also had
skin tuberculosis,"

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.710 align:middle line:90%
so-called lupus vulgaris.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.300 align:middle line:90%
"And that is gone, too.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.770 align:middle line:90%
It's healing."

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.620 align:middle line:84%
So my father said, "No, no,
that's an incurable disease.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.200 align:middle line:84%
Must have been something
else because it has

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.320 align:middle line:90%
nothing to do with migraines."

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.950 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the guy pulls from
his pocket laboratory proof

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.630 align:middle line:84%
that yes, the lesions
had tuberculoid in it.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.650 align:middle line:84%
So my father said,
"Let me see that."

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at the
first time ever had a skin

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.070 align:middle line:90%
tuberculosis lesion healing.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And then he said,
"Well, my shingle--"

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.740 align:middle line:84%
he was trained by the famous
neurosurgeon neurologist

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.030 align:middle line:90%
Foerster in Breslau, Germany.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And his shingle read
internal and nerve diseases.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.300 align:middle line:90%
But look at this skin disease.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.820 align:middle line:84%
So he said, "I never
see patients like that.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:55.750 align:middle line:90%
Do you know others?

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:56.740 align:middle line:90%
It's relatively rare."

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.990 align:middle line:84%
"Oh, yes, a hospital
where I went."

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.980 align:middle line:90%
"Well, send me some.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.370 align:middle line:90%
I'll treat them free of charge.

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.540 align:middle line:84%
I just want to find
out whether it works."

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.070 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's what happened.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.690 align:middle line:90%
He sent patients.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.770 align:middle line:84%
The patients got
the migraine diet,

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.250 align:middle line:84%
and their lupus skin
tuberculosis healed.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And that came to the ears
of the famous lung TB

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.300 align:middle line:84%
specialist, which was
Ferdinand Sauerbruch in Munich.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And he couldn't
quite believe that.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.380 align:middle line:84%
But he invited my
father to come to Munich

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:38.200 align:middle line:84%
from where he was practicing
in Westphalia in Bielefeld.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.210 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Look,
we'll test it.

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And we'll take some TB patients,
skin tuberculosis patients

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.030 align:middle line:84%
and that are in
advanced condition.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.740 align:middle line:84%
And if you can even stop a
single one from advancing,

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.530 align:middle line:84%
I'll believe every
word you say."

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:05.590 align:middle line:84%
He took 450 advanced skin
tuberculosis patients,

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.130 align:middle line:90%
of which 446 recovered--

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.337 align:middle line:84%
didn't just stop,
recovered, healed.

00:06:12.337 --> 00:06:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And then he published all this,
of course, under his own name.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.510 align:middle line:90%
He was the big professor.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.420 align:middle line:84%
My father was just a little
country doctor, right?

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.990 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, that's how it happened.

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.230 align:middle line:84%
But my father wasn't
satisfied with this.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.320 align:middle line:84%
He figured, first of all,
what is the connection

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.160 align:middle line:90%
between migraine and TB.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.130 align:middle line:90%
He didn't understand that.

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:38.290 align:middle line:84%
The next thing was
if skin tuberculosis

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:41.500 align:middle line:84%
can heal with nutrition,
with the right diet, what

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.810 align:middle line:90%
had other forms of TB?

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And there was lots of people,
and especially young people,

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.460 align:middle line:84%
who had this so-called
galloping tuberculosis that

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.820 align:middle line:84%
were dying in their late
teens and their early 20s.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.870 align:middle line:84%
It was a killer
lung tuberculosis.

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And he figured we'll have to
try it on lung TB, on bone TB,

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:12.005 align:middle line:84%
on encephalitic brain TB, and
various others, kidney TB.

00:07:12.005 --> 00:07:15.760 align:middle line:84%
The TB is a German, wanders
all around the place, right?

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And he started to
practice in his practice

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:25.090 align:middle line:84%
to use this what he called
his migraine diet on TB,

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:26.800 align:middle line:90%
on other forms of TB.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.450 align:middle line:90%
And yes, it worked.

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's brought
him to Berlin where

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:34.520 align:middle line:84%
under the auspices of the
famous Berlin TB specialist,

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.320 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:41.770 align:middle line:84%
Then he had a whole bunch of
lung TB patients certified

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:46.930 align:middle line:84%
by three authorities to be
incurable that he cured.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:53.920 align:middle line:84%
But that's where his whole
training changed, because what

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.280 align:middle line:84%
he found in those cases
was these patients

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.110 align:middle line:90%
didn't just have TB.

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:01.720 align:middle line:84%
Many had high blood
pressure, low blood pressure.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.250 align:middle line:90%
Many had allergies.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Many had other problems,
kidney problems and so on,

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.800 align:middle line:90%
even though they were young.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And all their
problems disappeared.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's where he first
realized that he was not

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:18.490 align:middle line:90%
treating a disease.

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:22.180 align:middle line:84%
He was helping the body
to recover, to strengthen,

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.400 align:middle line:84%
the immune system
to kill the germs,

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.810 align:middle line:84%
but to also heal the
other chronic changes

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:32.919 align:middle line:84%
and diseases that
had already occurred.

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's where he
completely parted company

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:38.860 align:middle line:90%
with orthodox medicine.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's how he later was
able to cure multiple sclerosis

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:48.370 align:middle line:84%
and migraine headaches, and
of course, high blood pressure

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:51.070 align:middle line:84%
and heart disease and
all the other things.

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:55.090 align:middle line:84%
And yet, it took another
totally different experience

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:56.740 align:middle line:84%
before he was able
to cure cancer.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:59.400 align:middle line:90%


00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:04.710 align:middle line:84%
What happened there, way before
all of these TB situations

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:10.470 align:middle line:84%
worked out, a patient
called him one day

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:13.170 align:middle line:84%
and said, "Dr. Gerson, I'd
like you to come to my house--"

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:15.030 align:middle line:90%
he used to make home visits--

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:16.200 align:middle line:90%
"come to my house.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm sick I can't come."

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:19.980 align:middle line:90%
"So what's your problem?"

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:22.250 align:middle line:90%
She wouldn't say.

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:25.260 align:middle line:84%
He asked, but she
wouldn't answer.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.160 align:middle line:84%
He comes to the home of this
very sick lady, bedfast,

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:35.790 align:middle line:84%
and it turns out she has
stomach cancer with metastasis.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.980 align:middle line:90%
She had had surgery, came back.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.160 align:middle line:90%
She was very ill.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.670 align:middle line:90%
She was dying.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.910 align:middle line:84%
My father said, "I've
never dealt with cancer,

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:46.560 align:middle line:90%
and I don't know what to do."

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.900 align:middle line:90%
"Yes, yes, I know that.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.760 align:middle line:84%
But you know, on the
book on the table

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:55.010 align:middle line:84%
over there is a book about
healing, about folk medicine.

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:56.760 align:middle line:90%
I'd like you to read that.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.880 align:middle line:84%
It's very much like
what you are doing.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And maybe, you know,
we can combine that."

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:05.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, anyway, he wrote
up a treatment for her,

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:10.220 align:middle line:84%
which was very similar
to his TB treatment.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.790 align:middle line:90%
And she got better.

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:13.470 align:middle line:90%
High fever disappeared.

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:14.940 align:middle line:90%
Pain disappeared.

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.670 align:middle line:90%
She was able to eat and drink.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And my father was
supposed to come back.

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And then something most
interesting happened.

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.280 align:middle line:90%


00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:30.800 align:middle line:84%
When my father came the second
time, her husband was around.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:31.750 align:middle line:90%
And he was furious.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:33.220 align:middle line:84%
He said, "No, I
don't want anymore.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:34.850 align:middle line:84%
I go to the doctors
around here."

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And then he literally
threw him out.

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.447 align:middle line:90%
He threw my father out.

00:10:39.447 --> 00:10:40.780 align:middle line:90%
He said, "I don't want you here.

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:43.520 align:middle line:90%
Go."

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly enough, it
probably saved his wife's life,

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:52.340 align:middle line:84%
because what happened
normally, when

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:56.570 align:middle line:84%
he was treating TB patients,
after a certain degree

00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:02.840 align:middle line:84%
of recovery on this very
vegetarian salt-free diet,

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:08.000 align:middle line:84%
he would add things like a
little yolk of egg and things

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.170 align:middle line:84%
like butter and
things like that.

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And that would have
made tumors regrow.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:19.091 align:middle line:84%
But meantime, he'd been thrown
out, and she didn't add that.

00:11:19.091 --> 00:11:21.200 align:middle line:90%
So she recovered.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.430 align:middle line:90%
He didn't know.

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:27.120 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know that
until much later.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.210 align:middle line:84%
But she said three
other patients

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:32.480 align:middle line:84%
who did the same thing
who also recovered

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:37.680 align:middle line:84%
from cancer, spreading cancer,
that had been given up.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.320 align:middle line:90%
And he couldn't forget that.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And he tried again and tried
again later on in Vienna,

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:46.040 align:middle line:84%
after we had left Germany
and then in France.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.340 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't have good results.

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And it took a lot
additional study

00:11:53.270 --> 00:12:00.020 align:middle line:84%
before he found in various
research materials, also

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:05.180 align:middle line:84%
here in the US, in New York,
where at Sloan Kettering,

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:12.470 align:middle line:84%
they found that in patients who
had had cancer surgery, if they

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:16.550 align:middle line:84%
had high cholesterol,
they survived less well.

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:18.800 align:middle line:84%
They healed less well
than those patients

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.780 align:middle line:90%
who had low cholesterol.

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's when it started
to begin to jive in his mind

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:27.740 align:middle line:90%
that it's the fats.

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's when he started
to totally restrict fats.

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And when he restricted
yolk of egg and oils

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:38.860 align:middle line:84%
and butter and animal
fats, of course,

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.390 align:middle line:84%
the patients recovered
and stayed well

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:43.940 align:middle line:90%
and didn't get recurrences.

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And that came a good deal
later, after he had long

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:52.010 align:middle line:84%
been able to deal with
and very positively heal

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:54.210 align:middle line:90%
the other diseases.

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:56.390 align:middle line:84%
But the cancer was
very much dependent

00:12:56.390 --> 00:13:00.110 align:middle line:90%
on completely eliminating fats.

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And he did that till
one year before he died.

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:08.100 align:middle line:84%
He was getting
tremendous results.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:16.820 align:middle line:84%
But he had tried and tried to
include in the patient's diet

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:19.340 align:middle line:90%
the essential fatty acids.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.680 align:middle line:90%
He knew they were necessary.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.560 align:middle line:84%
Yet he also knew
whenever he tried,

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:27.080 align:middle line:84%
no matter he tried
oils and fats,

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.150 align:middle line:84%
he tried every kind
of oil he could

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:32.450 align:middle line:84%
think of-- the sunflower, the
safflower oil, the olive oil,

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:36.680 align:middle line:84%
the nut oils, the cottonseed
oil, all of these things.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And patients who already had
completely eliminated any tumor

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:44.600 align:middle line:84%
tissue, it would
make new tumors grow

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.370 align:middle line:90%
when he gave them these fats.

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:49.400 align:middle line:84%
He even tried a little
unsalted fresh butter.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.050 align:middle line:90%
Made no difference.

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:57.680 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, his book, which
came out in early 1958,

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:01.460 align:middle line:84%
in several places it
says no fats, no oils,

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.190 align:middle line:84%
because he found over
and over and over again,

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:06.110 align:middle line:84%
with every kind
of oil and fat he

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:09.380 align:middle line:84%
tried, that it would
bring tumors back,

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:11.960 align:middle line:84%
even though the patients
had already recovered

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.970 align:middle line:90%
and the tumors were gone.

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:17.450 align:middle line:90%
It stimulated regrowth.

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:21.230 align:middle line:84%
Until-- and that was
after the book came out--

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:27.050 align:middle line:84%
until he ran across the work
of Dr. Johanna Budwig, who

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:33.470 align:middle line:84%
found the one oil that the
tumor-bearing patient can

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:34.850 align:middle line:90%
handle.

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's flaxseed oil,
the organic flaxseed oil.

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:44.700 align:middle line:90%
And that rang a bell.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:46.100 align:middle line:90%
And he tried it.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And not only it worked, it
worked to improve his results.

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:53.150 align:middle line:84%
But this was after
the book was finished

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:56.720 align:middle line:90%
in the last year of his life.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And he found that not
only the oils helped

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:06.590 align:middle line:84%
to carry the vitamin A, because
vitamin A is all soluble,

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:10.790 align:middle line:84%
it helped to carry
vitamin A into the system

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:12.230 align:middle line:90%
and to the tumor tissue.

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And it helped to kill
malignant tissue.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.000 align:middle line:90%
It did more.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.610 align:middle line:84%
The omega-3s helped to
clear the plaque out

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:25.360 align:middle line:84%
of the arteries so
that there was better

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.910 align:middle line:84%
circulation,
improved circulation.

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:30.610 align:middle line:84%
So he had better
results when he was

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:36.222 align:middle line:84%
able to add the
organic flaxseed oil.

00:15:36.222 --> 00:15:37.180 align:middle line:90%
And that's what he did.

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:42.070 align:middle line:84%
But it didn't get into the
book until I added Appendix 1,

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:46.090 align:middle line:84%
and I explain that
situation in the book, OK?

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:49.240 align:middle line:90%
But we still use flaxseed oil.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.030 align:middle line:90%


00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:53.190 align:middle line:90%
And it works.

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:56.200 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.000 align:middle line:90%
