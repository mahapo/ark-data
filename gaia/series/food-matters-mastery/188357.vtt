00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:08.540 align:middle line:90%


00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I've been doing
this kind of work for so long

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.440 align:middle line:84%
in the trenches,
one-on-one with people,

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.580 align:middle line:84%
people who've been doing
raw food for 20 years,

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.340 align:middle line:84%
people who've never
heard of organic food,

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.950 align:middle line:84%
people who've been organic but
are just turning themselves

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.460 align:middle line:90%
onto organic and raw foods--

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.580 align:middle line:84%
because of that body of
work and that time out

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.560 align:middle line:84%
there amongst the
people, we've been

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.830 align:middle line:84%
able to distill down
or literally juice down

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.870 align:middle line:84%
what the essential requirements
are to take you from A to Z

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.900 align:middle line:84%
as fast as possible with
these without suffering,

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.090 align:middle line:84%
without pain, without regret,
without guilt, fear, or shame.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.870 align:middle line:90%
It comes down to two steps.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.320 align:middle line:84%
Number 1 is adding into your
diet fresh organic vegetable

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.430 align:middle line:90%
juices--

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.755 align:middle line:84%
celery juice, celery cucumber
juice, celery cucumber apple.

00:01:01.755 --> 00:01:03.380 align:middle line:84%
You just put it
through a juice machine

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.030 align:middle line:84%
and drink it right
there on the spot.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.110 align:middle line:84%
This has an ability
to bring life force

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.250 align:middle line:84%
energy to the tissues
almost instantaneously

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.900 align:middle line:90%
within 15 minutes.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's a technology that
we've known about for probably

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.330 align:middle line:90%
about 80 to 100 years.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.020 align:middle line:84%
It was very popularized by
Dr. Norman Walker in the 1940s

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.740 align:middle line:84%
and '50s, brought to prominence
by my friend Jay Kordich.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And then now we're
in an evolved stage

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.880 align:middle line:84%
where people know
what juicers are.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.797 align:middle line:84%
They know that they can
do this kind of thing.

00:01:33.797 --> 00:01:35.172 align:middle line:84%
Health food stores
that they have

00:01:35.172 --> 00:01:37.280 align:middle line:84%
in their local neighborhoods
have juice machines.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And now we've just
got to get on it.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.540 align:middle line:84%
We've just got to say,
every day I do that.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.980 align:middle line:84%
I have 12 ounces, 16 ounces
of fresh vegetable juice.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.960 align:middle line:90%
Step 2 is adding in superfoods.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.180 align:middle line:84%
This is a language that
everyone can speak.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.790 align:middle line:84%
It's a subconscious kind
of prejudice that we have,

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:58.790 align:middle line:90%
which is very important.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.998 align:middle line:84%
And that is we'd rather get
our vitamins and minerals

00:02:00.998 --> 00:02:05.430 align:middle line:84%
from food versus
supplements and chemicals.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.550 align:middle line:84%
This has led people naturally
to discover superfoods

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.950 align:middle line:84%
and discover that
certain foods have

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.590 align:middle line:84%
an extraordinary quality
of vitamins and minerals

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.810 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of
co-factors and enzymes

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.600 align:middle line:84%
and special chemicals that, for
example, will cause us to live

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.850 align:middle line:84%
longer, will cause
our skin to be

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.080 align:middle line:90%
softer, et cetera, et cetera.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.700 align:middle line:84%
We've categorized
these as superfoods.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.000 align:middle line:90%
And here's what they include.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.270 align:middle line:84%
In one class, we'll start
with the B products--

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.460 align:middle line:84%
wild honey, wild bee
pollen, royal jelly.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.650 align:middle line:84%
Things that are
collected by the bees

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.520 align:middle line:84%
have this extraordinary quote,
unquote, "superfood quality."

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.450 align:middle line:84%
In Russia, they did 150 years
of research on longevity.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And they found that the
people who live the longest

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.500 align:middle line:90%
were beekeepers.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.230 align:middle line:84%
In my experience, I've found
that the longest lived people

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.020 align:middle line:84%
that I personally
know are beekeepers.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.510 align:middle line:84%
So there's some
interesting truth to it.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.602 align:middle line:84%
In days of old before there were
superfoods all over the planet,

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:07.310 align:middle line:84%
the way you would do
it was bee products.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.282 align:middle line:84%
Now, fortunately, we've
got other choices.

00:03:09.282 --> 00:03:10.490 align:middle line:90%
What are those other choices?

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.320 align:middle line:90%
Well, we've got the algaes.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.345 align:middle line:90%
People like, ah, algae?

00:03:13.345 --> 00:03:14.720 align:middle line:84%
This is un-- I'm
not going to eat

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.568 align:middle line:90%
the algae growing in my pool.

00:03:16.568 --> 00:03:18.110 align:middle line:84%
This is not what
we're talking about.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.080 align:middle line:84%
Some algaes are edible
just for example.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.090 align:middle line:84%
Like some tree saps are
edible, some aren't.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.050 align:middle line:84%
Maple sap is edible but, for
example, pine sap is, you know,

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.800 align:middle line:84%
not going to be edible,
because it's going

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.960 align:middle line:90%
to glue your mouth together.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.500 align:middle line:84%
If you can tune
into just one or two

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.785 align:middle line:84%
of these kind of
superfood algaes,

00:03:35.785 --> 00:03:37.910 align:middle line:84%
sometimes you might be able
to discover that you've

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.040 align:middle line:84%
found something that
works so great for you,

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.257 align:middle line:90%
you can't believe it.

00:03:41.257 --> 00:03:42.590 align:middle line:90%
But you can't know till you try.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:43.390 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Spirulina, blue/green algae from
Klamath Lake, and chlorella.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.650 align:middle line:84%
These are the top three
in the algae world.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.160 align:middle line:84%
Spirulina was consumed in Mexico
City as the primary protein

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.440 align:middle line:90%
source for 5,000 years.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Spirulina is the highest protein
content food in the world.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.420 align:middle line:84%
The Max Planck Institute
discovered that 50% of protein

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.420 align:middle line:84%
is destroyed in any food
once you cook the food.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.860 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, superfood,
plant-based protein sources

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.010 align:middle line:84%
are going to be a key
food of the future.

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.230 align:middle line:90%
Guess which ones we have?

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.178 align:middle line:84%
Spirulina, blue/green
algae, chlorella.

00:04:20.178 --> 00:04:22.470 align:middle line:84%
They're some of the highest
protein foods in the world.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.680 align:middle line:90%
They're more than 60% protein.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.660 align:middle line:84%
The next category, of
course, is the goji berry.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.140 align:middle line:84%
Goji berries is a
product that I originally

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.140 align:middle line:90%
brought to the internet.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.510 align:middle line:84%
First person to actually bring
that product onto the internet,

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.093 align:middle line:84%
to bring awareness
about that product,

00:04:37.093 --> 00:04:39.950 align:middle line:84%
bring the first organic goji
berries into the marketplace,

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.850 align:middle line:84%
and bring awareness that there
is a berry out there that

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.760 align:middle line:90%
is a complete protein source.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.630 align:middle line:84%
There is a berry out there that
contains all 18 amino acids

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.460 align:middle line:84%
that are required for
excellent nutrition, health,

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.487 align:middle line:84%
physical robustness,
and mental alertness.

00:04:56.487 --> 00:04:58.070 align:middle line:84%
There is a berry out
there that really

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.220 align:middle line:90%
does contain longevity factors.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.425 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the goji berry is
the only food ever discovered

00:05:04.425 --> 00:05:06.050 align:middle line:84%
in the history of
the world to actually

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.350 align:middle line:84%
help stimulate the production
of human growth hormone

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.370 align:middle line:90%
naturally--

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.260 align:middle line:90%
your own human growth hormone.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Goji berries contain betaine,
which is a liver detoxifier

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.480 align:middle line:84%
and cleanser which we need
now more than ever, because we

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.720 align:middle line:84%
have so many toxins
in our environment.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.960 align:middle line:84%
Goji berries are one of the
highest antioxidant sources

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.640 align:middle line:90%
ever in anything.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.310 align:middle line:90%
They're right on par with acai.

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.195 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing higher
than goji berries and acai

00:05:31.195 --> 00:05:35.890 align:middle line:84%
in antioxidants is cacao,
which is our next superfood.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.670 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we've seen this
word C-O-C-O-A, "cocoa,"

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.650 align:middle line:84%
and people get that
confused with coconuts,

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.210 align:middle line:84%
and they get that
confused with kola nuts.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.450 align:middle line:90%
And what is cocoa?

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:47.290 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:52.540 align:middle line:84%
It's really the word is
"cacao," C-A-C-A-O, cacao beans.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And this is the food or
the nut that all chocolate

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:56.860 align:middle line:90%
is made out of.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.540 align:middle line:84%
This food is very likely
the most powerful food

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.220 align:middle line:84%
in the world, and
it's very likely

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.690 align:middle line:90%
the food that could save us.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.190 align:middle line:84%
Because chocolate can only be
grown in an intact rainforest

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.240 align:middle line:90%
environment.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.830 align:middle line:84%
If we cut down
the rainforest, we

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.490 align:middle line:84%
destroy the ability to
grow the cacao tree.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:20.740 align:middle line:84%
This tree actually produces a
huge quantity of cacao beans

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.540 align:middle line:90%
all year around.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.660 align:middle line:84%
Chocolate is the only
fruit other than noni

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.060 align:middle line:90%
that's always in season.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.450 align:middle line:90%
So chocolate's always good.

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.200 align:middle line:84%
It's always a good
time to have chocolate.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.740 align:middle line:84%
That to me is an
amazing discovery.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:33.670 align:middle line:90%
What a concept.

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:35.170 align:middle line:84%
You can eat chocolate
all year long,

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.510 align:middle line:90%
and it's always in season?

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.030 align:middle line:84%
There's no other
fruit like that.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.270 align:middle line:84%
Chocolate is truly
and botanically a nut

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.630 align:middle line:84%
because it is the seed
of a tropical fruit tree.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.000 align:middle line:84%
The fruit of cacao--
the cacao fruit,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.590 align:middle line:90%
the actual flesh of the fruit--

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.710 align:middle line:84%
is awesome and rivals the
top fruits in the world.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.060 align:middle line:90%
Just want to put that out there.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Because if you ever
have the opportunity--

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.900 align:middle line:84%
you're in the tropics somewhere
in a big cacao-growing nation

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.480 align:middle line:84%
like Ecuador or Peru or
Brazil or Costa Rica,

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.260 align:middle line:84%
you can actually get whole,
fresh cacao fruits and eat

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.113 align:middle line:90%
them--

00:07:09.113 --> 00:07:10.780 align:middle line:84%
the whole thing,
everything-- the fruit,

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.460 align:middle line:84%
the flesh, the
seeds, everything.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.500 align:middle line:90%
And it is-- it's a high.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.360 align:middle line:84%
It's what people are
really looking for.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, why do
people take drugs?

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:22.780 align:middle line:84%
Because they feel terrible, so
they're trying to feel better,

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.490 align:middle line:90%
they're trying to feel good.

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:25.465 align:middle line:90%
Well, check it out.

00:07:25.465 --> 00:07:27.340 align:middle line:84%
If you actually have
the best nutrition ever,

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.970 align:middle line:90%
you feel good all the time.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And if you do drugs, it
actually takes you down.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.990 align:middle line:84%
Because you're already higher
than the drugs can take you.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:40.030 align:middle line:84%
That is critical information
for, for example,

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:41.440 align:middle line:90%
drug rehab centers.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.570 align:middle line:84%
It's critical to know that
instead of taking people

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.383 align:middle line:84%
off drugs and onto
coffee and cigarettes

00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:47.800 align:middle line:84%
that you could
take them off drugs

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.920 align:middle line:84%
and get them onto cacao
beans and goji berries

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.020 align:middle line:84%
and really have
people feeling good

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:54.940 align:middle line:84%
and getting what
they're missing,

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.910 align:middle line:84%
which is causing the need for
the drugs in the first place.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:01.390 align:middle line:84%
Cacao beans stack up
on the mineral content

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:03.220 align:middle line:90%
against anything in the world.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.190 align:middle line:84%
I'll put cacao up against any
food in the world on mineral

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:07.060 align:middle line:90%
content.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.200 align:middle line:84%
It's the highest natural
source of magnesium.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.230 align:middle line:84%
It's the highest natural
source of chromium.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:15.550 align:middle line:84%
It's very likely the highest
natural source of iron.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:18.520 align:middle line:84%
It's very likely the highest
natural source of manganese.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.150 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the highest
contents of zinc.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.110 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the highest
contents of copper.

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.960 align:middle line:84%
All the co-factors needed
for healthy metabolism,

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.520 align:middle line:90%
it's in the cacao bean.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:31.780 align:middle line:84%
It has the highest level
of vitamin C of any nut

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.299 align:middle line:90%
or seed in the world.

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:35.510 align:middle line:90%
That is astonishing.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:38.350 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the highest vitamin
C content foods in the world,

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:41.350 align:middle line:84%
but all processed chocolate
has no vitamin C in it

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:44.800 align:middle line:84%
because heat destroys
vitamin C. It has the highest

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.640 align:middle line:90%
antioxidant content.

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.930 align:middle line:84%
That means that if we are really
going to take advantage of what

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:53.530 align:middle line:84%
we learned in nutrition-- that
antioxidants protect us from

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:57.490 align:middle line:84%
DNA damage, viral
damage, cancer,

00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:00.860 align:middle line:84%
protect us from skin damage,
et cetera, et cetera--

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.890 align:middle line:84%
how do we heal ourselves
from all those things

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:04.900 align:middle line:84%
or prevent those
things from happening?

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.520 align:middle line:90%
Eat more chocolate.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.930 align:middle line:90%
What a concept.

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:09.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's
unbelievable, and it's

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:13.930 align:middle line:84%
always been right in
front of our face forever.

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:16.030 align:middle line:84%
It's always been
right there, the thing

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:17.680 align:middle line:90%
that could actually save us.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.610 align:middle line:84%
This to me indicates a higher
intelligence is at work.

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:24.760 align:middle line:84%
It indicates to me that God is
kind of always just throwing

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.290 align:middle line:90%
clues at us.

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And because it's a
free will experiment,

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:30.460 align:middle line:90%
we can either say yes or no.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.620 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, we
said no for a while.

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:36.850 align:middle line:84%
We decided that we could improve
God's original food or nature's

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:39.730 align:middle line:84%
original food or the creator's
original food or higher

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:41.740 align:middle line:84%
intelligence's original
food or whatever

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:44.410 align:middle line:84%
by cooking, processing,
roasting, broasting,

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:46.630 align:middle line:90%
microwaving, whatever.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:49.360 align:middle line:84%
Can we actually improve what
has already been created?

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is maybe, but
not the way we've been doing it.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.020 align:middle line:84%
We've got to work with nature
and with natural phenomenon,

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.970 align:middle line:84%
because nature's figured
out how to produce

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:01.750 align:middle line:84%
this stuff over some
exorbitant amount of time

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:02.920 align:middle line:90%
in the heart of God's love.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And then we came along and
said, oh, that's all wrong.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:08.170 align:middle line:90%
We can do it better.

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.750 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the reasons
why not only are we oriented

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:13.940 align:middle line:84%
towards superfoods, but we're
oriented towards raw foods

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.490 align:middle line:90%
and original and natural foods.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:19.330 align:middle line:84%
Can you actually
live on raw food?

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And I've been doing
it for 13 years.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And the amazing thing is
that I'm still alive actually

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:25.840 align:middle line:90%
compared to what I heard.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.060 align:middle line:84%
People said your ear
is going to fall off,

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.820 align:middle line:84%
your toenails are going
to crack, or whatever.

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:32.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I heard
everything possible,

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.240 align:middle line:90%
and people were sincere.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.740 align:middle line:84%
They really thought
maybe, you know,

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:37.115 align:middle line:84%
this guy's gone
off the deep end.

00:10:37.115 --> 00:10:39.730 align:middle line:90%
But they were sincerely wrong.

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:42.220 align:middle line:84%
It's like people have said,
hey, you can't fly a plane,

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:43.033 align:middle line:90%
you'll crash.

00:10:43.033 --> 00:10:44.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're flying in
planes all the time now.

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:46.810 align:middle line:84%
Good thing we didn't
listen to those people.

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:47.860 align:middle line:90%
This is important.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.920 align:middle line:84%
This is how science
advances-- real science, not

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.210 align:middle line:90%
contrived science.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:55.330 align:middle line:84%
But real science
advances by the pioneers

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:59.080 align:middle line:84%
step out, do the research,
experiment on themselves,

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.860 align:middle line:84%
make the discoveries, add the
information to the general body

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:03.940 align:middle line:90%
of education.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.090 align:middle line:84%
People pick it up and go,
you know, that makes sense.

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:08.388 align:middle line:90%
These people did the research.

00:11:08.388 --> 00:11:09.430 align:middle line:90%
We're going to go for it.

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:11.590 align:middle line:84%
They do it themselves
and feel it.

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:14.080 align:middle line:84%
Nutrition is very different
than other sciences

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.970 align:middle line:90%
in this particular respect.

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And that is,
nutrition is something

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:22.730 align:middle line:84%
you feel in your body, in
your heart, in your mind,

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:24.010 align:middle line:90%
and it's not esoteric.

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:26.110 align:middle line:84%
It's not something far
away where you're going,

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:30.310 align:middle line:84%
well, I think that guy told
me that I need to do this

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:32.290 align:middle line:90%
or I think this is good for me.

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:33.100 align:middle line:90%
You feel it.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:33.900 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.570 align:middle line:84%
If you take something for a
while and your body says no,

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:37.888 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be a no.

00:11:37.888 --> 00:11:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And if you take
something brand new--

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:41.430 align:middle line:84%
let's say it's goji
berries-- and your body goes

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:44.410 align:middle line:84%
yes, yes, yes, keep going,
you're onto it, keep going.

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:46.810 align:middle line:84%
This is something
you intuitively know.

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:50.200 align:middle line:84%
I feel very strongly
that the best

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:54.160 align:middle line:84%
doctor in the world, the best
nutritionist in the world

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.020 align:middle line:90%
is you.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.400 align:middle line:84%
You actually have
everything inside you,

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:02.170 align:middle line:84%
all the equipment necessary
to feel if something

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:03.740 align:middle line:90%
is right for you or not.

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:07.090 align:middle line:90%
