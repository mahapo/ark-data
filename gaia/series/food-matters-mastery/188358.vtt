00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.100 align:middle line:84%
>> 15, maybe even 20 million
Americans are dealing with

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.900 align:middle line:90%
diabetes.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.000 align:middle line:90%
I think it's a very high number.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.680 align:middle line:84%
The type 2 diabetes is
generally considered

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.610 align:middle line:90%
to be a lifestyle disease.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's the one
where we really

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.790 align:middle line:84%
should be immediately
making the changes--

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.230 align:middle line:84%
avoiding the junk food, avoiding
all the fat and the sugar,

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.210 align:middle line:84%
lowering the calories, and
getting people exercising.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.910 align:middle line:84%
Exercise, which costs
you absolutely nothing,

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.320 align:middle line:90%
has incredible benefits.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And everybody knows it, but
nobody wants to admit to it.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.130 align:middle line:90%
It's the basic stuff.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.570 align:middle line:90%
We are what we eat.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.940 align:middle line:84%
If we eat a lot of junk,
if we eat too much of it,

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.590 align:middle line:90%
we're going to have issues.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.290 align:middle line:84%
It would be surprising if
a malnourished body did not

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.790 align:middle line:90%
have Type 2 diabetes.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.060 align:middle line:84%
It would be surprising if a
person who never exercised

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.460 align:middle line:90%
did not develop diabetes.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.140 align:middle line:84%
People don't consume
enough chromium.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.790 align:middle line:84%
They don't consume
enough B vitamins.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.300 align:middle line:84%
They're under stress
on top of that,

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.330 align:middle line:90%
which causes B vitamin washout.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.340 align:middle line:90%
Vitamin C is a factor as well.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Vitamin C helps
regulate blood sugar.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.980 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Emanuel Cheraskin,
Professor of Oral Medicine

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.280 align:middle line:84%
at the University of
Birmingham, Alabama,

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.600 align:middle line:84%
talked about how vitamin C
helps to regulate blood sugar,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.490 align:middle line:84%
and yet you won't find anything
about it in texts on diabetes.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.710 align:middle line:84%
When people take
more vitamin C, they

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.680 align:middle line:84%
seem to have less trouble
with sugar fluctuations.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.880 align:middle line:84%
So B vitamins,
vitamin C, chromium--

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.190 align:middle line:90%
these are very powerful tools.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.140 align:middle line:84%
Diabetes is
basically two types--

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.830 align:middle line:84%
Type 1 which is called insulin
dependent or juvenile diabetes,

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.100 align:middle line:84%
and then Type 2 which
is adult onset diabetes.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.920 align:middle line:84%
As far as juvenile
diabetes goes,

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.900 align:middle line:84%
I think there's
still a whole lot

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.210 align:middle line:84%
to be learned exactly
what causes it,

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.550 align:middle line:90%
but there are some flags.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.100 align:middle line:90%
One is dairy products.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.160 align:middle line:84%
In some children,
introducing cow's milk

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.560 align:middle line:90%
too early can be a problem.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And although I am a farmer
or a dairymen myself--

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.440 align:middle line:84%
I used to milk 120
head twice a day,

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.220 align:middle line:84%
I tend to give dairy
products a thumbs up--

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.140 align:middle line:84%
I think they are
not for all people.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.180 align:middle line:84%
I especially am cautious about
the milk that people consume,

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.870 align:middle line:84%
because it's been so treated
and the cows have been so

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.880 align:middle line:90%
heavily treated and medicated.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.950 align:middle line:84%
So my view is if you're
going to have milk,

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.210 align:middle line:90%
it should be organic milk.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's better
to have yogurt and cheese,

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.810 align:middle line:84%
fermented foods where nature
and bacteria have had a chance

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.970 align:middle line:90%
to improve their value to you.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.100 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, Dr.
Carlton Fredericks,

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.970 align:middle line:84%
a famous nutritionist who
had a radio program that

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.830 align:middle line:84%
was constantly getting
canceled because he

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.630 align:middle line:90%
offended the sponsors--

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Carlton Fredericks said that
if a sugar diabetic, Type 1

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.770 align:middle line:84%
or a insulin-dependent
diabetic were

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.560 align:middle line:84%
to take very high doses
of B complex vitamins,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.870 align:middle line:84%
they could be weaned
off of insulin.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.210 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the first
real zingers I had ever seen.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, mm, weaned
off of insulin on vitamins?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.052 align:middle line:90%
That's quite a statement.

00:03:12.052 --> 00:03:13.510 align:middle line:84%
The more I looked
into it, the more

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.690 align:middle line:84%
I realized that there
was something to it.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And when I began working
with diabetic clients,

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.370 align:middle line:84%
I suggested to them
that they might

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.980 align:middle line:84%
want to try high
doses of vitamins

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.730 align:middle line:84%
with intelligent co-operation
and feedback to their doctor.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.530 align:middle line:84%
After all, if they're
on [AUDIO OUT],,

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.920 align:middle line:84%
they had better communicate with
the doctor that put them on it.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.400 align:middle line:90%
This is no joke.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.930 align:middle line:84%
So I said, how about you try
what Dr. Fredericks was hinting

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.220 align:middle line:84%
at and that the research is also
supporting and take B complex,

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.630 align:middle line:84%
all the B vitamins, maybe
a tablet every two hours,

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.310 align:middle line:90%
and some extra chromium?

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.320 align:middle line:84%
Chromium seems to help
even out blood sugar,

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.880 align:middle line:84%
and the B vitamins
do that as well.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.190 align:middle line:90%
So these people would do that.

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.357 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say, remember, you
got to go to your doctor.

00:03:56.357 --> 00:03:58.300 align:middle line:84%
Because if this
works, you're going

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.620 align:middle line:84%
to need your insulin dose
adjusted down right away.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.347 align:middle line:90%
And they did exactly that.

00:04:04.347 --> 00:04:06.430 align:middle line:84%
They took the vitamins,
they went to their doctor,

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.530 align:middle line:84%
and they immediately had
reductions in their insulin

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.800 align:middle line:90%
dose.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.570 align:middle line:90%
And these were Type 1 diabetics.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And generally a
juvenile diabetic

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.980 align:middle line:84%
can be expected to not
be cured of the illness.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.190 align:middle line:84%
What is the value of
reducing the maintenance

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.990 align:middle line:90%
dose of insulin?

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:21.970 align:middle line:90%
I think it's tremendous.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.070 align:middle line:90%
It just makes good sense.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.470 align:middle line:84%
On the sideline
with diabetes, we

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.110 align:middle line:84%
know that diabetics
often have trouble

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.650 align:middle line:84%
with other things such as
circulation in their eyes

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.780 align:middle line:90%
or their fingers or their toes.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And while this isn't
a cure for diabetes,

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.820 align:middle line:90%
it's good news for diabetic.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.280 align:middle line:84%
Diabetics who take
vitamin E as in Edward

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.060 align:middle line:84%
in, say, 800 units a day
or more are much less

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.960 align:middle line:84%
likely to have retinopathy
or the difficulties

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.600 align:middle line:84%
in circulation in
the extremities.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.630 align:middle line:84%
Doctors Wilfred and Evan Shute
found this out by accident

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.850 align:middle line:84%
when they were treating
cardiovascular disease.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.670 align:middle line:84%
They found out that it had a
special benefit for diabetics.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.180 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they had
one patient who

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.130 align:middle line:84%
was supposed to have an
amputation of the lower

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.450 align:middle line:90%
half of one leg.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.340 align:middle line:90%
And they were scheduled for it.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And they gave them lots
and lots of vitamin E.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:13.875 align:middle line:90%
You have nothing to lose.

00:05:13.875 --> 00:05:15.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean to be
cynical, but nothing

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.160 align:middle line:90%
to lose except the limb.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, the vitamin
E was so successful,

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.220 align:middle line:90%
they just took off a toe.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.470 align:middle line:84%
This is the kind of information
that is at least interesting.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.070 align:middle line:84%
Doctors Wilfred and Evan Shute
were both fully qualified

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.870 align:middle line:90%
physicians.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.990 align:middle line:84%
They lived in London,
Ontario, Canada.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.700 align:middle line:84%
They practiced for
over three decades.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.470 align:middle line:84%
They treated over
30,000 patients.

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.930 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't get published
in regular medical journals,

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.680 align:middle line:90%
so they started their own.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.560 align:middle line:90%
It was called, "The Summary."

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.780 align:middle line:84%
This information
is hard to find.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:51.695 align:middle line:90%
It shouldn't be.

00:05:51.695 --> 00:05:54.020 align:middle line:84%
It should be really
easy to find.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.900 align:middle line:84%
This is the kind of information
that the Diabetes Association

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.190 align:middle line:90%
should be talking about--

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.300 align:middle line:90%
take more vitamins.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.990 align:middle line:84%
For Type 2 diabetes, a lot of
it is associated with bad diet

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.580 align:middle line:90%
and being overweight.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Overweight is such
a huge problem now

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.130 align:middle line:84%
that in the United States,
perhaps as many as 3/4

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.010 align:middle line:84%
of the population
are overweight.

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And an enormous 1/3 are
seriously overweight.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.040 align:middle line:84%
We're talking people
that are way higher.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.250 align:middle line:84%
10, 15 pounds, we're not going
to lose any sleep over that.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.970 align:middle line:84%
Even 25 pounds, we're not
going to really worry.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.260 align:middle line:84%
But when it's 80 or
100 or 120 or 200,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.300 align:middle line:84%
that is trouble
waiting to happen.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.800 align:middle line:90%
We have to change this.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Less sugar, less
fat, more veggies.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.590 align:middle line:84%
When we get into a plant-based
diet, a high fiber diet,

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:41.960 align:middle line:84%
the weight will
automatically come down.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.570 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
actually go on a diet.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.010 align:middle line:90%
It's just a lifestyle.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:51.830 align:middle line:84%
B complex vitamins,
chromium also

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.160 align:middle line:84%
are very valuable for
the type 2 diabetic.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, avoiding
sugar is a good idea.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.660 align:middle line:84%
There may be some other hints
that can be added to that.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.020 align:middle line:84%
At DoctorYourself.com,
I have a whole rundown

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.090 align:middle line:90%
on that on diabetes.

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Abram
Hoffer actually has

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.960 align:middle line:84%
reviewed that particular
article and has commented on it.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.200 align:middle line:90%
