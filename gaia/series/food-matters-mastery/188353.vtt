00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Depression is the
number one topic searched

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.200 align:middle line:90%
for on DoctorYourself.com.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.360 align:middle line:84%
That's the biggest concern,
as far as I can tell,

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.725 align:middle line:90%
from my readers at least.

00:00:20.725 --> 00:00:22.100 align:middle line:84%
I hope after
reading the website,

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.160 align:middle line:90%
they'll be a lot more cheerful.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.230 align:middle line:84%
I think depression is
primarily nutrient deficiency.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.870 align:middle line:84%
For people that are really
sick, psychotic, schizophrenic,

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.190 align:middle line:84%
it could be a
nutrient dependency.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.570 align:middle line:84%
We know from history
that there was

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.020 align:middle line:84%
a time when people were
eating a lot of corn

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.300 align:middle line:84%
in the southern United
States, and corn

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.130 align:middle line:90%
is very low in tryptophan.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.210 align:middle line:84%
Tryptophan's converted
in the body to niacin.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And because they
ate a lot of corn,

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.150 align:middle line:84%
they weren't getting
enough tryptophan,

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.360 align:middle line:84%
which means they weren't
getting enough niacin.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And there were a large
number of people in the South

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.330 align:middle line:84%
during the depression
that had pellagra.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.580 align:middle line:84%
Pellagra is the vitamin
B3 deficiency disease.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:23.090 align:middle line:84%
The four Ds-- dermatitis,
diarrhea, dementia, and death.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.680 align:middle line:90%
A very serious illness.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.860 align:middle line:84%
There is no drug in the world
that will cure pellagra,

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.050 align:middle line:90%
only vitamin B3 and niacin.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.020 align:middle line:90%
Now think about that.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.010 align:middle line:84%
Deficiency in B3
eventually will kill you,

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.330 align:middle line:84%
but first it will cause
dermatitis and diarrhea.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.365 align:middle line:90%
Now you might miss that.

00:01:42.365 --> 00:01:44.700 align:middle line:84%
That could be caused
by a lot of things.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And those are not real
serious illnesses.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.980 align:middle line:84%
But dementia, now that's
another one entirely.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.580 align:middle line:84%
So what happened was as soon
as food fortification was

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.750 align:middle line:84%
introduced and niacin
was put into foods,

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.600 align:middle line:84%
there was much less
pellagra in the south.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.990 align:middle line:84%
Just from a tiny little bit of
niacin, the amount of pellagra

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.740 align:middle line:90%
plummeted in just a few years.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.820 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Abram Hoffer-- the
psychiatrist, medical doctor,

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.090 align:middle line:90%
nutrition PhD, and researcher--

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.370 align:middle line:84%
thought that maybe the people
that still had dementia simply

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.500 align:middle line:84%
hadn't gotten a high
enough dose of niacin,

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.810 align:middle line:84%
that their personal
need was higher.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't
have a deficiency.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.580 align:middle line:90%
They had a dependency.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.240 align:middle line:90%


00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.310 align:middle line:84%
So he started giving
them thousands

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.390 align:middle line:90%
of milligrams of niacin a day.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And these people with
dementia or psychosis

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.570 align:middle line:84%
or schizophrenia, 90%
of them were carried.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.400 align:middle line:84%
So when we look at
depression, I think

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.150 align:middle line:84%
the first thing we should do
is look at nutrient deficiency.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.560 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we take
animals and see

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.290 align:middle line:90%
how we can make them depressed?

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.300 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm a big believer
in animal rights,

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.213 align:middle line:84%
but I will sacrifice an
animal or 2 or 10 or 100

00:02:57.213 --> 00:02:58.880 align:middle line:84%
if it will save your
grandmother's life.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm willing to do that.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.490 align:middle line:90%
I have that viewpoint.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I think that
animal research by and large

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.500 align:middle line:90%
should be avoided.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean to sound like
I'm confusing the point there,

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.690 align:middle line:84%
but I think that we can do
animal research compassionately

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.960 align:middle line:84%
in the same way we can
milk cows compassionately.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.160 align:middle line:90%
It's just an opinion.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.530 align:middle line:90%
So let's say we take monkeys.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.420 align:middle line:90%
We take two groups of monkeys.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And we make one group
nutrient deficient,

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.490 align:middle line:84%
and we give the other
group lots of vitamins.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.670 align:middle line:84%
We will notice that the group
that's nutrient deficient

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.910 align:middle line:90%
is going to have poor behavior.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.500 align:middle line:90%
They're going to be depressed.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.810 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
become demented.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.720 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to
behave in a normal way.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.810 align:middle line:84%
This is true with cats,
and it's already been done.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.830 align:middle line:84%
Francis M. Pottenger
Junior, a physician,

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.470 align:middle line:84%
tracked several
generations of cats.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.260 align:middle line:84%
I think five or more
generations of cats.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.620 align:middle line:90%
He had them in two groups.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.910 align:middle line:84%
One group got raw food,
and the other group

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.130 align:middle line:90%
got all cooked food.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.150 align:middle line:90%
The raw food group did fine.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.990 align:middle line:84%
The cooked food group
developed all the diseases

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.220 align:middle line:90%
that people get--

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.740 align:middle line:84%
allergies, asthma, arthritis,
cancer, heart disease,

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.420 align:middle line:90%
depression, and dementia.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, Pottenger thought
that was pretty interesting.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.790 align:middle line:90%


00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.490 align:middle line:84%
But what was really
interesting was

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:25.570 align:middle line:84%
when he took the
group that was sick

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.100 align:middle line:84%
and gave them the fresh
food, they all got better.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.130 align:middle line:84%
So I think the solution
is just that simple.

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.480 align:middle line:84%
I think we're having trouble
seeing the trees because

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.220 align:middle line:90%
of the forest.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.182 align:middle line:84%
We're having a difficult time
accepting a simple therapy.

00:04:43.182 --> 00:04:44.140 align:middle line:90%
Here's what you can do.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.630 align:middle line:84%
If someone's depressed,
the first thing they can do

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.510 align:middle line:84%
is know that it's
OK to be depressed.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.490 align:middle line:84%
If you're malnourished,
you should be depressed.

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.580 align:middle line:90%
So don't do that anymore.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.150 align:middle line:90%
Go and eat good food.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And I defy anyone who is
depressed to feel depressed

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.310 align:middle line:84%
if they have a couple of nice
big, fresh vegetable salads

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.780 align:middle line:84%
and lots and lots of fresh
fruit and nuts and seeds

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.180 align:middle line:90%
and good food chewed well--

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.770 align:middle line:90%
fresh, organic, and wholesome.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.380 align:middle line:84%
I defy anybody to
try that for a month

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.330 align:middle line:84%
and tell me that
they feel depressed.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.560 align:middle line:90%
That's the first thing.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.442 align:middle line:84%
The second thing is
niacin, vitamin B3 niacin.

00:05:22.442 --> 00:05:24.400 align:middle line:84%
If you're depressed and
you want to feel better

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.980 align:middle line:84%
in less than 15 minutes,
take 250 to 500 milligrams

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.600 align:middle line:90%
of pure niacin.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.570 align:middle line:90%
That will cause a flush.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.170 align:middle line:84%
You'll look like
you have a sunburn,

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.600 align:middle line:84%
or you'll feel like
you're having a hot flash,

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.980 align:middle line:84%
and you will not feel
depressed if you do that.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.680 align:middle line:84%
That's a nice temporary
way of testing this theory

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.500 align:middle line:90%
about vitamin B3.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.090 align:middle line:84%
If a person is down and
miserable and depressed

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.830 align:middle line:84%
and they take high
doses of niacin,

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.320 align:middle line:84%
they will notice an
immediate improvement.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.500 align:middle line:84%
I worked with a lady once
who was suicidally depressed.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.780 align:middle line:84%
She lived at home
with her family.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.030 align:middle line:90%
She was in her 50s.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And she spent all day sitting
in a corner, face to the corner.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.250 align:middle line:90%
She wouldn't talk to anyone.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.840 align:middle line:90%
She wouldn't eat with anyone.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.272 align:middle line:90%
She was totally uncommunicative.

00:06:13.272 --> 00:06:14.980 align:middle line:84%
She was under the care
of a psychiatrist,

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.150 align:middle line:90%
of course, as she should be.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And the psychiatrist had her
on a variety of medications,

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.520 align:middle line:90%
which you would expect.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.860 align:middle line:84%
The family was wondering
about nutrition.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned to them about
Dr. Hoffer's work with niacin.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And they wondered how
much she needed to take.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.930 align:middle line:84%
This person was
very seriously ill.

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned that
Dr. Hoffer normally

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.320 align:middle line:84%
gave about 3,000
milligrams a day of niacin,

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.140 align:middle line:84%
but some people need a lot more,
especially very sick people,

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.730 align:middle line:84%
and they should give her as much
as it takes to make her better.

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, they figured
they could do that.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.110 align:middle line:84%
So at 11,500 milligrams
of niacin a day,

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.110 align:middle line:84%
she was sitting at the
table and talking to them

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.900 align:middle line:90%
like nothing had happened.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:01.270 align:middle line:84%
Now if you or I took 11,5000
milligrams of niacin,

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.070 align:middle line:90%
we would be glowing beet red.

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.370 align:middle line:84%
We would have such an
intense niacin flush

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.980 align:middle line:84%
and probably we would have
other symptoms too-- itching,

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.180 align:middle line:90%
maybe even nausea.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.770 align:middle line:84%
But for her, because she
had a vitamin dependency,

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:18.220 align:middle line:84%
that was the amount for
her which made her better--

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:23.650 align:middle line:84%
11,500 milligrams
of niacin a day.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:25.810 align:middle line:84%
So they went to
the psychiatrist,

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:29.200 align:middle line:84%
showed the psychiatrist
this recovered person,

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.637 align:middle line:84%
and the psychiatrist
said, well, I

00:07:30.637 --> 00:07:32.470 align:middle line:84%
don't think you should
take all that niacin.

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:34.160 align:middle line:90%
It might be harmful.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.748 align:middle line:84%
So they stopped
giving her the niacin,

00:07:37.748 --> 00:07:39.040 align:middle line:90%
and she was back in the corner.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.560 align:middle line:90%


00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.020 align:middle line:90%
Safety with niacin?

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:50.758 align:middle line:84%
There is not one death from
niacin per year on average.

00:07:50.758 --> 00:07:52.300 align:middle line:84%
There have been one
or two attributed

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.810 align:middle line:84%
over the last 15 or 20
years, but there's not even

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.750 align:middle line:90%
one death per year from niacin.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And how many people
that are suicidally

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:06.670 align:middle line:84%
depressed actually go
and end their lives?

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:07.900 align:middle line:90%
Tremendous tragedy.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.970 align:middle line:84%
So if niacin can help
that lady's depression,

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.320 align:middle line:90%
think what it can do for yours.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.180 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] So there's two
things you could do.

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.050 align:middle line:84%
Now the third thing is
high doses of vitamin C,

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.720 align:middle line:84%
because vitamin C in
high doses actually

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:24.130 align:middle line:84%
helps you make certain chemicals
which improve your mood.

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
is eat lots of foods

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.680 align:middle line:90%
that contain tryptophan--

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:33.940 align:middle line:84%
cashews, the dark meat
of chicken and turkey.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.610 align:middle line:84%
Nuts in general are
high in tryptophan.

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And that tends to improve
mood tremendously.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.710 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you look
at cashews, they

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:52.270 align:middle line:84%
have so much tryptophan in them
that two handfuls of cashews

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:55.895 align:middle line:84%
give you the therapeutic
equivalent of a prescription

00:08:55.895 --> 00:08:56.695 align:middle line:90%
dose of Prozac.

00:08:56.695 --> 00:08:59.900 align:middle line:90%


00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:03.020 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
tryptophan in cashew nuts.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.550 align:middle line:84%
Now everyone then says,
oh, but two cash--

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:09.620 align:middle line:84%
two handfuls of cashews,
isn't that fattening?

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:12.105 align:middle line:90%
And my point is, do you care?

00:09:12.105 --> 00:09:13.730 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to get
over the depression?

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, if you
eat two handfuls of cashews,

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:17.690 align:middle line:84%
you think you're
going to be hungry?

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:20.310 align:middle line:84%
You think you're going
to want anything else?

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:26.300 align:middle line:84%
So there is a case and point
where cashews, also beans--

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.190 align:middle line:84%
dairy products
contain tryptophan--

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:31.550 align:middle line:90%
these are antidepressant foods.

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:33.440 align:middle line:84%
Armed with this
knowledge-- vitamin

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:41.660 align:middle line:84%
C, fresh, raw organic food and
plenty of it, cashews, niacin.

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:44.960 align:middle line:84%
I think since all of them
work to eliminate depression,

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.640 align:middle line:84%
I would say the
cause of depression

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.857 align:middle line:90%
is failure to take them.

00:09:48.857 --> 00:09:50.315 align:middle line:84%
You see, the big
danger of vitamins

00:09:50.315 --> 00:09:51.860 align:middle line:90%
is not taking too many.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.110 align:middle line:90%
It's taking too few.

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:56.600 align:middle line:84%
The public has been
warned off the very thing

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.840 align:middle line:84%
that they should
be doing more of.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.360 align:middle line:84%
The medical profession
has it wrong.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.670 align:middle line:84%
Even the medical schools
that offer nutrition

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:08.000 align:middle line:84%
do not offer mega
dose nutrition.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.370 align:middle line:84%
Even the medical
schools that have

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:16.460 align:middle line:84%
courses in alternative medicine
are not really focusing on it.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:20.390 align:middle line:84%
I believe they're
just giving it a nod.

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:23.167 align:middle line:84%
The answer is for
every person to realize

00:10:23.167 --> 00:10:24.750 align:middle line:84%
that if you want
something done right,

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:26.450 align:middle line:90%
you have to do it yourself.

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:28.790 align:middle line:84%
You have to read,
you have to dig,

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:31.040 align:middle line:84%
you have to want to
have this information,

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.020 align:middle line:84%
and, of course, I
might add you have

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.090 align:middle line:84%
to be willing to actually
take the vitamins

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:37.670 align:middle line:84%
and actually juice
the vegetables.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:40.230 align:middle line:90%
You have to walk the walk.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:41.480 align:middle line:90%
Of course, it's worth it.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.200 align:middle line:90%
