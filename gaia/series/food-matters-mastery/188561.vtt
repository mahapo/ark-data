00:00:09.687 --> 00:00:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Breast cancer patients
is a good example.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.530 align:middle line:84%
The first recommendation,
I would probably

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.050 align:middle line:84%
do a 30-day Gerson
Plus program, just

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.450 align:middle line:84%
to get your body's
nutrition, immune system, up

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.792 align:middle line:90%
and running as best you can.

00:00:19.792 --> 00:00:21.375 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have
time for that, go in

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:23.080 align:middle line:84%
and have the surgery
done immediately.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.360 align:middle line:84%
But if you do have the time, do
a 30-day presurgical treatment.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.835 align:middle line:84%
Then go in and have a
simple lumpectomy done.

00:00:29.835 --> 00:00:32.880 align:middle line:84%
The director of the AMA,
about five years ago,

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.680 align:middle line:90%
published this statement.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.810 align:middle line:84%
There is absolutely
no difference

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.010 align:middle line:84%
in five-year survival rates
between simple lumpectomy,

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.760 align:middle line:84%
simple mastectomy,
radical mastectomy.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.150 align:middle line:84%
Why are we doing so many
radical mastectomies,

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.200 align:middle line:90%
disfiguring all these women?

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.850 align:middle line:84%
No reason to do it,
except maybe money?

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.556 align:middle line:90%


00:00:56.556 --> 00:01:00.300 align:middle line:84%
A simple lumpectomy
is just as effective.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.160 align:middle line:84%
Go in and do the
simple lumpectomy,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.510 align:middle line:84%
One more thing on that,
even if you have--

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.360 align:middle line:84%
and this isn't just for breast
cancer, any kind of cancer--

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.810 align:middle line:84%
even if you have active
cancer in the lymph nodes,

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.640 align:middle line:84%
my recommendation is do
not remove any lymph nodes.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.310 align:middle line:84%
Once you start destroying
lymph node chains,

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.790 align:middle line:84%
the lymph node circulation
never comes back.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.540 align:middle line:84%
The patient's abilities,
healing and otherwise,

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.050 align:middle line:84%
are always compromised,
especially when

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.610 align:middle line:84%
for the most part
surgery, radiation,

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.340 align:middle line:90%
and chemo are not curative.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.260 align:middle line:84%
As the director of the
AMA already stated,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.110 align:middle line:84%
the American Medical
Association, less than 30%

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.680 align:middle line:84%
of the patients survive
independent of the stage

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.740 align:middle line:90%
they come in.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.430 align:middle line:84%
So if it's not curative,
why destroy yourself,

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.330 align:middle line:90%
why maim yourself?

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.840 align:middle line:90%


00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.000 align:middle line:84%
The future in medicine as
I see it is the following.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.020 align:middle line:84%
If we look at where medicine
was 25 years ago, to where

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.470 align:middle line:84%
it is now, we see major
improvement and major steps

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.640 align:middle line:90%
forward.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.530 align:middle line:84%
When I first started
almost 30 years ago,

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.190 align:middle line:84%
I figured it would take
probably most of my lifetime

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.770 align:middle line:84%
before we would begin to
see major changes take place

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.910 align:middle line:84%
within the legal
system that would allow

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.820 align:middle line:84%
nutritional medicine
to be part of what

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.790 align:middle line:90%
is used on an everyday basis.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.970 align:middle line:84%
"Time" magazine had an
article a few years back

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.560 align:middle line:84%
about the revolution in
medicine that's taking place.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And alternative medicine
is becoming more and more

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.630 align:middle line:84%
at a forefront
leader in treatment.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.980 align:middle line:84%
On almost every street corner
now in the United States,

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.400 align:middle line:84%
you see a sign go
up at a doctor's

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.340 align:middle line:84%
or chiropractor's office,
alternative medicine down here.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, what do they mean
by alternative medicine?

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's different from what
conventional medicine typically

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.330 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.410 align:middle line:84%
You see more and more
physicians using nutraceuticals,

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.698 align:middle line:90%
using healthier things.

00:03:08.698 --> 00:03:10.240 align:middle line:84%
We're heading in
the right direction.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.290 align:middle line:90%
Are we there yet?

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.150 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.990 align:middle line:84%
In California, as an
example, where I live,

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.790 align:middle line:84%
it's still a felony to
not suggest and/or use

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.630 align:middle line:84%
chemotherapy, surgery, or
radiation for a cancer patient.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.600 align:middle line:84%
We have to move away from
this mindset and this control,

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.290 align:middle line:84%
strict control on medicine,
and go to therapies

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.390 align:middle line:90%
that are used around the world.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.100 align:middle line:84%
In the United States, a lot
of even conventional drugs

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.310 align:middle line:84%
are not available that are used
in other countries like Canada,

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.690 align:middle line:84%
like Australia, like
England, and Germany.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.910 align:middle line:84%
We need to change the mindset
of our legislators everywhere,

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:05.700 align:middle line:84%
worldwide, to look back at
the thousands and thousands--

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.250 align:middle line:84%
probably now in the
millions of patients--

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.770 align:middle line:84%
who have used alternative
approaches to heal disease.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.839 align:middle line:84%
There is a vast
database out there.

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:23.190 align:middle line:84%
Conventional medicine needs
to start looking at it more.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.960 align:middle line:84%
Legislators need to
start looking at it more.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.870 align:middle line:84%
If someone is intelligent
enough to go to medical school,

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.900 align:middle line:84%
and pass the exams,
and get licensed,

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.610 align:middle line:84%
they should also be
intelligent enough

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.390 align:middle line:84%
to use what is a treatment
program that should work well

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.200 align:middle line:90%
for the patient.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.260 align:middle line:84%
If the patient is paying
for the treatment,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.977 align:middle line:90%
they should be able to choose--

00:04:47.977 --> 00:04:50.310 align:middle line:84%
have the freedom to choose
the treatment that they think

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.110 align:middle line:90%
is best for them.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.320 align:middle line:90%


00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.670 align:middle line:84%
In this day of
informed consent, you

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.560 align:middle line:84%
must inform your patient of all
the reactions that take place,

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.880 align:middle line:84%
or all about the probable
ones, so the patient

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.460 align:middle line:84%
knows the pros and cons of the
treatment they're undergoing.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.188 align:middle line:84%
And if the doctor wants to
make the choice to use this,

00:05:12.188 --> 00:05:13.980 align:middle line:84%
and if the patient
wants to make the choice

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.290 align:middle line:84%
to use this, why
should it not be used,

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.503 align:middle line:84%
especially when it has
such a proven track record?

00:05:18.503 --> 00:05:19.920 align:middle line:84%
Things like the
Gerson therapy now

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.690 align:middle line:84%
has close to a
100-year track record.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And the Gerson Plus
therapy has a track record

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.210 align:middle line:90%
now of over 20 years.

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.300 align:middle line:90%
And it's been proven to have--

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:43.050 align:middle line:84%
even in the patient base that
we have of the cancer patients,

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.810 align:middle line:84%
over 92% of them being
end-state disease,

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.060 align:middle line:84%
the Gerson Plus therapy
has a proven track record

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.670 align:middle line:84%
of having at least a 25%
increase in overall patient

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.820 align:middle line:84%
survival rates in
that patient base.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.790 align:middle line:90%


00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.920 align:middle line:90%
What are they so scared of?

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.560 align:middle line:84%
Why do they not want
to use something

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.870 align:middle line:84%
that has a proven track
record worldwide to work?

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.340 align:middle line:90%


00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.250 align:middle line:90%
Is it financial?

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:15.030 align:middle line:90%


00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.060 align:middle line:90%
Is that it just doesn't work?

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.140 align:middle line:90%
That part isn't true.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.520 align:middle line:90%
We've already proven that.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:26.490 align:middle line:84%
So what is the reason why
we don't have more access

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:33.240 align:middle line:84%
to health care that meets
basic needs, changes diet

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:38.430 align:middle line:84%
and lifestyle, which now has
a marvelous worldwide track

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.740 align:middle line:90%
record?

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Hundreds and hundreds of
studies done, on every continent

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.050 align:middle line:84%
practically in the
world, that shows

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:51.485 align:middle line:84%
that whole food, plant-based
diets cure patients.

00:06:51.485 --> 00:06:52.610 align:middle line:90%
Why don't we use that more?

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.640 align:middle line:90%


00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.570 align:middle line:84%
If you do something
proactive about your health,

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:04.440 align:middle line:84%
if you take action, there
is absolutely no reason

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.700 align:middle line:90%
why you can't get well.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.150 align:middle line:90%
