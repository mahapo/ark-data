00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Indirectly, the food
industry's contributing

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.960 align:middle line:84%
to epidemics of nutritionally
related disorders and disorders

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.910 align:middle line:84%
that are of an inheritable
nature that may not have been

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.930 align:middle line:84%
expressed if the population
was eating properly.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.370 align:middle line:84%
I think the public need to have
more education in terms of what

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.228 align:middle line:90%
they can do for their health.

00:00:32.228 --> 00:00:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe that the
medical profession need

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.580 align:middle line:84%
to be honest, and
medical science

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.080 align:middle line:84%
needs to be honest
and say, we don't

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.450 align:middle line:90%
have cures for a lot of things.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.820 align:middle line:84%
And the effects
of our treatments

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.688 align:middle line:90%
are often highly toxic.

00:00:44.688 --> 00:00:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes their
treatments may actually

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.980 align:middle line:84%
accelerate the process and
progression of a disease.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And we take cancer
again, for example,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.430 align:middle line:84%
cancer cells just love
inflammatory mediators.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you've got
inflammation in your system,

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.010 align:middle line:84%
you've got a greater
risk of getting cancer.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.740 align:middle line:84%
If you produce
more inflammation,

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.240 align:middle line:84%
you've got a greater risk of
that cancer growing and growing

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.040 align:middle line:90%
rapidly.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.594 align:middle line:84%
Now, what produces
inflammation in the hospital?

00:01:11.594 --> 00:01:13.215 align:middle line:90%
Well, it could be stress.

00:01:13.215 --> 00:01:14.590 align:middle line:84%
But more likely,
it's going to be

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:21.580 align:middle line:84%
the surgeon's knife and the
wound itself becoming inflamed.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.950 align:middle line:84%
Radiotherapy produces
burns and inflammation.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And how often have
you seen somebody

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.820 align:middle line:84%
who's had one or two nodules
on their breast radiated,

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.400 align:middle line:84%
and six months later they've
got them all over their chest,

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.108 align:middle line:84%
in both breasts, in
their lungs, and they

00:01:35.108 --> 00:01:36.880 align:middle line:90%
die within a few weeks?

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.180 align:middle line:84%
The radiotherapy itself
kills off some of the tumors

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.240 align:middle line:84%
but produces inflammation
that stimulates nests of cells

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.190 align:middle line:90%
elsewhere in the body.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.980 align:middle line:84%
Chemotherapy and the killing
of cancers themselves

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.220 align:middle line:90%
can result in more inflammation.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.960 align:middle line:84%
So the issue here is that we
must look at what is called

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.350 align:middle line:84%
the "anti-inflammatory diet,"
the fish and the vegetarian

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.000 align:middle line:84%
style of diet and raw
foods, which are very,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.590 align:middle line:84%
very important as well because
we now know that fish oils

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.860 align:middle line:84%
and substances present
in vegetables can act

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.630 align:middle line:90%
as anti-inflammatory agents.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.440 align:middle line:84%
And we have some wonderful
anti-inflammatory herbs.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Turmeric, for example,
is a very powerful

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.250 align:middle line:90%
anti-inflammatory spice.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.820 align:middle line:84%
It's been used traditionally
for thousands of years

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.220 align:middle line:84%
and is very effective
in arthritis.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.640 align:middle line:84%
But also in some
studies, it's been

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.370 align:middle line:84%
shown to be effective in
treating cancer as well.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.240 align:middle line:84%
So I don't have any problem
at all in educating the public

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.010 align:middle line:84%
and also, at the
same time, educating

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.510 align:middle line:90%
my professional colleagues.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And there does need to be a
change in the way people think

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.530 align:middle line:84%
at universities as well
as in other institutions

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.420 align:middle line:84%
because there's too
much emphasis on looking

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.730 align:middle line:90%
for the next breakthrough drug.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, tell me the
last real breakthrough

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.710 align:middle line:84%
drug that we've had that
hasn't been, to some extent,

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.820 align:middle line:84%
toxic, or highly toxic,
or even killed people?

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.520 align:middle line:90%


00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.687 align:middle line:84%
Synthetic drugs are
important in modern medicine,

00:03:08.687 --> 00:03:10.270 align:middle line:84%
but they are not
the-- they should not

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.180 align:middle line:84%
be the first-rank
therapy in any patient,

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.330 align:middle line:84%
including in severe
illnesses unless it's

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.828 align:middle line:90%
going to be lifesaving.

00:03:17.828 --> 00:03:21.320 align:middle line:90%


00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.820 align:middle line:84%
Richard Nixon came
out and said, I'm

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.570 align:middle line:84%
going to give you $2
billion, and you'll

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:25.740 align:middle line:90%
find a cure for cancer.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.120 align:middle line:90%
Now, how long ago was that?

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.000 align:middle line:90%


00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.640 align:middle line:84%
They had the temerity and hubris
in the early 1980s to say,

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.860 align:middle line:84%
we'll have a vaccine
for AIDS, the HIV virus,

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.660 align:middle line:90%
within five years.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.600 align:middle line:84%
I said, we won't have
one within 20 years

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.100 align:middle line:84%
because you don't understand
what the HIV virus is

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.900 align:middle line:90%
and what it does.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And they still don't, and they
still haven't got a vaccine.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.000 align:middle line:84%
We have to have a
different way of thinking.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.760 align:middle line:84%
We have to be able to
look at the chemistry

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.530 align:middle line:84%
and the biochemistry
of the cell,

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.840 align:middle line:84%
and what's-- and the
functions inside the cell,

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.900 align:middle line:84%
and change them before we
get cell changes that result

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.630 align:middle line:84%
in pathology that we can
see under the microscope,

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.700 align:middle line:84%
or we can feel
through the breast,

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.860 align:middle line:90%
or hear through the stethoscope.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.810 align:middle line:84%
By the time you've got
that gross pathology--

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.860 align:middle line:84%
this is called gross anatomy,
or gross anatomical pathology,

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.380 align:middle line:90%
it's too late for many people.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.460 align:middle line:84%
The changes occur
biochemically possibly 20 years

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.190 align:middle line:90%
before you get the disease.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.970 align:middle line:84%
Diabetes, for example, the
changes in diabetic patients

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.800 align:middle line:84%
occur a long time before
the blood sugar goes astray

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.710 align:middle line:90%
in most cases.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.260 align:middle line:84%
The changes in cancer,
probably the same--

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.210 align:middle line:84%
deficiencies of
essential fatty acids,

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.250 align:middle line:84%
deficiencies of selenium,
high intakes of chemicals,

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.660 align:middle line:84%
disturbances to the immune
system by various viruses,

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:53.460 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And some of these things can
be measured, and some of them--

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.410 align:middle line:84%
and we need more
subtle measurements

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.870 align:middle line:84%
in the early stages
before we get

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.150 align:middle line:84%
the lump in the breast
where we biopsy it, produce

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.580 align:middle line:84%
more inflammation, and
stimulate the lump grow.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.020 align:middle line:90%
It's too late.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.200 align:middle line:84%
Most women who've
got a breast lump

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.130 align:middle line:84%
have got a deficiency
of selenium.

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.875 align:middle line:84%
They've got thyroid
under a hyper--

00:05:13.875 --> 00:05:16.440 align:middle line:84%
hypoactivity of
the thyroid gland.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.550 align:middle line:84%
These are contributing factors
to the breast cancer growing.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.170 align:middle line:84%
They're often overweight,
again a contributing factor.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:27.240 align:middle line:84%
They're often eating saturated
fats, meat, and milk,

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.580 align:middle line:90%
and other heavy foods.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.405 align:middle line:84%
And then these
saturated fats again

00:05:31.405 --> 00:05:33.030 align:middle line:84%
contribute to the
growth of the cancers

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.860 align:middle line:90%
and the spread of cancers.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.890 align:middle line:84%
We've got enough
information now to be

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.970 align:middle line:84%
able to make some
major changes, but it's

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.830 align:middle line:84%
got to be a change of
attitude and education

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.460 align:middle line:84%
of the public and education
of the professionals with that

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.342 align:middle line:90%
information we've got.

00:05:49.342 --> 00:05:51.360 align:middle line:84%
If I say to you,
oh, look, we've got

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.120 align:middle line:84%
something that will help
somebody with cancer, so where

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.860 align:middle line:84%
are the double-blind, placebo,
controlled crossover studies?

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.770 align:middle line:84%
These are the so-called
gold standard studies

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.610 align:middle line:90%
that medicine insists.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And if I say, I
haven't got a study

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.150 align:middle line:84%
to show that if you stop eating
steak three times a week that's

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.500 align:middle line:84%
marbled with-- full of fat,
and fried, and fries four times

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.160 align:middle line:84%
a week, I've got some
good epidemiological data,

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.520 align:middle line:84%
good studies to show that that
will reduce your risk of cancer

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.640 align:middle line:84%
and that that will reduce
the risk of spread of cancer,

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.580 align:middle line:84%
but I can't show you a
population of people who've

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.150 align:middle line:84%
been put on that sort of a diet,
and they've all been cured.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:31.950 align:middle line:90%
We can't do that.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.408 align:middle line:84%
And those sort of
studies, I think,

00:06:33.408 --> 00:06:38.310 align:middle line:84%
are probably not
worth their while.

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.940 align:middle line:84%
But I can show you studies that
have been done in, for example,

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.530 align:middle line:84%
the Lin Xian Province in China,
which has got the highest

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.840 align:middle line:84%
rate of cancer
from mouth to anus

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.720 align:middle line:84%
through the gut, the
esophagus, the intestines,

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.410 align:middle line:84%
and the stomach,
and the large bowel.

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:57.420 align:middle line:84%
This was a study
that was published

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:02.370 align:middle line:84%
by William Blot in the
"Journal of the National Cancer

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.200 align:middle line:90%
Institute" in America.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.850 align:middle line:84%
They showed that supplementation
with beta carotene, vitamin E,

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:14.640 align:middle line:84%
and selenium could reduce
the incidence of cancer

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:20.010 align:middle line:84%
in one part in the
gut by up to 24%.

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And they looked
at 30,000 people--

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.210 align:middle line:90%
huge study.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.660 align:middle line:84%
So 24 people out of
every 100 over a period

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.390 align:middle line:84%
of five years on this
supplement did not get cancer

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:32.220 align:middle line:90%
when they were expected to--

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.340 align:middle line:84%
selenium, beta
carotene, and vitamin E.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:38.010 align:middle line:90%
24%, that's 24 out of 100.

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Multiply that by
30,000, and you've

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.260 align:middle line:84%
got a huge number
of people who didn't

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.693 align:middle line:84%
get the cancer when they're
expected to statistically.

00:07:45.693 --> 00:07:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And we know that these
things will protect you

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:49.260 align:middle line:90%
against cancer.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260 align:middle line:84%
Other studies have been
done again with selenium

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.500 align:middle line:90%
to show that it is protective.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:00.540 align:middle line:84%
But there's no money in selenium
because the pill that was given

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:04.540 align:middle line:84%
to the Chinese people
compared to the placebo,

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.830 align:middle line:84%
which was a sugar pill, the
active pill only costs about

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:10.740 align:middle line:84%
$0.10 to $0.15 a
day at the most.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.750 align:middle line:90%
And there's no profit in there.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:15.390 align:middle line:84%
There's no money to
go back into research.

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:18.070 align:middle line:84%
There's no-- there's not
the millions of dollars

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:21.300 align:middle line:84%
that are required for these
very expensive studies.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.880 align:middle line:84%
So there's very little
work done in this area

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:27.150 align:middle line:84%
because the only
profits are made

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:31.080 align:middle line:84%
by inventing a chemical
that is protected

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.950 align:middle line:84%
by a patent and
therefore, of course,

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:37.000 align:middle line:84%
large, huge margins
on simple chemicals.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.750 align:middle line:90%
