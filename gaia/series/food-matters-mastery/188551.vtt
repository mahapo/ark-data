00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.740 align:middle line:84%
>> And when they do talk about
nutrition in medical school,

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.790 align:middle line:84%
it's basically the
five food groups.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.310 align:middle line:90%
Maybe a multi vitamin every day.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.350 align:middle line:84%
Possibly a B12 injection
for people that are elderly.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.490 align:middle line:84%
Maybe for pregnant women, we'd
better increase the folic acid

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.390 align:middle line:90%
a little bit.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.630 align:middle line:84%
We should fortify foods with
small amounts of nutrients.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.210 align:middle line:84%
Since we took all
the nutrients out,

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.840 align:middle line:84%
we should put a
few of them back.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.430 align:middle line:84%
That's like being
held up and having

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.740 align:middle line:84%
somebody take $1,000 from you
and giving you a 5 in change.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.450 align:middle line:84%
It's a very strange
world that we have

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.650 align:middle line:84%
when nutrition is the last
thing we look at for therapy.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.560 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Roger J. Williams
who actually discovered

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.180 align:middle line:84%
the vitamin pantothenic acid
and was Professor of Chemistry,

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.980 align:middle line:90%
very, very brilliant man.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.650 align:middle line:84%
He was introducing the concept
of biochemic individuality

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.910 align:middle line:90%
back in the 1940s.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And in the 1950s, he
wrote a series of books.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And into the 60s, on the
nutritional treatment

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.140 align:middle line:90%
of alcoholism.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.720 align:middle line:90%


00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Abram Hoffer worked
with Bill W., the founder

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.170 align:middle line:90%
of Alcoholics Anonymous.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And Bill W. and Abram
became good friends.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.370 align:middle line:84%
Bill W. suffered from
severe depression.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Abram said you should
take some niacin.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.380 align:middle line:84%
He suggested 3,000
milligrams of niacin a day.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.050 align:middle line:84%
That was the end of
Bill W.'s depression.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.330 align:middle line:84%
Bill W. then suggested
to people that

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.120 align:middle line:84%
were alcoholic, why don't
you try taking niacin

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.830 align:middle line:84%
and see if it helps
your depression.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.440 align:middle line:90%
See if it helps your alcoholism.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And the majority of the
people that tried the niacin

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.690 align:middle line:90%
had great improvement.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.480 align:middle line:84%
So Bill W., founder of
Alcoholics Anonymous,

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.380 align:middle line:84%
wanted AA to use niacin
and vitamin therapy.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.720 align:middle line:84%
But AA, which had
already been infiltrated,

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.420 align:middle line:84%
I would say is a good word,
by the medical profession,

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.840 align:middle line:90%
rejected that.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.590 align:middle line:84%
So to this day,
Alcoholics Anonymous

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.970 align:middle line:84%
focuses on many laudable steps
that alcoholics can and should

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.800 align:middle line:90%
do to stop drinking.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.300 align:middle line:84%
But it does not recommend
vitamin therapy.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.160 align:middle line:84%
We have a nation where the very
thing that will help people

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.980 align:middle line:84%
is being presented as
actually dangerous.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.480 align:middle line:84%
There have been
studies that purport

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.900 align:middle line:84%
to show that if you take an
extra multivitamin every day

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.220 align:middle line:90%
that it's going to hurt you.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.940 align:middle line:90%
And that's just nonsense.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.960 align:middle line:84%
There are studies that purport
to say that vitamin C will

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.670 align:middle line:90%
cause a kidney stone.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've searched
the medical literature.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And I've asked all
my students to search

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.970 align:middle line:84%
the medical literature and
my colleagues to search it.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as they
find scientific evidence

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.750 align:middle line:84%
of a vitamin C caused kidney
stone, send me the paper,

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.070 align:middle line:90%
send me the reference.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.360 align:middle line:84%
It's been 30 years and
I've never gotten one.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.020 align:middle line:84%
Now either everybody's
dumb or it's a myth.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.400 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's a myth.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.740 align:middle line:84%
A vitamin C caused kidney
stone is a lot like a unicorn.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.450 align:middle line:84%
Now you can imagine a unicorn
in your mind's eye right now.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.920 align:middle line:84%
You could draw a unicorn
if I asked you to.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.610 align:middle line:84%
Everyone knows what a unicorn
is, but they don't exist.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.290 align:middle line:84%
Well everyone knows
what a vitamin C

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.540 align:middle line:90%
caused kidney stone is.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.250 align:middle line:90%
But no one's ever seen one.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.960 align:middle line:90%
Because they don't exist.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.390 align:middle line:84%
This is just an example, even
the Journal of the American

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.880 align:middle line:84%
Medical Association has
said that vitamin C doesn't

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.220 align:middle line:90%
cause kidney stones.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And I get letters which
are just so moving.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.150 align:middle line:84%
I showed them to Colleen, and
she just says, oh my gosh.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.100 align:middle line:84%
There's this one lady
who recently wrote.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I
read your website,

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.350 align:middle line:90%
my son was in an institution.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.050 align:middle line:90%
He was 10 years old.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.430 align:middle line:84%
I start him on
vitamins, he's 11 now,

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.680 align:middle line:90%
and you wouldn't know the boy.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.380 align:middle line:84%
He's fine, he's cheerful,
everything is fine.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And all they did was give
him lots of vitamins and lots

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.470 align:middle line:84%
of niacin, and the child
completely changed.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I can't
begin to tell you how--

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.460 align:middle line:84%
well everything that
I learned about this

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.510 align:middle line:90%
I learned from other people.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.610 align:middle line:84%
All I'm doing is passing
it on, as you well know.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.460 align:middle line:90%
And here's the real kicker.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:13.800 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Abram Hoffer did the first
double blind placebo controlled

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.420 align:middle line:84%
tests in the history
of psychiatry in 1952

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.380 align:middle line:90%
with niacin on psychotics.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And he showed and published
that high doses of niacin cure

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.400 align:middle line:90%
psychosis.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And it was double blind
placebo control tested,

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.640 align:middle line:90%
and it's still ignored.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And if you now bring that up
to a doctor or an academic,

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.070 align:middle line:84%
they'll say, well that work
was done over 50 years ago

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.370 align:middle line:84%
and you know, it's
not really valid.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.890 align:middle line:90%
And I'm asking two questions.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.010 align:middle line:84%
Just because it's old research,
has the nature of psychosis

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.780 align:middle line:84%
really changed a
lot in 50 years?

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And has the chemical property
or properties of niacin

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.190 align:middle line:90%
changed in 50 years?

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.350 align:middle line:84%
The biggest single reason
why people aren't doing this

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:10.040 align:middle line:84%
is that it requires
taking responsibility.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.710 align:middle line:90%
And that is the only way out.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.108 align:middle line:84%
People ask me all the time,
what should I do for this,

00:05:16.108 --> 00:05:17.900 align:middle line:84%
what should I do for
that, curbside advice.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.810 align:middle line:84%
They write to me emails,
letters, phone calls

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:21.963 align:middle line:90%
if they had the chance.

00:05:21.963 --> 00:05:23.380 align:middle line:84%
They're always
asking, what should

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.838 align:middle line:84%
I do, what should I do, what
should I do, what should I do.

00:05:25.838 --> 00:05:31.370 align:middle line:84%
As if there is a magic
pill, a vitamin, not a drug,

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.120 align:middle line:84%
but still a single magic
pill that they can take.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.830 align:middle line:90%
And that's not true.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.520 align:middle line:90%
There is no magic bullet.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.690 align:middle line:84%
There is no monotherapy that
cures cancer, that cures

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:42.620 align:middle line:90%
heart disease.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.670 align:middle line:84%
But there is a
lifestyle change that

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:53.660 align:middle line:84%
prevents, arrests, and reverses
serious chronic disease.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.500 align:middle line:84%
But it requires, and this is my
answer to them, the following.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.060 align:middle line:90%
They ask me, what should I do.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.800 align:middle line:90%
And I have an answer now.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.440 align:middle line:84%
You have to change
your whole life.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.900 align:middle line:90%
You change your life.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.756 align:middle line:84%
And then they argue
for not changing.

00:06:08.756 --> 00:06:11.390 align:middle line:90%
I don't have time to exercise.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.130 align:middle line:90%
I don't like those foods.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:14.210 align:middle line:90%
My doctor disagrees.

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.120 align:middle line:90%
My parents disagree.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.920 align:middle line:90%
I can't afford it.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.450 align:middle line:84%
Oh, there's all these
different reasons.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:25.600 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, the
people that are desperate

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.020 align:middle line:84%
are often the ones who are
most willing to change.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.000 align:middle line:90%
So maybe sickness has a purpose.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.510 align:middle line:84%
Maybe sickness teaches us
to expand our own paradigms.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:38.560 align:middle line:84%
What I try to do in my
work, my books, my website,

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.140 align:middle line:84%
and even the Journal of
Orthomolecular Medicine,

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.380 align:middle line:90%
is to provide motivation.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Tell people that you
don't have to be sick.

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:50.230 align:middle line:90%
It's a choice.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not blaming the
patient when I say that.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.240 align:middle line:84%
If you take a person who's
sick and say, oh, well

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.410 align:middle line:90%
you chose to be sick.

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:57.820 align:middle line:90%
That's not it.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.980 align:middle line:84%
What we're really saying
is if you're well,

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.080 align:middle line:84%
you have a choice
to be well or sick.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.010 align:middle line:84%
If you're sick, all
right, there you are.

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.190 align:middle line:84%
What happened yesterday,
last week, last month,

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.120 align:middle line:90%
doesn't matter.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.220 align:middle line:90%
Start now, reverse it.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.500 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to stay sick.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.860 align:middle line:84%
We're not really that
interested in what you did.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.620 align:middle line:84%
Because what you
did didn't work.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:18.790 align:middle line:90%
So try something new.

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:22.810 align:middle line:84%
The old idea that if you
always do what you always did,

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:26.020 align:middle line:84%
you'll always get
what you always got.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.650 align:middle line:84%
The good news is that people
are not a bunch of dummies.

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:31.510 align:middle line:84%
Abraham Lincoln expressed
that when he said,

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:34.420 align:middle line:84%
you can fool some of the
people all of the time and all

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.160 align:middle line:84%
of the people some
of the time, but you

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.410 align:middle line:84%
can't fool all of the
people all of the time.

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's why over
half of the population

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:46.600 align:middle line:84%
now takes vitamins, even
though most doctors would say

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.540 align:middle line:90%
that it's really not necessary.

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:52.390 align:middle line:84%
We have a public that's
catching on quicker

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:54.850 align:middle line:90%
than the medical professions.

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:56.350 align:middle line:90%
In a way, it's sad.

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:59.260 align:middle line:90%
But in a way, it's great.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.060 align:middle line:84%
People should stop
being patients

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.520 align:middle line:90%
and start being people.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.470 align:middle line:90%
Why not be healthy and happy?

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:06.760 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.820 align:middle line:84%
You change your life, you do
some exercise, you eat right,

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:10.692 align:middle line:90%
you feel better.

00:08:10.692 --> 00:08:11.650 align:middle line:90%
All right, that's good.

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:12.550 align:middle line:90%
You look better.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.690 align:middle line:90%
All right, that's good.

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:14.540 align:middle line:90%
You live longer.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:15.340 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:16.250 align:middle line:90%
You save money.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:17.680 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And you have the
enormous satisfaction

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:23.320 align:middle line:90%
of having done it yourself.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.690 align:middle line:84%
People think, I don't
have a medical education,

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:26.560 align:middle line:90%
I can't know this.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.610 align:middle line:90%
Oh, please.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:31.720 align:middle line:84%
How complicated is it to eat
right and drink vegetable

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.400 align:middle line:90%
juices and exercise?

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.070 align:middle line:84%
You don't need any
degree to know that.

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:37.809 align:middle line:90%
It's too simple to work.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:38.980 align:middle line:90%
It's cheap.

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.030 align:middle line:90%
It's simple.

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:40.990 align:middle line:90%
It's safe.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:42.070 align:middle line:90%
It's effective.

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it can't
possibly be the answer.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:46.990 align:middle line:90%
But it is.

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:50.040 align:middle line:90%
