00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>> The classical case of a race
that doesn't get much cancer is

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.280 align:middle line:90%
the Japanese.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.400 align:middle line:84%
The Japanese who
live in Japan and eat

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.870 align:middle line:84%
the standard Japanese diet, live
the standard Japanese lifestyle

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.800 align:middle line:84%
have the lowest incidence
of cancer in the world.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.430 align:middle line:84%
Despite the fact that a lot
of them smoke, a lot of them

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.940 align:middle line:84%
drink alcohol, there is a
very low incidence of cancer.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's believed
that the low incidence

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.600 align:middle line:84%
is due to the high intake of
seafood, including fish and sea

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.240 align:middle line:90%
vegetables.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.290 align:middle line:84%
With that diet, there is a
high intake of trace elements,

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.140 align:middle line:84%
like selenium and
zinc and germanium

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.800 align:middle line:84%
and a whole range of other
anti-cancer trace elements.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.590 align:middle line:84%
There's also high intake
of the omega 3 fish oils,

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.250 align:middle line:84%
which are protective, as
well, not only from cancers,

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.600 align:middle line:84%
but heart disease
and Alzheimer's.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And they also drink
green tea, and green tea

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.810 align:middle line:84%
has got a range of chemicals
that protect us against cancer,

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.110 align:middle line:84%
as well, protect ourselves
and our genes and so on.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.020 align:middle line:84%
So you can be a Japanese
smoker and reduce

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.840 align:middle line:84%
your risk of getting lung
cancer and heart disease simply

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.990 align:middle line:84%
by drinking more green
tea, which is what is

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.640 align:middle line:90%
part of their traditional diet.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.710 align:middle line:84%
You take a Japanese
woman from Japan

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.560 align:middle line:84%
where the incidence of
breast cancer is very low

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.180 align:middle line:84%
and transplant her into America,
and she changes her lifestyle,

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.950 align:middle line:84%
the incidence of
cancer then starts

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.130 align:middle line:84%
creeping up to that of the
American woman, which is around

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.915 align:middle line:90%
about 13%.

00:01:46.915 --> 00:01:51.850 align:middle line:84%
So 13% of females in America
are at risk of getting--

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.430 align:middle line:90%
will get cancer of the breast.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.720 align:middle line:84%
Japanese-- less
than 1%, I think.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.240 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very interesting
change in environment,

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.230 align:middle line:84%
change in lifestyle,
change in diet,

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.610 align:middle line:84%
and the change in
the risk of cancer.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.520 align:middle line:84%
China is a very
interesting study, as well,

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.870 align:middle line:84%
because they've still
got provinces in China--

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.020 align:middle line:84%
there are some
areas where there's

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.490 align:middle line:84%
high levels of
certain chemicals.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.320 align:middle line:84%
There's deficiencies
of certain nutrients.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.445 align:middle line:84%
The people eat the local
food, so it's a good place

00:02:22.445 --> 00:02:24.620 align:middle line:90%
to study some of these areas.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And the study I mentioned
before, in Xi'an provinces,

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Northwestern China, and are high
incidence of gastrointestinal

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.510 align:middle line:84%
cancer are protected with
the beta-carotene, vitamin E,

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.460 align:middle line:90%
and selenium--

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.998 align:middle line:90%
very cheap approach.

00:02:40.998 --> 00:02:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And when you consider that
32,000 Australians are going

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.990 align:middle line:84%
to die from cancer
this year, some of them

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.270 align:middle line:84%
could have been
protected against cancer

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.450 align:middle line:84%
if they'd been made aware
of some simple changes.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.940 align:middle line:90%


00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.000 align:middle line:84%
Everything has the potential for
being toxic, including water.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.880 align:middle line:84%
I can drink water and die
from an overdose of water.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.970 align:middle line:84%
So everything has a
potential for being toxic.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.950 align:middle line:84%
When we look at specific
things like vitamin C,

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.860 align:middle line:84%
for example, we've got
to look at the facts.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.990 align:middle line:84%
The facts are that vitamin C has
been touted as a nutrient that

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.620 align:middle line:90%
will cause kidney stones.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.590 align:middle line:84%
That's a myth, and
it's been debunked.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And even in the
"Journal of Urology,"

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.150 align:middle line:84%
the journal of the study of
the kidney and the bladder,

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.280 align:middle line:84%
they've shown that 10,000
milligrams per day is safe.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, we were told that
100 milligrams or more

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.280 align:middle line:84%
could cause kidney damage
when I was a medical student.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.650 align:middle line:84%
There's a big difference
between 100 milligrams, which

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.110 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to cause damage,
and 10,000 milligrams,

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.020 align:middle line:84%
which is now accepted as
not causing any damage.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.550 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of this is
basically theoretical myth,

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.590 align:middle line:84%
and it's created by
the bias of people

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.880 align:middle line:84%
who are anti-vitamin C. The
other side effect of vitamin C

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.090 align:middle line:84%
is it not only causes kidney
stones and kidney damage,

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.930 align:middle line:84%
which is wrong and incorrect,
but that it can cause rebound

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.910 align:middle line:84%
scurvy, or vitamin
C deficiency, which

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.715 align:middle line:84%
is an absolute nonsense
as well, that it

00:04:15.715 --> 00:04:17.462 align:middle line:90%
can destroy vitamin B12.

00:04:17.462 --> 00:04:19.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, the fellow who said
that it would destroy

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.020 align:middle line:84%
vitamin B12, his
credibility was very much

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.330 align:middle line:84%
on the line quite
some time ago, and he

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.050 align:middle line:84%
lost credibility because
of the faulty workmanship

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.210 align:middle line:90%
in the laboratory.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.330 align:middle line:84%
Vitamin C is needed by
humans in higher doses

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.500 align:middle line:84%
than what we can often
achieve in a diet alone.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:46.740 align:middle line:84%
We're the only living animal,
apart from the other higher

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.580 align:middle line:84%
apes, that can't produce
vitamin C from glucose.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.380 align:middle line:90%
So vitamin C is essential.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.780 align:middle line:84%
If we don't get
enough, we get disease.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And we need more now
than ever because

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.580 align:middle line:84%
of the poisons in
our environment,

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.400 align:middle line:84%
the toxins in our system,
the buildup of pesticide

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.480 align:middle line:84%
and herbicide residues in
our fat cells, in our brains,

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.890 align:middle line:90%
in our livers.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.680 align:middle line:84%
We need to protect ourselves
against the toxic effects

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.180 align:middle line:84%
of these chemicals,
and vitamin c

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.790 align:middle line:84%
does that very
effectively by helping

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.430 align:middle line:90%
to remove them from our body.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Vitamin C is extremely
safe in doses

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.450 align:middle line:90%
that would boggle your mind.

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:37.180 align:middle line:84%
We need 60 milligrams to
prevent the vitamin C deficiency

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.160 align:middle line:84%
disease called scurvy, and that
disease is one characterized

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.530 align:middle line:84%
by easy bruising, bleeding,
bleeding from the gums, wounds

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.680 align:middle line:84%
that you've had open
up and hemorrhaging,

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.490 align:middle line:84%
and after 55 days of
vitamin C deficiency and you

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.500 align:middle line:84%
develop scurvy,
you will soon die.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.680 align:middle line:84%
But in that 55
days, you don't show

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.440 align:middle line:90%
any of the signs of scurvy.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.180 align:middle line:84%
When you're not taking
any vitamin C in,

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.090 align:middle line:84%
you just feel tired, a few aches
and pains, a bit lethargic,

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.300 align:middle line:84%
a little bit depressed maybe, a
sallow complexion in the face,

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.450 align:middle line:84%
a frown on the forehead, all
of these minor little things.

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.780 align:middle line:84%
But 55 days off vitamin
C, you get scurvy,

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.670 align:middle line:90%
and then you can die.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:22.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we look at
the population who've

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.240 align:middle line:84%
got all these minor aches and
pains and these sort of things,

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.560 align:middle line:84%
they're on the borderline
between scurvy and miserable

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.770 align:middle line:90%
health.

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.640 align:middle line:84%
All we need to do is give them
a little bit more vitamin C

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.470 align:middle line:84%
and you can bring them
back to good health.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's
1,000 milligrams.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.360 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's 2,000 milligrams.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.190 align:middle line:84%
For some people with
illnesses and diseases

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:45.220 align:middle line:84%
who are on medication, they may
need 4,000 milligrams or 6,000

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.345 align:middle line:90%
milligrams or 10,000 milligrams.

00:06:47.345 --> 00:06:48.970 align:middle line:84%
If somebody comes to
see me and they've

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:50.710 align:middle line:84%
got a severe case
of the flu, I can

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.290 align:middle line:84%
make them feel
better within an hour

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:58.610 align:middle line:84%
by giving them an intravenous
injection of 30,000 milligrams,

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.820 align:middle line:84%
which is a lot more than
the 60 milligrams that's

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.960 align:middle line:90%
going to prevent scurvy.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.080 align:middle line:84%
So you can use huge
doses of vitamin C

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.850 align:middle line:84%
without adverse events
and adverse side effects.

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.918 align:middle line:84%
It's a very, very safe nutrient
and, in fact, one of the safest

00:07:10.918 --> 00:07:13.210 align:middle line:84%
when you look at what's
required to prevent the disease

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.940 align:middle line:84%
and what's required to
actually treat an illness.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:18.700 align:middle line:90%


00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.610 align:middle line:84%
Even with the high doses
of 30,000 milligrams,

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.820 align:middle line:84%
we found that we couldn't get
people with certain cancers

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.690 align:middle line:90%
and HIV/AIDS any better.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:31.150 align:middle line:84%
So we pushed the dose
up to 40,000 milligrams,

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.150 align:middle line:84%
50,000 milligrams,
60,000 milligrams.

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:38.350 align:middle line:84%
We pushed the dose up
to 100,000 milligrams.

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:41.530 align:middle line:84%
We even went to
200,000 milligrams.

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:46.570 align:middle line:84%
We nearly got to a quarter
of a kilo IV in 24 hours.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.730 align:middle line:84%
No adverse events,
no adverse side

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.810 align:middle line:84%
effects apart from thirst and
feeling a little bit woozy

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:53.770 align:middle line:90%
in the head.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:58.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's with huge amounts of
vitamin C, the substances that

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:00.690 align:middle line:84%
were meant to cause
kidney stones if you

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:03.000 align:middle line:90%
took 100 milligrams.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.670 align:middle line:84%
We're talking more than
100,000 milligrams--

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:07.430 align:middle line:90%
in fact, 200,000 milligrams.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:10.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't recommend
those massive, massive doses

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:13.210 align:middle line:90%
unless you absolutely need them.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:14.700 align:middle line:84%
But typically,
with somebody with

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.610 align:middle line:90%
severe acute viral illness--

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:20.460 align:middle line:84%
adult chickenpox, for
example, or severe flu--

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.620 align:middle line:84%
you do need to use
tens of thousands

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:26.628 align:middle line:84%
of milligrams, which
is a lot more than what

00:08:26.628 --> 00:08:28.545 align:middle line:84%
is required to prevent
the deficiency disease.

00:08:28.545 --> 00:08:32.080 align:middle line:90%


00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.550 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting that our
requirements for vitamin C

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:39.820 align:middle line:84%
are so high like that when
we do get stressed or ill.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:44.179 align:middle line:84%
But if we don't get it, the
disease process may take off.

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:46.628 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot of
people walking around today

00:08:46.628 --> 00:08:48.670 align:middle line:84%
who'd be dead if they
didn't have their vitamin C

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:52.080 align:middle line:90%
injections.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:57.390 align:middle line:84%
Linus Pauling first suggested
that vitamin C could be

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.310 align:middle line:90%
useful against the common cold.

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:03.540 align:middle line:84%
But this was based on quite
a lot of science at the time

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.090 align:middle line:90%
and not just a guess or a whim.

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:11.040 align:middle line:84%
Pauling was, of course, a
colleague of Albert Einstein

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:16.320 align:middle line:84%
and quite a large number of
other high-level intellects

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.430 align:middle line:84%
at the time, and he won two
Nobel prizes, one in chemistry

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:23.070 align:middle line:90%
and one in peace.

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:26.280 align:middle line:84%
The work in chemistry
was on human proteins,

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:31.110 align:middle line:84%
and his crystallography work
revealed the helical nature

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:34.120 align:middle line:90%
of our genes.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.710 align:middle line:84%
So he's a brilliant man and
should not be taken lightly.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.600 align:middle line:84%
The problem was
that he was getting

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.090 align:middle line:84%
in the area of
clinical medicine,

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:44.700 align:middle line:84%
and he didn't have a
qualification in this area,

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:49.680 align:middle line:84%
and so he was, at the time,
very open to criticism.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And his suggestion
of vitamin C would

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.510 align:middle line:84%
have an effect on the
common cold was boo-hooed

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:56.880 align:middle line:90%
by the medical profession.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And I must say that the medical
profession is not always

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.920 align:middle line:84%
that scientific
and clear thinking.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:06.570 align:middle line:84%
Vitamin C has a wide range of
activities, and at that time,

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:09.420 align:middle line:84%
Pauling knew that it
had antiviral actions

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:13.140 align:middle line:84%
and it was important
for the immune system

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:17.430 align:middle line:84%
and that it was important
in detoxification processes.

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:19.590 align:middle line:84%
Why do some people
get a common cold

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:23.310 align:middle line:84%
and have a few sniffles
or a flu and a little bit

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:25.440 align:middle line:84%
of an ache and a
pain and get over it

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.520 align:middle line:90%
and other people are put to bed?

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.160 align:middle line:84%
It's probably
because of the action

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.800 align:middle line:84%
of the virus and the interaction
with the immune system and all

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.052 align:middle line:84%
the poisons and toxins
that result from it.

00:10:34.052 --> 00:10:35.760 align:middle line:84%
If you had an efficient
system and plenty

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.730 align:middle line:84%
of vitamin C in your
system, you can actually

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:40.660 align:middle line:84%
get rid of the virus
pretty quickly,

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:45.340 align:middle line:84%
and the immune system recovers,
and you have few symptoms.

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:48.850 align:middle line:84%
We talk about vitamin
C and the common cold,

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:50.850 align:middle line:84%
but vitamin C is more
important than just simply

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:51.720 align:middle line:90%
the common cold.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.400 align:middle line:90%
It's effective in flus.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.560 align:middle line:84%
It's effective in
people with HIV.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.610 align:middle line:84%
It's effective in people
with other viruses.

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:03.300 align:middle line:84%
I've seen adults with
chickenpox and the chickenpox

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.660 align:middle line:84%
drying up within eight hours
of a vitamin C injection.

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And miserable people, miserable
humans with adult chickenpox

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:15.123 align:middle line:84%
are so miserable, they
would want to die.

00:11:15.123 --> 00:11:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it is a
life-threatening disease.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.620 align:middle line:90%


00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.530 align:middle line:84%
We know that
rabies-inoculated Guinea pigs,

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:26.290 align:middle line:84%
if they're given vitamin C,
will recover very effectively.

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:29.070 align:middle line:84%
We know that vitamin
C given to people

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:32.550 align:middle line:84%
who have been poisoned
with drugs and medications

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:36.600 align:middle line:90%
can overcome the poisoning.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.640 align:middle line:84%
Vitamin C is very
important for humans,

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.300 align:middle line:84%
and without it, nearly every
other treatment is only

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.960 align:middle line:90%
going to be second best.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.840 align:middle line:84%
You can improve the
effects of herbs.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.790 align:middle line:84%
You can improve the
effects of drugs.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.130 align:middle line:84%
You can improve
the rate of healing

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:54.450 align:middle line:84%
from surgery with vitamin C. And
you can reduce the adverse side

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:57.000 align:middle line:84%
effects of radiotherapy
with vitamin C,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.020 align:middle line:84%
providing you use
the right dose.

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.410 align:middle line:84%
It may be the big doses that
I was talking about before,

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:04.440 align:middle line:84%
but individuality
is a crucial factor,

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.240 align:middle line:84%
and I might need
1,000 milligrams,

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.300 align:middle line:84%
and you might need
10,000 milligrams,

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.700 align:middle line:84%
and somebody else might
need 50,000 milligrams

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.710 align:middle line:84%
for the same reason, because
we are all the individual

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:15.510 align:middle line:90%
and all different.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:18.260 align:middle line:90%
