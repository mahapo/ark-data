00:00:03.346 --> 00:00:07.170 align:middle line:90%


00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, of course, my
father worked this all out.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And he basically
worked out a treatment

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.700 align:middle line:84%
that would deal with the
most seriously ill patients.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.540 align:middle line:84%
But he also helped people
who were not that ill.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.090 align:middle line:84%
Basically, the problem of all
chronic disease, he found,

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.370 align:middle line:90%
is a dual problem.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Namely, it's toxicity
and deficiency.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.490 align:middle line:84%
That goes for all
chronic diseases.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And one of the major problems
is, of course, the soil

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.440 align:middle line:84%
and what we do to the soil,
and the air, and the water,

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.440 align:middle line:84%
and everything we
take in our food.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.810 align:middle line:84%
So while, naturally, alcohol,
and cigarettes, and all

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.530 align:middle line:84%
these things are very
serious damaging to the body,

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.000 align:middle line:90%
it isn't only that.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.330 align:middle line:84%
It starts with the soil, and,
therefore, with the basic foods

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.350 align:middle line:84%
we start to eat
as small children,

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.250 align:middle line:84%
and that mothers
eat while they're

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.300 align:middle line:84%
pregnant, and the toxins
that go into the system.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.590 align:middle line:84%
The so-called fertilizer,
so-called artificial

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.860 align:middle line:84%
fertilizer, is made up of
three, mainly three minerals--

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.070 align:middle line:84%
N, P, K-- nitrogen,
phosphorus, and potassium.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.510 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's nice.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:37.720 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is that the
soil requires approximately 52

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.610 align:middle line:90%
different minerals.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.650 align:middle line:84%
So where's the calcium,
and the magnesium,

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.040 align:middle line:84%
and the manganese, and
the zinc, and the iron,

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.685 align:middle line:84%
and all of the other
things I can't mention?

00:01:48.685 --> 00:01:51.180 align:middle line:90%
They're missing.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And plants have
their own defenses.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.380 align:middle line:84%
They have defenses
against disease.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.210 align:middle line:84%
They have defenses
against attackers,

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.430 align:middle line:84%
including bugs, and
fungus, and so on.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.490 align:middle line:84%
But when the soil is
deficient, the plants also

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.530 align:middle line:84%
are deficient and weakened,
and they lose their defenses.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And the bugs come
and attack them.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And the disease, the
fungus and other disease,

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.500 align:middle line:90%
comes and attacks them.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.090 align:middle line:84%
So now, they come crying
to the pharmaceutical,

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.640 align:middle line:84%
the chemical companies, and
say, well, our plants are dying,

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.410 align:middle line:84%
and they won't grow, and we
have pests, and the pests--

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.760 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
chemical companies

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.130 align:middle line:84%
are terribly happy to sell them
pesticides, and fungicides,

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.680 align:middle line:84%
and growth stimulants, and
all kinds of other things.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.040 align:middle line:84%
So what we are
getting, even if we

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.420 align:middle line:84%
eat just commercial
vegetarian food,

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.710 align:middle line:90%
we get deficient, toxic food.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.350 align:middle line:84%
Because with all these
pesticides, and chemicals,

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.220 align:middle line:84%
and sprays, and all of that,
the food is not healthy,

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.840 align:middle line:90%
and it's deficient.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.560 align:middle line:84%
So we can't help but
be deficient and toxic.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And then on top of that
comes the food processing.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And in food processing, they
don't just heat the food.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.180 align:middle line:84%
But they add emulsifiers, and
dyes, and flavor enhancers,

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.200 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of
chemicals, something

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.900 align:middle line:84%
like 10,000 chemicals
that are approved

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.590 align:middle line:84%
by our FDA, the Food and Drug
Administration, as being safe.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.820 align:middle line:90%
None of them are safe.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.210 align:middle line:84%
There is no such thing
as chemicals you can

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.160 align:middle line:90%
take every day that are safe.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.040 align:middle line:90%
It's not true.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Every once in a while, they find
that one is particularly bad,

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.500 align:middle line:84%
and then they replace it as
soon as they have another one,

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.860 align:middle line:90%
they replace that one.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.520 align:middle line:84%
But usually, the
next one is worse.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.440 align:middle line:84%
That was with the
famous dye number two,

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.560 align:middle line:84%
the red number two
was highly toxic.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.650 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't take
it off the market--

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.910 align:middle line:84%
they knew it was toxic--
they didn't take it off

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.820 align:middle line:84%
until the chemical company
had developed red number five,

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.330 align:middle line:90%
and it's worse.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:13.240 align:middle line:84%
So we get all these additives
to the already deficient damaged

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:19.779 align:middle line:84%
foods, so that unless we
insist on eating organic, where

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:23.680 align:middle line:84%
the soil is treated
like it should be,

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.140 align:middle line:84%
the natural waste materials
are put back into the soil

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.560 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes things
like minerals--

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:37.030 align:middle line:84%
it happens that one of the best
minerals to put into the soil

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.270 align:middle line:90%
is ground granite.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.880 align:middle line:84%
So where do you
get ground granite?

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.170 align:middle line:90%
Very simple.

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.960 align:middle line:84%
The places that
grind headstones.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.610 align:middle line:84%
They use granite
stone, and they have

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.625 align:middle line:90%
a lot of powder lying around.

00:04:50.625 --> 00:04:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And they're very
happy to give it

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.610 align:middle line:90%
to you for you to take it away.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.380 align:middle line:90%
They're very happy.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.750 align:middle line:84%
They found this largely, also,
when, in Oregon, Mount St.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.190 align:middle line:90%
Helens erupted.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And you may have heard or
known that for numerous weeks,

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.990 align:middle line:84%
Mount St. Helen was spitting
ashes, and ashes, and ashes.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And for a while,
the ashes built up

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.800 align:middle line:84%
to the point of
several feet of height,

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.320 align:middle line:84%
and the farmers thought
they'd lost their soil.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.000 align:middle line:90%
On the contrary.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.790 align:middle line:84%
For instance, apple trees
that had been growing

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.980 align:middle line:84%
and had little apples,
worm eaten and useless,

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.370 align:middle line:84%
they were growing the
nicest, biggest apples,

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:34.780 align:middle line:90%
not a worm inside.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And the cabbages were larger
than they'd ever seen,

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.390 align:middle line:90%
great big heads of cabbage.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And their soil was
suddenly tremendously

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.780 align:middle line:90%
powerful and fertile.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.950 align:middle line:84%
So of course, you can't
always go to Oregon

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.900 align:middle line:90%
to pick up the dust there.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.650 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people,
though, can go

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:02.980 align:middle line:84%
to places near cemeteries
that grind headstones

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.790 align:middle line:90%
and pick up the minerals.

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.050 align:middle line:84%
So you can use what's left
over from your kitchen

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.360 align:middle line:84%
from organic food, from
the organic juicing.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.450 align:middle line:90%
Theirs is already ground up.

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:18.040 align:middle line:84%
You can compost that
together with some minerals,

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.870 align:middle line:84%
and you have the best
compost in the world.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And you have, therefore,
then, healthy vegetables

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.630 align:middle line:90%
that don't need chemicals.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.160 align:middle line:90%
They don't need sprays.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.420 align:middle line:84%
They don't need
pesticides because they

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.730 align:middle line:84%
have their natural defenses
in place, like we have.

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Normal human body
has powerful defenses

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.230 align:middle line:84%
to the point where
cancer is impossible.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:46.480 align:middle line:84%
The human body has such powerful
defenses that a normal healthy

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:52.030 align:middle line:84%
body cannot, will not develop
cancer or any other chronic

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.250 align:middle line:90%
disease, for that matter.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:59.410 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but with a
good, healthy, normal, rich

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:03.550 align:middle line:84%
organic food, you can
reverse these diseases,

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.950 align:middle line:90%
and that's what we do.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:08.620 align:middle line:84%
But the food alone
isn't the trick,

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.700 align:middle line:84%
because you also have to
get rid of the poisons.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And coming back to the
original cause of all disease--

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.130 align:middle line:90%
toxicity and deficiency--

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:21.310 align:middle line:84%
we have to detoxify
and replenish.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:24.460 align:middle line:84%
We have to deal with
both these problems.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:29.410 align:middle line:84%
So just organic food is fine
and important, but isn't enough.

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.680 align:middle line:84%
Because over the
years of toxicity,

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.990 align:middle line:84%
of the fluoride in the
water and toothpaste,

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:41.770 align:middle line:84%
of the chemicals in the
air, of toxins in the soil,

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.050 align:middle line:84%
and in the foods,
and in the processed

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.060 align:middle line:84%
foods, and the canned,
and jarred, and pickled,

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.430 align:middle line:84%
and preserved, and
emulsified things,

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:51.460 align:middle line:84%
we have accumulated
a lot of poisons.

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:55.420 align:middle line:84%
Not me, so much, because I don't
eat such things for decades.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.300 align:middle line:90%
But most of the public.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we
always have to deal

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:06.090 align:middle line:84%
with people who used to eat what
we call, or what is known as,

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:10.980 align:middle line:84%
the Standard American
Diet, the SAD.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.850 align:middle line:90%
And yes, it's sad.

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:13.960 align:middle line:90%
It's very bad.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.310 align:middle line:90%
And it promotes disease.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:19.690 align:middle line:90%
It promotes obesity.

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
interesting thing.

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:23.470 align:middle line:90%
Why are so many--

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:26.125 align:middle line:84%
including children, why
are people so obese?

00:08:26.125 --> 00:08:29.960 align:middle line:90%


00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm used to eating
all organic food.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:36.350 align:middle line:84%
All my vegetables and fruit and
everything I eat is organic.

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:39.260 align:middle line:84%
I never, never eat
in a restaurant.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:43.730 align:middle line:84%
I buy nothing from the grocery
shelves unless it's organic.

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:48.510 align:middle line:84%
I go to a special store that
has mainly, almost exclusively,

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:49.310 align:middle line:90%
organic food.

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:51.230 align:middle line:90%
I only buy and eat organic.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:54.300 align:middle line:90%


00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.580 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not toxic.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.415 align:middle line:84%
But most people, they don't
eat organic, are toxic.

00:08:59.415 --> 00:09:02.240 align:middle line:90%


00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's also
important to remember,

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.500 align:middle line:84%
when the body gets all
these toxins fed into it,

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.250 align:middle line:90%
it has to get rid of it.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:14.810 align:middle line:84%
But some of it, it just
simply can't excrete.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:18.710 align:middle line:84%
So it pushes it
out into fat cells,

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:23.450 align:middle line:84%
into connective tissue
cells, into organ systems,

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:24.500 align:middle line:90%
and various things.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.970 align:middle line:84%
The body gets rid of the
central organizing system.

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:32.080 align:middle line:90%


00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:37.590 align:middle line:84%
But then when you stop feeding
the body all these chemicals,

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:39.410 align:middle line:90%
it'll start to release them.

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:40.330 align:middle line:90%
It'll let go.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:45.200 align:middle line:84%
I always try to compare it,
for people's imagination,

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.240 align:middle line:84%
if a huge oil spill comes
at you from the ocean

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:53.440 align:middle line:84%
or from wherever, and you
have a very powerful hose,

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.500 align:middle line:84%
it can keep that oil
spill from coming to you.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.210 align:middle line:84%
But you shut off the
hose, it comes in.

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, with all
the chemical poisons

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.330 align:middle line:84%
in the system, with all
the poisons in the tissues,

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.190 align:middle line:84%
in the fat cells, in
the connective tissue,

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:13.810 align:middle line:84%
in the skin cells,
and all over the body,

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:18.880 align:middle line:84%
not missing the
brain, these toxins,

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:24.370 align:middle line:84%
when you stop pushing them into
the system, start to come out.

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And actually, if you now
only change your diet

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:32.770 align:middle line:84%
to the point of
eating all organic,

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:34.750 align:middle line:84%
you are releasing
all these poisons.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:37.660 align:middle line:84%
They go into the bloodstream
and into the liver.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And unless you help the
liver get rid of it,

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.630 align:middle line:90%
you can cause new damage.

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:42.850 align:middle line:90%
It's a mistake.

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:45.010 align:middle line:90%
It's a half a therapy.

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:50.080 align:middle line:84%
The other half of the
therapy is detoxify.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And that, I believe, is my
father's greatest genius.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Not only did he
recognize toxicity,

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:03.250 align:middle line:84%
not only did he see
that this toxicity was

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:08.060 align:middle line:84%
blocking and damaging the body,
but he found a way to detoxify.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.630 align:middle line:90%


00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And that has not yet
registered, or, if it has,

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.880 align:middle line:90%
doctors simply refuse to do it.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.550 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
they do is toxic.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:24.700 align:middle line:84%
Every drug they use,
prescription drug,

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.725 align:middle line:84%
over-the-counter
drugs, all drugs

00:11:26.725 --> 00:11:28.750 align:middle line:90%
are liver toxic, bar none.

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:33.810 align:middle line:90%


00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:36.750 align:middle line:84%
So when we start to
get these patients,

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:38.880 align:middle line:90%
they're full of toxins.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.030 align:middle line:84%
We have to get the toxins out
to even allow the nutrients

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:44.850 align:middle line:90%
to get into the tissues.

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:48.030 align:middle line:84%
You can't get them in there
if they're full of poisons.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:51.930 align:middle line:84%
You can't get two
things into one space.

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:56.520 align:middle line:84%
So the detoxifying is
absolutely of utter importance.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.130 align:middle line:90%
Now, in order to do that--

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:03.600 align:middle line:84%
and this goes way
back to World War I--

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:09.920 align:middle line:84%
in order to do that, my father
found that using caffeine

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.710 align:middle line:90%
rectally opens--

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:17.400 align:middle line:84%
travels up the hemorrhoidal
vein into the portal system

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.010 align:middle line:84%
to the liver,
opens the viaducts,

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:26.160 align:middle line:84%
and opens it all up so the
liver can let go, and it does.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.364 align:middle line:90%
And the patients are amazed.

00:12:29.364 --> 00:12:31.590 align:middle line:84%
A little bit
frightened sometimes

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:34.290 align:middle line:90%
of the stuff they excrete.

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:35.730 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's very black.

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:37.920 align:middle line:90%
Often, it's extremely smelly.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:41.460 align:middle line:84%
It's very toxic,
a chemical smell.

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:45.420 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes there are long strings
of stuff, the lining that's

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:48.900 align:middle line:84%
dead of the intestinal
tract, all kinds of things,

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:50.860 align:middle line:90%
and parasites.

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:51.820 align:middle line:90%
They excrete it all.

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.600 align:middle line:90%
It all comes out.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.080 align:middle line:90%
But it's better out than in.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.900 align:middle line:90%
But it's a bit scary.

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:02.070 align:middle line:84%
Patients are a bit shocked and
scared to see all the stuff

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:03.810 align:middle line:90%
they're harboring.

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:06.100 align:middle line:90%
But then the pain goes away.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
most interesting effects

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:13.530 align:middle line:84%
of these caffeine
implants that are simply

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:21.540 align:middle line:84%
called coffee enemas that we
use and that overcome pain.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Virtually any pain,
including cancer pain,

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:30.600 align:middle line:84%
including the pain of
people who have already

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:34.260 align:middle line:84%
been put on patches,
morphine patches,

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:39.510 align:middle line:84%
and codeine, and all kinds of
painkillers, heavy painkillers.

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:45.780 align:middle line:84%
A few days of organic food, no
poisons, of detoxifying enemas,

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.030 align:middle line:90%
and the pain goes away.

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:52.200 align:middle line:84%
Advanced cancer pain goes
away, in almost all cases.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, there is always
some exceptions.

00:13:54.530 --> 00:14:00.030 align:middle line:84%
But in the majority of cases,
we can get rid of pain,

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:01.920 align:middle line:90%
and it's very remarkable.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it
encourages patients.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:06.760 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to
take morphine anymore,

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.560 align:middle line:84%
and codeine, and all these
heavy combinations of chemical

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.220 align:middle line:90%
poisons.

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:15.530 align:middle line:90%
They're beginning to function.

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:16.830 align:middle line:90%
And healing begins.

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:19.420 align:middle line:90%
It's only the beginning.

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:23.110 align:middle line:84%
Another very important
thing to remember,

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:25.230 align:middle line:84%
while a very large
majority of our patients

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:30.780 align:middle line:84%
are cancer patients, the
Gerson therapy heals.

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And very important
to remember is,

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.700 align:middle line:90%
you cannot heal selectively.

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.900 align:middle line:84%
If you truly heal,
everything heals.

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:43.140 align:middle line:84%
If a patient comes, for
instance, not only with cancer,

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:48.300 align:middle line:84%
but with high blood pressure,
and/or diabetes, and maybe

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:51.720 align:middle line:84%
fibromyalgia and other
pains, and so on,

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:55.170 align:middle line:90%
all the problems disappear.

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:57.660 align:middle line:84%
You can't heal one disease
and keep two others.

00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:58.910 align:middle line:90%
It's impossible.

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:03.270 align:middle line:84%
When the body heals,
it heals everything.

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the Gerson
therapy is so effective.

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And doctors, like
this doctor in Japan,

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:11.790 align:middle line:84%
he demonstrated
a patient who had

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:15.210 align:middle line:90%
four different types of cancer.

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:16.320 align:middle line:90%
No drugs.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.550 align:middle line:90%
No chemo.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:19.080 align:middle line:90%
Nothing special.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.960 align:middle line:90%
One treatment, the body heals.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:25.440 align:middle line:84%
If you give it all the right
nutrients and detoxify it,

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.810 align:middle line:84%
it functions, it
works, and it heals.

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:30.720 align:middle line:84%
The body has what
my father called

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.740 align:middle line:90%
has its own healing mechanism.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And he went further
and he said, it's

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:41.640 align:middle line:84%
the doctor's duty to activate
and reactivate the body's

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.490 align:middle line:90%
own healing mechanism.

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:45.640 align:middle line:90%
And the patients heal.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter
what you call the disease.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:54.620 align:middle line:90%


00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:59.690 align:middle line:84%
We get patients that are
seriously, seriously ill, not

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:02.060 align:middle line:90%
generally the early patients.

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:06.150 align:middle line:84%
An early patient has a
problem, goes to the doctor.

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:07.900 align:middle line:90%
And the doctor diagnoses cancer.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:11.060 align:middle line:84%
Then come all the cancer
treatments, and the surgeries,

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:12.770 align:middle line:84%
and the radiation,
and the chemo,

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:18.350 align:middle line:84%
and all the additional damage
that these treatments do,

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:21.050 align:middle line:84%
and the painkillers
and everything else.

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And when the
patients are really,

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.820 align:middle line:84%
really seriously ill and
begin to understand that

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:29.480 align:middle line:84%
their doctors can't
help, making them worse,

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.970 align:middle line:84%
and that they're dying-- often
the doctors have sent them

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:34.580 align:middle line:84%
home, said, there's
nothing more we can do--

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:37.700 align:middle line:90%
that's when we see them.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.100 align:middle line:90%
And we see the recoveries.

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.400 align:middle line:90%
And it's very exciting.

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.440 align:middle line:90%
That's the important thing.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:49.700 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is, they
come to the hospital,

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.400 align:middle line:84%
usually, they don't stay
more than three weeks, which

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:56.750 align:middle line:84%
is very good, it's
important, but you can't cure

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:58.640 align:middle line:90%
advanced cancer in three weeks.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.310 align:middle line:84%
You have to totally
detoxify and rebuild

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:04.369 align:middle line:84%
the body, all the essential
organ systems and all

00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:06.319 align:middle line:90%
the healing mechanism.

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:09.800 align:middle line:84%
It takes two years,
which means that patients

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.859 align:middle line:90%
have to carry on at home.

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's largely my
job at the hospital.

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:18.060 align:middle line:84%
I have to explain to
them what they're doing,

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:22.130 align:middle line:84%
why they're doing
it, and how to do it.

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:24.230 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we do.

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:27.200 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.000 align:middle line:90%
