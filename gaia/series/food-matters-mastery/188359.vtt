00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.890 align:middle line:84%
>> In Western
industrialized nations,

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.290 align:middle line:84%
we don't really understand
what good health is.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.090 align:middle line:84%
We try to understand
what good food is,

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.580 align:middle line:84%
we try to understand what
relaxation and stress

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.390 align:middle line:84%
management, we try to understand
the importance of exercise,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.520 align:middle line:84%
but there is no
definition of good health.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And our health care systems are
systems that are almost 100%

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.130 align:middle line:90%
based on disease care delivery.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.320 align:middle line:84%
As a doctor, I was
trained to think and act

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.900 align:middle line:84%
in terms of disease
and disease care.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And very little of
what I do is really

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.850 align:middle line:90%
involved in health optimization.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.440 align:middle line:90%
I treat a patient.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.380 align:middle line:84%
I discharge them from
hospital or from the clinic.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.520 align:middle line:84%
But I return them to their
community in a state of health

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.020 align:middle line:84%
that was actually contributing
to the reason they came in

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.770 align:middle line:90%
to see me in the first place.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.010 align:middle line:84%
26% of patients who are
discharged from hospitals

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.260 align:middle line:84%
are more malnourished
than when they went in.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they go in,
in 80% to 90% of cases,

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.160 align:middle line:84%
is related to their
poor state of nutrition.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:14.050 align:middle line:84%
Nearly every condition apart
from accidents and trauma--

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.400 align:middle line:84%
but nearly every condition
including birth defects,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.620 align:middle line:84%
cancers, heart disease,
stroke, diabetes

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.560 align:middle line:84%
can be related to diet
and poor dietary habits

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.430 align:middle line:90%
and poor exercise habits.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.445 align:middle line:84%
So I think we do really need
to define health more carefully

00:01:27.445 --> 00:01:29.820 align:middle line:84%
rather than leave it up to
the doctors and the hospitals,

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.130 align:middle line:84%
the pathologists and
the pharmacologists.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.885 align:middle line:84%
It needs to be taken
out of that domain,

00:01:33.885 --> 00:01:37.410 align:middle line:84%
and we need a system of health,
a health care department.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And we need a disease care
department or a medical care

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.560 align:middle line:90%
department.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And they need to
compete for funds

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.970 align:middle line:90%
to make the population healthy.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And once we see that
competition occurring,

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.050 align:middle line:84%
we will see some sense
in the health system.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.460 align:middle line:84%
The current health
minister in Australia

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.470 align:middle line:84%
is carrying on the line that
we started some time ago

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.920 align:middle line:84%
in the Complementary
Health Council,

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.360 align:middle line:84%
where we suggested that we
have a health system that

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.890 align:middle line:90%
was sustainable.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.080 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a health
system that's sustainable.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And the more
disease that we see,

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.740 align:middle line:84%
the more unsustainable
it becomes.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And very little is done to
actually put a brake on that.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And there are a whole
range of reasons

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.450 align:middle line:90%
why very little is done.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.350 align:middle line:90%
It's often political.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.560 align:middle line:90%
It's often economical.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.560 align:middle line:90%
It's often social.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.090 align:middle line:90%
It's often bias.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it's got to do
with politicians, regulators,

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.560 align:middle line:84%
and professionals who
can't give up the ego

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.460 align:middle line:90%
and let go of their pet lovers.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.520 align:middle line:84%
We could reduce
hospital admission rates

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.720 align:middle line:84%
in the next five years in this
country by up to 10% to 20%

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.330 align:middle line:84%
if we just simply
looked sensibly

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.850 align:middle line:84%
at what's going on
in the community.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.400 align:middle line:84%
We'd pass laws-- well, we'd make
recommendations in Australia

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.200 align:middle line:90%
that sunlight--

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.200 align:middle line:84%
if we're exposed to
too much sunlight,

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.730 align:middle line:90%
we will end up with skin cancer.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:00.600 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.673 align:middle line:90%
We've got a policy--

00:03:01.673 --> 00:03:03.090 align:middle line:84%
don't go out in
the sun unless you

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.850 align:middle line:84%
put on a hat, some sunscreen,
and cover yourself up

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.430 align:middle line:84%
and stay in the shade as
much as you possibly can.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.600 align:middle line:84%
As a consequence of this
public health policy,

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.370 align:middle line:84%
we now have a vitamin D
deficiency affecting 25% to 30%

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.170 align:middle line:90%
of Australians.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.610 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking at a very
mild degree of deficiency,

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.440 align:middle line:90%
it may be as high as 35%.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.660 align:middle line:84%
Now to correct that deficiency,
you can go out in the sun

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.900 align:middle line:84%
or you can take some
vitamin D rich foods which

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.010 align:middle line:84%
are most unlikely going
to create the deficiency

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.680 align:middle line:90%
by the time you've got it.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.360 align:middle line:84%
Or you can take a
nutritional supplement

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.770 align:middle line:90%
with vitamin D in it.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.990 align:middle line:84%
Now the strongest
vitamin D in this country

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.800 align:middle line:84%
that we're allowed to produce
is about a thousand units.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.610 align:middle line:84%
Now some patients require 5
to 10 of these capsules a day

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.030 align:middle line:84%
to correct this deficiency,
but the deficiency

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.500 align:middle line:90%
is not being corrected.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.670 align:middle line:84%
So as a consequence of that, as
a consequence of our inability

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.970 align:middle line:84%
to recognize important factors
to contribute to health,

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.400 align:middle line:84%
we are going to see not only
an increase in osteoporosis

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.220 align:middle line:84%
as a consequence of
a lack of vitamin D

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.540 align:middle line:84%
and the bones thinning,
but females, older females

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.940 align:middle line:84%
tend to get weakness
in the muscle

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.620 align:middle line:90%
girdle around the pelvis.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.186 align:middle line:90%
So they're more likely to fall.

00:04:18.186 --> 00:04:19.769 align:middle line:84%
And so if they're
more likely to fall,

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.860 align:middle line:84%
they're more likely to
develop a fracture--

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.060 align:middle line:84%
a long bone, a wrist,
ankle, or the spine.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.380 align:middle line:84%
That contributes to a couple of
hundred million dollar hospital

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.510 align:middle line:90%
costs a year.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.460 align:middle line:84%
Add onto that the
vitamin D deficiency

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.470 align:middle line:90%
and the associated cancers--

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.210 align:middle line:84%
there's breast and
prostate, possibly stomach,

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.070 align:middle line:90%
and possibly even skin cancer.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.220 align:middle line:84%
We are not looking at solving
the problems because we're not

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.460 align:middle line:84%
actually defining the
problems carefully enough

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.340 align:middle line:84%
and looking at the
simple solutions.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.310 align:middle line:84%
If we decided tomorrow that
the vitamin D deficiency

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.600 align:middle line:84%
issue was going to
be addressed, we

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.803 align:middle line:84%
would need a massive
public education campaign.

00:05:06.803 --> 00:05:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And that would cost
millions of dollars,

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.920 align:middle line:84%
but it would save
hundreds of millions.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.310 align:middle line:84%
It would take a long time
because there are not

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.970 align:middle line:84%
many doctors who even know
how to measure a vitamin D

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.050 align:middle line:84%
deficiency, let alone
know how to treat it.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.690 align:middle line:90%
And that's only one.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.040 align:middle line:84%
We took everybody with mental
illness, psychological illness.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.060 align:middle line:84%
Most patients who I've admitted
to psychiatric institutions

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.630 align:middle line:84%
cause I've worked in
them for 10 years,

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.270 align:middle line:84%
most patients who were admitted
had multiple deficiencies

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.450 align:middle line:84%
and most of them were
B vitamin deficiencies,

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.640 align:middle line:84%
but there were many other
deficiencies as well.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.947 align:middle line:84%
Very rarely do you get a big
complex deficiency tested

00:05:44.947 --> 00:05:47.530 align:middle line:84%
when a patient goes to a mental
institution, let alone vitamin

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.510 align:middle line:84%
C which is also deficient
in protein deficiency.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.665 align:middle line:84%
You might get a folic acid
and vitamin B12 test done,

00:05:56.665 --> 00:05:59.950 align:middle line:84%
and that's about all in
terms of nutritional status.

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:02.500 align:middle line:84%
But these people
unfortunately have

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.793 align:middle line:84%
got deficiencies of nutrients,
immunological deficiencies.

00:06:05.793 --> 00:06:08.085 align:middle line:84%
They react to foods and
chemicals in their environment.

00:06:08.085 --> 00:06:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they've got
mental illness and depression

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.360 align:middle line:84%
and schizophrenia, et
cetera, is because there

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.040 align:middle line:84%
is a chemical
imbalance in the brain,

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.920 align:middle line:84%
but it's not due to
a drug deficiency.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.200 align:middle line:84%
It's more than likely due
to a nutritional deficiency

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.912 align:middle line:90%
or a toxic imbalance.

00:06:21.912 --> 00:06:25.080 align:middle line:90%


00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.040 align:middle line:84%
Suboptimal nutrition
prevails in nature,

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.530 align:middle line:84%
and it's one of the
selective forces

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.050 align:middle line:90%
in the evolutionary process.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And in agriculture, for
example, in Australia,

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.170 align:middle line:84%
we do need to
supplement our soils

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:44.730 align:middle line:84%
with phosphate
fertilizers to get

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.080 align:middle line:90%
the crops and pasture to grow.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.310 align:middle line:84%
We need to add
copper to our soils

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.800 align:middle line:84%
to prevent copper
deficiencies in animals.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.020 align:middle line:84%
We need to add
selenium to our soils

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.900 align:middle line:84%
to prevent selenium
deficiencies in animals.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:02.130 align:middle line:84%
We may not always get
all of the nutrients

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.710 align:middle line:84%
that we require for optimal
health from our diet,

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.170 align:middle line:90%
even if it is an excellent diet.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:11.070 align:middle line:84%
We don't know enough
about the relationship

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:15.690 align:middle line:84%
between cellular requirements
and the supply of nutrients

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:17.700 align:middle line:90%
from foods.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.450 align:middle line:84%
Add onto that the fact that
there are other factors that

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:24.390 align:middle line:84%
have an adverse influence
on cell function

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:27.600 align:middle line:84%
and can produce heart
disease and cancer

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.600 align:middle line:84%
through the processes
of reactive oxygen

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.720 align:middle line:90%
species and free radicals.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And looking at the basic
sciences of cellular nutrition,

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.510 align:middle line:84%
there is a growing and
massive body of evidence

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:46.890 align:middle line:84%
to support the role of
supplemental nutrients

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:50.190 align:middle line:84%
in protecting the cell membrane,
in protecting the proteins

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.770 align:middle line:84%
inside the cell, in
protecting the cell nucleus,

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:55.830 align:middle line:84%
and even going as far
as protecting your genes

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.570 align:middle line:84%
and chromosomes in
the cell nucleus.

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we believe a
lot of disease is, of course,

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:07.080 align:middle line:84%
inherited, but what can
we do environmentally

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.870 align:middle line:84%
to reduce the risks of
inheritable-- inherited

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.820 align:middle line:84%
diseases such as
diabetes and heart

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.740 align:middle line:90%
disease and certain cancers?

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.755 align:middle line:84%
We can improve the
functioning of our genes.

00:08:15.755 --> 00:08:17.130 align:middle line:84%
Now there's good
evidence, again,

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:19.800 align:middle line:84%
that we can improve the
functioning of our genes

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.560 align:middle line:84%
with good nutrition and
the appropriate nutrients.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.930 align:middle line:90%
Gene repair depends on enzymes.

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:28.980 align:middle line:84%
Enzymes in the cell nucleus
are dependent on trace elements

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:30.780 align:middle line:90%
like selenium and zinc.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And these repair enzymes keep
on repairing our chromosomes

00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:34.110 align:middle line:90%
in our genes.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:38.190 align:middle line:90%


00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:41.730 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's present
in garlic and carrots,

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:43.470 align:middle line:90%
for example, the carotenoids.

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:46.140 align:middle line:84%
We know that the
substance is actually--

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:54.210 align:middle line:84%
get into our cell nucleus and
protect the genes from damage

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:58.470 align:middle line:84%
and protect the genes from being
bonded to synthetic chemicals

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.840 align:middle line:84%
from the environment and
doing further damage.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:05.880 align:middle line:84%
So we don't know how much we
actually get from our diet.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.890 align:middle line:84%
It's very hard to
measure it sometimes.

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes taking
a supplement really

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:18.870 align:middle line:84%
is more an insurance against the
deficiency for a lot of people

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:23.250 align:middle line:84%
rather than actually correcting
an absolute deficiency.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.830 align:middle line:84%
There is some evidence,
however, that increased intakes

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:30.900 align:middle line:84%
of certain nutrients does
reduce the incidence of heart

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.720 align:middle line:90%
disease and cancer and stroke.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.440 align:middle line:84%
There is some evidence that
the fish oils, for example,

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.240 align:middle line:90%
protect our--

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.570 align:middle line:84%
protect us against not
only against heart disease

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:43.200 align:middle line:84%
and some cancers, but
may also protect us

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.630 align:middle line:84%
against Alzheimer's
disease and the disease--

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:49.680 align:middle line:84%
other diseases of brain
aging and even these omega 3

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.710 align:middle line:84%
fatty acids, even if we don't
get enough from our diet

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:55.140 align:middle line:90%
and from eating seafood.

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:57.480 align:middle line:84%
They may protect us
against Parkinson's disease

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.830 align:middle line:84%
and depression and
schizophrenia and so forth.

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:01.690 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot
of good evidence

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:03.120 align:middle line:90%
that supplementation helps.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And you live longer
and healthier

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.690 align:middle line:84%
if you exercise, have a
good diet, and supplement.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:11.040 align:middle line:90%
