00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:08.133 align:middle line:90%


00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Billions and billions and
billions of dollars have been

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.410 align:middle line:90%
spent on cancer research.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.870 align:middle line:84%
There has been
very little change

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.500 align:middle line:84%
in survival rates for cancer
patients, particularly

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.770 align:middle line:84%
the survival rate
after five years.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.080 align:middle line:84%
The five year or
better survival rate

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.490 align:middle line:84%
for almost all forms of cancer
is unchanged for the last four

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.870 align:middle line:90%
decades.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.540 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty sad.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.650 align:middle line:90%
Enough sadness.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.020 align:middle line:90%
Now for the good part.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.370 align:middle line:84%
When we look at high doses of
vitamin C given intravenously

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.070 align:middle line:84%
as an actual
chemotherapeutic agent,

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.780 align:middle line:84%
we have wonderful, uplifting
news for every cancer patient

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:48.890 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.740 align:middle line:90%
And it's easy and safe.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.510 align:middle line:90%
And did I say inexpensive?

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.750 align:middle line:90%
To have a physician give an IV.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.340 align:middle line:90%
You just have to insist on it.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.020 align:middle line:84%
I believe in the next 10 years,
this will become more accepted.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.540 align:middle line:84%
But people with cancer
can't afford to wait.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And the ones that
are already dead

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.340 align:middle line:84%
have been grossly mistreated
by the medical profession

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.620 align:middle line:84%
and by the government that
supposedly is supposed

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.560 align:middle line:84%
to encourage free
research and development

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.600 align:middle line:90%
of all possibilities.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.120 align:middle line:84%
The war against
cancer has been fought

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.280 align:middle line:90%
with one arm behind the back.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And I would never
go into the ring

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.570 align:middle line:84%
with the heavyweight
champion of the world

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.160 align:middle line:90%
and fight with one arm.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And yet, by restricting
cancer research and cancer

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:43.310 align:middle line:84%
treatment to basically drug,
surgery, radiation approaches,

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.860 align:middle line:84%
and not considering
nutrition seriously,

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.180 align:middle line:84%
we've done a terrible
disservice to all these people.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.050 align:middle line:84%
There's student at the Brigham
hospital in Boston, which

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.720 align:middle line:90%
is right next to Harvard Med.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.078 align:middle line:84%
Even then back in 1974,
it was a crisis hospital.

00:01:57.078 --> 00:01:58.620 align:middle line:84%
There were more
doctors and patients.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.100 align:middle line:90%
It was really a grim place.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And I got a chance
to observe and to see

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.790 align:middle line:90%
the failure of medicine.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.919 align:middle line:84%
You would see people,
like the one woman

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.620 align:middle line:90%
I remember with leukemia.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.772 align:middle line:84%
And they would give her
jello and white bread to eat.

00:02:15.772 --> 00:02:18.230 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm not saying that jello
and white bread cause cancer,

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.540 align:middle line:90%
but they sure aren't the cure.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.530 align:middle line:90%
Nursing homes.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.670 align:middle line:90%
You visit a nursing home.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.320 align:middle line:90%
You see what they feed people.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.730 align:middle line:90%
Hospital food.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.280 align:middle line:90%
Even school lunch food.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.530 align:middle line:90%
Is it really good for you?

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.665 align:middle line:84%
What would happen
if everybody ate

00:02:33.665 --> 00:02:36.170 align:middle line:84%
lots and lots of fresh,
organic food that

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.640 align:middle line:90%
was minimally processed?

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.920 align:middle line:84%
I think we'd have an
epidemic of health.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.270 align:middle line:84%
I think the stock
market would tremble.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.890 align:middle line:84%
The drug industry is a
half trillion dollar a year

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.720 align:middle line:90%
worldwide conglomerate.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Almost $300 billion
just in North America.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.220 align:middle line:84%
This is really,
really big business.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.880 align:middle line:84%
What would happen if
everybody were well?

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.790 align:middle line:90%
There is no money in health.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.598 align:middle line:84%
You see, good health
makes a lot of sense,

00:03:07.598 --> 00:03:09.140 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't make
a lot of dollars.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.930 align:middle line:90%


00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.780 align:middle line:90%
The profit is in disease.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.780 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
economics favorite.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.590 align:middle line:84%
And people that are healthy
don't go to doctors.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.640 align:middle line:84%
The curious thing there is that
if you go on patient reports--

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.040 align:middle line:84%
and this helped this person,
it helped this person,

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.350 align:middle line:84%
it helped this person,
that is a powerful way

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.420 align:middle line:90%
to learn and to persuade.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And yet, ironically,
the medical profession

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.670 align:middle line:84%
tends to discount
those as anecdotes

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.680 align:middle line:84%
because they haven't been
double blind placebo tested.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.510 align:middle line:84%
Now the curious
thing about this is

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.600 align:middle line:84%
that most medical
interventions have never been

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.520 align:middle line:90%
double blind placebo tested.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.480 align:middle line:84%
For instance, do you really
think that radiation for cancer

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.240 align:middle line:90%
was double blind placebo tested?

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.490 align:middle line:84%
Do you really think
that they had two rooms,

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.878 align:middle line:84%
and one room was the
real radiation machine,

00:04:00.878 --> 00:04:03.170 align:middle line:84%
and the other room was a
phony one that looked the same

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.820 align:middle line:90%
and had the same lights?

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.260 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.322 align:middle line:84%
Vaccinations were not
double blind placebo tested.

00:04:09.322 --> 00:04:11.030 align:middle line:84%
They tried the
vaccination, and then they

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.650 align:middle line:84%
looked at physician reports to
see if fewer kids got polio.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.980 align:middle line:84%
We have an interesting
setup here.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.360 align:middle line:84%
The medical profession can
say, it's just an anecdote.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, somehow, the
fact that that person got better

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.490 align:middle line:90%
doesn't count.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.550 align:middle line:84%
But if it's double blind
placebo controlled,

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:32.660 align:middle line:90%
that's the gold standard.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.790 align:middle line:84%
What I try to do in
my work-- my books,

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.420 align:middle line:84%
my website, and even the Journal
of Orthomolecular Medicine,

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.660 align:middle line:90%
is to provide motivation.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.950 align:middle line:84%
Tell people that you
don't have to be sick.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.500 align:middle line:90%
It's a choice.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not blaming the
patient when I say that.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.520 align:middle line:84%
If you take a person who's
sick and say, oh, well,

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.100 align:middle line:84%
you chose to be
sick, that's not it.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.260 align:middle line:84%
What we're really saying
is, if you're well,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.360 align:middle line:84%
you have a choice
to be well or sick.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.290 align:middle line:84%
If you're sick, all
right, there you are.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.470 align:middle line:84%
What happened yesterday,
last week, last month

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.400 align:middle line:90%
doesn't matter.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.330 align:middle line:90%
Start now.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.500 align:middle line:90%
Reverse it.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.780 align:middle line:90%
You don't have stay sick.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.510 align:middle line:84%
We're not really that
interested in what

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.900 align:middle line:84%
you did because what
you did didn't work.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.070 align:middle line:90%
So try something new.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.090 align:middle line:84%
The old idea that if you
always do what you always did,

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.300 align:middle line:84%
you'll always get
what you always got.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.957 align:middle line:84%
The good news is that people
are not a bunch of dummies.

00:05:26.957 --> 00:05:28.790 align:middle line:84%
Abraham Lincoln expressed
that when he said,

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.700 align:middle line:84%
you can fool some of the
people all of the time and all

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.440 align:middle line:84%
of the people some
of the time, but you

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.690 align:middle line:84%
can't fool all of the
people all of the time.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's why over
half of the population

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.880 align:middle line:84%
now takes vitamins, even
though most doctors would say

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.820 align:middle line:90%
that it's really not necessary.

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.670 align:middle line:84%
We have a public that's
catching on quicker

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.130 align:middle line:90%
than the medical professions.

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:53.630 align:middle line:90%
In a way, it's sad.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.540 align:middle line:90%
But in a way, it's great.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.340 align:middle line:84%
People should stop
being patients

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.800 align:middle line:90%
and start being people.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.750 align:middle line:90%
Why not be healthy and happy?

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.040 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.070 align:middle line:84%
You change your life, you do
some exercise, you eat right,

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.972 align:middle line:90%
you feel better.

00:06:07.972 --> 00:06:08.930 align:middle line:90%
All right, that's good.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:09.830 align:middle line:90%
You look better.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:10.970 align:middle line:90%
All right, that's good.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:11.790 align:middle line:90%
You live longer.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:12.590 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.550 align:middle line:90%
You save money.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:14.960 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And you have the
enormous satisfaction

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.600 align:middle line:90%
of having done it yourself.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.970 align:middle line:84%
People think, I don't
have a medical education,

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:23.840 align:middle line:90%
I can't know this.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.890 align:middle line:90%
Oh, please.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.550 align:middle line:84%
How complicated is it
to eat right, and drink

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.680 align:middle line:90%
vegetable juices, and exercise?

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.350 align:middle line:84%
You don't need any
degree to know that.

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.090 align:middle line:90%
It's too simple to work.

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.260 align:middle line:90%
It's cheap.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.280 align:middle line:90%
It's simple.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.270 align:middle line:90%
It's safe.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.350 align:middle line:90%
It's effective.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it can't
possibly be the answer.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.220 align:middle line:90%
But it is.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.000 align:middle line:90%
