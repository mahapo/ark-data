00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Basic Gerson Therapy is
essentially diet and lifestyle

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.480 align:middle line:90%
and detox changes.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And what the basic Gerson
Therapy consists of

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.890 align:middle line:84%
is essentially 13 glasses
of fresh fruit and vegetable

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.702 align:middle line:84%
juices every day, typically
made from citrus for breakfast.

00:00:23.702 --> 00:00:25.410 align:middle line:84%
The typical meals, so
you'll have an idea

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.050 align:middle line:90%
of what a typical day is like.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.960 align:middle line:84%
You'll have citrus, usually
orange juice for breakfast,

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.050 align:middle line:90%
oatmeal.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.500 align:middle line:84%
You can have stuff like fresh
fruit or stewed fruit or honey

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.810 align:middle line:84%
and add a couple pieces of good
malted grain, whole wheat or--

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.790 align:middle line:90%
not whole wheat.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Mult-grain no salt added toast
and then some fresh fruit.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And then for lunch,
patients will typically

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.320 align:middle line:84%
have a nice, large
fresh raw garden salad.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.260 align:middle line:84%
Hippocrates soup, which is kind
of a tomato, potato based soup.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.440 align:middle line:84%
The original recipe was
actually given by the father

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.970 align:middle line:90%
of medicine, Hippocrates.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's really a
very delicious soup.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.420 align:middle line:84%
It has leeks, and it has
onions, and all sorts

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.860 align:middle line:90%
of really good things in it.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And then the typical baseline
is like a baked potato,

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.820 align:middle line:84%
a couple of cooked vegetables,
and a fresh fruit for dessert.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And you can rotate
those things around

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.950 align:middle line:84%
by doing things
like potato salad,

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.850 align:middle line:84%
doing yams, or sweet potatoes,
doing a whole grain rice, just

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.780 align:middle line:84%
everything like that
you want to use.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.500 align:middle line:84%
But that's kind of the
basic essence of it

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.960 align:middle line:84%
as far as the diet
nutrition goes.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.920 align:middle line:84%
We also start our patients off
with numerous coffee enemas.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why we use
coffee enemas, well, aren't you

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.470 align:middle line:84%
supposed to drink that
with cream and sugar.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.970 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.805 align:middle line:84%
Organic coffee, if you can't
get organic then mountain grown.

00:01:51.805 --> 00:01:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we use,
and even in an emergency

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.720 align:middle line:90%
you could probably use instant.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.780 align:middle line:84%
But for the typical
patients, I like them

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.200 align:middle line:84%
to use the organic
coffee and do not

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.110 align:middle line:90%
make it with a paper filter.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.740 align:middle line:84%
You want a stainless
steel filter.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.740 align:middle line:84%
Or the easiest way
is just boil it.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.259 align:middle line:84%
Three heaping tablespoons
of coffee grounds

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.750 align:middle line:84%
to one quart of good pure
water, not junk water.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.200 align:middle line:90%
You need good quality water.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.450 align:middle line:84%
Distilled or reverse osmosis
or some good quality water

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.010 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And our patients typically, when
they start off at the hospital,

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.910 align:middle line:84%
and you want to be careful
doing this at home.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.010 align:middle line:84%
I would advise you
if you want to go

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.770 align:middle line:84%
on this strong of
a program to be

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:43.780 align:middle line:84%
under the care of an
experienced Gerson practitioner.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.120 align:middle line:84%
So please seek out a good,
experienced practitioner

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.540 align:middle line:84%
before you start
on a heavy program.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And that includes things like
five coffee enemas a day,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.580 align:middle line:84%
typically use one
quart of coffee.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Lay on your right
side, put the coffee

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.460 align:middle line:84%
in, hold it for a minimum
of 10 minutes, 10 to 20

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.550 align:middle line:90%
is a good time frame.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.520 align:middle line:90%
And then get rid of the coffee.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.830 align:middle line:90%
And what do coffee enemas do?

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was talking
about Dr. Peter Lectner

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.280 align:middle line:90%
who was one of my trainees.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And since he runs the largest
government run hospital

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.965 align:middle line:84%
and also Peter is the Director
of the Surgical Division there.

00:03:20.965 --> 00:03:23.340 align:middle line:84%
He had government money to do
animal model studies, which

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.810 align:middle line:90%
is really cool.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And what he found
out in those animal

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.240 align:middle line:84%
model studies is that one of the
ingredients in coffee cafestol

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.990 align:middle line:90%
is very bioactive.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And what cafestol
does is it activates

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.810 align:middle line:84%
the glutathion S-transferase
system, which is essentially

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.710 align:middle line:84%
the basis for cellular immunity
throughout your entire body.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
think, well, I'm

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.145 align:middle line:84%
going to absorb
a lot of caffeine

00:03:47.145 --> 00:03:48.270 align:middle line:90%
by having that much coffee.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.235 align:middle line:84%
No, it doesn't
appear that you do.

00:03:50.235 --> 00:03:52.110 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it appears that
the caffeine may not

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.510 align:middle line:90%
be absorbed at all.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.620 align:middle line:90%
But cafestol definitely is.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the things
that coffee enemas do

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.830 align:middle line:84%
is activate the
body's immune system.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that
coffee enemas do

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.180 align:middle line:84%
is dilates the bile ducts
and increases bio production

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.720 align:middle line:90%
and increases bio flow.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.730 align:middle line:84%
This has also been shown in
animal model studies with dogs.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that
coffee enemas do

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.720 align:middle line:84%
is they help very much
with pain control.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.470 align:middle line:84%
I have patients come in all
the time on morphine, Dilaudid,

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.980 align:middle line:90%
Vicodin, breakthrough meds.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.440 align:middle line:84%
Some of them come in on Dilaudid
to morphine every two or three

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.910 align:middle line:90%
hours.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Typically, they stay with
me about three weeks.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.850 align:middle line:84%
Before they go home,
they are totally off

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.980 align:middle line:90%
all of their opiates.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.320 align:middle line:84%
They are totally off all
of their pain control

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.800 align:middle line:90%
meds, totally pain controlled.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.090 align:middle line:90%
And remember, I didn't say--

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.890 align:middle line:84%
maybe not pain free
at this moment,

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.890 align:middle line:84%
but they will be, but totally
pain controlled on nothing

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:55.170 align:middle line:84%
more than coffee enemas
and aspirin, amazing.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.070 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that it does,
of course, is a bowel cleanse.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And people always
think about enemas

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:00.612 align:middle line:90%
as doing a colon cleanse.

00:05:00.612 --> 00:05:03.190 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it does that, but that's
not one of the main things

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.230 align:middle line:90%
that we're looking for.

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.110 align:middle line:84%
So we've got immune
system enhancement,

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.220 align:middle line:84%
we have pain control,
we have liver flush,

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.400 align:middle line:90%
and we have a colon cleanse.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.160 align:middle line:84%
So we have at least four
or five really good things.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure that there
are a lot more of them

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.060 align:middle line:90%
that coffee enemas do.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.150 align:middle line:84%
So we have all the
nutrition that we're doing,

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.602 align:middle line:84%
a good, heavy detox program
with five coffee enemas a day,

00:05:23.602 --> 00:05:25.060 align:middle line:84%
and then there are
some supplements

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.410 align:middle line:90%
that we give the patients.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.413 align:middle line:84%
Most of them are
not medications.

00:05:28.413 --> 00:05:30.580 align:middle line:84%
Most of them are just
supplements to help the body's

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.310 align:middle line:90%
metabolism function better.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Most of the patients
that come in

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.990 align:middle line:84%
have low metabolic function,
low metabolic rate,

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.550 align:middle line:84%
their bodies just aren't
working as well as they should.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And if their bodies
we're working well

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.150 align:middle line:84%
and their immune systems
were working well,

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.050 align:middle line:84%
they wouldn't be sick
in the first place.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.640 align:middle line:84%
So we help support
the body's metabolism,

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.080 align:middle line:84%
help support the body
to function better.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And one of the precepts
of Gerson therapy

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:58.030 align:middle line:90%
is the potassium-sodium balance.

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.950 align:middle line:84%
Freeman Cope, the gentleman who
I talked to you about earlier--

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.010 align:middle line:84%
and there was research
that the Navy did,

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.740 align:middle line:84%
some studies on Gerson therapy,
which really convinced him

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:06.970 align:middle line:90%
about what Gerson was doing.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And Gerson's theory was that
sick cells, particularly

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.190 align:middle line:84%
cancer cells, have a higher than
normal amount of sodium in them

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:18.820 align:middle line:84%
and a lower than normal
amount of potassium in them.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And Gerson therapy-- the
basic Gerson therapy--

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:30.670 align:middle line:84%
focuses on doing an exchange of
that sodium-potassium balance.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:34.120 align:middle line:84%
The body has the ability
to retain sodium within it,

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.190 align:middle line:84%
does not have the ability
to retain potassium.

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.990 align:middle line:84%
If you have taken
too much potassium,

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.130 align:middle line:84%
it goes out in the
excrement and the urine.

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And so the basic Gerson therapy
concentrates on high potassium

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.840 align:middle line:84%
foods, high potassium
input, and works

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.480 align:middle line:84%
on trying to get
potassium into the cells

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.860 align:middle line:84%
to help create healthy cells
where there was disease ones.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.080 align:middle line:84%
Some of the other
things that I use

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.900 align:middle line:84%
that are not part of
the basic Gerson therapy

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.720 align:middle line:84%
are things like ultraviolet
blood irradiation,

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.910 align:middle line:84%
another thing that Dr. Josef
Issels brought to the program.

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's where blood
is withdrawn, exposed

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:14.035 align:middle line:84%
to UV light, which kills not
only cancer cells but fungus,

00:07:14.035 --> 00:07:19.510 align:middle line:84%
and bacteria, and viruses, and
also produces ozone or hydrogen

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.220 align:middle line:90%
peroxide right in the blood.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Anytime you expose fluid,
water-based fluid--

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.020 align:middle line:90%
which blood is--

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:30.700 align:middle line:84%
to UV light, it produces
hydrogen peroxide or ozone

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.260 align:middle line:90%
in that fluid.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And so it has really
good properties as well.

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:39.940 align:middle line:84%
In surgery, for example, when we
have the abdomen totally open,

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.680 align:middle line:84%
many times you'll
see surgeons putting

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.380 align:middle line:84%
that hydrogen peroxide directly
into the open abdominal cavity

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.720 align:middle line:90%
to help clean the area.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And we, typically, use hydrogen
peroxide externally on wounds

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:50.260 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.302 align:middle line:84%
So to be able to produce
that kind of thing right

00:07:52.302 --> 00:07:55.920 align:middle line:84%
in your blood and kill off
the disease right where it is,

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.750 align:middle line:90%
is really a unique aspect.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:00.820 align:middle line:84%
Hyperbaric medicine
is also something

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.040 align:middle line:90%
that I'm very much a fan of.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm also a hyperbaric
physician and did training

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:09.640 align:middle line:90%
in San Diego and Denver.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And here in the United States,
only about 35 different disease

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:21.160 align:middle line:84%
entities are legally treatable
by hyperbaric medicine,

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:25.450 align:middle line:90%
worldwide about 187 of them are.

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And cancer is just one of
them that works so well.

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:33.370 align:middle line:84%
But so many other types of--
almost any degenerative disease

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:36.340 align:middle line:84%
will respond positively
to hyperbaric medicine.

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And basically, what that does
is raises the partial pressure

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:45.580 align:middle line:84%
of oxygen in the blood
and then tissues.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.370 align:middle line:84%
You can actually have
a crush injury where

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:50.465 align:middle line:90%
discs lead to the crush injury.

00:08:50.465 --> 00:08:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a person
in a hyperbaric chamber,

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:55.900 align:middle line:84%
you'll get increased tissue
levels of PO2, partial pressure

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.520 align:middle line:84%
of oxygen. And so
hyperbaric medicine

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.430 align:middle line:90%
is another wonderful modality.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:02.380 align:middle line:84%
One thing that I
will warn you about

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.060 align:middle line:84%
is the little blow
up chambers that

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.580 align:middle line:84%
only do about a half atmosphere
won't work very well.

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.935 align:middle line:84%
You need they go out at
least 1 and 1/2 atmospheres

00:09:08.935 --> 00:09:10.450 align:middle line:84%
or so before you
start getting very

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:17.510 align:middle line:84%
much of an increase in oxygen
levels in blood or tissue.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:20.950 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going to do
hyperbaric medicine, use that.

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:24.360 align:middle line:90%


00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.310 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk for a
minute about dentistry.

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:29.580 align:middle line:84%
Very few people
realize the impact

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:33.180 align:middle line:84%
that dental problems have
on your overall well-being,

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.860 align:middle line:90%
on your overall health.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:41.430 align:middle line:84%
If you have dental problems
and you don't correct it,

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:45.110 align:middle line:84%
you have a chronic drip, drip,
drip into the blood system,

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.220 align:middle line:90%
into the bloodstream--

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:51.240 align:middle line:84%
infections, bacteria,
problems of all types.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.990 align:middle line:84%
You must correct
dental problems.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:56.520 align:middle line:84%
Now there are ways
to correct them

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:57.978 align:middle line:84%
and there are ways
to correct them.

00:09:57.978 --> 00:10:01.340 align:middle line:90%
What's the right way to do it?

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:04.920 align:middle line:84%
You definitely do not want
silver amalgam fillings.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.300 align:middle line:90%


00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.950 align:middle line:84%
The silver is probably OK,
the amalgam is the problem,

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:13.570 align:middle line:90%
and that's the mercury.

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And I can't understand
how dentists worldwide

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:21.250 align:middle line:84%
continue to put tons of mercury
into the heads of people

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:24.520 align:middle line:84%
around the world when
we're told that even

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.420 align:middle line:84%
the smallest amount of mercury
that you might absorb--

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.212 align:middle line:84%
if a thermometer breaks
in a child's mouth,

00:10:29.212 --> 00:10:30.962 align:middle line:84%
you have to take them
down to the hospital

00:10:30.962 --> 00:10:32.710 align:middle line:84%
and get them pumped
out immediately

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:34.643 align:middle line:84%
because the mercury
is too dangerous.

00:10:34.643 --> 00:10:37.060 align:middle line:84%
If it's that toxic, why are
we putting it into our mouths?

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:40.770 align:middle line:90%


00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:43.320 align:middle line:84%
There have been
numerous studies that

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:51.550 align:middle line:84%
show that simply by removing the
silver amalgam fillings cancer

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:56.440 align:middle line:90%
goes away, arthritis goes away.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.260 align:middle line:84%
All the chronic,
long-term, hard to deal

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:04.240 align:middle line:84%
with, degenerative problems
improve with doing nothing

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.820 align:middle line:84%
more than getting
rid of the silver

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.100 align:middle line:84%
amalgam fillings that are
continually leaching out

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:10.600 align:middle line:90%
mercury into your body.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.740 align:middle line:90%


00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:13.990 align:middle line:90%
What do you replace them with?

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:16.960 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of good
replacements out there now.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.080 align:middle line:90%


00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.510 align:middle line:84%
Almost any of the
modern replacements

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:30.715 align:middle line:84%
that do not use mercury in
them probably quite usable.

00:11:30.715 --> 00:11:34.180 align:middle line:90%


00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.310 align:middle line:84%
Also, you don't
want root canals.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:37.980 align:middle line:90%
Do not have a root canal.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.850 align:middle line:90%
Do you not have an implant.

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:43.570 align:middle line:84%
Anytime you have a dead
tooth, the gums typically

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:45.978 align:middle line:90%
will adhere to a live tooth.

00:11:45.978 --> 00:11:47.770 align:middle line:84%
When you have a dead
tooth for any reason--

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:49.978 align:middle line:84%
whether it be a root canal,
whether it be an implant,

00:11:49.978 --> 00:11:51.340 align:middle line:90%
whatever the reason--

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:54.380 align:middle line:84%
the gums will pull
back just a tiny bit

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.920 align:middle line:84%
and bacteria will
get down inside.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:02.100 align:middle line:84%
You'll end up with abscesses in
the bottom, with spongy bone.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:03.850 align:middle line:84%
You need to go to a
good holistic dentist,

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.160 align:middle line:84%
a good biological
dentist, have a tooth--

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.920 align:middle line:84%
if you have a root canal
or a dead tooth-- removed.

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.520 align:middle line:84%
Many times, they'll find
abscesses, pus pockets hanging

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.710 align:middle line:90%
on the bottom of the roots.

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:17.530 align:middle line:84%
They'll have to get a burr
tool and go down and burr out

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:19.863 align:middle line:84%
the jaw bone because there'll
be a spongy jaw there.

00:12:19.863 --> 00:12:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And have then
burred out until you

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.530 align:middle line:84%
get down to good, healthy
bone because the bone will

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:25.374 align:middle line:90%
grow right back in.

00:12:25.374 --> 00:12:30.847 align:middle line:84%
But Dr. Issels did numerous
studies, just two of them

00:12:30.847 --> 00:12:31.930 align:middle line:90%
that I'm going to mention.

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:36.220 align:middle line:84%
One was over 400 consecutive
cancer patients that came in.

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:40.060 align:middle line:84%
And he said the
frequencies radiating off

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:46.750 align:middle line:84%
of the teeth that had root
canals and the frequencies

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:48.130 align:middle line:90%
of the tumors--

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:49.413 align:middle line:90%
almost identical.

00:12:49.413 --> 00:12:51.580 align:middle line:84%
Pulled the root canal--
within days the tumors start

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:57.190 align:middle line:90%
going away, incredible stuff.

00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:00.280 align:middle line:90%
Not only that, but he took--

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.040 align:middle line:90%
and he did this several times--

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:07.763 align:middle line:84%
but one of them is he took a
root canal tooth, ground it up,

00:13:07.763 --> 00:13:10.180 align:middle line:84%
put it through an autoclave--
supposed to kill everything,

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:10.980 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.060 align:middle line:84%
We autoclave our
surgical instruments

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.770 align:middle line:84%
before we go in
to have surgery--

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:16.480 align:middle line:84%
supposed to kill
everything, right?

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Autoclaved it-- mixed the
stuff up-- the residue

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.920 align:middle line:84%
that was left
after autoclaving--

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.120 align:middle line:84%
injected this into a bunch of
lab animals, and guess what?

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:28.630 align:middle line:84%
They ended up with all sorts of
diseases-- cancer, arthritis,

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:33.160 align:middle line:84%
lymphoma-- you name
it, the animals had it.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.260 align:middle line:90%
And you said, how could that be?

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.400 align:middle line:84%
How can all of this
come from only one tooth

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.220 align:middle line:90%
that only had one root canal?

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.040 align:middle line:90%


00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.430 align:middle line:84%
Possibly there may
be a connection.

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:51.690 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Virginia Livingston
talked about one basic life

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:54.760 align:middle line:84%
form from which all other
cancers, all other diseases

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:55.570 align:middle line:90%
start.

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:58.270 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Issels talked
about the same thing.

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:01.030 align:middle line:84%
What do you need to do
for your dental problems?

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:05.020 align:middle line:84%
Remove the offending
tooth, whether it's dead--

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.690 align:middle line:90%
for whatever reason.

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:13.580 align:middle line:84%
Put in a partial
bridge, do something.

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:16.970 align:middle line:84%
If you have silver amalgam
fillings, get them removed.

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:17.970 align:middle line:90%
Don't do it all at once.

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:19.930 align:middle line:84%
It may be too much for
your body to handle.

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:26.680 align:middle line:84%
Go see someone who's proficient
in biological dentistry,

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.410 align:middle line:84%
knows what they're doing,
has some experience

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:32.680 align:middle line:84%
because you want to
give your body the best

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.270 align:middle line:90%
chance to get well.

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:36.520 align:middle line:84%
But do take good
care of your teeth.

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:40.690 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Gerson also
said numerous times

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:46.300 align:middle line:84%
that an ongoing dental
problem is something that's

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.120 align:middle line:84%
incompatible with
healing, something

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.830 align:middle line:84%
that's incompatible with
getting rid of cancers.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:53.920 align:middle line:84%
You have to put the
mouth in good order

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.660 align:middle line:90%
in order to have a healthy body.

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:58.200 align:middle line:90%
