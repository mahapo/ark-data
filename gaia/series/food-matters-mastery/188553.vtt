00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.400 align:middle line:90%
>> My name's Patrick Holdford.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.830 align:middle line:84%
I started out as a
psychologist, and I

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.940 align:middle line:84%
was fascinated in what goes
wrong in severe mental illness,

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.590 align:middle line:90%
schizophrenia.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.340 align:middle line:84%
And way back in the '70s,
I came across this research

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.060 align:middle line:84%
that was reporting
incredible results using

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.740 align:middle line:90%
very large amounts of vitamins.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.670 align:middle line:84%
Not psychotherapy, not
drugs, but actually vitamins.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And this was really
good research.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.923 align:middle line:84%
I took it's my professor
and he said, ah,

00:00:37.923 --> 00:00:39.690 align:middle line:90%
it's a load of nonsense.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.580 align:middle line:90%
But I couldn't really fault it.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.790 align:middle line:84%
So I jumped on a plane,
and I went to North America

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.370 align:middle line:84%
to meet the people
who'd done the research.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.000 align:middle line:84%
This man called
Dr. Abram Hoffer.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.655 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what is your
success rate using nutrition

00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:55.455 align:middle line:90%
for schizophrenia?

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:58.800 align:middle line:90%
And he said 85% cure.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, I nearly fell off my chair,
because most psychiatrists

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.780 align:middle line:84%
have never seen anyone
with schizophrenia cured.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.060 align:middle line:84%
I said, what's your
definition of cure?

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.880 align:middle line:84%
He said, free of symptoms,
able to socialize

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.630 align:middle line:84%
with family and friends,
and paying income tax.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.190 align:middle line:90%
And thus, I became his student.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And I have seen hundreds
of people diagnosed

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.090 align:middle line:84%
with schizophrenia,
severe mental illness, who

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.220 align:middle line:90%
don't have it anymore.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.750 align:middle line:84%
One of the brightest
minds in science

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.710 align:middle line:84%
in the last century or two,
Dr. Linus Pauling, Einstein's

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.800 align:middle line:84%
friend, found out
about this research

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.680 align:middle line:84%
using very large
amounts of vitamin C

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.580 align:middle line:84%
and niacin, some B
vitamin folic acid.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And he also had
never seen a chemical

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.380 align:middle line:84%
where tiny amount,
and we're talking

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.390 align:middle line:84%
10 milligrams of vitamin C,
less than you can barely see,

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.950 align:middle line:90%
will stop you dying from scurvy.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And yet, massive amounts,
like 10,000 milligrams,

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.710 align:middle line:84%
which is completely non-toxic,
can have these profound health

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.510 align:middle line:90%
benefits.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.100 align:middle line:84%
Not only antipsychotic,
but anti cancer, antiviral.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.040 align:middle line:84%
So he started to really
focus on this whole area.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a man with two
Nobel prizes and 48 PhDs.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.720 align:middle line:90%
He's very, very bright.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.100 align:middle line:84%
All of modern biochemistry is
really based upon his work.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And very soon, he realized
that the future of medicine--

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.280 align:middle line:84%
if I quote him-- the future of
medicine is optimum nutrition.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Optimum nutrition is the
medicine of tomorrow.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.363 align:middle line:84%
If you have any disease for
which you go to your doctor

00:02:35.363 --> 00:02:36.780 align:middle line:84%
and they've
prescribed you a drug,

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.140 align:middle line:84%
it means that the drug only
works because your chemistry is

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.820 align:middle line:90%
out of balance.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And what we're saying is
that if you can find out

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.310 align:middle line:84%
what is your perfect
intake of the nutrients,

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.320 align:middle line:84%
these are the chemicals that
are part of our evolution,

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.760 align:middle line:84%
they're part of how
we are designed,

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.550 align:middle line:84%
and you can take them in
through diet and supplements,

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.030 align:middle line:84%
they will bring your
out of balance system

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.480 align:middle line:84%
back into balance
and restore health.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And we've literally spent
the last 20 years exploring

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.030 align:middle line:84%
exactly what you need to
do, what you need to eat,

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.850 align:middle line:84%
to be in the best
possible health.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.180 align:middle line:84%
Most of us are quite literally
digging our own graves

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.950 align:middle line:90%
with a knife and fork.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And when you get your own
optimum nutrition right--

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.350 align:middle line:84%
and it's really not
that difficult--

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.030 align:middle line:84%
you're not only
going to add probably

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:36.820 align:middle line:84%
10 years to your healthy life
but also life to your years.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that obesity is the
second most preventable cause

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.380 align:middle line:90%
of death?

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.860 align:middle line:90%
Smoking being the first.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.950 align:middle line:90%
Obesity is widespread.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's a joke
in more ways than one.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.500 align:middle line:84%
But it's not a joke, because
there is this whole trend now

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.650 align:middle line:84%
that so many of us are gaining
weight and then becoming obese,

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.710 align:middle line:90%
which is extreme overweight.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is leading into so
many other diseases-- diabetes,

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.260 align:middle line:84%
heart disease,
depression, and so on.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.380 align:middle line:84%
So the real question
is why and how

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.900 align:middle line:90%
can you reverse this process?

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to
tell you something

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.890 align:middle line:90%
that might surprise you.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:25.650 align:middle line:84%
It's not about calories,
and it's not about fat.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.060 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the statistics,
for example, in Britain,

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.780 align:middle line:84%
we have started over
the last 15 years

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.220 align:middle line:84%
to consume less calories
and much less fat.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.400 align:middle line:84%
In America, they've cut
the percentage of calories

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.632 align:middle line:90%
from fat from 42% to 34%.

00:04:45.632 --> 00:04:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And what difference has it
made to the obesity epidemic?

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.250 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.520 align:middle line:90%
It continues, ever-growing.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.820 align:middle line:84%
The real problem with
obesity and weight gain

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.360 align:middle line:84%
has to do with your
blood sugar level.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.520 align:middle line:84%
Put very simply,
we run on glucose.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.640 align:middle line:84%
We don't run on calories,
we run on glucose.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And when your blood
sugar level is too high,

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.740 align:middle line:90%
you dump the excess as fat.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And when your blood sugar level
is too low, you get hungry,

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.380 align:middle line:90%
and you get tired.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.250 align:middle line:84%
The first guy who caught onto
this was Atkins, Dr. Atkins.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.170 align:middle line:84%
He realized that protein and fat
don't affect your blood sugar.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.490 align:middle line:90%
So he said, OK.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give
people a diet of protein

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.320 align:middle line:90%
and fat, no carbohydrate.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, their hunger
reduced, and it worked.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.800 align:middle line:90%
They lost weight.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And it does work
for weight loss.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.790 align:middle line:84%
But that kind of diet
really isn't good for you

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:42.590 align:middle line:90%
in the long run.

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And even if the idea of
bacon and eggs for breakfast

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.510 align:middle line:84%
fills you with great glee
as a way to lose weight,

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.970 align:middle line:84%
it probably won't
in two months time,

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:56.260 align:middle line:84%
because we crave foods like
bread, pasta, and so on.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.520 align:middle line:84%
So the real answer
to losing weight,

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.240 align:middle line:84%
of reversing this process, is
to balance your blood sugar.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's done by eating what's
called a low glycemic load

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.840 align:middle line:90%
diet, or GL diet.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.620 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to be as extreme
as the Atkins type approach.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.990 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you need some protein.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And yes, you also need what
we call the slow releasing

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.710 align:middle line:90%
carbohydrates.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.530 align:middle line:90%
That's the low GI foods.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.160 align:middle line:84%
An example would be an oat
based cereal for breakfast

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.300 align:middle line:84%
rather than cornflakes, or
eating barriers or an apple

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.690 align:middle line:84%
rather than eating
a banana or raisins.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:41.530 align:middle line:84%
So if you learn how to combine
the right kind of proteins

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.620 align:middle line:84%
with these slow
releasing carbohydrates,

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.340 align:middle line:84%
and actually eating more food,
having breakfast, lunch, dinner

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.340 align:middle line:84%
and two snacks, as long as
you get your blood sugar

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.890 align:middle line:84%
effect right, you'll feel
full, you won't get hungry,

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.800 align:middle line:84%
your craving for sweet
foods will reduce,

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.990 align:middle line:90%
and so will your weight.

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:03.670 align:middle line:84%
We've done a lot of
research on this,

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:09.020 align:middle line:84%
and consistently, we find people
losing substantial amounts.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:14.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about six to
12 kilos in six weeks.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:19.000 align:middle line:84%
But what's amazing is as people
find their weight leaving,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.840 align:middle line:90%
they feel so fantastic.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.790 align:middle line:84%
So if the idea of losing
weight, feeling great,

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:28.420 align:middle line:84%
not feeling hungry,
never feeling hungry,

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:33.310 align:middle line:84%
and losing your desire for
very sweet foods attracts you,

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:38.020 align:middle line:84%
then you need to learn how to
eat a low glycemic low diet,

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.250 align:middle line:90%
a low GL diet.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.870 align:middle line:84%
That is the future of
all weight control.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:47.920 align:middle line:84%
So you might have heard
of GI, or Glycemic Index.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.170 align:middle line:90%
It's a very useful measure.

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:54.010 align:middle line:84%
It's a measure out of 100,
and if a food has a high GI,

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.345 align:middle line:84%
it means the sugar in
it releases quickly

00:07:56.345 --> 00:07:57.220 align:middle line:90%
into the bloodstream.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:01.700 align:middle line:84%
Cornflakes would be an example,
while oat flakes has a low GI.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.930 align:middle line:84%
So the general message is
if you eat low GI foods

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:07.550 align:middle line:84%
like apple and
oats for breakfast,

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:10.480 align:middle line:84%
it will make you feel fuller
for longer than eating something

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.283 align:middle line:90%
like Cornflakes and raisins.

00:08:13.283 --> 00:08:14.575 align:middle line:90%
Take something like watermelon.

00:08:14.575 --> 00:08:17.300 align:middle line:90%
It has a score of 72.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.330 align:middle line:84%
So that means that the
sugar in watermelon

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.910 align:middle line:90%
releases very, very fast.

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:24.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a problem with
GI, and watermelon's a good way

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:26.680 align:middle line:90%
to illustrate.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.110 align:middle line:84%
Number one, there
have been 12 diets

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:32.380 align:middle line:84%
based on low GI
foods, five of which

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:37.150 align:middle line:84%
have shown weight loss, four of
which have shown weight gain,

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.530 align:middle line:84%
and three of which have
shown no different.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:43.240 align:middle line:84%
So even though these low GI
foods are very good for you,

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:47.320 align:middle line:84%
the evidence of just eating
low GI foods to lose weight

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.790 align:middle line:90%
is not great.

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:50.380 align:middle line:90%
Now, watermelon.

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.390 align:middle line:90%
Let's come back to that.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:54.850 align:middle line:84%
If you were thinking
like Atkins who

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:59.050 align:middle line:84%
limited the amount of
carbohydrate in a food,

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:01.120 align:middle line:84%
watermelons are a
very, very good food,

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.450 align:middle line:84%
because it actually has very
little carbohydrate in it.

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:10.190 align:middle line:84%
A nice, big 120 gram slice is
only six grams of carbohydrate.

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.010 align:middle line:90%
So he'd say yeah, tick the box.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.710 align:middle line:90%
It's mainly water.

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:17.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, but the kind of
carbohydrate in it,

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.110 align:middle line:84%
the kind of sugar in it
is very fast releasing.

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:22.810 align:middle line:90%
So it has a GI of 72.

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And most books will tell
you above 70 is bad news.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.420 align:middle line:90%
Never eat it.

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:31.150 align:middle line:84%
So it's a bit
misleading, the GI.

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:34.780 align:middle line:84%
Because you could eat a food
that has fast releasing sugar

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:37.450 align:middle line:84%
but so little of
it, and actually

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:40.750 align:middle line:84%
it really won't affect
your bloodstream much.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:43.010 align:middle line:84%
Or you could eat a
food like chocolate,

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:46.640 align:middle line:84%
which has a GI of 49,
and most foods below 50,

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.830 align:middle line:90%
you're meant to eat them.

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:52.360 align:middle line:84%
So the sugar in chocolate
actually releases more slowly

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.260 align:middle line:90%
than watermelon.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.340 align:middle line:90%
But there's lots of it.

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.760 align:middle line:90%
So the net effect is very bad.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.280 align:middle line:84%
So all the scientific
community now

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:05.080 align:middle line:84%
have moved to something
called GL, or glycemic load,

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.450 align:middle line:84%
and that's when you
both take into account

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:09.700 align:middle line:90%
what Atkins was about, i.e.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:13.210 align:middle line:84%
How much carbohydrate
there is in the food,

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:18.670 align:middle line:84%
and you take into account how
fast the sugar in the food

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:20.950 align:middle line:90%
actually releases.

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And in the case of watermelon,
if you put these two together,

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.010 align:middle line:84%
you get a GL of four,
which is very low.

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:29.950 align:middle line:84%
So there's absolutely
nothing wrong

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:32.860 align:middle line:84%
with eating a slice
of watermelon.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:36.730 align:middle line:84%
GL is the future, because
it's the only precise way

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:40.360 align:middle line:84%
to know exactly what a food's
going to do to your energy,

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.810 align:middle line:84%
to your blood sugar,
and your weight.

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:45.790 align:middle line:84%
The World Health
Organization say

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:50.110 align:middle line:84%
that the biggest problem
facing us in the 21st century

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:51.370 align:middle line:90%
is not cancer.

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:52.940 align:middle line:90%
It's not heart disease.

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.390 align:middle line:90%
It's actually mental illness.

00:10:55.390 --> 00:11:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And of that depression,
is a major, major part.

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:04.930 align:middle line:84%
In America, a staggering
one in nine women

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:07.560 align:middle line:90%
are now taking antidepressants.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:11.530 align:middle line:84%
15% of the population in
most Western countries

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:13.690 align:middle line:90%
are clinically depressed.

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:15.940 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what is going on?

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes, our world has changed.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.670 align:middle line:84%
We're under more
stress, more pressure.

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:24.580 align:middle line:84%
The pace of change
is massive, and I'm

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:28.240 align:middle line:84%
sure that's difficult
for many of us.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.720 align:middle line:84%
But what's extraordinary
is that the impact

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:35.740 align:middle line:84%
of what you put in
your mouth on the brain

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:39.160 align:middle line:84%
and how you think and feel,
not only in depression but also

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:44.980 align:middle line:84%
in schizophrenia and age related
memory loss and also for kids,

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.030 align:middle line:90%
is phenomenal.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:47.740 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you an example.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.270 align:middle line:90%
I work with a lot of kids.

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:51.220 align:middle line:84%
Recently, we just
finished a project

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:55.360 align:middle line:84%
with a school for children
with severe problems.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.970 align:middle line:84%
This was a young girl
who was autistic,

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:02.620 align:middle line:84%
and almost every other day she
would have a temper tantrum

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.840 align:middle line:90%
that was uncontrollable.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And consequently,
her mother hadn't

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:09.235 align:middle line:84%
been able to take
her out, I mean, like

00:12:09.235 --> 00:12:13.120 align:middle line:84%
even to the shopping
mall, for years.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:17.260 align:middle line:84%
Within three months of
giving her a better diet,

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:21.670 align:middle line:84%
multivitamins, essential fats
containing omega 3 fats--

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:24.040 align:middle line:90%
that's what's found in fish--

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.720 align:middle line:84%
this girl has got
to the point where

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:31.210 align:middle line:84%
she will have a burst of
anger maybe once a month.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:33.730 align:middle line:90%
It's much, much shorter.

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:35.870 align:middle line:90%
At the end, she says, I'm sorry.

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:37.300 align:middle line:90%
I love you mom.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.600 align:middle line:84%
So for the first time,
her mom took a risk

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.160 align:middle line:84%
and took her on a
package holiday.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.290 align:middle line:84%
They went to an
island in Greece.

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And in this hotel, she
got up and sang karaoke

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.650 align:middle line:84%
to the whole audience
in the hotel,

00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:53.930 align:middle line:84%
involved them,
bowed, and sat down.

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:56.900 align:middle line:84%
This girl could never
have done this before.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:00.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
profound changes.

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:03.800 align:middle line:84%
Recently, a health editor from
one of the national newspapers

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.090 align:middle line:90%
rang me up.

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:06.860 align:middle line:90%
She'd read my book.

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:09.710 align:middle line:84%
She'd read about
the amino acids that

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:14.210 align:middle line:84%
are necessary to help make
serotonin, the mood boosting

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.220 align:middle line:90%
nutrient in your brain.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:19.610 align:middle line:84%
She'd read about omega 3
fats and the importance

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:23.450 align:middle line:84%
of having a concentrated
fish oil capsule,

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:26.750 align:middle line:84%
and she'd also read about a
mineral called chromium, which

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:29.480 align:middle line:84%
for many people who
are both depressed

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:33.510 align:middle line:84%
and gaining weight and
feeling tired are incredible.

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:35.780 align:middle line:90%
So she followed the book.

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.900 align:middle line:84%
She took the pills
and improved her diet.

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.965 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, she rang me up and said,
I'm not ringing for a quote.

00:13:41.965 --> 00:13:43.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm not ringing
for an interview.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm ringing to say thank you.

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:47.420 align:middle line:84%
I've been depressed
for four months.

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:50.810 align:middle line:84%
I followed your advice,
and it took 45 minutes

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:53.330 align:middle line:90%
to come out of depression.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:59.330 align:middle line:84%
What you eat, B vitamins, omega
3, balancing your blood sugar,

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:02.360 align:middle line:84%
exercise, getting
enough sunlight,

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.940 align:middle line:84%
these are critical
factors that may

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:08.900 align:middle line:84%
make you unable to deal with
the unavoidable stressors

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:10.350 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:14.750 align:middle line:84%
So you might not think about
it, but when your mood is low,

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:19.580 align:middle line:84%
when you feel very anxious,
or your memory isn't great,

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.010 align:middle line:84%
or you're not
sleeping, it may simply

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:25.400 align:middle line:84%
be that you're not getting
the right nutrients that

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:31.000 align:middle line:84%
allow your brain to
function properly.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.633 align:middle line:84%
So maybe you've been diagnosed
with a health problem.

00:14:34.633 --> 00:14:36.050 align:middle line:84%
What are you going
to do about it?

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:39.570 align:middle line:84%
Are you're going to freak
out and go to your doctor

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:43.500 align:middle line:84%
and just follow
exactly what they say?

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:48.540 align:middle line:84%
Or are you going to really
take responsibility for this?

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And responsibility means
responding, understanding

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:59.310 align:middle line:84%
how it is that this happened
to your body, really learning.

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:02.430 align:middle line:84%
Because every disease is
an incredible opportunity

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:04.050 align:middle line:90%
to learn.

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:08.820 align:middle line:84%
And you will find a wealth
of information to guide you.

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:10.960 align:middle line:90%
There are tests that you can do.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And if your doctor runs tests,
make sure you get a copy.

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:15.590 align:middle line:90%
Study these tests.

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:19.380 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of practitioners
out there who can guide you.

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:21.510 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the
day, the only person

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:24.970 align:middle line:84%
who can help you,
really, truly is you.

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:26.940 align:middle line:90%
You are your best physician.

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:30.330 align:middle line:84%
So with the guidance of your
doctor, any information you

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:34.260 align:middle line:84%
can get, other practitioners,
the important point

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.690 align:middle line:84%
is that most diseases
are reversible.

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:42.330 align:middle line:84%
It does take a change, because
the definition of insanity

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:47.940 align:middle line:84%
is to keep doing the same things
and expect different results.

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:51.120 align:middle line:84%
In truth, genes
don't cause disease.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.950 align:middle line:84%
But in the most case when
we're talking about cancer,

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:56.970 align:middle line:84%
heart disease, diabetes,
and so on, what happens

00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:02.310 align:middle line:84%
is what you inherit is
instructions in your genes

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:05.190 align:middle line:84%
that enable you to make
things in your body

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:08.490 align:middle line:84%
like hormones,
enzymes, and so on.

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:12.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's possible that you
may inherit the tendency

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.020 align:middle line:84%
to diabetes, because
certain hormones that

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:21.360 align:middle line:84%
keep your blood sugar stable are
more likely to work less well.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.900 align:middle line:84%
But it's just literally
that, more likely.

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:30.660 align:middle line:84%
Because genes are dependent
upon the environment

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:32.760 align:middle line:90%
in which you've made the genes.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And that environment is
made by what you eat.

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:39.600 align:middle line:84%
So when you change
your diet, you actually

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.080 align:middle line:84%
change the expression
of your genes,

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:47.190 align:middle line:84%
which ones are turned on, and
which ones are turned off.

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:50.410 align:middle line:84%
So it's not really genes
that cause disease.

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:54.150 align:middle line:84%
They just give you a
greater predisposition.

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:58.020 align:middle line:84%
What causes disease
is the interaction

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:03.240 align:middle line:84%
between what you've inherited,
your genes, and how you live.

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:06.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, the bottom line
is, you can't change

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:08.160 align:middle line:90%
the genes you've inherited.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:13.020 align:middle line:84%
But you can change how
you live and what you eat.

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And when you change
those, even the diseases

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:21.240 align:middle line:84%
that we think of as largely
genetic can be reversed.

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:25.560 align:middle line:84%
So why not focus on changing
what you can rather than

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:29.130 align:middle line:84%
talking about changing
what you can't?

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:31.740 align:middle line:84%
You can get all the nutrients
you need from a well-balanced.

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Diet do you believe
this statement?

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:39.840 align:middle line:84%
It's the biggest lie
in nutrition today.

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:44.040 align:middle line:84%
It has this notion that if
you eat a Harvest Festival

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.850 align:middle line:84%
spread with your brown
bread and fruit and veg,

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:48.660 align:middle line:90%
you get everything you need.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:51.197 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, if I stop someone
in the high street and say,

00:17:51.197 --> 00:17:52.530 align:middle line:90%
do you eat a well-balanced diet?

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:54.030 align:middle line:90%
They'll say, well, yeah.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:56.380 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:59.183 align:middle line:84%
And then you ask, well, what
is a well-balanced diet?

00:17:59.183 --> 00:18:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And you're told,
well, it's a diet

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.490 align:middle line:90%
that gives you all you need.

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:05.160 align:middle line:90%
And you go round and round.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:09.210 align:middle line:84%
In fact, some supposed
experts will tell you

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:11.332 align:middle line:90%
that if you eat the RDA--

00:18:11.332 --> 00:18:13.290 align:middle line:84%
that's what you read on
the Cornflakes packet--

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:17.310 align:middle line:84%
it stands for the Ridiculous
Dietary Arbitraries--

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:19.170 align:middle line:90%
you get everything you need.

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:21.330 align:middle line:84%
That if you get
your 60 milligrams

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:23.820 align:middle line:90%
of vitamin C, no worries.

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:24.970 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:30.370 align:middle line:84%
Anything more than that,
they say, is expensive urine.

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:33.010 align:middle line:84%
But it's crazy, because
you and I are unique.

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:34.330 align:middle line:90%
We're different.

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:35.835 align:middle line:90%
We're physically different.

00:18:35.835 --> 00:18:37.920 align:middle line:90%
We're biochemically different.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And our need for nutrients
is definitely different.

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And expecting you and I to have
the same need for vitamin C

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:50.730 align:middle line:84%
is like expecting us
to need size 10 shoes.

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:53.400 align:middle line:90%
It just doesn't work like that.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And what's becoming very, very
clear in the field of nutrition

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.850 align:middle line:84%
is that if you are in
any disease process,

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:05.670 align:middle line:84%
or maybe your energy is low,
you may need extra nutrients.

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:08.920 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's very important
to eat good food.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.670 align:middle line:84%
That's the cornerstone
of nutrition.

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:15.730 align:middle line:84%
But you will find that there
are all sorts of vitamins,

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:19.470 align:middle line:84%
minerals, and essential
fats, the intake of which,

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:22.590 align:middle line:84%
through supplements, can
not only restore your health

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:24.940 align:middle line:84%
but make you feel
much, much better.

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:28.350 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to be
in average poor health,

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:31.310 align:middle line:84%
eat an average,
well balanced diet.

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:36.500 align:middle line:84%
But if what you want is to be
100% healthy, feeling great,

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.140 align:middle line:84%
and stay free from
disease, then what you need

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.850 align:middle line:90%
is optimum nutrition.

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And that means a little more
than a well-balanced diet.

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And personally, I'd
recommend that to that,

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:51.510 align:middle line:90%
you add some decent supplements.

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:54.710 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell you a story
of a man called Andy.

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:56.780 align:middle line:84%
I went on television
recently and I

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.400 align:middle line:84%
said, give me a man with
a high cholesterol level,

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.390 align:middle line:90%
and give me three weeks.

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:02.620 align:middle line:90%
And Andy rang up.

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:04.750 align:middle line:84%
His cholesterol had
been very, very high,

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:06.370 align:middle line:90%
and he'd been prescribed a drug.

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:07.820 align:middle line:90%
He took it for six months.

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:10.910 align:middle line:84%
It didn't really make any
difference to his cholesterol.

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:14.440 align:middle line:84%
He just had side
effects, so he stopped

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.480 align:middle line:90%
and rang the TV station.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.770 align:middle line:90%
And I met him.

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:19.720 align:middle line:90%
He was tired all the time.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.400 align:middle line:90%
He had five coffees a day.

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.870 align:middle line:84%
In the evening,
he couldn't relax.

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:27.610 align:middle line:84%
He didn't sleep so good, so he'd
have a beer, or maybe a wine.

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:29.260 align:middle line:90%
And he was gaining weight.

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And he wasn't doing
much exercise.

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:33.160 align:middle line:90%
He just didn't have the energy.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.620 align:middle line:84%
So I told him what to do and
how to eat a low glycemic load

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:37.420 align:middle line:90%
diet.

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:42.460 align:middle line:84%
I gave him some supplements,
omega 3, niacin, vitamin B3,

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:44.440 align:middle line:84%
which lowers cholesterol
incredibly well.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.290 align:middle line:90%


00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was that his
energy went through the roof.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.395 align:middle line:84%
When I met him
three weeks later,

00:20:50.395 --> 00:20:53.110 align:middle line:84%
his cholesterol had
completely normalized.

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:57.760 align:middle line:84%
He'd lost 11 pounds, about
five kilos in weight,

00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.560 align:middle line:90%
really without trying.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.215 align:middle line:90%
And I said, how's the coffee?

00:21:01.215 --> 00:21:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I haven't
been having any.

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:04.990 align:middle line:90%
My energy's been amazing.

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is really
a key by the way,

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:09.310 align:middle line:84%
is that most people say
they don't exercise,

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.440 align:middle line:84%
because they haven't
got enough energy.

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:14.020 align:middle line:84%
He said, I've started playing
football again, simply

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.930 align:middle line:84%
because I've got
the energy to do it.

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:19.060 align:middle line:90%
And I said, how's the sleeping?

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh, I'm
sleeping like a baby.

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:23.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm hardly drinking any
alcohol in the evening,

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:25.120 align:middle line:90%
just because I'm relaxed.

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:27.670 align:middle line:90%
And I said, how's the stress?

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:29.920 align:middle line:84%
Because he'd told me
he was very stressed.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And he ran a chain of
small supermarkets,

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:33.520 align:middle line:90%
and I'm always stressed.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:34.900 align:middle line:90%
He said, what stress?

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.060 align:middle line:90%
I don't have any stress.

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:41.410 align:middle line:84%
Simply by changing his diet,
no stress, more energy,

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:43.840 align:middle line:84%
energy to exercise,
which is very

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:50.290 align:middle line:84%
important, same job, same
mortgage, same wife, no stress.

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:54.550 align:middle line:84%
The point is, when you get what
you put into your body right,

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:55.870 align:middle line:90%
everything works better.

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:58.600 align:middle line:84%
You become more relaxed,
you have more energy,

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:03.460 align:middle line:84%
you have the desire to exercise,
and these foods are delicious,

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:05.170 align:middle line:84%
so you can have your
cake and eat it.

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:06.880 align:middle line:90%


00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:10.960 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people say to me,
but if you take vitamins,

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.820 align:middle line:84%
aren't you just making
expensive urine?

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:16.120 align:middle line:90%


00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:20.740 align:middle line:84%
By the way, water is the most
important nutrient in the body.

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And you know what happens
when you drink water?

00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:27.250 align:middle line:90%
Yep, you pee it out.

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:31.130 align:middle line:84%
So does that mean I
shouldn't drink water?

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:31.930 align:middle line:90%
The answer is no.

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:33.933 align:middle line:84%
Of course you need
to drink water.

00:22:33.933 --> 00:22:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And an important
point about water

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:37.480 align:middle line:84%
is what happens
between you drinking

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.740 align:middle line:90%
it and you excreting it.

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:41.570 align:middle line:84%
So if you take vitamin
C, for example,

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:43.480 align:middle line:84%
will you excrete
more in your urine?

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.250 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is, absolutely.

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:46.625 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you're
going to end up

00:22:46.625 --> 00:22:49.360 align:middle line:84%
completely full of vitamin
C. But the critical point

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.150 align:middle line:90%
is what it does in between.

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:54.280 align:middle line:84%
In the four or so
hours that vitamins

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:58.510 align:middle line:84%
stay in your bloodstream,
driving all the enzyme systems,

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:01.750 align:middle line:84%
keeping your immune system
strong, increasing your energy,

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:03.820 align:middle line:90%
improving your brain function.

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:07.030 align:middle line:84%
So supplements,
nutrients, they work.

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:09.460 align:middle line:84%
The question is finding
the optimal amount.

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And yes, we are designed to
excrete some in the urine.

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:18.910 align:middle line:84%
It's just the way
our bodies work.

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:22.120 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people are
daunted by the idea

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:25.460 align:middle line:84%
that you've got to
radically change your diet

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:31.570 align:middle line:84%
and never drink or eat meat
or take handfuls of pills,

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:33.320 align:middle line:90%
and this is all too crazy.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is,
that is not so.

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.020 align:middle line:84%
When you get your
nutrition right,

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:41.140 align:middle line:84%
you can feel a benefit
in 10 days, literally as

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:42.670 align:middle line:90%
short as that.

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot of very,
very simple steps you can take.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:49.210 align:middle line:84%
First of all, one of
the easiest is simply

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:54.130 align:middle line:84%
to find a decent high
strength multi vitamin.

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:56.830 align:middle line:90%
If you can, I would add a gram--

00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:59.260 align:middle line:84%
that's 1000 milligrams,
it's one pill, which

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:02.060 align:middle line:84%
is the equivalent of 22
supermarket oranges, actually,

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:07.960 align:middle line:84%
of vitamin C. And
possibly some omega 3 fat.

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.300 align:middle line:84%
Those three are really
the absolute basics,

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:15.460 align:middle line:84%
and most people will experience
a benefit within 10 days.

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:17.560 align:middle line:84%
What else can you
do that's very easy?

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:19.810 align:middle line:90%
Well, eat more fruit.

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:24.000 align:middle line:84%
So for example, when you go to
work, take an apple, or a pair,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.410 align:middle line:84%
or some berries, and
literally snack on fruit.

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:30.250 align:middle line:84%
See if you can't have two pieces
of fruit every single day.

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:35.140 align:middle line:84%
The other simple behavior that
is really brilliant is seeds.

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:37.360 align:middle line:84%
Take something like
a pumpkin seed.

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.240 align:middle line:90%
Very high in omega 3 and 6 fat.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.120 align:middle line:84%
You can sprinkle a few on
your cereal, or once again

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.280 align:middle line:90%
snack on them through the day.

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:50.015 align:middle line:84%
These aren't so difficult.
Have more fish, less meat.

00:24:50.015 --> 00:24:53.030 align:middle line:90%
A very simple change.

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:54.580 align:middle line:90%
Try to drink more water.

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:58.870 align:middle line:84%
Aim for at least six
glasses of water a day.

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:01.510 align:middle line:90%
So Rome wasn't built in a day.

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:05.350 align:middle line:84%
But with a few very simple diet
changes and some very simple

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:10.120 align:middle line:84%
supplements, you will
start to notice an effect.

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:14.110 align:middle line:84%
Within 10 days, usually
your energy improves.

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:17.170 align:middle line:84%
After a couple of weeks, you'll
notice your mood is more stable

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:18.980 align:middle line:90%
and your mind is clearer.

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:23.830 align:middle line:84%
In about 20 days, your
skin starts to look better.

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And for long term
health problems,

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:29.080 align:middle line:84%
it usually takes a little
longer to see a result.

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:32.500 align:middle line:84%
So you'll get the benefits
very quickly simply

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:36.660 align:middle line:90%
by making simple changes.

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:41.010 align:middle line:84%
Is food better
medicine than drugs?

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:43.110 align:middle line:90%
What is good medicine?

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:45.990 align:middle line:84%
Good medicine is something
that's effective.

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:48.540 align:middle line:84%
It actually does not only
deal with the symptoms

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:51.540 align:middle line:90%
but treat the underlying cause.

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:56.400 align:middle line:84%
That is safe, and that
is doable or affordable.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:00.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've spent the last 30
years looking at the most

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:05.610 align:middle line:84%
common degenerative diseases,
from arthritis to asthma,

00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:08.460 align:middle line:90%
depression, to diabetes.

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And in most cases, when
we've really looked up close,

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:17.820 align:middle line:84%
we find that a simple strategy
of the right kind of diet,

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:22.890 align:middle line:84%
simple changes to lifestyle,
and also in most cases

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:26.310 align:middle line:84%
specific supplements
can not only

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:30.750 align:middle line:84%
relieve the pain, so to
speak, as well as drugs,

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:38.070 align:middle line:84%
but actually helps to deal
with the underlying causes.

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:41.970 align:middle line:84%
The best money making
drugs are always

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:46.330 align:middle line:84%
the drugs that cure the
disease, that is the symptoms,

00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:49.270 align:middle line:90%
but not the underlying disease.

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:53.160 align:middle line:84%
So when you stop the drug,
you instantly feel worse,

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:57.090 align:middle line:84%
and that makes you want
to keep taking them.

00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And also, a drug that is
patentable, in other words man

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:05.250 align:middle line:84%
made, so you can get
a monopoly on it,

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:08.430 align:middle line:84%
and hence you can
make your profit.

00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:11.190 align:middle line:84%
We found for most
of the diseases

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:14.370 align:middle line:84%
that you're likely to suffer
from you can get better

00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:20.220 align:middle line:84%
results, often faster, certainly
safer, and usually cheaper

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:25.380 align:middle line:84%
simply by getting the right
nutritional strategy together.

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:28.050 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't
want to take drugs

00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:29.890 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of their life.

00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
want to, then here's

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:37.860 align:middle line:84%
your opportunity to find out
what that right nutrition

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:41.790 align:middle line:84%
program is to not
only prevent diseases,

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:44.860 align:middle line:90%
but also to reverse them.

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:47.920 align:middle line:84%
Today if you go to your
doctor and you're sick,

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:53.290 align:middle line:84%
the chances are you are going
to walk out with a prescription.

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Depending on which
country you live in,

00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:00.280 align:middle line:84%
you might be surprised
to find that that

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:04.120 align:middle line:84%
is more likely to kill you
than a road traffic accident.

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:07.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, literally a
prescription from your doctor.

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:09.700 align:middle line:84%
In the British
Medical Journal, they

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:13.870 align:middle line:84%
calculated that more than
10,000 people in Britain

00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:18.450 align:middle line:84%
die every single year from an
adverse reaction to a drug,

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:21.870 align:middle line:84%
and that is excluding drugs
taken in overdose, i.e.

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:26.410 align:middle line:84%
Given and the wrong amount
or taken in the wrong amount.

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:29.045 align:middle line:84%
In America, the
figure, according

00:28:29.045 --> 00:28:30.670 align:middle line:84%
to one of the leading
medical journals,

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:34.300 align:middle line:90%
was over 100,000 deaths.

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And the amazing thing is
that this is many, many times

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:45.670 align:middle line:84%
greater than your risk of dying
from a road traffic accident.

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:48.220 align:middle line:84%
So why aren't we
processing this?

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:52.450 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we have
citizens, consumer groups,

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:55.750 align:middle line:84%
why don't we have government
agencies really focusing

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:56.770 align:middle line:90%
on this issue?

00:28:56.770 --> 00:29:00.980 align:middle line:84%
We just seem to
take it for granted.

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:07.120 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we've just been
stuck in a whole marketing

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:10.780 align:middle line:84%
model, where the
public are kept away

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:15.370 align:middle line:84%
from the true information about
disease and their treatments.

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:18.430 align:middle line:90%
And so, too, are doctors.

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:21.790 align:middle line:84%
60% in America of
postgraduate education

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:25.840 align:middle line:84%
is paid for by the
pharmaceutical industry.

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:30.690 align:middle line:84%
Drug reps knock on the door of
doctors literally every week.

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:33.220 align:middle line:84%
A massive amount
of money is spent

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:37.420 align:middle line:84%
to keep doctors
prescribing drugs.

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And doctors are exposed
to a tiny amount

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:45.910 align:middle line:84%
of hours on important
subjects like nutrition.

00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:50.740 align:middle line:84%
In Britain, 0.05 of a
percent of all the money that

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:53.890 align:middle line:84%
is spent researching
medicine is spent

00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:56.980 align:middle line:90%
on complementary approaches.

00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:02.830 align:middle line:84%
So if the doctors don't know
about it, how on earth can we?

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:05.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, the truth is
nowadays, you can,

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.750 align:middle line:84%
but you have to
make that choice.

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:11.620 align:middle line:84%
You have to make that
choice to become informed.

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And you can do it very easily
these days from the web,

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:19.630 align:middle line:84%
from books, and from
resources like this.

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:23.140 align:middle line:84%
But it really is up to
you, because your doctor

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:28.900 align:middle line:84%
is likely to be as ill
informed about the real ways

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:32.230 align:middle line:84%
to reverse disease
processes, simply

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:34.540 align:middle line:84%
because there isn't
the money in it.

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:38.530 align:middle line:84%
You see, the point is that
nature has already patented

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:43.640 align:middle line:84%
or invented nutrients, vitamins,
minerals essential fats.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:47.780 align:middle line:90%
So you can't get a patent.

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And the way it works
under international law

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:53.860 align:middle line:84%
is something is either a
food, or it's a medicine.

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:56.240 align:middle line:90%
It can't be both.

00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And if a food claims to
prevent or treat a disease,

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:03.830 align:middle line:84%
it then is classified
as a medicine.

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And medicines can't be
sold without a license,

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:10.640 align:middle line:84%
and the license
costs a lot of money.

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:13.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's simply not
worth getting a license

00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:16.310 align:middle line:84%
unless you've got
patented, that is,

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:22.140 align:middle line:84%
a man made product
that only you can sell.

00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And for that simple reason, we
are now stuck firmly in an era

00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:33.440 align:middle line:84%
where we are told that the only
way out of diseases is drugs.

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:36.500 align:middle line:84%
But after all, is
arthritis caused

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:39.230 align:middle line:90%
by a deficiency of painkillers?

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:42.960 align:middle line:84%
Is high cholesterol caused
by a deficiency of statins?

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:45.800 align:middle line:84%
Is diabetes caused by
a deficiency of drugs?

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:49.610 align:middle line:84%
Is depression caused by a
deficiency of antidepressants?

00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:51.680 align:middle line:90%
The answer is, of course not.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:56.870 align:middle line:84%
So if you really want to
find your way out of disease

00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:59.060 align:middle line:84%
and be in the best
possible health,

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:02.360 align:middle line:84%
you've got to go back
to the true causes.

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And the true causes are
nutrition, stress, exercise,

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:07.790 align:middle line:90%
pollution.

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:09.650 align:middle line:84%
Those are the places
where you need

00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:12.590 align:middle line:84%
to look to find a
way of living that

00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:13.850 align:middle line:90%
truly makes you feel great.

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:15.410 align:middle line:90%


00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:18.800 align:middle line:84%
We don't really have a
National Health Service.

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.470 align:middle line:84%
We have a National
Disease Service

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:25.610 align:middle line:84%
that's really focused on
trying to keep people alive

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:27.980 align:middle line:84%
once they've developed
a serious diseases.

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:31.790 align:middle line:84%
It's like shutting the door
once the horse has bolted.

00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And the future of
medicine really

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:36.260 align:middle line:84%
needs to focus a
lot more on finding

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:39.510 align:middle line:84%
out early on when something's
gone out of balance.

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:40.193 align:middle line:90%


00:32:40.193 --> 00:32:42.360 align:middle line:84%
Really, we could say there
are two kinds of illness.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:45.200 align:middle line:84%
There's vertically ill, and
that's how most of us are.

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:47.690 align:middle line:84%
We're upright, but
we don't feel great.

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:50.880 align:middle line:84%
And then when you keel over,
you're horizontally ill.

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:55.820 align:middle line:84%
So the question is how to get
you to a state of super health.

00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays, you can
see practitioners,

00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:02.030 align:middle line:84%
nutritional therapists, who can
run tests that are not there

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:04.070 align:middle line:84%
to find out whether
you've got this disease

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:07.910 align:middle line:84%
or that but actually to find
out how your system is working.

00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:10.760 align:middle line:90%
Is your system out of balance?

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:15.200 align:middle line:84%
For example, homocysteine,
a very, very simple pinprick

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.660 align:middle line:84%
blood test, and
it will determine

00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:21.700 align:middle line:84%
exactly what you need in the
way of certain B vitamins.

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:24.140 align:middle line:84%
Or there are very good
food allergy tests, again,

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:28.640 align:middle line:84%
on a simple pinprick test
that can find out exactly

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:33.050 align:middle line:84%
which foods your body loves and
which foods your body hates.

00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:35.840 align:middle line:84%
So by using the
right kind of tests

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:38.000 align:middle line:84%
as well as
questionnaires, you can

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.130 align:middle line:84%
find out how you are now
on a scale of 100% health

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:44.600 align:middle line:90%
and do something about it.

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:47.660 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit like
getting your car tuned up.

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:51.920 align:middle line:84%
So the real message is, don't
wait until it's too late.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.850 align:middle line:90%
Get some advice.

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:54.890 align:middle line:90%
Read around.

00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:57.650 align:middle line:84%
Find a practitioner
who can guide you

00:33:57.650 --> 00:34:01.160 align:middle line:84%
and find what is your
perfect, optimum nutrition.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:03.710 align:middle line:84%
That's the future
of medicine, doctors

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:07.520 align:middle line:84%
working with nutritionists
and really good education.

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:09.620 align:middle line:84%
We learn maths,
we learn English,

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:11.840 align:middle line:84%
we learn all sorts
of things at school,

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:15.320 align:middle line:84%
but we never actually
learn how this body works

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:18.469 align:middle line:84%
and what you need to be in
the best possible health.

00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:21.650 align:middle line:84%
The true cause of
illness is ignorance.

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And the true way to
health is to get informed.

00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:31.940 align:middle line:90%
Become your own practitioner.

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:35.630 align:middle line:84%
The Dalai Lama once said
something that I really like.

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:39.080 align:middle line:84%
He said, every human being
has the desire to be happy

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:41.780 align:middle line:84%
and the desire to
be free of pain.

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And that he tries to
remember that his desire

00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:47.210 align:middle line:84%
to be happy and free of pain
is of no greater or lesser

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:51.380 align:middle line:90%
importance than yours.

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:55.100 align:middle line:84%
So really, what I have
learned is that there

00:34:55.100 --> 00:35:01.190 align:middle line:84%
is available to all of us an
amazing state where energy

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:04.790 align:middle line:84%
is great, and where your mind is
clear, where your mood is good,

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:11.120 align:middle line:84%
where you feel connected,
you really feel full of life,

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:15.770 align:middle line:84%
and I meet so few people
who have that experience.

00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:18.470 align:middle line:84%
So my work in the
field of nutrition

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:24.950 align:middle line:84%
is not only to help people like
you recover happiness, recover

00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:28.460 align:middle line:84%
health, and become
free of pain but also

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:34.910 align:middle line:84%
to discover that there is a
whole level of energy that

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:38.600 align:middle line:84%
is available to you
right now, and all

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:42.170 align:middle line:84%
you have to do is make
very simple changes,

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:45.650 align:middle line:84%
get your nutrition right,
get your lifestyle right,

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:48.740 align:middle line:84%
and all of that will
be available to you.

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:54.520 align:middle line:84%
All of my work is about helping
people to have that experience.

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And believe me, once you've had
that, your old habits will just

00:35:58.330 --> 00:35:59.130 align:middle line:90%
fall away.

00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:02.350 align:middle line:90%


00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:06.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm often asked, what
is the real problem?

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:09.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how have we
got into the place

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:13.270 align:middle line:84%
that we're at with all these
diseases in the 21st century

00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:17.650 align:middle line:84%
and stress and tired
and depressed and so on?

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:22.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's really
a lack of connection.

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:27.580 align:middle line:84%
In some communities where
they grow their own food

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:31.000 align:middle line:84%
and are more socially connected,
people are much happier.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.210 align:middle line:84%
These are sometimes
poorer communities.

00:36:34.210 --> 00:36:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And yet, there's some
kind of connection.

00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think we've
lost that connection

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:44.980 align:middle line:84%
with this striving towards
our high technology existence.

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:48.050 align:middle line:84%
With texting and emails
and computers and so on,

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:54.220 align:middle line:84%
somehow we lose that ability to
just connect with someone else.

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And also to really
connect with ourselves,

00:36:56.890 --> 00:37:01.060 align:middle line:84%
to be comfortable
in being yourself.

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:03.550 align:middle line:90%
And also to connect with food.

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:06.310 align:middle line:84%
You can eat now without
really ever knowing

00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:08.860 align:middle line:84%
that the food comes
from the ground.

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:10.990 align:middle line:84%
So when we work with
kids in schools,

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:14.980 align:middle line:84%
we always make sure that they
grow some of their own food

00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:17.320 align:middle line:84%
and see it from a
seed to the food,

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:21.340 align:middle line:84%
because when you make a salad
or you make dinner out of food

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:24.730 align:middle line:84%
that you've grown
yourself in the earth,

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:27.040 align:middle line:84%
it's a whole
different experience.

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:31.270 align:middle line:84%
Our body is literally
made from the elements.

00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And in due course, we will
go back to the elements.

00:37:35.350 --> 00:37:38.560 align:middle line:84%
So nutrition isn't just
this kind of dry thing

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.490 align:middle line:84%
that you have to
do to be healthy.

00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:42.760 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely fundamental.

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.550 align:middle line:84%
You are literally made
from what you eat.

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:47.455 align:middle line:84%
And if you can get
involved in your nutrition

00:37:47.455 --> 00:37:51.610 align:middle line:84%
and enjoy what you buy
and enjoy preparing food

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:54.730 align:middle line:84%
and enjoy eating it,
then you can start

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:56.830 align:middle line:90%
to regain that connection.

00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And life, I think,
really is about.

00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:01.180 align:middle line:84%
If you want to have
a fulfilling life,

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:03.070 align:middle line:84%
you need fulfilling
relationships

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:07.240 align:middle line:84%
with others, with yourself,
and with your food

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.600 align:middle line:90%
and your environment.

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:14.000 align:middle line:90%
