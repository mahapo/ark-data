00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.800 align:middle line:90%


00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.730 align:middle line:90%
>> I had depression.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.332 align:middle line:84%
And the depression
led me to drinking.

00:00:06.332 --> 00:00:07.540 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't being a good father.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.797 align:middle line:90%
My dog was scared of me.

00:00:08.797 --> 00:00:09.880 align:middle line:90%
My kids were scared of me.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.610 align:middle line:10%
And now, things
are just changed.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.040 align:middle line:10%
It's like from darkness
to light, basically.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.694 align:middle line:90%
The San Pedro saved me.

00:00:17.694 --> 00:00:25.438 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.438 --> 00:00:29.310 align:middle line:84%
So this is like a bit
of a secret location.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.300 align:middle line:90%
This is the place.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>> We shouldn't be filming
too many details here, huh?

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.760 align:middle line:90%
We're off in Alacante.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.395 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go
find some San Pedro.

00:00:38.395 --> 00:00:39.317 align:middle line:90%
>> Don't you see it?

00:00:39.317 --> 00:00:40.125 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh shit.

00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:41.005 align:middle line:90%
>> And there.

00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:42.604 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:00:42.604 --> 00:00:43.490 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>> That's quite a bit, eh?

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.590 align:middle line:90%


00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:48.600 align:middle line:90%
It's a bit of a jungle.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.085 align:middle line:90%
But, I mean, look at these.

00:00:50.085 --> 00:00:52.350 align:middle line:84%
These are, like,
beautiful specimens.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.190 align:middle line:84%
Look how thick and
juicy these are.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.860 align:middle line:90%
It's like being a beekeeper.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.660 align:middle line:84%
Getting stung is
part and parcel.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.230 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a rite of
passage, right?

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Echinopsis peruviana
cactus, more commonly referred

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.590 align:middle line:84%
to as San Pedro, is known for
the psychedelic and healing

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.120 align:middle line:90%
properties of mescaline.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.800 align:middle line:84%
The use of these
cacti in ceremonies

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.840 align:middle line:84%
in South and Central
North America

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.680 align:middle line:84%
can be tracked back
nearly 6,000 years.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.550 align:middle line:84%
Sanson has taken a
more casual approach,

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.100 align:middle line:84%
preparing it for his friends
to go on a sacred nature walk.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there must
be about 20 kilos there.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:20.797 align:middle line:90%
>> It's so much.

00:01:20.797 --> 00:01:21.630 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a whole bag.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.466 align:middle line:84%
That'll be enough 12
people, let's say.

00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, after it's been
boiled for two or three hours,

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.130 align:middle line:90%
the skin just comes off perfect.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.830 align:middle line:90%
Almost perfect.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you want
to strain it off.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Gorgeous.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.310 align:middle line:90%
>> And there we have it.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.190 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.560 align:middle line:90%
>> That's our finished product.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.750 align:middle line:90%
>> It's mescaline soup.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Basically.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.390 align:middle line:90%
>> It doesn't smell bad at all.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.870 align:middle line:84%
It smells kind of
good, actually.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.000 align:middle line:90%
>> How it goes.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.285 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't think that
would taste good, though.

00:01:49.285 --> 00:01:54.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, I'd really been
on sort of a downhill spiral.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.045 align:middle line:84%
Alcohol and depression were the
root causes of the unhappiness,

00:01:58.045 --> 00:01:58.870 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.170 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't really have
anything to be unhappy about.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.040 align:middle line:84%
When I took the cactus
for the first time,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.510 align:middle line:84%
it sort of gave me an
opportunity to look at my life

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.410 align:middle line:90%
from a distance.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.840 align:middle line:84%
It was that divine moment
where I just found, like,

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.840 align:middle line:90%
the essence of living.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.010 align:middle line:84%
But now I'm introducing
it to people

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.170 align:middle line:84%
that could be in a similar
situation that I was,

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.362 align:middle line:84%
then help them to be able
to use the cactus, too.

00:02:21.362 --> 00:02:22.326 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:02:22.326 --> 00:02:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>> When I have about
5 cups of this brew,

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.180 align:middle line:84%
I get into the space
for I want to be.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm completely in the
present, yes, and San Pedro

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.860 align:middle line:84%
bringing out my voice,
bringing out my creativity.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.400 align:middle line:84%
That's where I find
my healing space.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.050 align:middle line:84%
>> As is often the case, the
first time I work with new

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.530 align:middle line:84%
psychedelics, my
experience was light.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.390 align:middle line:84%
I mainly felt tingly, a
strong connection to nature,

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.575 align:middle line:90%
and just a little bit goofy.

00:02:44.575 --> 00:02:46.315 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:02:46.315 --> 00:02:48.160 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm feeling the San Pedro.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.240 align:middle line:90%
It's really subtle.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.230 align:middle line:90%
I took a small dose.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.150 align:middle line:90%
I want a banana.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.520 align:middle line:84%
>> But for some of the
other participants,

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.715 align:middle line:84%
their experiences allow
for great healing.

00:02:58.715 --> 00:03:00.670 align:middle line:84%
>> The guy that
feels really trapped,

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.240 align:middle line:84%
and he's got a real bad
smoking addiction, he said,

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.060 align:middle line:84%
well it's not just
about the smoking.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.200 align:middle line:90%
It's about everything.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.040 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I'm not right
in the head, he said to me.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, well, let's
do a therapy, me and you.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.520 align:middle line:84%
Going to have to have
a pretty heavy dose,

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.285 align:middle line:84%
and then he's going to probably
need support, keep talking him

00:03:16.285 --> 00:03:17.085 align:middle line:90%
through it.

00:03:17.085 --> 00:03:20.660 align:middle line:84%
>> It's just an intense therapy
when you get down to it, right?

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't claim to be some
sort of modern-day shaman.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can introduce
you to a plant.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And the plant does the
work, and you do the work.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean you're your
best therapist.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.470 align:middle line:84%
Taking the plant is like
opening the box to yourself.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Despite Schedule I status,
toxicity of mescaline is,

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.500 align:middle line:84%
low health risks are few,
and the many reputed benefits

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.390 align:middle line:90%
of San Pedro are vast.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.100 align:middle line:84%
When done mindfully,
who can argue

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.320 align:middle line:84%
with more connection to
our creativity, connection

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.200 align:middle line:84%
to nature, healing ourselves,
and curing addictions?

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.730 align:middle line:84%
For more information,
get involved

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.290 align:middle line:84%
in your local
psychedelic society

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.600 align:middle line:84%
and help change
current legislation.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.400 align:middle line:90%
