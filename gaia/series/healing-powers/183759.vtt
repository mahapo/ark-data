00:00:01.872 --> 00:00:04.530 align:middle line:10%
>> It's not often that one
thinks of cannabis as a thing

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.700 align:middle line:10%
that will fix a
majorly flawed system.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.580 align:middle line:84%
But Weed for Warriors,
an organization

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.230 align:middle line:84%
advocating for the
use of marijuana

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.210 align:middle line:84%
to address veteran
issues, is showing us

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.240 align:middle line:90%
just how that's possible.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.200 align:middle line:90%
It smells totally crazy in here.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.300 align:middle line:90%
It's so strong.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to the LA chapter of
the Weed for Warriors Project.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.580 align:middle line:84%
We're here to create a
community that helps each other

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.210 align:middle line:84%
and to ensure that cannabis is
accessible to those of us who

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.010 align:middle line:90%
want it.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.090 align:middle line:10%
>> The things we were told would
harm us are actually proving

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.010 align:middle line:10%
to do the opposite.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.000 align:middle line:84%
Drugs like MDMA, mushrooms,
marijuana, LSD, and ayahuasca

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.150 align:middle line:84%
are helping resolve
serious mental issues.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.250 align:middle line:84%
Join us as we explore
for ourselves the healing

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.190 align:middle line:84%
powers of weed, psychedelics,
and other mindful practices.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.618 align:middle line:90%


00:00:50.618 --> 00:00:53.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Weed for Warriors
Project is a veteran group,

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.280 align:middle line:10%
really just helping them
learn about cannabis.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.890 align:middle line:10%
That it's not just
some recreational drug.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.300 align:middle line:10%
This is actually
something that's

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.570 align:middle line:10%
medically helping people and
really opening up veterans

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.044 align:middle line:10%
to receive help.

00:01:05.044 --> 00:01:07.830 align:middle line:10%
>> A very good friend of mine
in Headquarters Platoon Fifth

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.750 align:middle line:10%
Battalion, Seventh Infantry
was ambushed in a vehicle,

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.430 align:middle line:10%
shot 24 times.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.490 align:middle line:84%
A child was shot-- a lot of
issues, survivor's guilt.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.280 align:middle line:84%
From there, I went
on, and basically

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.850 align:middle line:84%
medicating with pharmaceuticals
that turned me into someone

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.000 align:middle line:90%
I didn't recognize.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>> These guys go to war for a
country and come back with all

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:27.830 align:middle line:90%
these issues.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.960 align:middle line:84%
They're prescribed a
cocktail of pharmaceuticals

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.750 align:middle line:84%
that come with terrible side
effects that don't adequately

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.025 align:middle line:90%
address their problems.

00:01:34.025 --> 00:01:37.130 align:middle line:10%
>> I was on a total of, like,
22 different medications

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.568 align:middle line:10%
because of my PTSD and
depression and borderline

00:01:39.568 --> 00:01:41.360 align:middle line:10%
personality, and all
of these other things.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Pain management,
they're taking opiates.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.010 align:middle line:84%
So you have the addiction
issues, the overdose issues,

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.080 align:middle line:84%
the mood stabilizers,
like lithium,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.430 align:middle line:90%
that make these guys zombies.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.672 align:middle line:84%
>> Up to 22 veterans are
committing suicide daily

00:01:52.672 --> 00:01:54.380 align:middle line:84%
because these treatments
are not working.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.630 align:middle line:10%
>> Shortly after getting
back from my third deployment

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.330 align:middle line:10%
to Afghanistan, I went from
not being on any pills at all

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.827 align:middle line:10%
to being on a combination that
added up to 18 pills a day.

00:02:03.827 --> 00:02:05.660 align:middle line:84%
That was-- it was not--
it was a way to die.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:06.648 align:middle line:90%
100%.

00:02:06.648 --> 00:02:10.600 align:middle line:90%


00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.050 align:middle line:10%
>> He was in a tent.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.290 align:middle line:90%
He was a veteran.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.095 align:middle line:90%
He asked the VA for help.

00:02:16.095 --> 00:02:19.800 align:middle line:84%
The first thing the VA's going
to do-- here's your Percocet,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.590 align:middle line:90%
here's your Percodan.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.250 align:middle line:90%
He had become addicted to that.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.800 align:middle line:84%
He died right there
in that-- in a tent.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.270 align:middle line:90%
Shot himself.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.674 align:middle line:90%
We paid for that mural for him.

00:02:29.674 --> 00:02:33.130 align:middle line:84%
In Lebanon, in '83,
being blown out

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.680 align:middle line:84%
of the third floor
in a marine barracks.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.570 align:middle line:84%
241 Marines died
in that instant.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:46.525 align:middle line:84%
Mentally, it affects you where
it haunts you in your dreams.

00:02:46.525 --> 00:02:50.750 align:middle line:84%
>> There's times that I can open
my front door, and I see Iraq.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.550 align:middle line:90%
I feel it.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.675 align:middle line:84%
The idea of getting in a
vehicle and driving around

00:02:53.675 --> 00:02:55.160 align:middle line:84%
with the possibility
of blowing up

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.680 align:middle line:84%
is not something
I'm willing to do.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.620 align:middle line:90%
And I will completely shut down.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And if it's a school
day or it's a work day

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.830 align:middle line:84%
or if it's an anything,
I will shut down.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:03.430 align:middle line:90%
I'll call in.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.472 align:middle line:90%
I won't be able to do it.

00:03:04.472 --> 00:03:06.585 align:middle line:84%
A friend of my father's
gave me a joint.

00:03:06.585 --> 00:03:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you
should try this.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.070 align:middle line:90%
And I was really hesitant.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.590 align:middle line:84%
But they were afraid that I
was either going to end my life

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.430 align:middle line:84%
or end up just wandering
off dead somewhere.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.080 align:middle line:90%
Cannabis takes that away.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.603 align:middle line:84%
Cannabis gives me
the ability to live.

00:03:20.603 --> 00:03:23.010 align:middle line:84%
>> It blows my mind
that this is not legal.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.810 align:middle line:90%
It's so insane.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.185 align:middle line:84%
>> People are making a lot of
money off that prohibition.

00:03:26.185 --> 00:03:28.680 align:middle line:84%
I think it exposes the moral
corruption of our government.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.690 align:middle line:90%
It's for-profit.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.850 align:middle line:84%
The sad truth is we're
killing more people

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.640 align:middle line:84%
with the War on Drugs than the
drugs are killing themselves.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And yet, because it's
illegal on a federal level,

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.430 align:middle line:84%
there is no clear and easy
access to medical marijuana

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.720 align:middle line:90%
for veterans.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.580 align:middle line:84%
This is where Weed
for Warriors comes in.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.120 align:middle line:84%
These are the guys that
drove buses across the nation

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.870 align:middle line:84%
and threw their
pharmaceutical medications

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.912 align:middle line:84%
on the steps of the White
House, and then lit up.

00:03:49.912 --> 00:03:52.340 align:middle line:84%
>> We arrived in Washington
DC on November 11,

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.810 align:middle line:90%
to be there on Veterans Day.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.140 align:middle line:84%
We marched from Benjamin
Franklin Park past the VA.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.760 align:middle line:84%
We dumped out empty
pill bottles that

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.938 align:middle line:84%
were collected on our journey to
highlight the suicide epidemic

00:04:01.938 --> 00:04:03.605 align:middle line:84%
and the over-medication
of our veterans.

00:04:03.605 --> 00:04:06.764 align:middle line:90%


00:04:06.764 --> 00:04:08.181 align:middle line:84%
>> You're just
pushed to the side.

00:04:08.181 --> 00:04:10.556 align:middle line:84%
You're fed a bunch of pills
and said, hey, you know what?

00:04:10.556 --> 00:04:12.330 align:middle line:84%
This is the life
you're going to live.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And when your body, your
mind, starts rejecting it,

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:16.709 align:middle line:90%
what do you do?

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.334 align:middle line:84%
Like, you have to
find a different way.

00:04:18.334 --> 00:04:20.048 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, you do end up dead.

00:04:20.048 --> 00:04:21.510 align:middle line:10%
>> What are we doing?

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.950 align:middle line:10%
Like, are you going to survive?

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.500 align:middle line:10%
We have three children together.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And are you going to
make it long enough

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.250 align:middle line:90%
to even see them grow?

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.330 align:middle line:90%
He's my husband.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.770 align:middle line:90%
He's the father my children.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.060 align:middle line:84%
He needs to get out there
and be asking for help.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.950 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter what.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.020 align:middle line:90%
And we found Weed for Warriors.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.160 align:middle line:90%
He would go to a meeting.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.883 align:middle line:84%
And the two hours
he was there, he

00:04:39.883 --> 00:04:41.800 align:middle line:84%
would come home a
completely different person.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.030 align:middle line:84%
I just got to talk to guys, that
are in the same position as me,

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.820 align:middle line:84%
that use cannabis
to help themselves.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.040 align:middle line:90%
And that was enough--

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.540 align:middle line:84%
enough for that week that
he didn't kill himself.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.390 align:middle line:10%
>> He smokes, and then
he feels much better.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and I like going
to the beach or the pool.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>> And without the medicine?

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you really want to
know what happened without

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:06.834 align:middle line:90%
the medicine?

00:05:06.834 --> 00:05:10.570 align:middle line:90%


00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Cannabis hasn't done
anything except help me.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.070 align:middle line:10%
I took one or two hits.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.990 align:middle line:90%
Just, I wanted a microdose.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.580 align:middle line:90%
And it was like--

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.100 align:middle line:84%
anybody in the military
would understand this term.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.450 align:middle line:90%
I felt like I dropped my pack.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.160 align:middle line:90%
My pack was lifted.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.720 align:middle line:90%
And I was just--

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.260 align:middle line:90%
all the stress was relieved.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.630 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, cannabis allows me
to acknowledge what it is that

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.220 align:middle line:10%
I'm feeling and accept it.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.810 align:middle line:84%
>> It's helped me to reach those
feelings that I used to have

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.970 align:middle line:90%
that--

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.150 align:middle line:84%
they weren't useful for me
when I was in the service.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And now, I want compassion
and love back in my life.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.860 align:middle line:90%
>> It's going to help you.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:51.900 align:middle line:90%
It's going to heal you.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.250 align:middle line:84%
If you don't want to have
anything to do with it, don't.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.750 align:middle line:90%
But stop telling me I'm wrong.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.170 align:middle line:90%
I want my life.

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:03.720 align:middle line:90%
It helps me live.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.720 align:middle line:84%
I want the liberty to
choose my medicine.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.273 align:middle line:84%
And the pursuit of happiness
for my family depends on it.

00:06:09.273 --> 00:06:11.190 align:middle line:84%
>> I still have a lot
of physical limitations.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.637 align:middle line:84%
Cannabis allows me to
get past them and be.

00:06:15.637 --> 00:06:17.220 align:middle line:84%
You know, hold my
kids on my shoulders

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.750 align:middle line:90%
and walk around, and do--

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:19.590 align:middle line:90%
be a dad.

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.692 align:middle line:84%
It definitely would not
be there without it.

00:06:21.692 --> 00:06:24.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Times are a-changin', and
the old systems aren't working

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.030 align:middle line:90%
anymore.
