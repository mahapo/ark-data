00:00:27.988 --> 00:00:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>> We're here at the Parliament
of the World Religions,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.680 align:middle line:84%
a very unique and unusual
conference that first started

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.160 align:middle line:84%
in 1893, where religious
leaders and representatives from

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.130 align:middle line:84%
different faiths come together
to get on the same page

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.260 align:middle line:84%
and actually solve
the world's problems.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.660 align:middle line:10%
The things we were told
would harm us are actually

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.920 align:middle line:10%
proving to do the opposite.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.910 align:middle line:84%
Drugs like MDMA, mushrooms,
marijuana, LSD, and ayahuasca

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.090 align:middle line:84%
are helping resolve
serious mental issues.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.160 align:middle line:84%
Join us as we explore
for ourselves the healing

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.680 align:middle line:84%
powers of psychedelics and
other mindful practices.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:06.090 align:middle line:90%


00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.880 align:middle line:10%
Here at the conference, you
have all kinds of religions.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.855 align:middle line:10%
There's Islam, Hindu,
Christianity, the big ones,

00:01:11.855 --> 00:01:13.980 align:middle line:10%
and then also ones that
I've never heard of before.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:21.140 align:middle line:90%


00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.160 align:middle line:84%
This year is of particular
note, because for the first time

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.950 align:middle line:84%
ever, the spiritual
practices of ayahuasca

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.990 align:middle line:84%
and their many stewards,
indigenous people

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.140 align:middle line:84%
from the Amazon, ICEERS,
and the Santo Daime,

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.420 align:middle line:84%
have been invited to share
their work with this plant

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.230 align:middle line:90%
on a global stage.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.700 align:middle line:90%


00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.800 align:middle line:84%
Ayahuasca is
actually two plants.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.920 align:middle line:84%
A complex brew originating
in the Amazon jungle.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.780 align:middle line:10%
And its rapid rise
in popularity is

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.660 align:middle line:10%
credited to how effective it
is in helping people overcome

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.870 align:middle line:10%
serious mental issues like
addiction, depression, PTSD,

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:52.770 align:middle line:10%
and trauma.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.870 align:middle line:84%
For the indigenous
people, it is a practice

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.210 align:middle line:84%
held for hundreds if
not thousands of years,

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.050 align:middle line:90%
essential to their way of life.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.470 align:middle line:10%
How do these plants work to
help us evolve spiritually

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.410 align:middle line:10%
and to connect to
our true nature?

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:34.820 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.900 align:middle line:10%
>> The drinking of ayahuasca
in a ceremony is the core

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.780 align:middle line:10%
of their spiritual traditions.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.390 align:middle line:10%
>> Here's the fascinating thing,
all the other groups here can

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.510 align:middle line:10%
talk very openly about their
religion and their spiritual

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.240 align:middle line:10%
paths and share with
people how to participate.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.110 align:middle line:84%
Ayahuasca, because of the laws
in the US, is very interesting.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.510 align:middle line:84%
We're here and we can talk
about this spiritual path,

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.760 align:middle line:84%
however, the main
component of it,

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.460 align:middle line:84%
which is the sacrament,
in this context,

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.880 align:middle line:84%
ayahuasca is still
illegal in most places.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.630 align:middle line:84%
So I've got these
amazing beautiful people

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.090 align:middle line:84%
coming here and saying,
I'm very interested,

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.923 align:middle line:90%
where can I do this?

00:03:09.923 --> 00:03:11.340 align:middle line:84%
I say, I can't
tell you anything.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.140 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And in most countries,
ayahuasca ceremonies must be

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.770 align:middle line:84%
conducted in secrecy, because
the prohibition of DMT,

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.080 align:middle line:84%
the active component
in the brew.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And those that
facilitate or partake

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.330 align:middle line:84%
are constantly at
risk of persecution.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:27.950 align:middle line:84%
Colonization and
the war on drugs

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.620 align:middle line:84%
has made it so that even the
indigenous people can't partake

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.530 align:middle line:84%
in their own spiritual
practices in most places, which

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.672 align:middle line:84%
is why this conference
is so interesting.

00:03:35.672 --> 00:03:38.906 align:middle line:90%


00:03:38.906 --> 00:03:41.720 align:middle line:10%
>> [SINGING NON-ENGLISH]

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:55.640 align:middle line:90%


00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:26.830 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.300 align:middle line:90%
>> [SINGING NON-ENGLISH]

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.500 align:middle line:90%


00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.840 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:04:35.840 --> 00:05:16.605 align:middle line:90%


00:05:16.605 --> 00:05:19.293 align:middle line:90%
>> [SINGING NON-ENGLISH]

00:05:19.293 --> 00:05:23.110 align:middle line:90%


00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.470 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.880 align:middle line:90%


00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.567 align:middle line:84%
>> So what does being at this
conference actually accomplish?

00:05:32.567 --> 00:05:34.400 align:middle line:84%
The biggest takeaway
seems to be that we all

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.440 align:middle line:90%
have so much common ground.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.500 align:middle line:10%
Each belief and
religion and ideology

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.160 align:middle line:10%
seems to be all a tool in the
toolkit helping us reconnect

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.870 align:middle line:10%
to our own divine nature.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.970 align:middle line:84%
Yet all these acknowledged
belief systems

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.950 align:middle line:84%
haven't been enough
to steer humanity

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.160 align:middle line:84%
into a peaceful,
sustainable existence.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And with the current
dire state of affairs,

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.500 align:middle line:90%
we need all hands on deck.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>> There are entheogenic
plants, cacti,

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.350 align:middle line:84%
and mushrooms that have been
facilitating direct connection

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.730 align:middle line:84%
with the divine
since ancient times.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.060 align:middle line:10%
But the knowledge
of these plants

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.480 align:middle line:10%
has been repressed
by colonization.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.450 align:middle line:84%
We believe it's divine timing
for the interfaith community

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.160 align:middle line:84%
to be open and honest about
the value of entheogenic plants

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.820 align:middle line:90%
for religious practices.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Because until we recognize
these practices as legitimate

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:27.020 align:middle line:84%
on a global scale, people and
the world are actually missing

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.008 align:middle line:84%
out on profound spiritual and
psychological healing exactly

00:06:30.008 --> 00:06:31.550 align:middle line:84%
at the time when we
need it the most.

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:37.850 align:middle line:90%


00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.900 align:middle line:10%
