meeting with what might seem
an unlikely group of marijuana

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.091 align:middle line:10%
users, senior citizens.

00:00:22.091 --> 00:00:25.130 align:middle line:84%
Senior citizens are the fastest
growing and largest demographic

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.830 align:middle line:84%
in the field of cannabis,
for so many reasons.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.230 align:middle line:84%
Today we're going to meet
with medical practitioners,

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.432 align:middle line:84%
educators, outreach,
and pioneers

00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:34.890 align:middle line:84%
who are helping bring these
medicines to the senior citizen

00:01:21.265 --> 00:01:23.930 align:middle line:84%
reliant on prescription
medicines and more connected

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.250 align:middle line:90%
to a natural way of life.

>> One day when I
was still smoking,

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.900 align:middle line:84%
I was driving across the bridge
and all of a sudden I realized

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.572 align:middle line:90%
I was relaxed.

00:01:32.572 --> 00:01:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I shifted
from getting high to getting

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.826 align:middle line:90%
medicated, personally.

00:01:36.826 --> 00:01:39.440 align:middle line:90%
My whole mindset changed on it.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And I became much more aware of
what the medical benefit of it

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.230 align:middle line:90%
could be.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
meeting people

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.330 align:middle line:84%
who were much more engaged
in the medical world,

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.560 align:middle line:90%
and the advocacy world.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.065 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I just said
this is where I need to be.

00:01:51.065 --> 00:01:53.820 align:middle line:10%
>> So I haven't been practicing
for a long time nursing,

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.820 align:middle line:10%
until I saw this photo in my
local newspaper of a nurse

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.930 align:middle line:10%
teaching senior citizens at
a retirement community about

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.090 align:middle line:10%
cannabis.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And I went, Oh my gosh, this
is really legitimizing it.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.900 align:middle line:90%
And I was just so curious.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And then I started going
to conferences, meetings,

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.530 align:middle line:84%
these kinds of groups, to
learn as much as I can.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.640 align:middle line:10%
>> Plant-based medicines,
non-toxic plant-based medicines

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.410 align:middle line:10%
are alive and well.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's just us creating
more awareness and education

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.800 align:middle line:84%
around them so it feels
safer to use them.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.280 align:middle line:84%
So we have a
mission ahead of us.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.480 align:middle line:90%
But I think it's a worthy one.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.520 align:middle line:10%
>> So my name is Barbara Blaser,
and I'm an RN with 50 years

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.440 align:middle line:10%
experience in the RN field.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.300 align:middle line:84%
I actually retired
a couple of years

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.940 align:middle line:84%
ago after being the
director of a hospice.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And while I was at
the hospice I saw

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.890 align:middle line:84%
lots of patients who really
appeared to be suffering

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.517 align:middle line:90%
with end-of-life things.

00:02:50.517 --> 00:02:52.850 align:middle line:10%
And I would see them on Friday
and they'd be devastated.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'd see them on Monday
and they would be more upbeat.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And they would have been visited
by a grandson with brownies.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And I began studying
what the efficacy was

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.590 align:middle line:90%
in treating seniors.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And I got offered
the opportunity

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.980 align:middle line:84%
to become a patient advocate
at Magnolia Wellness

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:08.780 align:middle line:90%
here in Oakland.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.330 align:middle line:10%
>> About five, six years ago,
I took three antidepressants

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.950 align:middle line:10%
a day and washed it down with
a bottle of wine every night.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.315 align:middle line:84%
And then took sleeping
pills on top of that.

00:03:20.315 --> 00:03:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And weighed about 200 pounds
more than I do right now.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.690 align:middle line:90%
And slowly I weaned myself off.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.280 align:middle line:90%
I started doing edibles.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm an edibles girl.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.815 align:middle line:84%
And I'm happy to say today
I don't take anything.

00:03:34.815 --> 00:03:38.210 align:middle line:84%
No antidepressants,
no pharmaceuticals.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:39.573 align:middle line:90%
only marijuana.

00:03:39.573 --> 00:03:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.370 align:middle line:10%
>> So just to clarify,
you actually retired from

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.260 align:middle line:10%
the hospice, took time off,
and then went on to go back

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.940 align:middle line:10%
into the field because--

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I actually got
critically, seriously ill.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And had some major
surgery and it went bad.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.050 align:middle line:84%
The doctor, who I dearly
love, poked a hole

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.450 align:middle line:90%
in my intestinal tract.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.190 align:middle line:84%
I ended up with septicaemia,
in a coma for weeks,

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.940 align:middle line:84%
lost all my hair, had
to re-learn to walk.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And in that six months I
spent a lot of time reading

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.380 align:middle line:90%
about medical marijuana.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.230 align:middle line:10%
I came to believe that cannabis
offered the opportunity to age

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.380 align:middle line:10%
at home successfully,
get back into the garden,

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.170 align:middle line:10%
and see my grandkids,
and enjoy life more.

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And for the seniors that
we see, 40% of our patients

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.090 align:middle line:84%
are seniors, that's
what they want to do.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.632 align:middle line:84%
>> Something that I feel really
impassioned about is bringing

00:04:28.632 --> 00:04:30.530 align:middle line:84%
seniors into the
cannabis community.

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.230 align:middle line:84%
Allowing them to speak
to practitioners,

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.130 align:middle line:84%
creating education for them
so that the stigma can get

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.097 align:middle line:84%
demystified in a way that
is comfortable for them.

00:04:40.097 --> 00:04:42.680 align:middle line:84%
>> The thing is, most of these
guys grew up during the "Reefer

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Madness" era and
the war on drugs.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.670 align:middle line:84%
So it's taken a lot of
outreach and education

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.770 align:middle line:84%
to dispel the false myth
that kept the medicine

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.330 align:middle line:90%
illegal for so long.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>> The stigma against medical
marijuana still exists,

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:54.940 align:middle line:90%
thank you Nancy Reagan.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.120 align:middle line:90%
But in seniors in particular--

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm 71.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.900 align:middle line:10%
I grew up believing
Nancy Reagan.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.940 align:middle line:84%
Oh my god, Nancy
wouldn't lie to me.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:02.870 align:middle line:90%
But she did.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.070 align:middle line:90%
She lied to me.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.570 align:middle line:84%
>> I do still see quite
a bit of resistance.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.740 align:middle line:10%
You know, because 90% of them
have never used it before.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.330 align:middle line:10%
A lot of them come
to me desperate.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.280 align:middle line:84%
Sort of, they've
tried everything else.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.400 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else has worked.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And so they're very sort
of disgusted in some cases

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.770 align:middle line:84%
that they've resorted
to marijuana.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.420 align:middle line:10%
>> People from our generation,
we're so used to hiding

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.580 align:middle line:10%
our cannabis, you know, and
our cannabis use in the closet.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a nice way to
bring people out of the closet,

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.270 align:middle line:84%
cannabis-wise, into a
social environment where

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.360 align:middle line:84%
we can sit around and smoke
together, laugh together,

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.530 align:middle line:90%
eat together.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And nobody's worried about
what the person next to them

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.370 align:middle line:90%
might think about that.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:48.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Seniors benefit so much
from cannabis as they age.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.080 align:middle line:84%
For sleep, for pain,
for mood elevation,

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.790 align:middle line:90%
for community, for bonding.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.390 align:middle line:10%
I mean, cannabis is an
incredible bonding plant.

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>> What we found is that a
lot of folks started coming

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.950 align:middle line:84%
to the East Bay Senior
Cannabis Social Club looking

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.810 align:middle line:84%
for a healthy change
in their lives.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.610 align:middle line:90%
What they got was a lot more.

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.800 align:middle line:84%
They found a community of
like-minded individuals

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.610 align:middle line:90%
to share their experiences with.

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.055 align:middle line:84%
And for some, a real sense of
community, and even family.
