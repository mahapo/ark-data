00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.855 align:middle line:84%
We're on our way right now to
San Diego to learn about Kambo.

00:00:03.855 --> 00:00:09.500 align:middle line:90%


00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.800 align:middle line:10%
Kambo is a secretion that comes
from the Amazonian tree frog,

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.012 align:middle line:10%
known as Phyllomedusa bicolor.

00:00:15.012 --> 00:00:16.970 align:middle line:10%
So legend has it that it
all began in a village

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.580 align:middle line:10%
in the Amazon jungle, where
everyone was incredibly sick

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.100 align:middle line:10%
and none of the traditional
medicines worked.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.920 align:middle line:10%
The shaman drinks ayahuasca,
a psychedelic brew,

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.540 align:middle line:10%
and has these
visions that the tree

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.450 align:middle line:10%
frog will help cure everyone.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.350 align:middle line:10%
So he sets off into the
jungle, finds his tree frog,

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.600 align:middle line:10%
collects its secretion,
and administers it

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.330 align:middle line:10%
to his whole village, which
then made everyone throw up,

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.625 align:middle line:10%
and miraculously,
everyone's cured.

00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:44.190 align:middle line:84%
We're going to meet with Caitlin
Thompson, who is a practitioner

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.050 align:middle line:84%
and has actually
used Kambo to treat

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.130 align:middle line:84%
autoimmune disorders and a lot
of gut imbalances and bacteria

proving to do the opposite.

Drugs like MDMA, mushrooms,
marijuana, LSD, and ayahuasca

right.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.078 align:middle line:84%

had been working with this frog

medicine.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.915 align:middle line:84%

sounds interesting,

00:01:54.915 --> 00:01:56.280 align:middle line:90%
and I was intrigued.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.640 align:middle line:84%
So I went with
him to a ceremony.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.060 align:middle line:90%
It was deep.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.230 align:middle line:90%
It was profound.

What's going to happen
to my stomach with this?

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so there's a lot
of microorganisms that live

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.960 align:middle line:84%
in the GI tract, called the
microbiome, and it's a very,

very complex ecology, just
like the rainforest is.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes when species of
bacteria can become overgrown

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.590 align:middle line:84%
and they start contributing
to disease or sickness

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.570 align:middle line:84%

no, just kidding.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.848 align:middle line:84%
And then these fuzzies,
these little fuzzy things--

00:07:40.848 --> 00:07:42.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's a
Rice Krispie treat.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.730 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not a Rice Krispie
treat because I see this.

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:47.820 align:middle line:84%
This is common, and everybody
has these little fuzzies.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.340 align:middle line:84%
You have quite a
dark color, which

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.370 align:middle line:84%
indicates to me that you
might have some heavy metal

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:58.960 align:middle line:84%
toxicity or some toxins that
balance your bile that are fat

00:07:58.960 --> 00:07:59.760 align:middle line:90%
soluble--

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:04.320 align:middle line:84%
because the bile stores toxins
and then kind of recycles them

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.330 align:middle line:84%
over and over because the
bile gets reused by the body.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.620 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of ideas about
what the vomit can tell us,

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.590 align:middle line:84%
but you certainly
have a darker vomit,

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:16.390 align:middle line:84%
which makes me think that we got
a lot of good stuff out today.

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:17.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:17.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:17.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.200 align:middle line:90%
>> So yeah, there you have it.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.000 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.092 align:middle line:90%
>> Barfology.

00:08:21.092 --> 00:08:22.448 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:08:22.448 --> 00:08:24.260 align:middle line:90%


00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.700 align:middle line:84%
I know taking a frog medicine
that makes you throw up

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.010 align:middle line:84%
sounds pretty trippy, but
there were absolutely no

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:30.480 align:middle line:90%
psychedelic effects.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.750 align:middle line:84%
Yet still, many credit Kambo
for having changed their life.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:36.030 align:middle line:84%
It's a little too
soon for me to say,

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:37.559 align:middle line:84%
but the next day,
I did find myself

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:40.470 align:middle line:84%
having some serious moments of
insight and a sense of clarity

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:42.020 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have before.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.670 align:middle line:84%
The next week, my skin
started clearing up.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:46.748 align:middle line:10%
Throwing up isn't
exactly a party,

00:08:46.748 --> 00:08:48.540 align:middle line:10%
but I'd say the after
effects are worth it,

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:49.890 align:middle line:10%
and I will be doing it again.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:53.240 align:middle line:10%
