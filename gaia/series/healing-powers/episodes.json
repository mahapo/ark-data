After returning to life at home, veterans are often beset by psychiatric conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, as well as painful physical injuries — and they’re frequently prescribed large quantities of pharmaceuticals to cope with such ailments. These cocktails of drugs are increasingly leading to overmedication and severe side effects, including even further deterioration of mental and physical health. \r\n\r\nBut this group of veterans isn’t giving up the fight! Join Healing Powers host Mareesa Stertz as she meets members of the Weed for Warriors Project in Los Angeles, who are leading the charge to expand legal cannabis access to former soldiers as a healthier alternative to relying on prescription pills. These courageous individuals are attaining more functional and fulfilling lives for themselves and their families through the help of medical marijuana, and they’re not settling for what the government is willing to offer. Through activism and solidarity, these warriors are changing the conversation around the lives of veterans, while illustrating how cannabis could help end a cycle of avoidable pain and death.","teaser":"Former soldiers share their experiences using cannabis to treat the traumas of military service.","keyart16x9WithText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/6bd08e6e-5a29-42b8-91a9-26f4eda864e2/187964_THP_e1_Weed-for-Warriors_16x9.jpg"},"keyart16x9NoText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/3bf724d8-eed4-465c-ade4-aa3c325596e4/187964_THP_e1_Weed-for-Warriors_16x9_clean.jpg","medium":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/3bf724d8-eed4-465c-ade4-aa3c325596e4/187964_THP_e1_Weed-for-Warriors_16x9_clean.jpg","large":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/3bf724d8-eed4-465c-ade4-aa3c325596e4/187964_THP_e1_Weed-for-Warriors_16x9_clean.jpg"}},{"seriesId":187962,"seriesTitle":"Healing Powers","seriesPath":"series/healing-powers","seriesVoteDownCount":16,"seriesVoteUpCount":273,"coverartImage":null,"created":"2020-01-30","episode":2,"classicFacets":{},"fitnessLevel":[],"fitnessStyle":[],"heroImage":null,"heroImageNotext":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/7f47548b-5834-4b37-afea-e0ec12e46bdc/187965_THP_e2_Cleansing-with-Kambo_hero-clean.jpg","host":null,"meditationStyle":null,"path":"video/cleansing-kambo","previewImage":null,"published":true,"season":1,"title":"Cleansing with Kambo","type":{"content":"video","display":"normal","product":"episode"},"voteDownCount":15,"voteUpCount":238,"yogaLevel":[],"yogaStyle":[],"episodeCount":6,"seasonCount":1,"preview":null,"feature":{"duration":566,"mediaId":183761,"georestrictions":{"availability":"worldwide","countries":[]},"offerings":{"availability":"onlyWith","subscriptions":[253,280,290]},"id":183761,"isFree":false},"id":187965,"isNew":false,"featuredType":null,"body":"While you may have heard of ayahuasca or other psychedelic practices originating from south of the border, there’s one such medicine growing in popularity that yields no hallucinogenic effects at all — but will make you vomit repeatedly.
