00:00:02.922 --> 00:00:04.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Such a cute little dude.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I was always told that magic
mushrooms grows on cow shit.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.990 align:middle line:84%
But these ladies are not
living up to the hype.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.680 align:middle line:84%
We found the mushroom,
but it's not a magic one.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.850 align:middle line:90%
But it's cute.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.510 align:middle line:10%
In Holland, psilocybin
is mostly legal.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.310 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to be
working with Oliver

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.070 align:middle line:10%
Martin, a practitioner who
guides people in a psilohuasca

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.870 align:middle line:10%
journey.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.068 align:middle line:10%
>> This is a dung-loving--

00:00:31.068 --> 00:00:35.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Psilohuasca is psilocybin,
also known as magic mushrooms,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.390 align:middle line:10%
taken with Syrian rue, a seed
from the peganum harmala plant.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.270 align:middle line:84%
The Syrian rue extends and
intensifies the mushroom

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.690 align:middle line:84%
experience, making it
four times more powerful,

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.250 align:middle line:90%
and lasting up to nine hours.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.025 align:middle line:84%
>> He says I'm not going
to be the same after this.

00:00:50.025 --> 00:00:53.130 align:middle line:10%
>> The things we were told would
harm us are actually proving

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.040 align:middle line:10%
to do the opposite.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.030 align:middle line:84%
Drugs like MDMA, mushrooms,
marijuana, LSD, and ayahuasca

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.180 align:middle line:84%
are helping resolve
serious mental issues.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.280 align:middle line:84%
Join us as we explore
for ourselves the healing

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.220 align:middle line:84%
powers of weed, psychedelics,
and other mindful practices.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.423 align:middle line:90%


00:01:13.423 --> 00:01:15.183 align:middle line:90%
>> It smells OK.

00:01:15.183 --> 00:01:16.350 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't smell that gross.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.840 align:middle line:90%


00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.970 align:middle line:90%
It's not too bad.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:24.932 align:middle line:90%
[COUGHS]

00:01:24.932 --> 00:01:25.894 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:01:25.894 --> 00:01:27.228 align:middle line:90%
[COUGHS]

00:01:27.228 --> 00:01:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Since the beginning
of recorded history,

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.450 align:middle line:84%
people have been taking
psychedelic plants to help them

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.430 align:middle line:90%
overcome mental hurdles.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.790 align:middle line:84%
For me, I came to Oliver looking
to conquer my overactive mind,

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.070 align:middle line:84%
an anxiety-wrought problem
that's been bothering

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.090 align:middle line:90%
me my entire life.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.800 align:middle line:90%
>> I loop in my mind.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.500 align:middle line:84%
I tried to figure something out,
and then it doesn't work out.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.097 align:middle line:84%
And then I try to
figure it out again.

00:01:46.097 --> 00:01:46.930 align:middle line:90%
And it's just like--

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.280 align:middle line:90%
>> In daily life you will?

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, while I'm
trying to fall asleep.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And I will not be
able to turn off.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.170 align:middle line:84%
>> What mushrooms do, what a
psychedelic in general does,

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.840 align:middle line:84%
is to enhance the senses to
a point that they go beyond

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.580 align:middle line:90%
the daily perception.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.740 align:middle line:90%
We're walking here, yeah?

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And simultaneously, so
many things are happening.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And we have very good
ears and very good eyes,

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.150 align:middle line:84%
and we can see everything
and hear everything.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Still we can focus
on talking together.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And the mushrooms, they get
all the stuff washed up,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.820 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.740 align:middle line:84%
All the energy is loose, and
get to the surface again.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And you can look at it
and finally process it.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.292 align:middle line:90%


00:02:35.292 --> 00:02:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Oliver works hard
to create a sacred,

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.090 align:middle line:84%
safe environment for
the therapeutic session.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the powdered
mushroom material--

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.360 align:middle line:90%
2 grams.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.210 align:middle line:90%
Very powerful subspecies.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Psilohuasca is a relatively
new practice that Oliver's been

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.500 align:middle line:84%
working with for 20 years that
exists outside of traditional

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.732 align:middle line:90%
plant medicine work.

00:02:58.732 --> 00:02:59.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Smells like mushroom soup.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Cheers, guys.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.666 align:middle line:90%
See you on the other side.

00:03:03.666 --> 00:03:04.618 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah.

00:03:04.618 --> 00:03:11.282 align:middle line:90%


00:03:11.282 --> 00:03:12.860 align:middle line:90%
>> I need some more water.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:13.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.552 align:middle line:90%
Drink up.

00:03:14.552 --> 00:03:15.352 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:03:15.352 --> 00:03:17.490 align:middle line:84%
>> You will soon see
how strong they are.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:19.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm curious.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.535 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:03:20.535 --> 00:03:23.730 align:middle line:84%
>> This is where
things get interesting.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.190 align:middle line:84%
Fluorescent colored waves
and patterns took over.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And I felt about
eight years old,

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.910 align:middle line:84%
shooting laser beams
out of my hands

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.190 align:middle line:84%
while taking a tour
of the universe.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.560 align:middle line:84%
Patterns turned into a river,
which eventually landed me

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.643 align:middle line:90%
at the foot of a mountain.

00:03:35.643 --> 00:03:37.920 align:middle line:84%
When I climbed this
bright, glowing mountain,

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.300 align:middle line:84%
a magnetic force
was drawing me up.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.360 align:middle line:84%
The higher I climbed,
the more I realized

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.370 align:middle line:84%
that everything
around me was composed

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.470 align:middle line:84%
of these energetic entities
that were basically

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.780 align:middle line:90%
the building blocks of reality.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And these are part of the
force that drive everything.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.750 align:middle line:84%
I found myself
bathed in a light,

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.570 align:middle line:84%
and came to realize
that that light was God,

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.630 align:middle line:90%
and that God is everything--

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.120 align:middle line:90%
including me.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And that, of course, has
some pretty big implications.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Holy shit.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.044 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:04:12.044 --> 00:04:16.540 align:middle line:90%
Um, I feel like there is--

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.620 align:middle line:84%
it's like a video
game land of like--

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.580 align:middle line:84%
but it's, like, the underlying
building blocks of creation.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And you-- and you
see all these, like,

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.740 align:middle line:84%
little entities that are
building everything together.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.590 align:middle line:84%
I started, uh, being able
to see how they operate.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.540 align:middle line:84%
I kept on laughing, because I
see that it's all a big game.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.860 align:middle line:90%
There is no good.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:38.880 align:middle line:90%
There is no bad.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.650 align:middle line:90%
We decide to give life meaning.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.570 align:middle line:84%
We decide to say,
oh, it's really hard.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:43.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to suffer.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.240 align:middle line:84%
Or we decide to say, look
at the awesomeness of it.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.980 align:middle line:84%
It's really just
kind of what patterns

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.393 align:middle line:84%
we've ingrained
in ourselves that

00:04:51.393 --> 00:04:52.560 align:middle line:90%
determine which way we look.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>> All things are
growing, you know.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.300 align:middle line:84%
It's like when you water
a plant, it's growing.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And if you water, um, your
thoughts, yeah, you know,

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.700 align:middle line:84%
surrounding a problem,
you know, not existing,

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.040 align:middle line:84%
thought pattern you
don't like, yeah,

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.490 align:middle line:84%
which is pretty much it--
if you feed it with energy,

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.640 align:middle line:84%
if you water it with
energy, it grows.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>> It's so funny, because we
put ourselves through so much

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.527 align:middle line:84%
to forget that we are
part of everything.

00:05:20.527 --> 00:05:21.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that's what I'm saying.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.190 align:middle line:90%
It's not about healing stuff.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.787 align:middle line:84%
It's about
acknowledging the fact

00:05:25.787 --> 00:05:27.870 align:middle line:84%
that you are already a
perfect human being the way

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.040 align:middle line:90%
that you are.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And that there's-- you know,
the sun is out now, you know.

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.750 align:middle line:84%
But the last days, it
was raining, you know.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.470 align:middle line:90%
So that's and yang of life.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.280 align:middle line:90%
So everything is dark and light.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.900 align:middle line:84%
>> While it may appear that
psilohuasca could be a quick

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.290 align:middle line:84%
fix to any issue, I have
to say it's really more

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.710 align:middle line:84%
of a ground-shaking moment
of clarity that takes months

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.530 align:middle line:90%
and lots of self work to unfold.

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.560 align:middle line:84%
But since this
session, I found myself

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.160 align:middle line:84%
with a lot more faith in
the way the universe works,

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.920 align:middle line:84%
helping relieve my
anxiety and allowing

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.360 align:middle line:84%
me to trust that the things life
throws my way are meant to be,

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.700 align:middle line:84%
and that it'd help
me grow stronger.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.443 align:middle line:90%
