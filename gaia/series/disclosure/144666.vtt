00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.190 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WILCOCK: Welcome to
another episode of Disclosure.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, David Wilcock.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And we are back and running
with Rupert Sheldrake,

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.040 align:middle line:84%
truly one of the
greatest scientific minds

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.210 align:middle line:90%
in our modern era.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.750 align:middle line:84%
I put him right up there with
Copernicus, Aristotle, Galileo,

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Einstein, as I said at the
beginning of the interview.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, in this
episode, we're going

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.860 align:middle line:84%
to go through a whole bunch of
amazing scientific experiments

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.930 align:middle line:90%
that are utterly mind-blowing.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.390 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about
things like how people naturally

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.290 align:middle line:84%
learn Morse code better if it's
the original Morse code rather

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.290 align:middle line:84%
than a fake Morse code; how
people learn to type better,

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.090 align:middle line:84%
even if they've
never typed before,

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.864 align:middle line:84%
using the old fashioned
QWERTY keyboard.

00:00:58.864 --> 00:01:00.780 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about
a lot of that stuff.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.570 align:middle line:84%
But what really was
the most interesting

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.960 align:middle line:84%
for me is when we
get into chemicals.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.150 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
I actually hadn't really

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.100 align:middle line:84%
been familiar with,
because I hadn't

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.250 align:middle line:84%
read Sheldrake's book before,
where this was discussed.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very paradoxical
type of discussion.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.890 align:middle line:84%
The idea here is that if
we're in a living universe,

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.960 align:middle line:84%
then the actual physical stuff
that's not conventionally

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.130 align:middle line:84%
seen as alive is ultimately
conscious in its own way

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.110 align:middle line:84%
and is interconnected
energetically.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.830 align:middle line:84%
So this is going to be a little
confusing for some people.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.660 align:middle line:84%
But what we're
going to talk about

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.110 align:middle line:84%
is how Sheldrake is describing
chemical companies that

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.620 align:middle line:84%
are putting together and mixing
two chemicals that have never

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.020 align:middle line:90%
necessarily been mixed before.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And if those chemicals
haven't been mixed before,

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.780 align:middle line:84%
they don't know how
to make crystals.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.180 align:middle line:84%
But then surprisingly,
once the crystal

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.900 align:middle line:84%
is formed, which in some cases
can take many months, all

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.030 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden over a
short period of time

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.060 align:middle line:84%
if you do this with
several batches,

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.550 align:middle line:84%
suddenly all over the
world the crystals

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.650 align:middle line:90%
start to form more easily.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And you're even going to hear
about an AIDS treatment called

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.330 align:middle line:84%
ritonavir and how
once that drug started

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.500 align:middle line:84%
to develop an
alternative branch,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.400 align:middle line:84%
the original version could
no longer be manufactured.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.380 align:middle line:84%
Every laboratory
around the world

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.590 align:middle line:84%
was only able to produce
this weird strain of it that

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.380 align:middle line:84%
did not have the effectiveness
that the drug needed.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.150 align:middle line:84%
The pharmaceutical companies
could not dial it back.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.070 align:middle line:90%
They lost billions of dollars.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.710 align:middle line:84%
So this is very, very
fascinating stuff.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:38.510 align:middle line:90%
Check it out.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.930 align:middle line:84%
This is undoubtedly some
of the greatest information

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.390 align:middle line:84%
that I've ever gotten on
camera, and I'm really

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.640 align:middle line:90%
stoked for you to see it.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.390 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: I think the guy that was
working on this, his last name

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.130 align:middle line:90%
starts with an M. Morse code.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.930 align:middle line:10%
SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.790 align:middle line:10%
DAVID: People who've
never seen it before--

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:55.405 align:middle line:10%
SHELDRAKE: Yes

00:02:55.405 --> 00:02:57.113 align:middle line:10%
DAVID: If you give
them a fake Morse code

00:02:57.113 --> 00:02:59.530 align:middle line:10%
to learn as opposed to the
real one, what happens?

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.380 align:middle line:90%
SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.302 align:middle line:90%
Arden Mahlberg.

00:03:01.302 --> 00:03:02.260 align:middle line:90%
DAVID: Mahlberg, right.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.500 align:middle line:90%
SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.790 align:middle line:90%
He did this as a thesis.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.800 align:middle line:84%
I think it was at the California
Institute of Integral Studies.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.910 align:middle line:10%
And he took people who
didn't know Morse code at all

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.750 align:middle line:10%
and he got them to learn regular
Morse code for certain letters.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.730 align:middle line:10%
And then he made up
this new Morse code,

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.620 align:middle line:10%
similar numbers of
dots and dashes,

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.360 align:middle line:10%
but kind of fake Morse code.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.850 align:middle line:10%
And the idea was the regular
one would be easier to learn,

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.770 align:middle line:10%
because millions of people
have already learned it.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.440 align:middle line:10%
And that's just what he found.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.180 align:middle line:10%
So that's another test.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And that would be an
example of tapping

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.810 align:middle line:84%
into a kind of
collective memory.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Hardly anyone learns
Morse code today.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.860 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is millions
of people have learned it.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And this general
principle, you see,

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.000 align:middle line:84%
is actually rather important
in industrial design.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there have been
many attempts of people

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.370 align:middle line:84%
to reform the
typewriter keyboard,

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.300 align:middle line:90%
the computer keyboard.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.050 align:middle line:84%
As you know, the model we
all kind is the QWERTY one,

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:08.200 align:middle line:84%
Q-W-E-R-T-Y. That was invented
in the 1860s by the Remington

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.020 align:middle line:84%
Typewriter Corporation
in the United States.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And those old-style
typewriters, bars

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.600 align:middle line:90%
come up when you press keys.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.560 align:middle line:84%
If you had letters
that frequently

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.250 align:middle line:84%
came next to each other,
like Q and U, for example,

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.170 align:middle line:90%
these bars would get jammed.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.460 align:middle line:84%
So they had to design it so
that you wouldn't very often get

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.660 align:middle line:90%
adjacent letters.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.190 align:middle line:84%
You'd never get Q to
W, you see, so Q-W.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And it was designed
so that you'd

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.450 align:middle line:84%
get the minimum
number of jamming,

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.070 align:middle line:84%
so it was done for purely
mechanical reasons.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And many people in
the 1970s and '80s

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.670 align:middle line:84%
and '90s thought, you know,
this is completely irrational,

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:49.610 align:middle line:90%
unnecessary.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.670 align:middle line:84%
Let's have rational
typewriter design,

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.120 align:middle line:84%
based on rational frequencies
of numbers, the way fingers

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.180 align:middle line:90%
work, etc.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.030 align:middle line:90%
And they worked studying things.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.540 align:middle line:84%
They kept coming up with new
improved typewriter designs.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And when they tested them
out on people who hadn't yet

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.060 align:middle line:84%
learned to type and weren't
yet familiar with anything,

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.740 align:middle line:84%
they found that
the QWERTY design

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.670 align:middle line:84%
was much easier
for people to learn

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.390 align:middle line:84%
than these new rational,
improved designs.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's a perfect example,
you see, of morphic resonance.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.700 align:middle line:84%
You've got a kind
of habit that's

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.180 align:middle line:84%
grown up of people learning
that kind of typing.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And even though with modern
computers things jamming,

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean mechanical things jamming
like in Remington typewriters

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.590 align:middle line:84%
in the 19th century, is
completely irrelevant,

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.000 align:middle line:84%
and yet this is a built-in habit
that's got sort of fossilized

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.080 align:middle line:84%
into the state-of-the-art
technologies as QWERTY-type

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.310 align:middle line:90%
keyboard.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.240 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: Well, there's
another study that involves

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.105 align:middle line:90%
Japanese nursery rhymes.

00:05:47.105 --> 00:05:48.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you're
familiar with that one.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:49.060 align:middle line:90%
SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.860 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.910 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: So let's talk
a little about that.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.290 align:middle line:84%
SHELDRAKE: Well,
this was done by--

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.870 align:middle line:84%
when my hypothesis
of morphic resonance

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.740 align:middle line:84%
first came out in 1981, the
British magazine New Scientist

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.960 align:middle line:84%
ran a contest for the
best ideas for testing it.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And they had a
prize, a cash prize.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And the winning entry
suggested getting people

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.450 align:middle line:84%
to learn foreign
nursery rhymes compared

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.930 align:middle line:84%
with a similar rhyme with
similar rhythm and meter

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.260 align:middle line:84%
on the grounds the real one
would be easier to learn.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.020 align:middle line:84%
So I actually did
this experiment.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.360 align:middle line:84%
I got one of Japan's
leading poets

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.280 align:middle line:84%
to compose a fake
nursery rhyme that

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.530 align:middle line:84%
had a similar words and rhythm
to a genuine nursery rhyme.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.050 align:middle line:84%
And then we got people
in the US and in Britain

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.800 align:middle line:84%
to learn it phonetically
by repeating it.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And the prediction
was the genuine one

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.050 align:middle line:84%
would be easier to
learn than the fake one.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.759 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, that's
what happened.

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:53.800 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: And the kids that
had learned this nursery

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.630 align:middle line:84%
rhyme, it's like millions
of people, right?

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:56.880 align:middle line:90%
SHELDRAKE: Millions of people.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's like
English nursery rhymes.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.019 align:middle line:84%
I mean, millions of
people learn these.

00:07:01.019 --> 00:07:02.560 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: So this means
that even if you

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.800 align:middle line:84%
don't speak the
language, you're still

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.580 align:middle line:84%
going to phonetically remember
the real nursery rhyme better

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:10.910 align:middle line:90%
than the fake one.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:11.710 align:middle line:90%
SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
what's important

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.420 align:middle line:84%
here is this helps to explain
why children can learn

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.740 align:middle line:90%
languages in the first place.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.020 align:middle line:84%
I think a large part
of regular learning

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.870 align:middle line:90%
is by morphic resonance.

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.890 align:middle line:84%
Babies can learn language
astonishingly fast.

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:32.680 align:middle line:84%
Noam Chomsky, the linguist,
said that the fact that children

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.590 align:middle line:84%
can learn language
so quickly shows

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:37.690 align:middle line:84%
that there must
be some inherited

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.420 align:middle line:84%
language-learning ability,
because it is far too

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.540 align:middle line:84%
quick to explain in terms
of stimulus-response type

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.370 align:middle line:90%
psychology.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:49.450 align:middle line:84%
So Chomsky came up
with a theory there

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:51.770 align:middle line:84%
must be genes for
language and we must all

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:53.240 align:middle line:90%
inherit these genes.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.330 align:middle line:84%
But because Chinese
children could learn English

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.070 align:middle line:84%
if they were adopted
by an English family

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:00.380 align:middle line:84%
just as easily as
English children,

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:03.500 align:middle line:84%
it had to be genes
for universal grammar.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.710 align:middle line:84%
That was his theory, because
he assumed it must be in genes.

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:10.080 align:middle line:84%
But you see, the data shows
that kids learn very quickly.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.340 align:middle line:84%
There's something inherited
about where they learn it.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.950 align:middle line:84%
There's no evidence for the
existence of universal grammar

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:16.970 align:middle line:90%
genes.

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:20.180 align:middle line:84%
But morphic resonance would
explain this much more easily.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.730 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you start learning
a language and start trying

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:25.340 align:middle line:84%
to say it, you tune in by
morphic resonance to people

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.780 align:middle line:90%
who've spoken it before.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.465 align:middle line:84%
This would lead to
facilitated learning.

00:08:29.465 --> 00:08:31.340 align:middle line:84%
The same would be true
of learning any skill,

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.610 align:middle line:84%
like riding a bicycle
or driving a car

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:38.240 align:middle line:90%
or windsurfing or surfboarding.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, all
these new skills,

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.860 align:middle line:84%
there's been a tremendous
invention of new skills

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:46.260 align:middle line:84%
in recent decades in various
sports, like surfboarding,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.290 align:middle line:90%
windsurfing, snowboarding.

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:53.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, no one did these things
before, and they're new skills.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And people who work in those
areas, almost all of them

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.000 align:middle line:84%
are convinced it's
much easier for kids

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.940 align:middle line:84%
to learn these things now
than it was originally.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.880 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: I'm sure you're also
familiar with the Hebrew words

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.990 align:middle line:84%
study, where some of
the most prevalent words

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:12.320 align:middle line:84%
in the Old Testament were
taken and then compared

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:17.570 align:middle line:84%
with Hebrew words that didn't
have that type of prevalence.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:18.470 align:middle line:90%
SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:21.680 align:middle line:10%
Well, that was-- actually,
that was done by Professor Gary

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:25.070 align:middle line:10%
Schwartz, who is now at Arizona,
but at that time was professor

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:27.500 align:middle line:10%
of psychology at Yale.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And there was a prize
offered by the Tarrytown

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:33.110 align:middle line:90%
Foundation in New York.

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:34.970 align:middle line:84%
Following the New
Scientist competition,

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:37.400 align:middle line:84%
which was for ideas
for experiments,

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.310 align:middle line:84%
the Tarrytown Foundation
offered a $10,000 prize

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:42.500 align:middle line:90%
for the best actual experiment.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And that was won by
Professor Schwartz at Yale.

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And that was his
experiment, that what he did

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.910 align:middle line:90%
was asked people--

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:56.420 align:middle line:84%
showed people real words from
the Old Testament, common words

00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:01.250 align:middle line:84%
and rare words, compared
with anagrams of real words.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:04.610 align:middle line:84%
For example, in English a
real word is cat, C-A-T.

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:07.570 align:middle line:84%
But T-C-A contains
the same letters,

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:09.320 align:middle line:90%
but it's not a real word.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And his prediction
was that when people

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.770 align:middle line:84%
were asked to look
at these words,

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:17.720 align:middle line:84%
and people who
didn't know Hebrew

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.380 align:middle line:84%
and had never learned it, that
the real words would somehow

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:22.880 align:middle line:90%
seem more familiar.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.850 align:middle line:84%
He asked people to guess
the meaning of the words,

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:30.210 align:middle line:84%
and then asked them how accurate
they thought their guess was.

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:32.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, when people
did guess correctly,

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:34.280 align:middle line:84%
he eliminated them
on the grounds

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.470 align:middle line:84%
they might have
known Hebrew, they

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:40.130 align:middle line:84%
might have seen it or heard
it as a child or something.

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.710 align:middle line:84%
So he only took people
who guessed wrongly,

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:44.760 align:middle line:90%
to be very conservative.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And then when he looked
at the confidence

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:50.220 align:middle line:84%
they felt in their guess, he
found that with the real words,

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.270 align:middle line:84%
even though the guess was false,
they felt much more confident.

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.760 align:middle line:84%
Somehow there was something
familiar about those words that

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.590 align:middle line:90%
made him feel more confident.

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And they were more confident
with the frequent words

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.330 align:middle line:84%
from the Old Testament
than the rare words

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:03.770 align:middle line:90%
from the Old Testament.

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:06.930 align:middle line:84%
This was a significant
statistical effect.

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:12.275 align:middle line:84%
So that was another one of these
morphic resonance experiments.

00:11:12.275 --> 00:11:17.630 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: The story about
blue tits, these birds that

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:21.260 align:middle line:84%
eventually learned
how to drink cream out

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:22.730 align:middle line:84%
of the milk bottles
that were left

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:25.130 align:middle line:84%
in front of people's
houses, tell us

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:27.230 align:middle line:90%
a little bit about that one.

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:30.110 align:middle line:84%
SHELDRAKE: Well,
in Britain, we've

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:32.690 align:middle line:84%
always had a system where
fresh milk's delivered

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:34.220 align:middle line:90%
to the doorstep everyday.

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.210 align:middle line:90%
It's still going on.

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:36.640 align:middle line:84%
We still have fresh
milk delivered

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.200 align:middle line:90%
to our house in London.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.560 align:middle line:90%
They put it on the doorstep.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And they originally
had cardboard lids.

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:44.620 align:middle line:90%
Now they have metal foil lids.

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.284 align:middle line:84%
And there's a bottle, and
then they collect the bottles

00:11:47.284 --> 00:11:49.700 align:middle line:84%
when they deliver the milk,
wash them, and use them again.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.130 align:middle line:90%
It's a very good system.

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:56.420 align:middle line:84%
In the 1920s, people started
noticing in Southampton

00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:00.500 align:middle line:84%
in the south of England
that when they went out

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.030 align:middle line:84%
to collect their
milk, the cream had

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:03.950 align:middle line:90%
gone from the top of the milk.

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And when people
looked carefully,

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:09.230 align:middle line:84%
they found that blue tits, which
are what are called chickadees

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:13.590 align:middle line:84%
here in the United States, were
tearing off these cardboard

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:17.450 align:middle line:84%
tops and drinking the cream
out of the top of the bottles.

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:21.350 align:middle line:84%
They were getting a supply
of free cream every morning.

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And the spread of this habit
was documented by amateur bird

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:27.080 align:middle line:90%
watchers all over Britain.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And they found that the spread
got quicker and quicker.

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:34.100 align:middle line:84%
It spread, but it spread
often jumping many miles,

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.320 align:middle line:90%
far further than blue tits fly.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.960 align:middle line:90%
They're home-loving birds.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And it seemed to
be accelerating.

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:45.050 align:middle line:10%
And the professor of zoology at
Oxford University, Sir Alister

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:48.330 align:middle line:10%
Hardy, was so impressed
by this he thought

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.370 align:middle line:10%
there must be something
like telepathy going on

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:51.960 align:middle line:10%
between the blue tits.

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And it was carefully documented
by scientists at Cambridge,

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:57.660 align:middle line:84%
discussed by
professors at Oxford,

00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:01.740 align:middle line:84%
and showed this accelerated
rate of learning.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think that
rather than telepathy,

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.740 align:middle line:84%
it's morphic resonance,
that you'd expect something

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.030 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:11.130 align:middle line:84%
The most interesting
data came from Holland,

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:14.490 align:middle line:84%
because in Holland when the
Germans invaded and occupied

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:17.550 align:middle line:90%
Holland, milk delivery stopped.

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't start until
several years after the war.

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:22.537 align:middle line:84%
Blue tits only live
two or three years,

00:13:22.537 --> 00:13:24.870 align:middle line:84%
so there wouldn't have been
any surviving blue tits that

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:27.950 align:middle line:84%
remembered the golden
age of free cream.

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And when they resumed milk
deliveries in Holland,

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:37.365 align:middle line:84%
within months all over Holland
blue tits were stealing milk.

00:13:37.365 --> 00:13:39.990 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: Well, the blue tits must
be writing books and handing it

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:42.240 align:middle line:90%
to their children.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can't
explain it skeptically.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:46.050 align:middle line:90%
SHELDRAKE: No.

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:50.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, the interesting
coda to that story

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.847 align:middle line:84%
is that now blue tits have
stopped doing it in Britain.

00:13:53.847 --> 00:13:55.180 align:middle line:90%
We don't have any more problems.

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is that,
like many other people,

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.100 align:middle line:84%
we've switched to
semi-skim milk, where

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.920 align:middle line:84%
there's no cream on the
top of the bottle to steal.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.380 align:middle line:90%
And it's not worth the effort.

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.921 align:middle line:84%
Blue tits have sort
of quit doing it.

00:14:06.921 --> 00:14:09.276 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:09.276 --> 00:14:11.640 align:middle line:90%


00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.940 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: Now, I know that
you've also done research

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:17.490 align:middle line:90%
with termite mounds.

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And in this case,
you're putting--

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.850 align:middle line:84%
it's like a metal plate in
the middle of a termite mound

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:25.080 align:middle line:90%
so that they can't--

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.750 align:middle line:84%
the ones above the
metal plate are

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.370 align:middle line:84%
sealed from the
ones on the bottom,

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:32.845 align:middle line:84%
but they still coordinate
activity somehow?

00:14:32.845 --> 00:14:33.720 align:middle line:90%
SHELDRAKE: Well, yes.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.580 align:middle line:10%
This experiment, I
describe this in my book

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.200 align:middle line:10%
"Seven Experiments
That Could Change

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.940 align:middle line:10%
the World, A
Do-It-Yourself Guide

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.740 align:middle line:10%
to Revolutionary Science."

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:44.760 align:middle line:10%
My aim in that book was to find
paradigm-changing experiments

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:48.160 align:middle line:10%
that could be done on a
budget of $10 or less,

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.740 align:middle line:10%
because it's very
hard to get grants

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:51.270 align:middle line:10%
for unconventional science.

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:52.260 align:middle line:90%
DAVID: Sure.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.051 align:middle line:84%
SHELDRAKE: So I thought
one way around that

00:14:54.051 --> 00:14:57.480 align:middle line:84%
was to make it so inexpensive
that you don't need a grant.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And one of those seven
experiments is the termite one.

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:05.010 align:middle line:10%
What I was basing it on was some
research done in South Africa

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:09.550 align:middle line:10%
by Eugene Marais, who was
a South African biologist.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And he found that if you
damage a termites' nest,

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:13.830 align:middle line:90%
then they repair the damage.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's a mystery as to
how they built these mounds

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:20.830 align:middle line:84%
in the first place,
because termites are blind,

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:24.330 align:middle line:84%
so it's not as if they
can see these structures.

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And they can communicate
by smell and by tapping,

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.320 align:middle line:84%
but it's hardly likely that
elaborate architecture could

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.350 align:middle line:84%
be the plan in the first place
of this, how that could be

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:36.540 align:middle line:90%
done by smell and by tapping.

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:39.270 align:middle line:84%
I think it's because of what I
call the morphic field, a kind

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:42.720 align:middle line:84%
of invisible blueprint that
the termites are following

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.130 align:middle line:84%
that's part of their
collective memory.

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:48.370 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, what Marais found was
that if you damage the nest,

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:49.170 align:middle line:90%
they repair it.

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:51.400 align:middle line:84%
But then, as you say,
you put in a metal sheet

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.570 align:middle line:84%
down the middle, damaged
it on both sides,

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:57.094 align:middle line:84%
and then the termite set
to work repairing it.

00:15:57.094 --> 00:15:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And they repaired
it in such a way

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:02.220 align:middle line:84%
that the arches and the
tunnels and the outer wall

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.560 align:middle line:84%
sort of matched up perfectly
when you removed the metal

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.500 align:middle line:84%
sheet, which would have
prevented any smell or contact

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.000 align:middle line:90%
between the termites.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.390 align:middle line:84%
So as if they were responding
to some invisible plan, which

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:15.710 align:middle line:84%
he thought was the mind,
the collective mind

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:16.510 align:middle line:90%
I would call it.

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:18.120 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: Could they walk
around the edge of the sheet?

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:18.780 align:middle line:90%
SHELDRAKE: No, they couldn't.

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.280 align:middle line:90%
It went right outside the nest.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.414 align:middle line:84%
The nest's here, and
the sheet's way outside.

00:16:22.414 --> 00:16:24.330 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: And they have to
stay inside the mound.

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:24.690 align:middle line:90%
SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:26.370 align:middle line:84%
They have to stay
inside the mound.

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:27.910 align:middle line:90%
They don't walk outside.

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:28.710 align:middle line:90%
DAVID: OK.

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:32.250 align:middle line:84%
SHELDRAKE: Termites are always
in tunnels or covered up.

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:34.630 align:middle line:84%
So my proposed experiment
was to repeat that.

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, that's
one of the experiments

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:39.000 align:middle line:90%
that hasn't been repeated.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.660 align:middle line:84%
I tried repeating it myself
when I was in Brazil.

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:44.250 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm probably
the only person

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:46.530 align:middle line:84%
in the world who regrets the
fact there aren't any termite's

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:47.430 align:middle line:90%
in Britain.

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:51.060 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:52.980 align:middle line:84%
So I happened to be
in Brazil for a while.

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:54.400 align:middle line:84%
So I did it with
termite's there.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.920 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately,
it was a species

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.080 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't repair
damage, or at least

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:02.400 align:middle line:84%
didn't repair it in this
experiment, a completely

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.410 align:middle line:84%
different species from
the one Marais worked

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:06.670 align:middle line:90%
with in South Africa.

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:09.980 align:middle line:84%
So that still remains
on the to-do list.

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And I can't do it
myself, because I

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.795 align:middle line:90%
don't live in the tropics.

00:17:14.795 --> 00:17:16.170 align:middle line:84%
But that's one of
the experiments

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:18.520 align:middle line:90%
that it could be done with ants.

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.510 align:middle line:84%
I also propose a similar
experiment with ants,

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:23.627 align:middle line:90%
hasn't been done yet.

00:17:23.627 --> 00:17:25.335 align:middle line:84%
There are many, many
possible experiments

00:17:25.335 --> 00:17:26.740 align:middle line:90%
that haven't been done yet.

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:28.680 align:middle line:90%
But that one was already done.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.300 align:middle line:84%
And what I was
proposing is simply

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.340 align:middle line:90%
a repeat of what Marais did.

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.710 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: This phantom limb
pain, is that similar

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:37.071 align:middle line:84%
to-- does that fit in
with your theories?

00:17:37.071 --> 00:17:38.070 align:middle line:90%
SHELDRAKE: It does, yes.

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:42.360 align:middle line:84%
You see, I think that the body
is shaped by invisible plans,

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.210 align:middle line:84%
the morphogenetic
fields, which themselves

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:48.370 align:middle line:84%
have a kind of memory
given by morphic resonance.

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:51.790 align:middle line:84%
Now normally, the field of
my arm and the physical arm

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:52.840 align:middle line:90%
are closely linked.

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.300 align:middle line:84%
When I move my arm around,
the field within and around it

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:58.030 align:middle line:84%
moves with it, like
when you have a magnet.

00:17:58.030 --> 00:17:59.200 align:middle line:90%
You move the magnet around.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.020 align:middle line:84%
The magnetic field is around
the magnets and in the magnet,

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.010 align:middle line:90%
it moves with the magnet.

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:08.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's hard to examine the
fields just by themselves,

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:11.380 align:middle line:84%
because they're always linked
with the physical body.

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:14.680 align:middle line:84%
Except when you have an
amputation of an arm or a leg,

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.870 align:middle line:84%
people have phantom
arms or legs.

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:middle line:10%
It feels as if the arm
or leg's still there.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.020 align:middle line:90%
They can move them around.

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:22.150 align:middle line:84%
They can even push them
through solid objects.

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:27.120 align:middle line:84%
But because they're phantoms,
they go through a solid object.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.870 align:middle line:84%
I think what they're
experiencing there is

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:31.670 align:middle line:90%
the field of the missing limb.

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:34.090 align:middle line:84%
Now in the case of
newts, if you cut the arm

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:37.840 align:middle line:84%
off a newt, or a
leg off a newt, it

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.790 align:middle line:90%
will regenerate a whole limb.

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
morphogenetic field is what's

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:43.994 align:middle line:90%
the basis of that process.

00:18:43.994 --> 00:18:45.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the humans, we
don't regenerate limbs,

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:50.410 align:middle line:84%
but I think the field is still
there, and people feel it.

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:52.240 align:middle line:84%
The standard
scientific explanation

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:56.590 align:middle line:84%
is that you experience all
your body inside your brain.

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:59.442 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying no, it's not all
inside the brain at all.

00:18:59.442 --> 00:19:01.525 align:middle line:84%
The field of the limb is
what you're experiencing.

00:19:01.525 --> 00:19:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And the phantom limb,
the field of the limb

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:05.980 align:middle line:90%
is right where it seems to be.

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:09.040 align:middle line:84%
So one of the experiments
I propose in the "Seven

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:12.820 align:middle line:84%
Experiments" book is to
see if you can detect

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:14.920 align:middle line:90%
the field of a missing limb.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And how we do this
experiment is we

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:21.100 align:middle line:84%
find people who have had
amputations of their arms.

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:24.190 align:middle line:84%
I was working with
ex-servicemen, former British

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:31.510 align:middle line:84%
soldiers who had lost limbs
in battle and had amputations.

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:35.240 align:middle line:84%
And we did it just in a
regular room with a doorway.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:40.060 align:middle line:84%
We mark out six regions on the
door, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, on both

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:40.880 align:middle line:90%
sides of the door.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.660 align:middle line:90%
So we've got six panels.

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And on one side of the
door, my research assistant

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:49.600 align:middle line:84%
throws a dice to get a random
number between 1 and 6,

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.190 align:middle line:90%
say it's number 2.

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Then we ask the amputee
to push his phantom arm

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:57.480 align:middle line:90%
through panel number 2.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.140 align:middle line:90%
So now, on this side--

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:00.360 align:middle line:90%
here's the door.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And on this side
of the door we've

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:05.110 align:middle line:84%
got a phantom limb sticking
through one of the panels--

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:08.630 align:middle line:84%
of course, it's invisible--
but not through the others.

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And then we recruited
people who say

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:14.950 align:middle line:84%
they're good at subtle
energy medicine or healing.

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And one by one, I
asked them in the room.

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:18.080 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.060 align:middle line:90%
Here's this door.

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:21.040 align:middle line:84%
Here are these six
zones, marked clearly

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:24.940 align:middle line:90%
on the door 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:28.370 align:middle line:84%
Please feel them or
do whatever you do,

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:32.020 align:middle line:84%
and tell me where you
think the phantom arm is.

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:33.020 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know myself.

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:33.820 align:middle line:90%
It was done blind.

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:36.430 align:middle line:84%
My assistant was the
other side of the door.

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And we found some
of these healers

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:41.050 align:middle line:84%
were right very much
higher than chance,

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:44.620 align:middle line:84%
highly significant
statistically.

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:49.200 align:middle line:84%
So they were somehow able
to feel this missing limb.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a really
interesting finding, you see.

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And the argument I
got from skeptics

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:59.250 align:middle line:84%
was, well, how do you know
it's not just telepathy?

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:02.154 align:middle line:84%
So-- well, actually,
if we've moved--

00:21:02.154 --> 00:21:03.070 align:middle line:90%
DAVID: Just telepathy.

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:04.695 align:middle line:84%
SHELDRAKE: If we've
moved on the debate

00:21:04.695 --> 00:21:08.710 align:middle line:84%
to the counter-argument being,
could it be just telepathy,

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:11.230 align:middle line:90%
then that's scientific progress.

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:14.230 align:middle line:84%
So to test for that, in a
new series of experiments--

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:15.430 align:middle line:90%
I haven't done this yet.

00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:19.000 align:middle line:84%
But to test for it, you could
have a control where they just

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.336 align:middle line:84%
imagine pushing their arm
through, instead of actually

00:21:21.336 --> 00:21:22.960 align:middle line:84%
pushing the phantom
arm through and see

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.480 align:middle line:90%
if people can pick that up.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:24.730 align:middle line:90%
DAVID: Right.

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:25.630 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:28.570 align:middle line:84%
SHELDRAKE: Anyway,
this is an experiment

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:32.200 align:middle line:84%
that I think if I worked in
subtle energy healing, which

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.969 align:middle line:84%
I don't, but if I did, I
think I'd really try and get

00:21:34.969 --> 00:21:37.510 align:middle line:84%
this experiment going on a much
larger scale, because I think

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:40.990 align:middle line:84%
it's a really good way of
looking at energy fields,

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:46.450 align:middle line:84%
the fields of the body,
because amputees do

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:48.310 align:middle line:84%
have this unique
situation of having

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:51.000 align:middle line:84%
the field of the missing
limb without the limb.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.830 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: Well, you've also
looked into a standard thing

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:57.220 align:middle line:84%
many people have experienced
where they come home

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:00.550 align:middle line:84%
and it's not a normal
time and their dog or cat

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:02.320 align:middle line:84%
is right there at
the door as soon

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.139 align:middle line:90%
as they walk up to the door.

00:22:04.139 --> 00:22:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And some people
would say, well, it's

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.138 align:middle line:84%
because the animal hears the
sound of the brakes of the car

00:22:08.138 --> 00:22:09.220 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:12.340 align:middle line:84%
So you looked into
this, and how did you

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:15.910 align:middle line:84%
study to see if
animals can figure out

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:17.956 align:middle line:90%
if people are coming home?

00:22:17.956 --> 00:22:20.580 align:middle line:84%
SHELDRAKE: Well, first of all,
I collected stories from people.

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:23.650 align:middle line:84%
I have a huge database
with more than 5,000 cases

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:25.420 align:middle line:84%
where people tell
me about things

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:29.260 align:middle line:84%
they've noticed with their dogs
or cats or parrots or horses.

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And we have hundreds
and hundreds of stories

00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:33.890 align:middle line:84%
from people saying
their dog or their cat

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:35.650 align:middle line:90%
knew when they were coming home.

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:39.380 align:middle line:84%
It's not usually where
the dog's just at the door

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:40.180 align:middle line:90%
when they arrive.

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:42.640 align:middle line:84%
It's when someone at home
who knows when they're

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:46.440 align:middle line:84%
coming who actually sees the dog
go to the door, sometimes half

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.500 align:middle line:90%
an hour before.

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:48.300 align:middle line:90%
DAVID: OK.

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.920 align:middle line:84%
So the dog starts waiting
in front of the door.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:50.370 align:middle line:90%
SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:51.420 align:middle line:90%
Waiting.

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And I have more than
50 stories from women

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:58.170 align:middle line:84%
who told me that their husbands
or partners work irregular

00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:02.130 align:middle line:84%
hours as plumbers, taxi
drivers, lawyers, etc.

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:04.620 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
regular routine hours.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And they would always
know when their man was

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.950 align:middle line:84%
on the way home, because the
dog would go and start waiting

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:14.150 align:middle line:84%
at the door often 15,
20 minutes in advance,

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:16.380 align:middle line:84%
so they'd get his
meal ready so when

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:18.390 align:middle line:84%
he arrived it'd be
hot on the table,

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:19.830 align:middle line:90%
because the dog had told them.

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:21.240 align:middle line:90%
DAVID: Wow.

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.907 align:middle line:84%
SHELDRAKE: That kind
of story is common.

00:23:22.907 --> 00:23:24.864 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: And it's not like
they come home at 5:30

00:23:24.864 --> 00:23:26.100 align:middle line:90%
and the dog senses the light.

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:26.500 align:middle line:90%
SHELDRAKE: No.

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:26.730 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:28.530 align:middle line:84%
Most of these stories
were non-routine.

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:30.120 align:middle line:84%
If it's a routine
time, most people

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:31.620 align:middle line:90%
assume it's just routine.

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:32.520 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't that.

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:33.320 align:middle line:90%
DAVID: Right.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.690 align:middle line:84%
SHELDRAKE: And also, we had
many, many cases where people

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:40.980 align:middle line:84%
came home by public transport,
bus or subway in New York

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.710 align:middle line:84%
or something like that,
where you'd get the subway's

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:45.130 align:middle line:90%
rumbling through all the time.

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:46.629 align:middle line:84%
There would be been
nothing specific

00:23:46.629 --> 00:23:49.230 align:middle line:84%
about a particular subway
train that would tell a dog

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:52.500 align:middle line:90%
when their owner was on it.

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And yet they do it
with public transport.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:58.950 align:middle line:84%
So what we did was
set up experiments

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:01.770 align:middle line:84%
where people go at least
five miles from home.

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:04.380 align:middle line:84%
We film the place the dog waits
the whole time they're out

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:07.092 align:middle line:84%
of the house with a
time-coded videotape.

00:24:07.092 --> 00:24:07.892 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:24:07.892 --> 00:24:08.540 align:middle line:10%
- And we've got to go back now.

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:09.840 align:middle line:10%
Right.

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:10.950 align:middle line:10%
So I've got to--

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:11.990 align:middle line:10%
- We have to get a taxi.

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.790 align:middle line:90%
- Right.

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:14.443 align:middle line:90%
- Where can we get a taxi?

00:24:14.443 --> 00:24:16.160 align:middle line:84%
- You know where we
were filming before?

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.525 align:middle line:10%
- Yeah.

00:24:17.525 --> 00:24:19.800 align:middle line:84%
- I noticed there was
a taxi right there,

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.362 align:middle line:84%
so we could knock
on the door there.

00:24:21.362 --> 00:24:22.162 align:middle line:90%
- Let's go.

00:24:22.162 --> 00:24:22.962 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:24:22.962 --> 00:24:25.500 align:middle line:10%
SHELDRAKE: They wait until
we pick a random time

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:29.380 align:middle line:10%
and tell them to come
home through a cell phone.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:32.280 align:middle line:10%
And to avoid familiar car
sounds, they come in a taxi

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:35.100 align:middle line:10%
or in another
unfamiliar vehicle.

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:38.120 align:middle line:10%
And then we can see if the
dog goes and starts waiting.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And the dogs I've
worked with most start

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.550 align:middle line:84%
waiting as soon as the
person decides to come home,

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:46.470 align:middle line:84%
even before they
got in the taxi.

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:49.980 align:middle line:84%
What they're responding to
is that person's intention.

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:53.550 align:middle line:84%
So now, we've got all this
on film, published papers

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:54.780 align:middle line:90%
in peer-reviewed journals.

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And I summarized this research
in my book "Dogs That Know

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:01.920 align:middle line:84%
When Their Owners
Are Coming Home."

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.290 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: One of the most
controversial things

00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:07.920 align:middle line:84%
you've ever done
is to apply this

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:11.670 align:middle line:84%
to an arena that
goes beyond biology.

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'd love to hear some
more specifics on this,

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:17.730 align:middle line:84%
because this gets into
the TED conspiracy

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:19.890 align:middle line:90%
and how they suppressed you.

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:26.730 align:middle line:84%
You have data showing that even
chemicals and the way chemicals

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:34.470 align:middle line:84%
react can somehow change by
how we work with the chemicals?

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:37.320 align:middle line:84%
SHELDRAKE: Well, that was
more of a morphic resonance

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.730 align:middle line:90%
phenomenon, the chemical one.

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:41.220 align:middle line:84%
It's about when we
crystallize new chemicals.

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:43.650 align:middle line:84%
If you make a new chemical
for the first time,

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:46.870 align:middle line:84%
it's very often hard to
get the crystals to form.

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:48.870 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as people
have made them in one lab,

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:51.550 align:middle line:84%
it gets easier all
round the world.

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:54.870 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: That should be just
a completely discrete,

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:57.040 align:middle line:90%
reactionary process, right?

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:59.790 align:middle line:84%
There should be a
very logical way

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:03.090 align:middle line:84%
to measure if you put
two reactants together

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:05.730 align:middle line:84%
and they have a
reaction, you're dealing

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:07.770 align:middle line:84%
with solid molecules
that should be

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:09.750 align:middle line:84%
able to interface
with each other

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:middle line:84%
and they make little
combinations and twists

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:15.790 align:middle line:84%
and turns, and there should be a
very steady speed that crystals

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:17.490 align:middle line:90%
would arise out of that medium.

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:18.450 align:middle line:90%
SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:20.190 align:middle line:90%
And yet that's not the case.

00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:24.750 align:middle line:84%
With new compounds, you
often wait weeks, months,

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:26.450 align:middle line:84%
sometimes years
before crystals form.

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:27.250 align:middle line:90%
DAVID: Really?

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:29.100 align:middle line:84%
SHELDRAKE: Once they've
formed in one lab,

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:30.475 align:middle line:84%
it's well known
to chemists, they

00:26:30.475 --> 00:26:34.470 align:middle line:84%
tend to get easier to form in
other labs around the world.

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Chemists usually
assume that this

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:38.400 align:middle line:84%
is because fragments
of previous crystals

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.380 align:middle line:84%
get carried from lab
to lab, sometimes

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:42.810 align:middle line:84%
on the clothing of
migrant chemists,

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:45.670 align:middle line:84%
sometimes as invisible dust
particles in the atmosphere.

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:46.470 align:middle line:90%
DAVID: Sure.

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:49.830 align:middle line:84%
SHELDRAKE: And of course,
one phenomenon for this

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:52.350 align:middle line:84%
could be people learning
how to do it better.

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:56.010 align:middle line:84%
That's a kind of standard
explanation for the phenomenon.

00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:58.560 align:middle line:84%
But it also happens
with unwanted chemicals.

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:01.200 align:middle line:90%


00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:04.920 align:middle line:84%
When the first anti-AIDS
drugs were made,

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:07.650 align:middle line:84%
one of the components
was ritonavir.

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:10.200 align:middle line:84%
It's a chemical
in the AIDS drug.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.660 align:middle line:84%
It was made by
Abbott Laboratories.

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:15.540 align:middle line:10%
And they'd been in
production for a few years.

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:17.250 align:middle line:10%
Everything was going smoothly.

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And then a new kind of
crystal of ritonavir

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:21.960 align:middle line:90%
turned up in one factory.

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.642 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, it was
like a new fashion.

00:27:24.642 --> 00:27:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, these crystals
were everywhere.

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:28.560 align:middle line:10%
They couldn't get back
the original form.

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:31.260 align:middle line:84%
It was like this new
kind come into existence,

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:35.320 align:middle line:84%
and now that somehow
came to predominate.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And they were
certainly not trying

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:38.087 align:middle line:90%
to tell people how to make this.

00:27:38.087 --> 00:27:39.920 align:middle line:84%
They were desperately
trying not to make it.

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.210 align:middle line:84%
They had to pull this
drug off the market,

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:44.280 align:middle line:84%
because it had a
different solubility.

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.740 align:middle line:90%
They lost billions of dollars.

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And they had to reformulate
their whole drug

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.870 align:middle line:90%
using the new--

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:54.210 align:middle line:84%
they had to actually
sell it in a liquid form,

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:58.530 align:middle line:84%
because they couldn't get
back the original drug.

00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:01.580 align:middle line:84%
So these are called
crystal polymorphs,

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:05.710 align:middle line:84%
or polymorphic crystals,
ones with different shapes.

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:08.850 align:middle line:84%
This is a major concern
in the chemical industry.

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:12.660 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: Crystal polymorph
just means a crystal that

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:14.230 align:middle line:90%
has a very complex structure?

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:15.030 align:middle line:90%
SHELDRAKE: No.

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:16.850 align:middle line:84%
It means where you
have alternative forms.

00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:19.650 align:middle line:84%
So a common example
is with carbon.

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:22.000 align:middle line:84%
It can exist in the
form of diamond--

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.700 align:middle line:90%
that's a carbon crystal--

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:27.360 align:middle line:84%
or in graphite,
like in pencil lead.

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And those are both
crystals of carbon,

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:31.400 align:middle line:90%
but they have different shapes.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:34.380 align:middle line:90%
And so they're polymorphs.

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.260 align:middle line:84%
So with a lot of complex
organic chemicals,

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.930 align:middle line:84%
they can crystallize one
way and sometimes they

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:41.610 align:middle line:90%
can crystallize another way.

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And the cases I'm talking
about, where they first

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:48.540 align:middle line:84%
knew one kind of crystal,
then another kind pops up.

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:51.059 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: So they had an existing
workflow, where you put

00:28:51.059 --> 00:28:52.350 align:middle line:90%
these two ingredients together.

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:53.320 align:middle line:90%
You do it this way.

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.770 align:middle line:84%
You get this chemical
as the result.

00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, it starts doing

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:00.780 align:middle line:90%
a different type of crystal.

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And that actually took
over all the systems?

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:03.420 align:middle line:90%
SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:04.500 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:06.090 align:middle line:84%
There's several
examples of that.

00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:08.870 align:middle line:84%
I describe them in my
book "Morphic Resonance."

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And these are well known
in the chemical industry.

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, in drug companies,
they pay a lot of attention

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:17.850 align:middle line:84%
to this, because it has huge
commercial consequences.

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:20.130 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: Is there
any way you could

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:22.230 align:middle line:90%
standardize some categories?

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:24.180 align:middle line:84%
Like, does it work with
acids but not bases?

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:24.990 align:middle line:90%
Is it pH level?

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:25.440 align:middle line:90%
SHELDRAKE: No.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.240 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.810 align:middle line:10%
It works it seems--

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:30.060 align:middle line:10%
they've tried-- they've
gone to enormous lengths

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:32.940 align:middle line:10%
to try and get back the
original forms if that

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:35.610 align:middle line:10%
was part of the original
drug formulation.

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:39.300 align:middle line:90%
And there's no simple answer.

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:42.660 align:middle line:10%
You know, chemists themselves
who work with crystals

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:46.310 align:middle line:10%
find this all rather
baffling, the way

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:48.840 align:middle line:10%
once something
changes it happens

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.650 align:middle line:10%
in other parts of the world.

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:52.980 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's a morphic
resonance phenomenon.

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:54.420 align:middle line:84%
I think morphic
resonance applies

00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:58.800 align:middle line:84%
not just to living organisms,
animals and plants and people,

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.780 align:middle line:84%
but also to chemicals,
to crystals.

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:03.320 align:middle line:90%


00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:05.600 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: What we just learned
here about chemicals

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.790 align:middle line:84%
is really groundbreaking
information for me

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:12.650 align:middle line:84%
as well, because I've had
lots and lots of data talking

00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:14.750 align:middle line:84%
about this concept
of morphic resonance,

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:17.060 align:middle line:84%
the idea of a
shared consciousness

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:19.830 align:middle line:90%
amongst living things.

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:23.880 align:middle line:84%
But actually for me, this was so
groundbreaking to have the man

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:26.730 align:middle line:84%
himself there in
front of me on camera

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:30.510 align:middle line:84%
and have a dialog showing that
these same principles extend

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:33.630 align:middle line:84%
directly into
physical matter itself

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:36.660 align:middle line:84%
that we normally would
think of as inanimate.

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:39.540 align:middle line:84%
Rupert Sheldrake is really
doing an amazing job here,

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:41.830 align:middle line:90%
but we are definitely not done.

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:44.070 align:middle line:84%
There's much, much
more to discuss

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:47.490 align:middle line:84%
coming up in the next
episode, including

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:49.650 align:middle line:90%
something very interesting.

00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:53.430 align:middle line:84%
Rupert Sheldrake has
exposed the skeptics.

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:57.340 align:middle line:84%
As it turns out, the skeptics
are part of an organized crime

00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:58.140 align:middle line:90%
ring.

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:00.270 align:middle line:90%
They are not random people.

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And so in the next
episode, we're

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:04.110 align:middle line:84%
going to hear
about how there are

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:06.960 align:middle line:84%
skeptic groups in
which they tell you

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.880 align:middle line:84%
you don't need to know anything
about the subject at all.

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:13.440 align:middle line:84%
All you do is act very confident
and say that the science has

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:14.970 align:middle line:90%
been discredited.

00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And so Rupert Sheldrake
has built a website

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:19.020 align:middle line:84%
called Skeptical
About Skeptics, where

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:21.180 align:middle line:84%
he is blowing the
whistle on these people

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:25.120 align:middle line:84%
and exposing the ones who are
giving you the disinformation.

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.570 align:middle line:84%
This is all part of
the disclosure process.

00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:30.360 align:middle line:84%
We need to know that
we've been lied to,

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:34.450 align:middle line:84%
and we need to understand
what's really going on.

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:37.050 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to join me
next time on Disclosure,

00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:41.190 align:middle line:84%
speaking truth to power and
giving power to the truth.

00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:44.540 align:middle line:90%
