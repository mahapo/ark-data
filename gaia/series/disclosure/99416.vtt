>>DAVID WILCOCK:
I'm David Wilcock,

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.340 align:middle line:90%
and welcome to "Disclosure."

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.190 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we have a
very intriguing interview

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.400 align:middle line:10%
with Graham Hancock that
is also very controversial.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.860 align:middle line:10%
Graham Hancock, of course,
is the award-winning author

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.130 align:middle line:10%
of "The Fingerprints of the
Gods," "Sign and the Seal,"

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.200 align:middle line:10%
many other books that we
discussed throughout the time

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.310 align:middle line:10%
that I have interviewed
him for our program.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.680 align:middle line:10%
And in this episode, we get into
some of the most controversial

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.570 align:middle line:10%
material of all.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.530 align:middle line:84%
For starters, we begin talking
about DMT and the pineal gland,

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.340 align:middle line:84%
and that's controversial
enough in and of itself

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.620 align:middle line:84%
because there seems to be a
very intrinsic fear of any usage

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.300 align:middle line:90%
of psychedelics in our society.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.470 align:middle line:84%
But part of that might be that
if you did decide to use them,

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.630 align:middle line:84%
you start to see reality
in a different way.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.310 align:middle line:84%
You may even see that reality
is like a grocery store,

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.440 align:middle line:84%
and what everybody believes
to be absolute truth is simply

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.470 align:middle line:84%
one choice that's available
to you on the shelves.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And there are other
choices that we're not

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.430 align:middle line:84%
usually aware of
that are in some ways

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.060 align:middle line:84%
equally as real and as palpable
as what we now know to be true.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.010 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
controversial things

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.330 align:middle line:84%
that Graham says in
this episode is the idea

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.380 align:middle line:84%
that the Father God-- Yahweh
in the Old Testament--

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.650 align:middle line:84%
is in fact a negative entity
masquerading as positive.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.880 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly what it says
in the Law of One series, which

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.150 align:middle line:84%
is the philosophical basis of
all the work that I've done.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And it was quite surprising to
hear Graham so confidently come

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.060 align:middle line:84%
out with the same thing
based upon actually

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.759 align:middle line:84%
reading what Yahweh says
in the Old Testament

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.490 align:middle line:90%
and what he wants.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.890 align:middle line:90%
Yahweh is a nasty entity.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.660 align:middle line:90%
That's Graham's point.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.740 align:middle line:84%
It's very uncomfortable
because we've

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.450 align:middle line:84%
been taught to believe
in the institutions

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.010 align:middle line:84%
and trust that everything that
the Bible says must be correct

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.380 align:middle line:84%
and it must be good,
when in fact Yahweh

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.300 align:middle line:84%
says he's a jealous god,
he's a vengeful god,

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.060 align:middle line:84%
he asks people to commit
murders in his name,

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.190 align:middle line:84%
he's asking that all the
firstborn be murdered.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.230 align:middle line:84%
There's some really, really
nasty stuff with Yahweh.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And the Law of One says
that the original Yahweh was

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.390 align:middle line:84%
a positive entity,
and that contact

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.010 align:middle line:84%
occurred before most of the
books of the Old Testament

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.970 align:middle line:90%
were written.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And then that entity
during the time of Moses

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.190 align:middle line:84%
got replaced by a
negative entity.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
this happened was

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.670 align:middle line:84%
that Moses was
doing psychic parlor

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.380 align:middle line:84%
tricks for everybody who asked
him to show them a miracle.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of this and
other moral and ethical lapses,

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.930 align:middle line:84%
Moses ended up making
contact with the wrong side

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.480 align:middle line:84%
of the fence, and
he had to be allowed

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.830 align:middle line:84%
to do that because of the
way the game is played.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.970 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, Moses
accrued great karma

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.070 align:middle line:84%
by bringing in such things as
the Ten Commandments, which

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.350 align:middle line:84%
say, thou shalt not do this
or thou shalt not do that.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.760 align:middle line:84%
That is actually the actions
of a negative entity.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.140 align:middle line:84%
A positive entity is going
to say, if you do this,

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.350 align:middle line:90%
then this will happen.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.710 align:middle line:84%
If you do that, then
that will happen.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.600 align:middle line:84%
Another key teaching
that has been suppressed

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.140 align:middle line:84%
by the Roman government that
put together the New Testament

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.620 align:middle line:90%
is reincarnation.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going to
discuss in this episode

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.720 align:middle line:84%
how reincarnation
leads to this idea

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.150 align:middle line:84%
that you have to
pay for what you

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.600 align:middle line:84%
do in later lifetimes, which
means people would be less

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.460 align:middle line:84%
likely to support the actions
of a totalitarian government

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.090 align:middle line:84%
that encourages them
to go and kill people

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.450 align:middle line:84%
if they were to find out that
any atrocities they commit

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.450 align:middle line:84%
are things they're going to have
to pay for in later lifetimes.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.260 align:middle line:84%
So there's this and
a whole lot more

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.300 align:middle line:84%
coming up in this
episode of "Disclosure"

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.060 align:middle line:90%
with Graham Hancock.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.680 align:middle line:90%
Check it out.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.390 align:middle line:84%
So these metaphysical
entities are showing up all

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.760 align:middle line:90%
over the world.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And people are, in
your theory, seeing

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.000 align:middle line:84%
something that's
real but maybe just

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.990 align:middle line:90%
on a different layer of reality.

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.073 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM HANCOCK: Exactly.

00:04:34.073 --> 00:04:35.850 align:middle line:90%


00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.210 align:middle line:10%
Consciousness is
the key, and that

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.380 align:middle line:10%
what we need to function day
to day in the material world

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.770 align:middle line:10%
is what I call the
alert problem solving

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.460 align:middle line:10%
state of consciousness--
which is a very

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.050 align:middle line:10%
good state of consciousness.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.920 align:middle line:10%
And you know, when I
get in an airplane,

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.760 align:middle line:10%
I would like my pilot to be
in an alert problem solving

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.770 align:middle line:10%
state of consciousness.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.750 align:middle line:84%
It has its place, but it's not
the only state of consciousness

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.300 align:middle line:84%
that we human beings
are capable of.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's possible to
radically alter consciousness.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And shamans down the
ages have developed

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.170 align:middle line:90%
a whole range of techniques.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.530 align:middle line:10%
Quite a number of them involve
visionary plants and substances

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.990 align:middle line:10%
like DMT, which is the active
ingredient of ayahuasca

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.390 align:middle line:10%
or psilocybin mushrooms used
in shamanistic ceremonies

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.940 align:middle line:10%
all around the world.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.785 align:middle line:10%
Other techniques don't
involve plant agencies.

00:05:27.785 --> 00:05:31.530 align:middle line:10%
They involve rhythmic drumming,
certain forms of dance.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.320 align:middle line:84%
The Kalahari Bushmen dance
around a fire for 24 hours

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.650 align:middle line:84%
till they sense their
spirits leaving their bodies.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.460 align:middle line:84%
The point is however
you get there

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.590 align:middle line:84%
that in order to encounter these
entities directly and easily

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.320 align:middle line:84%
and pretty much on
call is you have

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.100 align:middle line:84%
to get into an altered state of
consciousness, a trance state.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Our body does
make DMT itself, right?

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Our body makes DMT.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And medical science has not
been able to explain why.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.140 align:middle line:84%
The evidence is honing
in more and more that DMT

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.560 align:middle line:90%
is made in the pineal gland.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.772 align:middle line:90%
This was a theory a decade ago.

00:06:10.772 --> 00:06:12.230 align:middle line:84%
Rick Strassman was
the first person

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.830 align:middle line:84%
to propose-- he's a psychiatrist
at the University of New

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.860 align:middle line:84%
Mexico-- was the first
person to propose that DMT

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.980 align:middle line:90%
is made in the pineal gland.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.660 align:middle line:84%
New research done by the
Cottonwood Foundation

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.040 align:middle line:84%
in New Mexico has
increasingly confirmed that.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.340 align:middle line:84%
They found, for example, DMT
in the pineal glands of rats.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And the next-- it's not
a big jump from there

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.040 align:middle line:84%
to say that's likely where it's
made in human beings as well.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And the pineal
gland is, of course,

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.160 align:middle line:90%
a very interesting gland.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.670 align:middle line:90%
It's the third eye.

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:45.790 align:middle line:84%
In evolutionary,
more simple animals,

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.770 align:middle line:84%
it actually has a lens,
a cornea, and a retina.

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.180 align:middle line:84%
In human beings, it's descended
deeper into the brain.

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.980 align:middle line:84%
It's not reactive to light
anymore in the way that it was.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.380 align:middle line:84%
But maybe what
it's doing-- maybe

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.400 align:middle line:84%
DMT is the lens of
our pineal gland,

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:08.190 align:middle line:84%
allowing us to see
wider areas of reality

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.800 align:middle line:84%
than are normally
accessible to our senses.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.570 align:middle line:84%
This is where we have
to challenge the model

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:17.280 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness is simply
an artifact of the brain,

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.810 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness is simply
made by the brain the way

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:21.850 align:middle line:90%
a generator makes electricity.

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:25.095 align:middle line:84%
Equally possible is that the
relationship between the brain

00:07:25.095 --> 00:07:28.180 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness is more like
the relationship between a TV

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.790 align:middle line:90%
signal and a TV set.

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.481 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing we
can do-- I'm not

00:07:32.481 --> 00:07:33.730 align:middle line:90%
saying that that's what it is.

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm using that as an analogy
to suggest that consciousness

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.040 align:middle line:84%
may not actually be manufactured
by the brain, just in the way

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.430 align:middle line:84%
that the TV signal is not
manufactured by the TV set.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:46.620 align:middle line:84%
But the TV signal manifests--
the TV set allows that signal

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.760 align:middle line:84%
to manifest in the picture and
sound and so on and so forth.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.440 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's what
consciousness is.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.910 align:middle line:84%
It's a signal which our
brains are transceiving.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, if that
were the case, then

00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.800 align:middle line:84%
it would be possible
to alter the receiver

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.620 align:middle line:90%
wavelength of the brain.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, all
kind of channels

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.010 align:middle line:84%
that you couldn't
pick up when you're

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:09.870 align:middle line:84%
tuned into channel normal
would become accessible to you.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And those channels
would be equally real.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
suggestion of what

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.860 align:middle line:84%
is going on with altered
states of consciousness,

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.840 align:middle line:84%
that these visions which are
astonishingly trans-personal

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.770 align:middle line:84%
and universal and which are
documented in rock and cave art

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.540 align:middle line:84%
all around the world,
that these visions are

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.240 align:middle line:84%
encounters with
intelligent entities

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.200 align:middle line:90%
at other levels of reality.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not denying
the possibility

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:34.850 align:middle line:84%
that we may encounter
those intelligent entities

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:36.799 align:middle line:90%
in physical forms as well.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:41.309 align:middle line:84%
But one way to encounter
them regularly and reliably

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:44.510 align:middle line:84%
and to communicate
with them is to develop

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:46.790 align:middle line:84%
our science of altered
states of consciousness

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:47.540 align:middle line:90%
to a higher level.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:48.956 align:middle line:84%
We've been very
resistant to that.

00:08:48.956 --> 00:08:51.490 align:middle line:84%
The war on drugs
has made us very

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:54.640 align:middle line:84%
reactive to the idea of
altering consciousness at all.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.230 align:middle line:84%
But it may be
exactly what we need

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:58.460 align:middle line:84%
to do if we're
going to penetrate

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.860 align:middle line:90%
the mysteries of existence.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So let's look at
this, just for a second.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.860 align:middle line:90%
DMT is made by the body.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:08.670 align:middle line:84%
It's in the pineal
gland very likely.

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.500 align:middle line:84%
It's just a few chemical
notches away from melatonin,

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.805 align:middle line:84%
and we know the pineal
gland is making melatonin.

00:09:13.805 --> 00:09:17.120 align:middle line:90%


00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.250 align:middle line:84%
Most conventional
scientists would

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:22.630 align:middle line:84%
say that if you take DMT or
a DMT-like substance that

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:25.945 align:middle line:84%
releases that, that the
hallucinations are just

00:09:25.945 --> 00:09:26.875 align:middle line:90%
this brain garbage.

00:09:26.875 --> 00:09:28.410 align:middle line:90%
It's just static.

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:29.307 align:middle line:90%
It's not useful.

00:09:29.307 --> 00:09:30.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: That's what they say.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's based on their
model, which is not a fact.

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.380 align:middle line:84%
It's based on their
reference frame

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.830 align:middle line:84%
that the brain is
making consciousness.

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:41.792 align:middle line:84%
But the moment you realize that
that is a reference frame--

00:09:41.792 --> 00:09:44.250 align:middle line:84%
that's not a scientifically
established fact that the brain

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.250 align:middle line:90%
is making consciousness.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, there are
many pieces of evidence

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:49.320 align:middle line:90%
which challenge that fact.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.780 align:middle line:84%
For example, the out-of-body
experience or the near-death

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:57.030 align:middle line:84%
experience-- if we're
flat line on the ECG

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:59.090 align:middle line:84%
and we're still
having experiences,

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:01.800 align:middle line:84%
then for sure the brain is
not making our consciousness.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.980 align:middle line:84%
Our consciousness is
not local to the brain.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.360 align:middle line:84%
It's in some way manifesting
through the brain.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And the existing materialistic
model of brain activity

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:12.570 align:middle line:84%
doesn't do that, which seeks to
reduce these experiences simply

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.930 align:middle line:90%
to disturb brain activity.

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:16.890 align:middle line:84%
I think we have to stay
open to the possibility

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.660 align:middle line:84%
that something else much
more mysterious is going on

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.820 align:middle line:84%
and that shamans, for tens
of thousands of years,

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:26.420 align:middle line:84%
have known this and have
known the ways and the means

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:29.150 align:middle line:84%
to contact those
intelligences beyond.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.520 align:middle line:84%
And then of course we
come into the next issue.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.610 align:middle line:84%
If those intelligences are
real in some way, if they exist

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:40.050 align:middle line:84%
in freestanding other
dimensions or levels of reality

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:42.810 align:middle line:84%
that we can access through
changing our consciousness,

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:45.450 align:middle line:84%
what is it they want
with us, these beings?

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:49.250 align:middle line:84%
What are they doing
with the human race?

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:52.760 align:middle line:84%
Why have they been present
with us for so long?

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.860 align:middle line:84%
Do they have our best
interests at heart?

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that some of
them have our best interests

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.660 align:middle line:90%
at heart and others don't?

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:00.660 align:middle line:90%
It was very interesting.

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:04.870 align:middle line:84%
When Rick Strassman's volunteers
at the University of New Mexico

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:09.040 align:middle line:84%
were given intravenous
doses of dimethyltryptamine

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.940 align:middle line:84%
and sent on that rocket ship
to the other side of reality

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:16.030 align:middle line:84%
that dimethyltryptamine will
do for you, quite a lot of them

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:20.830 align:middle line:84%
encountered entities who
basically said, hi, guys.

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:24.200 align:middle line:84%
We're so glad you've
discovered this technology.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Now we can communicate
with you more easily.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:29.935 align:middle line:84%
That actually sends shivers
down my spine a little bit.

00:11:29.935 --> 00:11:33.740 align:middle line:84%
It's a very, very strange thing
that more than one volunteer

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:35.450 align:middle line:90%
had that experience.

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And again, it
challenges the notion

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.890 align:middle line:84%
that these are simply
artifacts of the brain.

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:42.264 align:middle line:84%
Maybe by reaching the receiver
wavelength of the brain,

00:11:42.264 --> 00:11:44.180 align:middle line:84%
we're making contact
with other intelligences.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And then, see,
shamans have always

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.540 align:middle line:84%
sought to master and
manage those influences.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:53.530 align:middle line:84%
From the shamanic point of
view, whether we like it or not,

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:58.670 align:middle line:84%
we are influenced by
intelligences that are normally

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:00.340 align:middle line:90%
invisible to our senses.

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And what they seek to
do by entering trance

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:05.880 align:middle line:84%
is to negotiate and deal
with those intelligences.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And shamans recognize that
some of those intelligences

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:12.770 align:middle line:84%
are nurturing and positive for
us and seek the best for us.

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are profoundly
negative and dangerous

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:17.140 align:middle line:90%
to humanity.

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:21.325 align:middle line:84%
And better that we recognize
the existence of those entities

00:12:21.325 --> 00:12:24.505 align:middle line:84%
and deal with them rather than
stick our heads in the sand

00:12:24.505 --> 00:12:26.040 align:middle line:90%
and pretend they don't exist.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well,
you basically saw,

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.074 align:middle line:84%
like, a whole movie
when you took DMT.

00:12:30.074 --> 00:12:30.740 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah.

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:34.120 align:middle line:84%
My work with ayahuasca, where
the active ingredient is DMT--

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.600 align:middle line:84%
I've also smoked
DMT in the pure form

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.600 align:middle line:84%
and had extraordinary
experiences with that.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.270 align:middle line:84%
But with ayahuasca, DMT
is the active ingredient.

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:46.290 align:middle line:84%
Ayahuasca is the vine of souls--
the ancient shamanistic brew

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:47.790 align:middle line:84%
of the Amazon which
we know has been

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:50.172 align:middle line:84%
used by peoples in the
Amazon for thousands

00:12:50.172 --> 00:12:51.130 align:middle line:90%
and thousands of years.

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:54.180 align:middle line:84%
Archaeological evidence traces
it back at least 4,000 years

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:57.780 align:middle line:84%
with the specific purpose of
making contact with the spirit

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:01.430 align:middle line:84%
world to bring healing
influences down

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:04.640 align:middle line:84%
to the human plane to
receive inspiration.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.530 align:middle line:84%
Many of the shamans
are painters.

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:09.780 align:middle line:84%
What I received in a series of
ayahuasca sessions in Brazil

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:14.260 align:middle line:84%
back in 2006 or 2007 was
the-- I'm not a painter.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.800 align:middle line:84%
So didn't get
inspiration for painting.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.880 align:middle line:84%
But I got inspiration
to write a novel.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.365 align:middle line:84%
And that normal was my first
novel, called "Entangled."

00:13:22.365 --> 00:13:23.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe
that I would have

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.790 align:middle line:84%
had that creative
impulse if I had not

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:28.280 align:middle line:90%
had that ayahuasca experience.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It's really
amazing to see

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:34.820 align:middle line:84%
such a prolific documentarian,
nonfiction author who's

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:41.670 align:middle line:84%
all about facts, that your
maiden voyage into fiction,

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.670 align:middle line:84%
it just crackles like
a Michener novel.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:49.099 align:middle line:84%
It's like you had the chops
right out the starting gate.

00:13:49.099 --> 00:13:49.640 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.090 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah.

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:53.350 align:middle line:90%
I was given a story.

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And I'd been honing--
I suppose the one

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.430 align:middle line:90%
thing I do is narrative.

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:01.530 align:middle line:90%
I have narrative skills.

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And those narrative skills
I was able to bring to bear

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.910 align:middle line:90%
on the writing of the novel.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:07.970 align:middle line:10%
And "Entangled"
is my first novel,

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:13.180 align:middle line:10%
but subsequently I've
written the first two volumes

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.060 align:middle line:10%
of a trilogy of novels
called "War God," which

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.730 align:middle line:10%
is about the Spanish
conquest of Mexico.

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:20.850 align:middle line:10%
And what is at
the heart, what is

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:25.230 align:middle line:10%
in common between "Entangled"
and the "War God" series

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:28.080 align:middle line:10%
is the notion that
spiritual forces are

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:31.980 align:middle line:10%
at work behind history,
that these entities that

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:34.540 align:middle line:10%
are encountered in altered
states of consciousness

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:38.380 align:middle line:10%
are indeed very real
and that some of them

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.910 align:middle line:10%
work for the benefit of
mankind, and some of them

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:43.160 align:middle line:10%
work to deviate
us from our path.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Our path is the path
of spiritual ascension,

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:48.130 align:middle line:84%
that we are here
to learn and grow

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:50.330 align:middle line:90%
and to become beings of light.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.410 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
meant to do here.

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:57.010 align:middle line:84%
But there are dark, malign,
and maleficent entities

00:14:57.010 --> 00:15:00.020 align:middle line:84%
in the beyond who seek to
block us and prevent us

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:02.030 align:middle line:90%
from achieving that path.

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:04.144 align:middle line:84%
And so in "War
God," for example--

00:15:04.144 --> 00:15:06.560 align:middle line:84%
the first volume is called
"War God: Nights of the Witch."

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:11.640 align:middle line:84%
The second volume,
published October 2014

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:15.230 align:middle line:84%
is called "War God: Return
of the Plumed Serpent."

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:19.860 align:middle line:84%
In "War God," Moctezuma,
the Aztec emperor,

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:24.320 align:middle line:84%
encounters regularly the
entity that the Aztecs called

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.304 align:middle line:84%
hummingbird,
Huitzilopochtli-- the

00:15:26.304 --> 00:15:27.970 align:middle line:84%
hummingbird at the
left hand of the sun.

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:30.850 align:middle line:90%
He was their god of war.

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And he is constantly-- and this
is not something I'm making up.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.400 align:middle line:84%
The historical
documents are clear

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:41.950 align:middle line:84%
that Moctezuma felt himself to
be in contact with this entity

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:44.970 align:middle line:84%
who is demonic in every
aspect of his behavior

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:47.010 align:middle line:84%
and who urges and
encourages Moctezuma

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:50.270 align:middle line:84%
to ever more horrific
acts of human sacrifice

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:54.200 align:middle line:84%
and mass, mass murder
of subject populations.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
Cortes, Hernan Cortes,

00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:00.860 align:middle line:84%
the conquistador, in dreams
is encountering an entity

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:03.070 align:middle line:84%
that he construes
as Saint Peter.

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is based
on historical facts.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:08.536 align:middle line:84%
And Cortes felt he had a special
relationship with Saint Peter

00:16:08.536 --> 00:16:09.640 align:middle line:90%
since his childhood.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm
suggesting in the novel

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:14.530 align:middle line:84%
is that actually
the same demon who

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:18.120 align:middle line:84%
appears to Moctezuma
as the war god takes

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.400 align:middle line:84%
on the disguise of Saint Peter
and appears to Cortes as Saint

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Peter and plays these
two men like puppets

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:28.910 align:middle line:84%
to maximize human misery
in the land of Mexico.

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And that event is
the Spanish conquest

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.980 align:middle line:84%
of Mexico, which changed the
whole story of the world.

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And almost every negative thing
in international relations--

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.880 align:middle line:84%
whether it was Colonialism,
whether it was slavery--

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.335 align:middle line:84%
followed from those events of
the Spanish conquest of Mexico.

00:16:45.335 --> 00:16:48.520 align:middle line:84%
If Moctezuma had been a
different kind of character,

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.210 align:middle line:84%
if he had behaved in a
loving and positive way

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:52.760 align:middle line:84%
towards his neighbors,
if he had not

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.150 align:middle line:84%
been hated by his
neighbors, Cortes

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:58.900 align:middle line:84%
would never have succeeded
in overthrowing him.

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:01.300 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm
suggesting is that we

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.430 align:middle line:84%
need to look for the spiritual
forces at work behind history,

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:07.184 align:middle line:84%
not dismiss those as fantasies
or figments of the imagination,

00:17:07.184 --> 00:17:09.920 align:middle line:84%
but understand that
we are being played

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.119 align:middle line:84%
by vastly intelligent
and dangerous beings

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:16.530 align:middle line:84%
and that what we have
to do is to nurture

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:20.740 align:middle line:84%
the light within ourselves
and to manifest and grow that.

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And every minute of every
day, we human beings

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:25.100 align:middle line:90%
are confronted by choices.

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:27.599 align:middle line:84%
And those choices are always
choices between dark and light.

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:31.380 align:middle line:84%
They may be very small scale,
or they may be very large scale,

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:32.590 align:middle line:90%
but there are always choices.

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:35.210 align:middle line:84%
We have to be careful
to choose the light

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.730 align:middle line:84%
and to resist the
temptation of the dark side.

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's this that I'm
exploring in my novels.

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that
fiction is a better way

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.460 align:middle line:84%
to explore those
extraordinary ideas, that you

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:49.120 align:middle line:84%
can get inside the heads
of characters in a way

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:51.130 align:middle line:90%
that you can't in nonfiction.

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:52.760 align:middle line:84%
It's not that I've
given up nonfiction.

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:55.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm still very much a
writer of nonfiction.

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:59.650 align:middle line:84%
But I'm enjoying this
exploration of the novel

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:03.070 align:middle line:84%
as a means of putting
extraordinary ideas wrapped up

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:06.090 align:middle line:84%
in fast-moving stories in
front of my readers as well.

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, there's
a common shamanic belief

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:12.420 align:middle line:84%
that there are these
negative entities.

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:14.830 align:middle line:90%
And in Gnosticism and--

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:19.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Gnosticism is such
an important area of study.

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And I first got
into Gnosticism back

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.962 align:middle line:84%
in the '90s when I wrote
my half of a book that's

00:18:25.962 --> 00:18:27.170 align:middle line:90%
now called "The Master Game."

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.180 align:middle line:84%
It was originally
titled "Talisman."

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:31.240 align:middle line:90%
My coauthor was Robert Bauval.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.760 align:middle line:10%
And I focused very much on
Gnosticism in that book.

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:40.030 align:middle line:10%
And Gnosticism is an
astonishing antidote

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:43.380 align:middle line:10%
to the mental
conditioning that we

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:47.550 align:middle line:10%
have been subjected to in
world society for hundreds

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:49.440 align:middle line:10%
and hundreds of years.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And Gnosticism is very
disturbing to read.

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:56.530 align:middle line:84%
If you go back-- you
see, for a long time

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:58.960 align:middle line:84%
we only knew about
the Gnostic ideas

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:03.300 align:middle line:84%
from the Christians who
had persecuted them.

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.210 align:middle line:84%
The Gnostics were
amongst the first people

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:08.576 align:middle line:84%
to be burned at the stake
back 400 years after Christ.

00:19:08.576 --> 00:19:10.992 align:middle line:84%
It was Christians who were
doing that persecution.

00:19:10.992 --> 00:19:12.200 align:middle line:90%
And then they said, this is--

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: On behalf of
the Roman government.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: On behalf of
the Roman government.

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:17.050 align:middle line:84%
Because that's when
Christianity, in my opinion,

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:20.910 align:middle line:84%
took the wrong path, when it
pulled on the jackboot of Rome

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:25.010 align:middle line:84%
and became the religion
of the Roman state,

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:27.030 align:middle line:84%
the single most
terrifying militaristic

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:30.320 align:middle line:84%
state that's ever been
known in human history.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.375 align:middle line:84%
Christianity became the
religion of that state.

00:19:33.375 --> 00:19:35.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It's
imperial Christianity.

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Imperial
Christianity.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And the first people
they started to persecute

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:43.040 align:middle line:84%
were the Gnostics, because the
Gnostics-- and this is an idea

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.130 align:middle line:84%
that many who are
committed to Christianity

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:47.810 align:middle line:84%
will find repulsive or
very difficult to accept.

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:50.300 align:middle line:84%
The Gnostics said that
the entity that we

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:54.090 align:middle line:84%
call God-- Jehovah, as he
is in the Old Testament,

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:56.880 align:middle line:84%
the Muslims call him Allah,
it's the same entity, the God

00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:02.480 align:middle line:84%
of Abraham-- that this entity--
the God of Judaism as well,

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.790 align:middle line:84%
of course, Jehovah, God
of Judaism, Christianity,

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:07.830 align:middle line:84%
and Islam, goes by
different names,

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:10.730 align:middle line:84%
he's the same entity-- that
this entity isn't a god at all

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:12.050 align:middle line:90%
from the Gnostic point of view.

00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:15.740 align:middle line:84%
From the Gnostic point of view,
the simple word to describe him

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:17.120 align:middle line:90%
is a demon.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.420 align:middle line:90%
He's a demon.

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And what he's done is
he has convinced mankind

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:24.800 align:middle line:90%
that he is God.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And he wants us to-- because
he's really a demon, not a god

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:32.490 align:middle line:84%
at all-- he wants to
bring out the worst in us.

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:34.940 align:middle line:84%
He wants us to
behave in ways that

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:38.220 align:middle line:84%
cause fear and terror
and hatred and division

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:41.140 align:middle line:84%
because that's
what he thrives on.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.510 align:middle line:90%
That's what he grows on.

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:50.250 align:middle line:84%
He grows on the manipulation
of hatred in humanity.

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the
statements and the actions

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:57.420 align:middle line:84%
of the God of the Old
Testament, he is not a nice guy.

00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:01.920 align:middle line:84%
The stuff he does, the mass
murders that he's responsible

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:06.170 align:middle line:84%
for, the incitement that he
delivers to his followers

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:09.650 align:middle line:84%
to engage in horrific acts
occurs again and again.

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And you have to ask yourself,
can this be a good thing?

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.090 align:middle line:84%
Can this be a good
thing when he's

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:17.830 align:middle line:84%
telling us to go off and commit
acts of murder in his name?

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And what I often
say is, when you

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:24.190 align:middle line:84%
look at the three mainstream
monotheistic faiths,

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:29.710 align:middle line:84%
all of them talk the
talk of peace and love.

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:32.350 align:middle line:84%
But actually, if you look
at the walk they walk,

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:35.540 align:middle line:84%
it's a walk of hatred
and fear and suspicion.

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to me that
there's a real chance

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:42.830 align:middle line:84%
that the Gnostics were right and
that the entity-- that we have

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:46.150 align:middle line:84%
been hoodwinked by a
supernatural entity,

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:50.030 align:middle line:84%
if you like, by a
demonic entity who

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:53.520 align:middle line:84%
has persuaded us that he is God
and made us act in his names.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:56.780 align:middle line:84%
The Crusades, the religious
wars, the terrible divisions,

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:58.810 align:middle line:84%
the persecutions of
members of other faiths

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:00.720 align:middle line:84%
that have occurred--
all of that is not

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.740 align:middle line:84%
the action of a
good and loving God.

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.722 align:middle line:84%
All of that is the
action of a demon.

00:22:04.722 --> 00:22:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
Gnostics said he was.

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:08.780 align:middle line:90%
They called him the demiurge.

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And they felt that he
had representatives

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:18.660 align:middle line:84%
in the human race who disguised
themselves as human beings, who

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:24.560 align:middle line:84%
were called archons, whose sole
task was to mislead us further

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:27.140 align:middle line:84%
down the path of darkness and
take us away so that we would

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:30.040 align:middle line:84%
never realize the divine
spark within ourselves

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:34.220 align:middle line:84%
and that a grand cosmic game
is being played out here,

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:36.980 align:middle line:84%
of which the human
race is the fulcrum.

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And the decisions that we make
and the choices that we make

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:43.900 align:middle line:84%
are not only important
to us but are

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:46.455 align:middle line:90%
important to the whole cosmos.

00:22:46.455 --> 00:22:48.080 align:middle line:84%
This is the center
of the Gnostic idea.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.710 align:middle line:90%
It was a very powerful idea.

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:53.077 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's an idea that
merits further exploration.

00:22:53.077 --> 00:22:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, it
couldn't be more different

00:22:54.910 --> 00:23:00.810 align:middle line:84%
what Jesus is saying and his
approach towards spirituality,

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:04.990 align:middle line:84%
and then what he would call the
father that he's operating on.

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:07.120 align:middle line:84%
There's virtually no
relationship between--

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:07.635 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: There's
no relationship.

00:23:07.635 --> 00:23:09.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: --that and Jehovah.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:14.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: And the Gnostics saw
Christ as a Gnostic teacher.

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:16.780 align:middle line:84%
They were the
original Christians.

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:18.900 align:middle line:84%
The Gnostics were the
original Christians.

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:23.280 align:middle line:84%
But their religion was hijacked
by this militaristic force

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.040 align:middle line:90%
and by this demonic entity.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.430 align:middle line:84%
The Gnostics were the
original Christians.

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And they felt that their
role was to nurture

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:31.620 align:middle line:90%
the divine spark in humanity.

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
Christ came to do.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:37.280 align:middle line:84%
He came to nurture the
divine spark in man.

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And by a very clever trick,
that was hijacked and turned

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:43.650 align:middle line:84%
into something completely
opposite from what it

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:44.660 align:middle line:90%
was originally intended to be.

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:46.118 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, you
must be familiar

00:23:46.118 --> 00:23:48.320 align:middle line:84%
with the works of Origen,
like "De Principiis."

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.470 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yes, yes.

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And he claims
that Saint Peter spoke

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:57.130 align:middle line:84%
to Saint Clement of Alexandria
and that he got teachings

00:23:57.130 --> 00:24:00.070 align:middle line:84%
from Saint Clement, and that
the biggest secret teaching

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:01.547 align:middle line:90%
of Jesus was reincarnation.

00:24:01.547 --> 00:24:02.630 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Right, exactly.

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:04.500 align:middle line:90%
Which Christianity now denies.

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:05.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And so reincarnation
doesn't work

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:11.130 align:middle line:84%
when you're trying to set
up an imperial religion--

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:11.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: No, not at all.

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: --where you're going
to burn in hell forever if you

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:15.870 align:middle line:84%
don't pay taxes and kill the
enemy that your government

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:16.370 align:middle line:90%
dislikes.

00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:17.161 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Exactly.

00:24:17.161 --> 00:24:20.910 align:middle line:84%
They edited reincarnation
out of the story.

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
reincarnation implies

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:29.549 align:middle line:84%
that we do have to take
account of the lives we live,

00:24:29.549 --> 00:24:31.590 align:middle line:84%
because the lives we live
will have a consequence

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:33.980 align:middle line:90%
upon our next life.

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:36.350 align:middle line:84%
It makes us think very
carefully about what we do.

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:41.690 align:middle line:84%
Those horrendous acts that the
state wants us to carry out

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:46.890 align:middle line:84%
might be very bad for our souls,
and we might resist doing them.

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:49.115 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very subversive
teaching, reincarnation.

00:24:49.115 --> 00:24:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it
was edited out.

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, this Gnostic
idea of this demonic demiurge

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:01.790 align:middle line:84%
misleading mankind and his human
agents, or agents in human form

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:04.510 align:middle line:84%
called the archons,
it's easy to see who

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:07.010 align:middle line:90%
they are in the world today.

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:09.070 align:middle line:84%
The state, the
instruments of state,

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:13.240 align:middle line:84%
the governments that seek to
divide us from one another

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:16.800 align:middle line:84%
and are constantly manipulating
and creating new wars,

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.845 align:middle line:84%
making us terribly afraid
of this or that person

00:25:19.845 --> 00:25:25.380 align:middle line:84%
or this or that so-called enemy,
the big corporations, they're

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.960 align:middle line:90%
all part of this game.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.840 align:middle line:84%
The big media, they're
all part of this game

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:36.001 align:middle line:84%
of pushing our buttons to stop
us thinking for ourselves.

00:25:36.001 --> 00:25:37.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, and
you started out--

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:39.277 align:middle line:84%
you're a Pulitzer
Prize winning writer.

00:25:39.277 --> 00:25:41.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: No, I never
won a Pulitzer Prize.

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:41.568 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Oh, you
didn't win a Pulitzer?

00:25:41.568 --> 00:25:42.100 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I thought you did.

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:43.016 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: No, no, no.

00:25:43.016 --> 00:25:44.289 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Well, it sounds good.

00:25:44.289 --> 00:25:45.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: It does.

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:45.420 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:46.496 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: You should have.

00:25:46.496 --> 00:25:47.371 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Thank you.

00:25:47.371 --> 00:25:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: "Lords of Poverty,"
you start out on the mainstream

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:51.264 align:middle line:90%
track.

00:25:51.264 --> 00:25:52.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: I did get
an HL Mencken Award

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:53.888 align:middle line:90%
for "Lords of Poverty."

00:25:53.888 --> 00:25:57.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: HL Mencken, OK.

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:59.530 align:middle line:84%
So you start out on
a mainstream track,

00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:04.880 align:middle line:84%
and you start to find out that
aid to Third World countries

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:07.820 align:middle line:84%
is being systematically
thwarted.

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:09.730 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that, because people

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:12.000 align:middle line:84%
don't realize that you
started out as a mainstream--

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: I was a
mainstream journalist.

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:14.060 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: --academic.

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:15.643 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: I worked
for The Economist.

00:26:15.643 --> 00:26:18.050 align:middle line:84%
I was the East Africa
Correspondent of The Economist,

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:20.470 align:middle line:84%
and I was reporting mainstream
news and current affairs.

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:22.595 align:middle line:84%
There was a time in my life
when I used to buy four

00:26:22.595 --> 00:26:24.060 align:middle line:84%
or six newspapers
a day, you know.

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:27.010 align:middle line:90%


00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:29.750 align:middle line:84%
Current affairs
was central to me.

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote a series of books
as a current affairs journalist,

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:36.520 align:middle line:84%
of which the best known,
published in 1989,

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.710 align:middle line:90%
was called "Lords of Poverty."

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And that was a critique
of foreign aid.

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:43.340 align:middle line:84%
At that point,
criticizing foreign aid

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:45.330 align:middle line:90%
was like criticizing motherhood.

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:46.742 align:middle line:90%
One wasn't supposed to do that.

00:26:46.742 --> 00:26:48.200 align:middle line:84%
It was supposed to
be automatically

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:51.870 align:middle line:84%
a good thing, this generosity
to give to the poor.

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:56.192 align:middle line:84%
But what I found from my
years of visiting aid projects

00:26:56.192 --> 00:26:58.150 align:middle line:84%
as a journalist, from
tramping around the world

00:26:58.150 --> 00:26:59.780 align:middle line:84%
and looking at
the effects of aid

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:02.390 align:middle line:84%
was that it is not
a good thing at all,

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:05.670 align:middle line:90%
that it is a control system.

00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And as been rightly
quipped, what aid

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:11.670 align:middle line:84%
is is taking from the
poor in rich countries

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:15.510 align:middle line:84%
to give to the rich
in poor countries.

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:18.160 align:middle line:84%
It isn't really about
helping the poor at all.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:23.100 align:middle line:84%
It's about empowering the
elites in the societies that

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:23.780 align:middle line:90%
receive aid.

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And most people who pay for
aid through their tax dollar

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:30.750 align:middle line:84%
would not wish to empower elites
in this or that developing

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:31.260 align:middle line:90%
country.

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:33.400 align:middle line:84%
They would wish the money
to go directly to the poor

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.275 align:middle line:90%
and to help the poor.

00:27:34.275 --> 00:27:35.450 align:middle line:90%
Well, it doesn't.

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And it manifests through
gigantic aid projects.

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And I suppose it
was the first time

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:45.280 align:middle line:84%
that I began to really question
the existing order of things.

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's in common
between "Lords of Poverty"

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:51.230 align:middle line:84%
and my later books on
historical mysteries,

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:56.480 align:middle line:84%
is that they are taking
a radical perspective

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.540 align:middle line:84%
on what is thought to be the
established order of things.

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, that could
still-- questioning foreign aid

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:06.910 align:middle line:84%
even now could still be seen
as pretty radical and a slap

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:08.660 align:middle line:90%
in the face to the system.

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Because
foreign aid, the amount

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:12.640 align:middle line:84%
of dollars going in
foreign aid has continued

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:15.074 align:middle line:84%
to grow every year, and
every developed country

00:28:15.074 --> 00:28:16.490 align:middle line:84%
is giving more and
more, and we're

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:17.870 align:middle line:90%
told this is a good thing.

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:19.270 align:middle line:90%
I say it's a really bad thing.

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Look, I mean, America
never got rich

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.260 align:middle line:90%
because people gave America aid.

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:26.810 align:middle line:84%
America made itself
a prosperous country

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:27.850 align:middle line:90%
through its own efforts.

00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:29.670 align:middle line:90%
Nobody aided America to do that.

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:32.125 align:middle line:84%
So why should we think that
giving aid to other countries

00:28:32.125 --> 00:28:34.450 align:middle line:90%
is going to make them rich?

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:35.829 align:middle line:90%
That's not the way it's done.

00:28:35.829 --> 00:28:37.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: If you look
at what happened

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:40.670 align:middle line:84%
in America with the
Native Americans,

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:43.930 align:middle line:84%
Native Americans are now
being kept on reservations,

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:47.155 align:middle line:84%
and they're given a
stipend from the time

00:28:47.155 --> 00:28:50.240 align:middle line:84%
that they become 18 that
pays for all their bills.

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.400 align:middle line:84%
It is like the
welfare state concept.

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.169 align:middle line:84%
If you put people
on welfare, you

00:28:54.169 --> 00:28:55.460 align:middle line:90%
remove the incentive for them--

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:56.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: You completely
remove the incentive.

00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: --to want
to do anything else.

00:28:57.870 --> 00:28:58.495 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yes.

00:28:58.495 --> 00:29:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And you do something
worse than that.

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:04.440 align:middle line:84%
You take away from them their
responsibility over themselves.

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:06.340 align:middle line:84%
That's what we need
as human beings.

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:08.369 align:middle line:84%
That's part of our
growth process.

00:29:08.369 --> 00:29:09.410 align:middle line:90%
This is my belief system.

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:11.310 align:middle line:84%
I firmly believe
that's why we're here.

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:13.070 align:middle line:84%
We're here to learn
and grow and develop.

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And part of that is taking
responsibility for oneself.

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And any institution
that separates us

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:23.700 align:middle line:84%
from sovereignty over ourselves
and from responsibility

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:26.660 align:middle line:84%
over ourselves is not
doing us any favors.

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:31.080 align:middle line:84%
They're doing us a disservice,
a very severe disservice,

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:33.850 align:middle line:84%
and preventing our
growth as spirits.

00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:36.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So what was the
response to "Lords of Poverty"?

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.600 align:middle line:84%
Did anything change
as a result of that?

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:39.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: No.

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:40.030 align:middle line:90%
Nothing changed.

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:41.874 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are
big institutions.

00:29:41.874 --> 00:29:43.540 align:middle line:84%
I was told that people
at the World Bank

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:47.630 align:middle line:84%
used to actually read it
in brown paper wrappers.

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:49.244 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Like a whisky bottle.

00:29:49.244 --> 00:29:49.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah.

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:51.659 align:middle line:84%
It was a book that
made them very annoyed,

00:29:51.659 --> 00:29:55.080 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time, they
felt they needed to read it.

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:55.580 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:57.500 align:middle line:84%
These institutions
are too big to change.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:00.400 align:middle line:84%
What I hope I did do
was shine some light

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:04.520 align:middle line:84%
on the underbelly of foreign
aid and to show what a disaster

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:07.200 align:middle line:84%
it is and how little
it has achieved

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:10.280 align:middle line:84%
and what a waste of money
it is in every possible way.

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:13.381 align:middle line:84%
Just down at that simple
level, there's so much

00:30:13.381 --> 00:30:15.380 align:middle line:84%
better things that could
be done with that money

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:17.110 align:middle line:84%
than is being done
than channeling

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:20.390 align:middle line:84%
into these huge projects
which empower bureaucracies.

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:23.862 align:middle line:84%
They empower the aid giver
and the aid receiver,

00:30:23.862 --> 00:30:24.570 align:middle line:90%
the institutions.

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:26.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Do you
think that it also

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:31.440 align:middle line:84%
creates a method
by which people can

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:34.600 align:middle line:84%
be lured into thinking that the
problem is being dealt with?

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:36.150 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Absolutely.

00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:38.560 align:middle line:90%
It is exactly doing that.

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:43.000 align:middle line:84%
It is saying, all those
problems out there in the world,

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.970 align:middle line:84%
this is our way of
solving those problems.

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:46.100 align:middle line:90%
This is our contribution.

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:48.841 align:middle line:84%
We're doing something about
it, so you can relax, guys.

00:30:48.841 --> 00:30:49.340 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry.

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:50.389 align:middle line:90%
No, we can't relax.

00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And its
low-lying political fruit.

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:53.640 align:middle line:84%
If you want to win
an election, you

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.665 align:middle line:84%
say, oh, look at
what we're doing.

00:30:55.665 --> 00:30:57.290 align:middle line:84%
Look at the aid
programs we've started.

00:30:57.290 --> 00:31:00.050 align:middle line:84%
We're building communities
in Zimbabwe, and we're--

00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:00.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Exactly.

00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:02.910 align:middle line:90%
And who can be against that?

00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:05.200 align:middle line:90%
This is the whole problem.

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:10.000 align:middle line:84%
It's an easy answer to
the problems of the world.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And it isn't solving
any of those problems.

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:13.760 align:middle line:90%
It's making them worse.

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:18.010 align:middle line:84%
Nothing has got better in 50,
60, 70 years of aid giving.

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:18.510 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:21.114 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So these warlords
end up basically intercepting

00:31:21.114 --> 00:31:22.363 align:middle line:90%
the money before it actually--

00:31:22.363 --> 00:31:23.825 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Yes, they
intercepted, they control it,

00:31:23.825 --> 00:31:25.240 align:middle line:90%
and it empowers them.

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:26.430 align:middle line:90%
It makes them more powerful.

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:27.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So they
become more brutal,

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:29.390 align:middle line:84%
and the dictatorship
gets even worse.

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:30.056 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah.

00:31:30.056 --> 00:31:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And we, the taxpayers in the
West, are paying for that.

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's a bad deal-- for
us and for the people who

00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:37.680 align:middle line:84%
are really meant to be
benefiting from our generosity.

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.138 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So this
starts to get over

00:31:39.138 --> 00:31:44.130 align:middle line:84%
to the John Perkins side of
things, "The Economic Hit Man."

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:45.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: I suppose so, yeah.

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:48.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Where
ultimately the aid

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:52.910 align:middle line:84%
is being diverted into a puppet
dictatorship that is actually

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:55.280 align:middle line:84%
run by the cabal,
the European powers.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:58.330 align:middle line:90%


00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:01.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: It's a system
of global control.

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:02.590 align:middle line:90%
That's what aid's about.

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:06.060 align:middle line:84%
It's about keeping
power in a few hands.

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:10.640 align:middle line:84%
The same hands that are
controlling us here in the West

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.970 align:middle line:84%
are also controlling all
the developing countries.

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing
so-- aid is a key tool

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:19.890 align:middle line:90%
in that process of control.

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:21.535 align:middle line:90%
It's key to that.

00:32:21.535 --> 00:32:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It's sophisticated
money-laundering, basically.

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:25.660 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Undoubtedly the case.

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:27.410 align:middle line:90%
And control.

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:31.940 align:middle line:84%
It allows those
elite individuals

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:36.290 align:middle line:84%
who run our societies to
run other societies as well.

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And guess what, they don't
have to pay for it themselves.

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:40.960 align:middle line:90%
We the taxpayer pay for it.

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: As sick and as crazy as
these people in the cabal are,

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:47.090 align:middle line:90%
you have to admire them.

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:49.780 align:middle line:84%
They created this
system of global control

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:54.440 align:middle line:84%
through allegedly humanitarian
aid relief programs.

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And better, they get
us to pay for it.

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.900 align:middle line:84%
These are unsettling
implications,

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:04.000 align:middle line:84%
but what they are doing is they
are shedding light on things

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.500 align:middle line:90%
that we need to know.

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:07.950 align:middle line:10%
This is all part of
the disclosure process,

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:11.420 align:middle line:10%
and it is fascinating that
Graham Hancock started out

00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:14.390 align:middle line:10%
doing groundbreaking
work in exposing

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:16.925 align:middle line:10%
the problems in our
society and the things that

00:33:16.925 --> 00:33:19.460 align:middle line:10%
are going wrong so
that he can steer us

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:21.580 align:middle line:10%
towards the things
that are going right.

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:24.370 align:middle line:84%
We have other episodes
of Graham Hancock and me

00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:27.730 align:middle line:84%
talking coming up, where we
get into many other fascinating

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:28.720 align:middle line:90%
subjects.

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And that is coming up in future
episodes of our ancient history

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:35.820 align:middle line:90%
miniseries here on "Disclosure."

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Coming up in the next
episode is part two,

00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:43.620 align:middle line:84%
the final section of my epic
interview with Laird Scranton.

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And in this episode, I challenge
him based upon the exact things

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:53.340 align:middle line:84%
that his skeptics and his
haters have said in the Amazon

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:55.750 align:middle line:90%
comments section for his book.

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:58.010 align:middle line:84%
How is he going to
hold up under fire?

00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:02.220 align:middle line:84%
Let's find out, because his
information is so wide-ranging

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:04.670 align:middle line:84%
that if he can come back
swinging and have good answers

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:08.340 align:middle line:84%
to his critics, then we
have to seriously consider

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:11.860 align:middle line:84%
that what he is telling
us may be in fact correct.

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And that means that
ancient civilizations

00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:19.480 align:middle line:84%
may have been seeded here
by extraterrestrial life who

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:22.500 align:middle line:84%
gave us a unified
cosmology showing

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:25.610 align:middle line:84%
how our own lives and
the lives of nature as we

00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:29.389 align:middle line:84%
know it is fundamentally
interconnected with the cosmos

00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:30.510 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:32.949 align:middle line:84%
That's coming up next
time on "Disclosure."

00:34:32.949 --> 00:34:37.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, David Wilcock,
and I thank you for watching.

00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:44.885 align:middle line:90%
