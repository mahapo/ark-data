00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID WILCOCK: Hello, and
welcome to another episode

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.490 align:middle line:90%
of disclosure.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.110 align:middle line:84%
We are interviewing my
hero, G. Edward Griffin,

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.170 align:middle line:84%
the author of a whole
bunch of really explosive,

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.740 align:middle line:84%
whistle-blowing books,
including "The Creature

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.480 align:middle line:84%
from Jekyll Island," which he
is possibly the most known for.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.770 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we're
really going to get into it.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, you may or may not have
heard of the so-called LIBOR

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:40.670 align:middle line:90%
scandal.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.400 align:middle line:90%
This is unbelievable.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.680 align:middle line:84%
Because this is
supposedly a watermark

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.520 align:middle line:84%
that determines how
much competition banks

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.990 align:middle line:84%
have with each other based
on their financial solvency.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And now we find out, and
this has been publicly

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.320 align:middle line:84%
made available to us, that
the banks were actually

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.970 align:middle line:84%
colluding with each other to
rig their own interest rates.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.304 align:middle line:84%
And the bottom line
is that all of them

00:01:04.304 --> 00:01:06.720 align:middle line:84%
were pretending that they were
worth more than they really

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.540 align:middle line:90%
were.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.290 align:middle line:84%
The whole economy is
ultimately a Ponzi scheme.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.830 align:middle line:84%
Then we're also seeing the
Snowden stuff coming out.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.650 align:middle line:90%
What's up with that?

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.020 align:middle line:84%
What is the real
purpose of the NSA?

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.310 align:middle line:84%
Is it really to look for some
guys in a cave in Afghanistan?

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.380 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.330 align:middle line:84%
G. Edward Griffin asks some
very pertinent questions here,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:32.030 align:middle line:84%
which is, if we have this group,
it is essentially a cartel.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.400 align:middle line:84%
A cartel is simply governments
and businesses working together

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.360 align:middle line:84%
in secret to eliminate
competition and maximize

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.210 align:middle line:90%
profits.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.310 align:middle line:84%
And so the word "cartel"
is a really good benchmark

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.550 align:middle line:90%
for using this.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.670 align:middle line:84%
So we have the NSA that puts
people under surveillance.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing the results
of that surveillance seeming

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.120 align:middle line:84%
to include the fact
that this group has

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.590 align:middle line:84%
been able to amass
incredible power,

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.737 align:middle line:90%
seemingly with no opposition.

00:01:59.737 --> 00:02:01.320 align:middle line:84%
If you can listen
to every phone call,

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.004 align:middle line:84%
if you can hear what
everybody's saying,

00:02:03.004 --> 00:02:04.670 align:middle line:84%
then you can basically
do what you want,

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.100 align:middle line:84%
because if anybody comes up
and tries to tear you down,

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.560 align:middle line:90%
you can just take them out.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
seem to be seeing

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.205 align:middle line:84%
with this rash of
banker suicides

00:02:13.205 --> 00:02:16.960 align:middle line:84%
that's been going on
all throughout 2014.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.690 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
information to consider here.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.970 align:middle line:84%
And G. Edward Griffin
is the best of the best.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.000 align:middle line:84%
He was the main
inspiration for Ron Paul

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.220 align:middle line:84%
that led to Ron Paul speaking
out about the Federal Reserve.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.130 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very honored to be
able to interview G. Edward

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.170 align:middle line:84%
Griffin in this
episode, where we really

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.680 align:middle line:84%
get into the heart of
understanding the Federal

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.690 align:middle line:90%
Reserve and the NSA.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.540 align:middle line:90%
Check it out.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, you are most well known
for your groundbreaking,

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.800 align:middle line:84%
investigative work into exposing
the Federal Reserve System.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.230 align:middle line:84%
So the average person can
pull $1 out of their wallet,

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.030 align:middle line:84%
and they look at the money,
and right up at the top

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.400 align:middle line:90%
it says, Federal Reserve Note.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.160 align:middle line:90%
What exactly does that mean?

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.590 align:middle line:10%
>>G. EDWARD GRIFFIN: It means
they're being vandalized.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.330 align:middle line:10%
It means they're
being stolen from.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.960 align:middle line:10%
It means they're using as
money a piece of paper that

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.930 align:middle line:10%
was issued by a banking
cartel, and they

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.570 align:middle line:10%
think that it's issued
by the government.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.230 align:middle line:90%
They think it's secure.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.490 align:middle line:84%
They think it's an
honorable piece of money.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And they think that's the
best that there it is.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.790 align:middle line:84%
They think that if they
save that money in a bank

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.340 align:middle line:84%
account or accumulate value
in an insurance policy

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.140 align:middle line:84%
or something like
that, they think

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.430 align:middle line:84%
that they're doing the
right thing for themselves

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.200 align:middle line:84%
and their families,
because as the years go by,

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.720 align:middle line:84%
they'll be able to retire
on this accumulated wealth.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.160 align:middle line:84%
So they're thinking right
from their perspective,

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.120 align:middle line:84%
but what they don't
realize is that this is not

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.470 align:middle line:84%
a real-- at least not
a good money system.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.470 align:middle line:90%
You could call it money.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.980 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.438 align:middle line:84%
It certainly is a money, but
it's a very bad form of money.

00:03:59.438 --> 00:04:02.510 align:middle line:90%
It's a fiat money system.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.834 align:middle line:10%
What they don't realize
is that it's a trick.

00:04:05.834 --> 00:04:06.375 align:middle line:90%
It's a fraud.

00:04:06.375 --> 00:04:09.280 align:middle line:90%


00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.990 align:middle line:84%
The money is supposed to
be a measure of value.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.890 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to
say, well, I measure

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.390 align:middle line:84%
everything in comparison
to this unit, the dollar.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.839 align:middle line:84%
It's supposed to be the same
now, and 20 years from now

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:23.550 align:middle line:84%
and 50 years from
now, that should

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.270 align:middle line:90%
represent the same value.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And it does if the money is
backed by something of value

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.485 align:middle line:84%
also, like gold or silver
or cases of cheap white wine

00:04:34.485 --> 00:04:38.370 align:middle line:84%
or anything that it takes
human effort to produce.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.070 align:middle line:84%
Then the money system, if
it's backed by those things,

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.270 align:middle line:84%
has a value that is stable
over a period of time.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.290 align:middle line:10%
But once they break
the money away

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.490 align:middle line:10%
from anything of intrinsic
value and they can just

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.710 align:middle line:10%
create it by raising
their hand and say, yeah,

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.150 align:middle line:10%
I vote for another
$100 billion today,

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.500 align:middle line:10%
and it's created out of
nothing, well, now it's

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.330 align:middle line:10%
no longer a measure
of value at all.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.080 align:middle line:90%
It's a trick.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.080 align:middle line:84%
It's worthless, really,
and it's very dangerous.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.038 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't say it's
worthless, because as long

00:05:07.038 --> 00:05:10.380 align:middle line:84%
as people are willing to
accept it, it's worth that.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.220 align:middle line:84%
But the value of it
keeps going down day

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.090 align:middle line:84%
by day, month by
month, year by year.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And as we know,
there was a time--

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.820 align:middle line:84%
I can remember when I first
started to drive a car.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.990 align:middle line:84%
I could buy a gallon
of gas for $0.31.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.937 align:middle line:84%
Well, what it is
today, I don't know

00:05:27.937 --> 00:05:29.770 align:middle line:84%
how long this film's
going to be around now,

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.630 align:middle line:90%
but it's pushing $5.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:37.130 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean that the
gas really costs more?

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.310 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:39.810 align:middle line:90%
The gas really costs the same.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.400 align:middle line:84%
It's that the value of
the dollar has gone down.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.470 align:middle line:10%
Because it takes more of
them to buy gas and bread

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.630 align:middle line:10%
and pay your rent and
your utility bill.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.490 align:middle line:84%
It takes more of
those for everything.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.570 align:middle line:84%
The real value has
remained stable.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.730 align:middle line:84%
But we just have no measure
of what stability is.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: OK, so the
term Federal Reserve,

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.550 align:middle line:84%
most people are
going to think, OK,

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.600 align:middle line:84%
federal, that means it's
the federal government

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.930 align:middle line:90%
of the United States.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.040 align:middle line:84%
Reserve means that there
is some reserve of money

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.850 align:middle line:84%
that they are
holding as collateral

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:18.050 align:middle line:84%
against these Federal Reserve
notes that they're printing.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.090 align:middle line:84%
Is the Federal Reserve part
of our federal government

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.120 align:middle line:90%
at all or not?

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And what really is
the Federal Reserve?

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.480 align:middle line:90%
What are we looking at here?

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: It's absolutely true
that somebody will say that.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.910 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] I've heard
it many, many times.

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.470 align:middle line:84%
But it is not absolutely
true that they're correct.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:37.690 align:middle line:90%
In fact, they're wrong.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.370 align:middle line:90%
They just don't understand.

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.390 align:middle line:84%
The truth of the matter is
those are called Federal Reserve

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:46.720 align:middle line:84%
Notes, which means that
they're-- a note is like

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.330 align:middle line:90%
and IOU.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.890 align:middle line:84%
That's what "note" means
in the financial world.

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:50.910 align:middle line:90%
It's a note.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.225 align:middle line:84%
I loan you some money, and
here's my note for you to sign,

00:06:54.225 --> 00:06:55.450 align:middle line:90%
and you pay it back.

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:59.900 align:middle line:84%
So I hold the note, and
you've got the piece of paper.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And so a Federal
Reserve Note means

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:07.640 align:middle line:84%
it's an IOU issued by
the Federal Reserve.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, what is the
Federal Reserve?

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.340 align:middle line:84%
Is it an agency of the
federal government?

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.850 align:middle line:90%
No, it is not.

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.460 align:middle line:84%
The Federal Reserve
is a banking cartel.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.550 align:middle line:90%
It's a group of private banks.

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:21.400 align:middle line:84%
So a Federal Reserve Note is a
piece of paper issued as an IOU

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.740 align:middle line:90%
by the private banks.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.550 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.050 align:middle line:10%
And will those private
banks ever pay it back?

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:30.540 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:31.300 align:middle line:90%
The answer is no.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.920 align:middle line:84%
They'll pay it
back, but in what?

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.770 align:middle line:84%
In more Federal
Reserve Notes, see.

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:36.910 align:middle line:90%
That's the trick.

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:41.790 align:middle line:84%
If you're forced to use
these notes as money,

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.570 align:middle line:84%
then no matter how
worthless they become,

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:47.550 align:middle line:84%
you must accept them as
payment back for the originals.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.330 align:middle line:90%
Is not an accident, by the way.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.080 align:middle line:84%
These things are not
taught in school.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.760 align:middle line:84%
They're not taught in
school because the schools

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.602 align:middle line:90%
are run by the government.

00:07:56.602 --> 00:07:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's in the best
interest of the government

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.380 align:middle line:84%
that you and I don't really
think about these sorts

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.545 align:middle line:90%
of things very much.

00:08:02.545 --> 00:08:04.110 align:middle line:84%
It's very much in
their interest.

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:07.347 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise we might get angry.

00:08:07.347 --> 00:08:09.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: One of the
more interesting aspects

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.150 align:middle line:84%
of your book is
that you describe

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.590 align:middle line:84%
that there were
four attempts made

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:16.550 align:middle line:90%
to create the Federal Reserve.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:19.780 align:middle line:84%
The Federal Reserve
Act of 1913 was only

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.500 align:middle line:84%
the conclusion of
a longstanding war

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:27.250 align:middle line:84%
to try to create this financial
structure of a central bank.

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:30.660 align:middle line:84%
So can you walk us through
the alternative view

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.130 align:middle line:84%
of American history
that you have presented

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:36.190 align:middle line:84%
and show us who
these people are?

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:41.159 align:middle line:84%
And how have they tried to
build this cartel over time?

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: It's a very important
part of American history,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.240 align:middle line:84%
and it's something that's
surprised me to find out

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:51.240 align:middle line:84%
that the Federal Reserve was
actually the fourth attempt

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:55.000 align:middle line:84%
to create what they call
a central bank in America.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.030 align:middle line:84%
A central bank is
merely a code phrase

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:04.100 align:middle line:84%
that the academics use to
describe this thing called--

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.410 align:middle line:84%
we call it the Federal Reserve,
but in other countries,

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:09.230 align:middle line:84%
they have the same thing
called something else.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:13.250 align:middle line:84%
They're all central banks, which
means that they're basically

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:17.290 align:middle line:84%
private banks in the
form of a cartel, which

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:21.050 align:middle line:84%
have gone into partnership with
their respective governments.

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And the governments have
taken their cartel agreement

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:28.380 align:middle line:84%
and passed it into law so
that now what would normally

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:31.360 align:middle line:84%
be just a private agreement
between the banks themselves

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.010 align:middle line:84%
to regulate themselves
for their own benefit

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:38.440 align:middle line:84%
now is enshrined in the laws
of those countries, which

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:43.110 align:middle line:84%
means that you and I
now must obey or abide

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:47.630 align:middle line:84%
by the rules of a cartel
or we go to prison.

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:51.290 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason that most
people think that the Federal

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:54.040 align:middle line:84%
Reserve and other central
banks around the world

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.980 align:middle line:84%
are, in fact, agencies
of their governments,

00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:00.030 align:middle line:84%
because they know if they don't
go along with these rules,

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:01.620 align:middle line:90%
they're going to go to prison.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And only governments
can put you in prison.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:07.070 align:middle line:84%
So that's what makes it look
like a government agency when

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:12.400 align:middle line:84%
in fact, all it is is a private
banking cartel agreement, which

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.540 align:middle line:90%
has been passed into law.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.870 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the government
becomes a partner, in a way,

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:20.260 align:middle line:84%
with the private
banks in this cartel.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And we've got this
partnership, this amalgamation

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:27.300 align:middle line:90%
between politics and finance.

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very, very
powerful combination.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:33.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, so I was
surprised to find out

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.230 align:middle line:84%
that the Federal Reserve
was the fourth attempt

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.604 align:middle line:90%
to do that in the United States.

00:10:38.604 --> 00:10:40.020 align:middle line:84%
I was really
surprised to find out

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.650 align:middle line:84%
that at the time of the
signing of the Declaration

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:47.780 align:middle line:84%
of Independence and the writing
of the Constitution itself,

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.690 align:middle line:84%
we already had
one of those here.

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:53.440 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know it, but
there was one there.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.450 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't last very long.

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:58.200 align:middle line:84%
They were raising
money, by the way,

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.740 align:middle line:84%
by printing it and
creating it out

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:03.180 align:middle line:84%
of nothing to help finance
the Revolutionary War.

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.920 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the reasons that
the politicians and the bankers

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.650 align:middle line:84%
form this partnership,
is because it's

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:10.270 align:middle line:90%
mutually advantageous.

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.870 align:middle line:84%
The politicians are able
to get fast, easy money

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:15.772 align:middle line:84%
in unlimited quantities, because
the banks just create it.

00:11:15.772 --> 00:11:16.480 align:middle line:90%
There's no limit.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.270 align:middle line:84%
It's not backed by
gold or anything.

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why the
politicians like it.

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And the bankers like it because,
heck, they created money,

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:24.440 align:middle line:84%
and now they're
collecting interest

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.570 align:middle line:90%
on this thing they created.

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:26.650 align:middle line:90%
They like that.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And everybody likes it
except the poor suckers

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:30.600 align:middle line:84%
out there like us
who have to pay

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.390 align:middle line:84%
the taxes in the form of either
direct taxes or inflation,

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:36.620 align:middle line:84%
prices going up to
pay for all of this.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:40.070 align:middle line:84%
So that was already
in place at that time.

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:42.960 align:middle line:84%
It had ruined what was left
of the economy at the end

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.790 align:middle line:90%
of the Revolutionary War.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And there was a strong
movement to get rid of it.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:48.600 align:middle line:90%
In fact, they did.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Within a year or two-- I've
forgotten the exact time frame,

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:55.060 align:middle line:84%
but very soon after the
creation of the country,

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.690 align:middle line:84%
the first central bank
of the United States

00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:59.540 align:middle line:90%
was allowed to expire.

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:02.520 align:middle line:84%
The charter expired,
and it became, I think,

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:07.337 align:middle line:84%
a Philadelphia bank,
just a private bank.

00:12:07.337 --> 00:12:08.420 align:middle line:90%
The second one came along.

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:11.310 align:middle line:84%
It was the First Bank
of the United States.

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:13.510 align:middle line:90%
And it went out of business.

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:14.560 align:middle line:90%
The third one came along.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.420 align:middle line:84%
It was the Third Bank
of the United States.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
one where there was

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:24.110 align:middle line:84%
a great battle between President
Andrew Jackson and the bankers.

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:26.530 align:middle line:90%
He's famous for that battle.

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:29.960 align:middle line:10%
Even the history
books today, you

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.140 align:middle line:10%
can find maybe a couple of lines
about Andrew Jackson's battle

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:34.240 align:middle line:10%
against the bank.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.190 align:middle line:90%
You don't get any details.

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:38.640 align:middle line:84%
All you know is that Jackson
was against the banks,

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.931 align:middle line:84%
and you wonder, really, who
were the good guys in that,

00:12:40.931 --> 00:12:42.330 align:middle line:90%
maybe Jackson, maybe the banks.

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:47.090 align:middle line:84%
But it turned out that Jackson
really based his career

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:48.570 align:middle line:90%
on getting rid of the banks.

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:51.020 align:middle line:84%
He called them,
you den of vipers!

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.730 align:middle line:84%
That was his attack
phrase, colorful language

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:56.370 align:middle line:84%
for a president speaking
against the central bank.

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:59.730 align:middle line:90%
He says, I will cast thee out.

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:01.480 align:middle line:84%
There was almost a
religious fervor.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.020 align:middle line:84%
And he put his political
career on the line.

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And he almost lost that
battle, because Nicholas Biddle

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.680 align:middle line:84%
was the head of the
bank at that time.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And he is quoted as saying,
I will get this guy Jackson.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to ruin him.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to have him impeached.

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And he said, the
United States may fall,

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.420 align:middle line:90%
but the bank will not fall.

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:28.420 align:middle line:90%
He's quoted as saying that.

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And so what he did is he
started to pull in loans that

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:35.280 align:middle line:90%
were outstanding to businesses.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.710 align:middle line:90%
He was demanding full payment.

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And it was putting
companies out of business.

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:43.480 align:middle line:84%
He was deliberately creating
a man-made recession

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.840 align:middle line:90%
so that he could say, you see?

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:48.170 align:middle line:84%
That's Jackson's fault.
He talks about taking away

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:51.330 align:middle line:84%
the power of our bank, and look
what he's doing to the economy.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.977 align:middle line:84%
And people were saying,
yeah, Jackson, you dirty guy.

00:13:53.977 --> 00:13:55.560 align:middle line:84%
Look what you're
doing to the economy.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.275 align:middle line:84%
And there was a movement
in Congress to impeach him.

00:13:58.275 --> 00:14:01.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turned out
that almost by accident,

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:05.440 align:middle line:84%
there was one of the large
newspapers in the Midwest that

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.810 align:middle line:84%
picked up on the fact that
Biddle was deliberately

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:09.310 align:middle line:90%
doing this.

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:10.580 align:middle line:90%
They published it.

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And when the news hit
that it was Biddle himself

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.210 align:middle line:84%
who was doing this, then
the tide of public opinion

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:19.950 align:middle line:84%
turned, and it was Biddle
who found himself out

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:22.400 align:middle line:84%
on the street, and
Jackson had the support,

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.520 align:middle line:84%
and the bank was
finally terminated.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:28.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What's your
perspective on the War of 1812?

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:31.090 align:middle line:84%
America had declared its
independence from Britain.

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:34.470 align:middle line:84%
But then the British come back,
and they tried to invade again.

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:37.290 align:middle line:84%
Do you see that
historical event as being

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:40.662 align:middle line:84%
significant in the research
that you've conducted?

00:14:40.662 --> 00:14:42.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: I'm not
one of the people that

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:47.080 align:middle line:84%
is so concerned about foreign
involvement or influence

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.840 align:middle line:90%
in our Federal Reserve system.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.460 align:middle line:90%
I know it's there.

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:53.880 align:middle line:84%
I know that the Rothschilds and
the Warburgs in the beginning

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:57.280 align:middle line:84%
were very influential in
the policies and so forth.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:01.510 align:middle line:84%
But I don't really see
that as a major factor.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:06.720 align:middle line:84%
Let's just assume for the
moment that the British banks

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:10.970 align:middle line:84%
or political figures are shadowy
figures behind the scene, are

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:14.460 align:middle line:84%
the dominant force in the
Federal Reserve System.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.030 align:middle line:90%
So what?

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:18.140 align:middle line:84%
We still have to get
rid of it, you see?

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:20.470 align:middle line:84%
We can talk about
who is behind that

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:23.360 align:middle line:84%
and who is getting the most
benefit, but none of that

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.240 align:middle line:90%
makes any difference.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.520 align:middle line:90%
We know it's not us.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.420 align:middle line:84%
So let's get on
with the real job

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.320 align:middle line:90%
and get rid of this monster.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.600 align:middle line:90%
Let's slay this creature.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.220 align:middle line:84%
Usually in that argument,
you find the idea

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:38.690 align:middle line:84%
that, well, it's those big, bad
bankers that are the problem.

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:40.730 align:middle line:84%
We're paying interest
on the national debt

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:44.470 align:middle line:84%
to these big, bad bankers, and
interest on private debt, too.

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:47.880 align:middle line:84%
So all we got to do is just get
those banker out of the picture

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:51.460 align:middle line:84%
and turn this fiat money
system over to the treasury

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:56.010 align:middle line:84%
and let the federal
government run the scam.

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:57.500 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.460 align:middle line:84%
We can't trust those
big, bad bankers,

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:02.237 align:middle line:84%
but those nice, friendly,
trustworthy politicians

00:16:02.237 --> 00:16:02.820 align:middle line:90%
are different.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:05.450 align:middle line:84%
We can trust them to
take care of the problem.

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:08.460 align:middle line:84%
This is the hidden message
behind that argument.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:09.670 align:middle line:90%
Let's see who's behind it.

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:10.300 align:middle line:90%
And they're foreigners.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:11.883 align:middle line:84%
Well, we don't like
foreigners, right?

00:16:11.883 --> 00:16:14.110 align:middle line:84%
So let's get it back
to the people, which

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:16.810 align:middle line:84%
means to the politicians
in Washington.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And I don't like
that solution at all.

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:20.812 align:middle line:90%
I think it's a trap.

00:16:20.812 --> 00:16:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm glad you brought it
up, because it gave me a chance

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:25.880 align:middle line:90%
to express my views on that.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So I'm interested
in looking at the fact

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:30.450 align:middle line:84%
that we have the
Federal Reserve that

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:34.720 align:middle line:84%
gets started in 1913, in which
the American government quite

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.550 align:middle line:84%
literally outsourced the
issuance of its currency

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:41.260 align:middle line:84%
to a consortium of
private bankers.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And then within four years,
we have the conditions

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:48.900 align:middle line:84%
that lead up to World
War I, including

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.670 align:middle line:84%
the rise of the Russian
Revolution of 1917,

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:54.120 align:middle line:90%
the Bolshevik Revolution.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.990 align:middle line:84%
Is that just a
coincidence, or is there

00:16:55.990 --> 00:17:00.490 align:middle line:84%
are some connective thread
between the foundation

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:03.880 align:middle line:84%
the Federal Reserve and
the start of these wars?

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.660 align:middle line:84%
In short, I guess what
I'm really asking is,

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:11.140 align:middle line:84%
is there a reason for why a
banking cartel like the Federal

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.220 align:middle line:84%
Reserve would want
there to be a war?

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.050 align:middle line:90%
Do they profit off of it?

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And if so, how are
they benefiting

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:19.089 align:middle line:90%
from creating these wars?

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:20.839 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: It's a
complex question

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:23.430 align:middle line:90%
with different components to it.

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:26.160 align:middle line:84%
First of all, Woodrow
Wilson was concerned,

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.420 align:middle line:84%
as far as I can see
in his later years,

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:33.330 align:middle line:84%
was concerned about this
creature, the Federal Reserve,

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:35.565 align:middle line:84%
that he had helped
create, by the way.

00:17:35.565 --> 00:17:36.940 align:middle line:84%
I think it's
important for people

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:41.020 align:middle line:84%
to know that Wilson himself was
a big supporter of the Federal

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:41.520 align:middle line:90%
Reserve.

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:46.800 align:middle line:84%
And without his cooperation and
behind-the-scenes endorsement,

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.590 align:middle line:84%
the Federal Reserve
probably would never

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:50.490 align:middle line:90%
have been enacted into law.

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:52.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Is that
just a coincidence?

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:55.470 align:middle line:90%
Was war good business for them?

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: So the issue is that
why are the bankers doing this?

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:02.800 align:middle line:84%
Is it just because they
want to make money?

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:06.560 align:middle line:84%
Or do they have political
objectives as well?

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And if it's primarily
money, does war

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:12.060 align:middle line:84%
help them achieve
that objective?

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.120 align:middle line:90%
Duh, of course.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:19.040 align:middle line:84%
Nations at war spend
huge amounts of money,

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.880 align:middle line:84%
and they don't get
it from direct taxes.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.970 align:middle line:84%
They always get it
through inflation.

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:27.725 align:middle line:84%
They always get it through their
central banks, who just create

00:18:27.725 --> 00:18:30.680 align:middle line:84%
it out of thin air,
pump it into the economy

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:34.150 align:middle line:84%
through the government,
and it's inflation.

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the price of
gasoline and bread and college

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:40.660 align:middle line:84%
educations keeps
going up, up, up,

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.250 align:middle line:84%
because the value of the dollar
keeps going down, down, down.

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And that lost value is what is
siphoned off to the government

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:49.990 align:middle line:90%
so they can fight the wars.

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:52.040 align:middle line:84%
That's how they
finance the wars.

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And we pay for it through
inflation primarily.

00:18:55.100 --> 00:19:00.530 align:middle line:84%
So sure, central banks
and, well, any bank

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:02.600 align:middle line:90%
loves to make loans.

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.210 align:middle line:90%
They're born to make loans.

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:06.010 align:middle line:84%
That's how they
make their money.

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And so there's no bigger
borrower than the government

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:11.650 align:middle line:90%
fighting a war.

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:14.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's just obvious once
you see the picture of that.

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:17.020 align:middle line:84%
It is very much in the
interest of the Federal Reserve

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:22.550 align:middle line:84%
and every other central bank
in the world to be the lender

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:25.410 align:middle line:84%
to their governments
on a big scale.

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing quite as big
a scale as a war for survival.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And under those conditions,
the politicians and the people

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.987 align:middle line:84%
themselves don't ask
what the price tag is.

00:19:35.987 --> 00:19:38.070 align:middle line:84%
They don't say, how much
is this going to cost us?

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:40.250 align:middle line:84%
They say, I don't care
what the price is.

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:43.550 align:middle line:84%
We have to win the war,
or we'll be conquered.

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:48.870 align:middle line:84%
So wars have always been a prime
weapon, a tool, if you will,

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:50.460 align:middle line:90%
on the part of central banks.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And in my mind at
least, David, if it

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:55.250 align:middle line:84%
weren't for that
central bank mechanism,

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:58.010 align:middle line:84%
where they could finance
wars in this easy fashion,

00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:02.210 align:middle line:84%
I think most modern wars
would never have been fought.

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:03.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: In the
last year, we've now

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:07.360 align:middle line:84%
heard about the LIBOR scandal,
where all the top banks that

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.860 align:middle line:84%
are supposedly competing
with each other

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:12.390 align:middle line:84%
are actually manipulating
their own interest

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:15.220 align:middle line:90%
rates to benefit each other.

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:16.620 align:middle line:90%
That's come out recently.

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:19.532 align:middle line:84%
Would you say that
that's the smoking gun

00:20:19.532 --> 00:20:21.240 align:middle line:84%
that you've been
looking forward to prove

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.155 align:middle line:84%
that this cartel
actually exists?

00:20:23.155 --> 00:20:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Yes,
I think it's true

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:29.030 align:middle line:84%
that in the last year or two,
it seems like the evidence has

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:32.160 align:middle line:84%
been coming, bubbling
up from this morass,

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.519 align:middle line:90%
from this pit of smoking debris.

00:20:35.519 --> 00:20:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And there's the evidence
bobbing around on the surface.

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:39.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, the banks are crooked.

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:40.700 align:middle line:90%
The banks steal.

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:42.030 align:middle line:90%
The banks lie.

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:44.756 align:middle line:84%
The banks have unsavory
political connections.

00:20:44.756 --> 00:20:45.880 align:middle line:90%
They're buying politicians.

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:47.060 align:middle line:90%
It's all coming up.

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:48.640 align:middle line:10%
And people go, well,
how about that?

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.473 align:middle line:10%
What does this mean?

00:20:49.473 --> 00:20:52.220 align:middle line:10%
Well, it means that
we've been taken over

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:55.020 align:middle line:10%
by a banking cartel that
owns our government.

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:55.980 align:middle line:90%
That's what it means.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.216 align:middle line:90%
And they get away with this.

00:20:57.216 --> 00:20:58.590 align:middle line:84%
We read about it
in the newspaper

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:00.310 align:middle line:84%
and think, well, I'm
glad we read about it.

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:01.935 align:middle line:84%
That means the
problem's solved, right?

00:21:01.935 --> 00:21:03.150 align:middle line:90%
No, they just read about it.

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:05.290 align:middle line:90%
The problem goes on.

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:07.270 align:middle line:84%
None of these guys
ever go to prison.

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:08.237 align:middle line:90%
They never pay.

00:21:08.237 --> 00:21:10.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, their corporations,
like their bank,

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:14.240 align:middle line:84%
might get find $50
million or even $1 billion

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:18.690 align:middle line:84%
for having cheated the American
people in their mortgage loans.

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:19.380 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's good.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:22.310 align:middle line:84%
The bank's going to
pay $1 billion, right?

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:24.040 align:middle line:90%
Who's the bank?

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.700 align:middle line:90%
The investors in the bank.

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:28.230 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's the
Ma's and the Pa's that

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:29.832 align:middle line:84%
put their savings
in the bank stock

00:21:29.832 --> 00:21:32.040 align:middle line:84%
because they're trying to
put the kids through school

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.320 align:middle line:90%
or have a retirement fund.

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:35.790 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones
that pay the fine.

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:39.770 align:middle line:84%
The executives who made
the decision get a bonus.

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:41.250 align:middle line:90%
They don't go to prison.

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:42.840 align:middle line:90%
They get a promotion.

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:44.290 align:middle line:90%
And they go on to the next job.

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And they say, [KISSES] thank
you, you guys in the Congress.

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:47.710 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:48.876 align:middle line:90%
That worked out pretty well.

00:21:48.876 --> 00:21:50.150 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it again.

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:52.370 align:middle line:84%
That's why all these
things keep coming up.

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:53.780 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're learning.

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:55.580 align:middle line:90%
Is it the smoking gun?

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:59.920 align:middle line:84%
I guess you would call it
the stinking garbage more

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.160 align:middle line:90%
than anything else.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm glad to see it
happening, not because it's

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:06.620 align:middle line:84%
happening, but because
it's so visible now

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:08.870 align:middle line:84%
that maybe the American
people will wake up

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:12.520 align:middle line:84%
and say, things are not exactly
what I've been told they are.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:18.130 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: Ed, why are the NSA
listening to our phone calls?

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:22.100 align:middle line:10%
Are they really just looking
for a bunch of guys hiding out

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:25.560 align:middle line:10%
in caves in Afghanistan trying
to smuggle in box cutters

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:29.170 align:middle line:10%
through airport
security and TSA?

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:31.480 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't add up for me.

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.380 align:middle line:84%
To listen to
everybody's phone call,

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:37.550 align:middle line:84%
there must be some
deeper agenda going on.

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:40.130 align:middle line:90%
So what are they doing?

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:42.260 align:middle line:90%
And who are these people?

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:46.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: The NSA is
the American version

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:51.440 align:middle line:84%
of the spy agencies for a
collectivist government, which

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:56.330 align:middle line:84%
means the government is
moving toward a goal, which

00:22:56.330 --> 00:23:01.090 align:middle line:84%
is the absolute domination
and control over all citizens.

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:04.020 align:middle line:84%
There are similar agencies
in other government,

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:07.910 align:middle line:84%
maybe not as well funded or
as big, but Germany has one,

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:13.660 align:middle line:84%
France has one, Russia has
a huge one, England has one.

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:17.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean any, nation with a
little extra money in its budget

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:20.550 align:middle line:84%
has got a similar
agency to the NSA.

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:22.090 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:23.740 align:middle line:90%
Are they looking for terrorists?

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:24.534 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:23:24.534 --> 00:23:25.450 align:middle line:90%
That's their pretense.

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:28.030 align:middle line:90%


00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:30.160 align:middle line:84%
What they're trying to
do is build a mechanism

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:35.354 align:middle line:84%
whereby they can spot
people like you and me.

00:23:35.354 --> 00:23:36.770 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they
know where we are.

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:38.020 align:middle line:90%
We're kind of out in the open.

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:40.230 align:middle line:84%
But they can spot people
like the guy next door,

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:44.860 align:middle line:84%
who may think the same things
that we do but he's not visible

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:45.660 align:middle line:90%
yet.

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:50.450 align:middle line:84%
They want to know who everybody
is that is asking questions

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:52.104 align:middle line:90%
like we're asking.

00:23:52.104 --> 00:23:53.770 align:middle line:84%
They want to know who
are the people who

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:57.032 align:middle line:84%
are not content with
the present system.

00:23:57.032 --> 00:23:59.240 align:middle line:84%
They want to know who are
the people that likely will

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:01.902 align:middle line:90%
demand reform, real reform.

00:24:01.902 --> 00:24:03.610 align:middle line:84%
They want to know who
it is that possibly

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:06.890 align:middle line:84%
might offer some kind
of physical resistance.

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:09.390 align:middle line:84%
They want to know
who owns the guns.

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:13.240 align:middle line:84%
They want to know what political
parties that people belong to

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:16.596 align:middle line:84%
and who they vote for and
what churches they go to.

00:24:16.596 --> 00:24:17.970 align:middle line:84%
They want to know
how they think.

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:18.990 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:21.840 align:middle line:84%
It's because they want
to spot the people who

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:27.110 align:middle line:84%
have to be put away--
that's as bluntly

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:30.710 align:middle line:84%
as I know how to say it--
people that need to be put away,

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:32.440 align:middle line:84%
need to be taken
off the streets,

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.790 align:middle line:84%
have to be put in
prisons or worse.

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:38.000 align:middle line:84%
They do not want those
people roaming around,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.680 align:middle line:84%
because they know that's
the vulnerable point

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.660 align:middle line:90%
of their regime, their control.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:45.520 align:middle line:84%
They know things like
that are possible.

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.180 align:middle line:84%
They believe that
they're coming.

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:49.330 align:middle line:90%
In fact, this is no secret.

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:51.630 align:middle line:84%
This isn't even a controversial
thing that I'm saying.

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:55.500 align:middle line:84%
It sounds blunt and harsh,
but everybody's saying it.

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:58.380 align:middle line:84%
You can go to the
United Nations,

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:00.240 align:middle line:84%
and you can read
report after report

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:03.684 align:middle line:84%
after report of how they
must prepare for civil unrest

00:25:03.684 --> 00:25:05.100 align:middle line:84%
in all the countries
of the world,

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:09.340 align:middle line:84%
because the people are getting--
the natives are restless.

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:11.200 align:middle line:90%
The people are uprising.

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.140 align:middle line:84%
We've seen riots
and demonstrations,

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:14.640 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
see more of that.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.655 align:middle line:90%
And they know that.

00:25:16.655 --> 00:25:17.280 align:middle line:90%
They know that.

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:20.910 align:middle line:84%
You go to any major city and go
down to the police department,

00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:24.460 align:middle line:84%
go your state headquarters, go
to the law enforcement agency,

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:27.440 align:middle line:84%
and you'll see report
after report saying,

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.860 align:middle line:90%
prepare for civil violence.

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:32.460 align:middle line:84%
People are getting angry
with their governments.

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:33.357 align:middle line:90%
Prepare for it.

00:25:33.357 --> 00:25:34.440 align:middle line:90%
This is not controversial.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:36.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying this is
what everybody knows.

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:38.910 align:middle line:84%
So when you ask the
question, "Why do they

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:42.040 align:middle line:84%
have these spy operations
going?" it makes sense.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.660 align:middle line:84%
They want to know who
it is that's going

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:47.640 align:middle line:84%
to cause the problem
so they can possibly

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:51.530 align:middle line:84%
prevent it or deal with it
in a very efficient manner.

00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:53.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: For me, this is
liberating information.

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:56.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't get scared when I have
these kind of conversations.

00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:59.360 align:middle line:84%
You can see how much
G. Edward Griffin and I

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:01.330 align:middle line:90%
are smiling as we're talking.

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why is that
the truth will set you free.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:09.070 align:middle line:84%
I do believe in a spiritual
purpose to this universe.

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:11.810 align:middle line:84%
I believe in a just
and loving creator.

00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that even
as scary as this looks,

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.550 align:middle line:84%
this cartel has been
allowed to exist.

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:20.690 align:middle line:84%
It's written into the great
ancient texts like the Bible

00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:24.530 align:middle line:84%
that the devil would take
over dominion of the Earth.

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:27.280 align:middle line:84%
But this does
appear to be a sort

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:31.220 align:middle line:84%
of philosophical,
apocryphal, roundabout way

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.930 align:middle line:84%
of saying things in a
metaphorical language that

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:36.580 align:middle line:90%
is now being literally seen.

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:39.010 align:middle line:84%
That may sound awful Christian
and Bible-banging to you,

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:40.680 align:middle line:84%
but all the ancient
traditions spoke

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:44.090 align:middle line:84%
about a time of great darkness,
great corruption on Earth,

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:47.352 align:middle line:84%
that would then pave the
way for a golden age.

00:26:47.352 --> 00:26:49.310 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode,
we're going to bring it up

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:52.830 align:middle line:84%
into the 20th century
with the Federal Reserve

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:55.880 align:middle line:84%
and all of the ways in which
the things that we've learned

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.340 align:middle line:84%
consolidate into
what we know now.

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:01.650 align:middle line:84%
That's coming up next
time here on "Disclosure."

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:05.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, David Wilcock,
speaking truth to power

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:07.970 align:middle line:90%
and giving power to the truth.

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:11.920 align:middle line:90%
