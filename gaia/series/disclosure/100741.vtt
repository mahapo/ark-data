>>DAVID WILCOCK:
I'm David Wilcock,

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.450 align:middle line:10%
and I want you to join me on
an adventure of disclosure.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.700 align:middle line:10%
That's our show, and
this is the episode

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.520 align:middle line:10%
that ties together our whole
ancient history miniseries.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.360 align:middle line:10%
Graham Hancock is the author
who became the center of gravity

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.330 align:middle line:10%
after writing
"Fingerprints of the Gods"

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.280 align:middle line:10%
that pulled all these
different scholars together

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.800 align:middle line:10%
who we've been interviewing,
Andrew Collins,

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.450 align:middle line:10%
Laird Scranton more
recently, John Anthony West,

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.690 align:middle line:10%
Robert Bauval, and also the
geologist Robert Schoch,

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.450 align:middle line:10%
who talked about
the water weathering

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.390 align:middle line:10%
on the back end of the Sphinx
and said this clearly could not

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.880 align:middle line:10%
have been done
any time recently.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.150 align:middle line:84%
It requires many, many thousands
of years of rainfall and water

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.510 align:middle line:84%
washing over these
rocks in order

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.290 align:middle line:84%
to account for the
erosion that we see.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is a paradigm shift
in every sense of the word.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.120 align:middle line:84%
The things that
we thought we knew

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.640 align:middle line:84%
about ancient civilizations
are being upturned.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.570 align:middle line:84%
The evidence of Gobekli Tepe
in East Anatolia, Turkey,

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.620 align:middle line:84%
is an undeniable
smoking gun that

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:33.450 align:middle line:84%
shows Stonehenge-like monuments,
23 to 24 stone rings of them,

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.930 align:middle line:84%
each of which the stones
weigh 10 to 15 tons,

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.650 align:middle line:84%
and we know that they
were found in soil

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.640 align:middle line:84%
that had been undisturbed
for at least 10,000 years.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Mainstream archaeologists
are not denying that.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.990 align:middle line:84%
The story gets
even stranger when

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.600 align:middle line:84%
we look at the Giza alignment
that Robert Bauval originally

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.520 align:middle line:84%
discovered, and then Hancock
and Bauval wrote books together

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.270 align:middle line:84%
about, the Orion
correlation theory

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.930 align:middle line:84%
showing that the alignment
was fixed in 10,500 BC, which

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.400 align:middle line:84%
precisely correlates with the
time of a global catastrophe

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.030 align:middle line:90%
called the Younger Dryas period.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, we've heard
that Hancock believes

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.300 align:middle line:84%
that it was a comet impact
that might have hit the earth

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.720 align:middle line:84%
and caused it to shift
in its equilibrium.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.550 align:middle line:84%
We've heard John Anthony
West siding on the idea

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.980 align:middle line:84%
that it might have been
some sort of solar event,

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.490 align:middle line:90%
a coronal mass ejection.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.240 align:middle line:84%
But what we do know is
that there is platinum

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.720 align:middle line:84%
and there is nano diamonds
and things in the Earth that

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.650 align:middle line:84%
clearly show that something
catastrophic happened

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.230 align:middle line:84%
at this time, and we
can pinpoint it down

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.310 align:middle line:90%
to exactly when it took place.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.700 align:middle line:84%
So Graham Hancock does
us a great service

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.340 align:middle line:84%
here of tying together
all the different pieces

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.390 align:middle line:84%
of what we've been talking about
throughout this miniseries.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.230 align:middle line:84%
Bring in the concept of
underground tunneling

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.210 align:middle line:84%
under the Giza Plateau, of who
these people might have been,

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.280 align:middle line:84%
and of how the legend
of their civilization

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.530 align:middle line:84%
still survives in a trail of
tangible scientific evidence

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.990 align:middle line:84%
that we can look
at and completely

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:21.070 align:middle line:84%
dismiss the skeptical, old
school view of civilization

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.840 align:middle line:84%
starting as hunter-gatherers and
gradually working its way up.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.290 align:middle line:84%
We now have to
seriously consider

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.730 align:middle line:84%
that civilization attained
a very high level, including

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.020 align:middle line:84%
high technology that may well
exceed what we have today

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.420 align:middle line:84%
by orders of magnitude, and
that they were all wiped out,

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.770 align:middle line:84%
and we had to rebuild
ourselves from scratch.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Here it is, summarizing this
part of "Disclosure" that

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.940 align:middle line:84%
will help us to start to launch
into the next section, where

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.960 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be talking
more about the cabal,

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.560 align:middle line:84%
about the alleged inheritors
of these secret ancient mystery

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.060 align:middle line:84%
traditions, and how
they begin to take over

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.540 align:middle line:84%
the planet with the Roman
Empire and so much more.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.240 align:middle line:84%
But first, we're going
to tie it all together

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.970 align:middle line:84%
and put a nice ribbon
on it to finish out

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.970 align:middle line:90%
our section on ancient history.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.650 align:middle line:90%
This is "Disclosure."

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.860 align:middle line:84%
I invite you to take
this journey of the mind

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.240 align:middle line:84%
with me as I interview
Graham Hancock.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.920 align:middle line:90%
I hope you enjoy it.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.100 align:middle line:84%
So could you summarize
for us Robert Bauval?

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.360 align:middle line:84%
He sees the three
pyramids in Giza,

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.239 align:middle line:84%
and he has an
insight about what?

00:04:28.239 --> 00:04:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM HANCOCK: Let
me say at the outset,

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.404 align:middle line:84%
Robert is a close
friend of mind,

00:04:31.404 --> 00:04:33.989 align:middle line:84%
and Robert and I have worked
together for many, many years

00:04:33.989 --> 00:04:35.780 align:middle line:84%
and co-authored a number
of books together.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.910 align:middle line:10%
But I would say in future
generations, 200 years

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.680 align:middle line:10%
from now, the name
of Robert Bauval

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.640 align:middle line:10%
will be remembered as one
of those individuals who

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.850 align:middle line:10%
made a key breakthrough
discovery about ancient Egypt,

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.000 align:middle line:10%
which change forever our
understanding of ancient Egypt.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And that breakthrough discovery
in some ways is very simple.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.150 align:middle line:84%
See, Robert is a construction
engineer abide by training.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.520 align:middle line:84%
He looks at buildings from the
a very technical point of view.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.670 align:middle line:84%
But he also has a deep
interest in astronomy.

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.920 align:middle line:84%
Robert has been studying
astronomy for decades.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And one day out
in the desert, it

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.760 align:middle line:84%
struck him that there was
an uncanny resemblance

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.532 align:middle line:84%
between the three stars
of the belt of Orion

00:05:17.532 --> 00:05:19.490 align:middle line:84%
and the three pyramids,
the layout of the three

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.300 align:middle line:90%
pyramids on the ground.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, many would say, oh,
you can match up stars

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.660 align:middle line:90%
to any three buildings.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:27.810 align:middle line:90%
It must be random.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.570 align:middle line:84%
But no, it's not random, because
the constellation of Orion

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.250 align:middle line:84%
was seen by the ancient
Egyptians as the figure

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.210 align:middle line:90%
in the sky of their god Osiris.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.404 align:middle line:84%
This was a very
special consolation

00:05:38.404 --> 00:05:40.070 align:middle line:84%
to the ancient
Egyptians, and indeed, he

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.620 align:middle line:84%
was the god who ruled
over the kingdom

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.920 align:middle line:84%
of the Duat, the
afterlife kingdom

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.090 align:middle line:84%
to which our souls
travel after death

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.560 align:middle line:90%
in the ancient Egyptian view.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And whatever else
the Giza Plateau is,

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.460 align:middle line:84%
it's definitely a place
that's consecrated

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.740 align:middle line:84%
to that quest for
immortality that

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.600 align:middle line:84%
was at the heart of the ancient
Egyptian system of religion.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.570 align:middle line:84%
So it makes perfect
sense that they

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:06.340 align:middle line:84%
would seek to copy on the
ground that figure in the sky.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, there are texts in
the ancient Egyptian pyramid

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.800 align:middle line:84%
texts and the ancient
Egyptian "Book of the Dead"

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.090 align:middle line:84%
which speak off the
hidden circle of the Duat

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.680 align:middle line:84%
and of copying it
upon the ground

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.310 align:middle line:84%
and of how there is
merit to be gained

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.270 align:middle line:84%
for he who makes this
perfect copy on the ground

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.830 align:middle line:90%
of that region of the sky.

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So just the
kindergarten level,

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.140 align:middle line:84%
what is the relationship
between the belt

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.460 align:middle line:90%
stars and the pyramids?

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.260 align:middle line:90%
How do we see it?

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:33.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: If you
are an artist, OK,

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.200 align:middle line:84%
and you're looking south at
the constellation of Orion

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.530 align:middle line:84%
in the sky, and you have
your easel in front of you

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.070 align:middle line:84%
with a piece of paper on it,
you draw the three pyramids

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.120 align:middle line:90%
on that piece of paper.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.810 align:middle line:84%
Sorry you draw-- see how
closely the connection is?

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.511 align:middle line:84%
You draw the three stars
on that piece of paper.

00:06:49.511 --> 00:06:51.010 align:middle line:84%
Then you take the
piece of paper off

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:53.570 align:middle line:84%
and you lay it down
this way on the ground.

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.370 align:middle line:90%
That's what you see at Giza.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.280 align:middle line:84%
Those three pyramids
are effectively

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.980 align:middle line:84%
a three-dimensional drawing
of those three stars laid down

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:01.580 align:middle line:90%
on the ground.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And if you measured
the brightness of the star

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.030 align:middle line:84%
by the width of the star,
how would that work?

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.446 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Magnitudes
of the stars

00:07:07.446 --> 00:07:09.560 align:middle line:84%
work out exactly with the
magnitudes of the three

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.090 align:middle line:90%
pyramids.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:11.631 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So the
width of the pyramids

00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:13.430 align:middle line:84%
corresponds to the
magnitude of the stars.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: To the magnitudes
of those three stars.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.920 align:middle line:90%
But here's the mysterious thing.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.620 align:middle line:84%
Because of the phenomenon
called precession,

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.200 align:middle line:84%
the wobble on the axis of
the Earth, which changes.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.054 align:middle line:84%
From our perspective
viewing the stars,

00:07:26.054 --> 00:07:27.470 align:middle line:84%
the Earth is our
viewing platform,

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.430 align:middle line:84%
so if it's wobbling,
that viewing platform,

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.050 align:middle line:84%
it changes the positions
of the stars down the ages

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:36.720 align:middle line:84%
according to a cycle, because
it's a cyclical wobble.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.950 align:middle line:84%
The best match,
the perfect match

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.240 align:middle line:84%
between the stars
of the belt of Orion

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:47.290 align:middle line:84%
and the three pyramids on the
ground occurs not in 2,500 BC,

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:51.580 align:middle line:84%
but in 10,500 BC, 12 and
1/2 thousand years ago,

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.340 align:middle line:84%
and that brings us back
to precisely that period

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:57.040 align:middle line:84%
of dramatic, cataclysmic
change on the Earth

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.670 align:middle line:84%
that geologists call
the Younger Dryas.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:01.480 align:middle line:84%
It's as though a
huge effort is being

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.920 align:middle line:84%
put to mark that
date and that time

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.210 align:middle line:84%
and to use the universal
language of astronomy

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:11.350 align:middle line:84%
with enduring architecture
to memorialize that forever

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:12.716 align:middle line:90%
and to draw our attention to it.

00:08:12.716 --> 00:08:14.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now, a
skeptic could say

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:17.292 align:middle line:84%
you can find Jesus' face in
a Jackson Pollock painting.

00:08:17.292 --> 00:08:18.750 align:middle line:84%
So you've got these
three pyramids.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.390 align:middle line:84%
OK, maybe they
look like the stars

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:23.210 align:middle line:84%
of Orion belt. That's
just a conspiracy theory.

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:24.520 align:middle line:90%
So does he have any other data?

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah, indeed
skeptics do say that.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:30.340 align:middle line:84%
But what rules that
out is, first of all,

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:33.580 align:middle line:84%
as I've mentioned, that Orion
isn't any old constellation.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:38.450 align:middle line:84%
Orion is Osiris to the ancient
Egyptians, the god of the dead.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, that
there are shafts

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:44.330 align:middle line:90%
emerging from the Great Pyramid.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.530 align:middle line:84%
There are two emerged
from the king's chamber,

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:48.820 align:middle line:84%
and they actually do come
through the entire body

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.120 align:middle line:84%
of the pyramid and
emerge on the outside.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And there are two that emerge
from the queen's chamber

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.140 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And the southern shaft
of the queen's chamber

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:02.480 align:middle line:90%
targets the star Sirius.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.760 align:middle line:84%
And the southern shaft
of the king's chamber

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.380 align:middle line:84%
targets one of the stars
in the belt of Orion.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.840 align:middle line:90%
So there's a multiple lock here.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.270 align:middle line:84%
It's not just that
the appearance

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:17.120 align:middle line:84%
of the pyramids on the
ground is like the appearance

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.590 align:middle line:84%
of the stars of
the belt of Orion.

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:22.860 align:middle line:84%
It's not just that
Orion was Osirus.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.440 align:middle line:10%
It's also that there are very
precisely aligned shafts which

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.680 align:middle line:10%
target this key area of
the sky because, of course,

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.740 align:middle line:10%
Siruis is Isis, the
consort of the god Osiris.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.970 align:middle line:84%
They're locking
in to these stars

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:37.330 align:middle line:90%
in multiple different ways.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Are there any
other geological features

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.140 align:middle line:84%
or buildings in Egypt that
might also fit this pattern?

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:47.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: The whole pyramid
field around the Giza Plateau,

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:51.700 align:middle line:84%
right down as far as
Dahshur, fits this pattern

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:52.830 align:middle line:90%
of stars in the sky.

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is the
work of Robert Bauval.

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:56.860 align:middle line:84%
It's very important
to make that clear.

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.230 align:middle line:84%
This is the breakthrough
that Robert-- now, Robert

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:01.250 align:middle line:84%
has taken a lot of stick from
Egyptologists and their friends

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:03.280 align:middle line:84%
in the media, but
I have no doubt

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:07.710 align:middle line:84%
that Robert is right about
this and that in time to come,

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:10.390 align:middle line:84%
he will be recognized
as the man who

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:12.200 align:middle line:84%
made the fundamental
breakthrough

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.980 align:middle line:84%
in our understanding of Egypt,
that this is the key that

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:16.846 align:middle line:90%
unlocks the mystery.

00:10:16.846 --> 00:10:18.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So many of
the brightest stars

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:21.590 align:middle line:84%
of the consolation
Orion and its neighbors

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:24.520 align:middle line:84%
actually have pyramids in those
exact locations on the surface.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yes, they do.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And the Nile River
is a part of this, too.

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:28.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: The Nile
River is a part of it.

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:31.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not saying that
whoever made the Giza Plateau

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.690 align:middle line:84%
monuments put the
Nile River there,

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:38.730 align:middle line:84%
but I am saying that they chose
that site because the Nile

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:40.480 align:middle line:90%
River was there.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.040 align:middle line:84%
If you go back to a very
particular moment, which

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:50.320 align:middle line:84%
is the spring equinox at dawn
in 10,500 BC, what you find

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.560 align:middle line:84%
is that, of course, as
always occurs on the equinox,

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:56.300 align:middle line:84%
the sun is rising
perfectly due east in line

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:58.300 align:middle line:90%
with the gaze of the Sphinx.

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.400 align:middle line:84%
Above the sun is
the constellation

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:04.200 align:middle line:84%
of Leo, the celestial
lion, the counterpart

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.540 align:middle line:90%
of the lion-bodied Sphinx.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.480 align:middle line:90%
As above, so below.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And at exactly the moment that
the sun bisects the horizon,

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:16.290 align:middle line:84%
due south on the meridian
lies the belt of Orion,

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:18.410 align:middle line:90%
sitting on the meridian.

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:23.530 align:middle line:84%
And between the two,
we have the Milky Way

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:29.260 align:middle line:84%
exactly mirrored by the
Nile River on the ground.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.730 align:middle line:84%
Somebody was going around
the world looking for a place

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:34.930 align:middle line:84%
where they could create
a gigantic diagram that

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:38.010 align:middle line:84%
summarized the sky at
that particular moment,

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:39.960 align:middle line:90%
and that place was Giza.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So the belt of Orion is
just to the right of the Milky

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:45.312 align:middle line:84%
Way, if the Milky Way is
like a vertical line--

00:11:45.312 --> 00:11:47.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Yes, it stands on
the West Bank of the Milky Way

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:50.181 align:middle line:84%
as the pyramids stand on
the West Bank of the Nile.

00:11:50.181 --> 00:11:51.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So the
Nile River perfectly

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.740 align:middle line:84%
corresponds to the strip
we call the Milky Way.

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Yes, perfectly
corresponds in 10,500 BC

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.490 align:middle line:90%
at dawn on the spring equinox.

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:03.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And Leo is
there on the horizon,

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:04.974 align:middle line:90%
and the Sphinx is a lion.

00:12:04.974 --> 00:12:07.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: The Sphinx is a
lion, and the Sphinx is looking

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:08.556 align:middle line:90%
at the constellation of Leo.

00:12:08.556 --> 00:12:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And I and other
researchers in this field

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:12.830 align:middle line:84%
believe that the
Sphinx was originally

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:16.860 align:middle line:84%
not only a lion-bodied but
also a lion-headed monument,

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:18.790 align:middle line:84%
and that probably in the
time of the pharaohs,

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:20.620 align:middle line:84%
they recarved the
head of the Sphinx

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.100 align:middle line:84%
into the familiar human
form that it has today.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.457 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And we were in the
Age of Leo during the time

00:12:25.457 --> 00:12:27.040 align:middle line:84%
that that original
alignment happened.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.581 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Yes,
because the character

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:31.850 align:middle line:84%
of the astrological
age is thought

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:33.820 align:middle line:84%
to be defined by the
constellation that

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:38.070 align:middle line:84%
houses the sun on the
equinox in any one time.

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:40.510 align:middle line:84%
We've been living for the
last 2000 and a bit years

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:42.740 align:middle line:84%
in the age of
Pisces, because it's

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.900 align:middle line:84%
the fish, the
constellation of Pisces,

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:49.069 align:middle line:84%
that the sun rises against the
background of in our epoch.

00:12:49.069 --> 00:12:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we live in the
dawning of the Age of Aquarius,

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:54.640 align:middle line:84%
because Aquarius by
procession is being shifted

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.510 align:middle line:84%
to house the sun and will house
the sun for the next 2,000

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:00.630 align:middle line:90%
plus years.

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:04.096 align:middle line:84%
That's why, if you go back
before the time of Christ,

00:13:04.096 --> 00:13:05.970 align:middle line:84%
you'll find that the
predominant symbolism is

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:10.580 align:middle line:84%
to do with rams, because
that was the age of Aries.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:11.810 align:middle line:90%
Rams are everywhere.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:13.660 align:middle line:84%
The ram-headed
sphinx is actually

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.270 align:middle line:84%
in the Temple of
Karnak for example.

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:16.410 align:middle line:90%
Go back further.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:18.492 align:middle line:90%
It's the age of Taurus.

00:13:18.492 --> 00:13:20.200 align:middle line:84%
Everything is about
bulls in that period,

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.160 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the
Minotaur in Crete,

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.025 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the
Apis Bull in Egypt.

00:13:26.025 --> 00:13:27.400 align:middle line:84%
You'd have to be
astronomically--

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Mithraism
with the Tauroctany

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:30.520 align:middle line:84%
where they're
slaughtering the bull.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:31.145 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yes.

00:13:31.145 --> 00:13:34.100 align:middle line:84%
You'd have to be astronomically
illiterate, which

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:37.190 align:middle line:84%
the ancient Egyptians were
certainly not, to build

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:39.580 align:middle line:84%
an equinoxial
marker with the body

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.190 align:middle line:90%
of a lion in the Age of Taurus.

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:44.440 align:middle line:84%
That's when the Sphinx is
supposed to have been built,

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.330 align:middle line:84%
2,500 BC, smack in the
middle of the Age of Taurus.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.080 align:middle line:84%
You're going to build
an equinoxial marker

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.871 align:middle line:84%
in that the epoch,
you're going to build it

00:13:50.871 --> 00:13:52.420 align:middle line:90%
in the form of a bull.

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.170 align:middle line:84%
But it's not in
the form of a bull.

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:55.640 align:middle line:90%
It's in the form of a lion.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And that speaks
to the Age of Leo.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And the Age of Leo is right back
there in that mysterious window

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:05.280 align:middle line:84%
between 12,000 and
13,000 years ago,

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.646 align:middle line:90%
between 10,000 BC and 11,000 BC.

00:14:07.646 --> 00:14:09.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So let's just
throw the numbers out there.

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:12.159 align:middle line:84%
The precession moves by one
degree every 72 years, right?

00:14:12.159 --> 00:14:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: One degree
every 72 years.

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:14.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So what does
that actually mean?

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.438 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Well,
what that means is

00:14:16.438 --> 00:14:18.380 align:middle line:84%
that the sun passes
through an entire house

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:21.130 align:middle line:90%
of the zodiac in 2,160 years.

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:23.180 align:middle line:90%
That's 30 times 72.

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:25.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So that's
the age of the zodiac.

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: And what it means
is that your great year, when

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.700 align:middle line:84%
the sun will transit all
the 12 houses of the zodiac,

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:36.270 align:middle line:90%
unfolds in 25,920 years.

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Then the clock resets, and
you're back where you started.

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:40.807 align:middle line:90%
Because it's a cycle.

00:14:40.807 --> 00:14:42.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So the Earth
is spinning like this.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:43.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: It's
wobbling like a top.

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:45.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But then
at the same time--

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:48.506 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: See--
the spring equinox

00:14:48.506 --> 00:14:52.220 align:middle line:84%
is signaled by the moment when
the Earth on its tilted axis

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.390 align:middle line:90%
is broadside on to the sun.

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:56.090 align:middle line:84%
And the question is,
what constellation

00:14:56.090 --> 00:15:00.010 align:middle line:84%
is lying behind the
sun at that point, OK?

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:03.600 align:middle line:84%
But because the axis is
doing this very slowly,

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.670 align:middle line:84%
the moment in the Earth's orbit
around the sun at which it lies

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:09.830 align:middle line:84%
broadside onto the sun shifts
at the rate of one degree

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:11.400 align:middle line:90%
every 72 years.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And that means that
there's a backward movement

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:16.250 align:middle line:84%
through the zodiac, the opposite
direction to the direction

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:17.730 align:middle line:84%
that we calculate
the zodiac when

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:19.810 align:middle line:90%
we look at our birth signs.

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:22.330 align:middle line:84%
It goes backwards
through the zodiac.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:26.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So if somebody gave you
and me like a $5 billion grant

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:30.756 align:middle line:84%
and we could build a pyramid--
we barely have the technology

00:15:30.756 --> 00:15:31.380 align:middle line:90%
to pull it off.

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:32.960 align:middle line:90%
We get $5 billion.

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And we want to align our
pyramid with a star in the night

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:39.210 align:middle line:84%
sky, what's going to
happen after 72 years?

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:41.475 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: It's going to change.

00:15:41.475 --> 00:15:43.350 align:middle line:84%
It's most noticeable at
the pole, by the way.

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:46.017 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we call our
pole stop Polaris

00:15:46.017 --> 00:15:48.100 align:middle line:84%
because that's the nearest
star to which the north

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:49.404 align:middle line:90%
pole of the Earth points.

00:15:49.404 --> 00:15:50.820 align:middle line:84%
But the north pole
of the Earth is

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:53.990 align:middle line:84%
doing that as well, which
means that it won't always

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:56.989 align:middle line:84%
point at Polaris and it hasn't
always pointed at Polaris.

00:15:56.989 --> 00:15:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it will point
at empty space, sometimes

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:01.120 align:middle line:90%
at other stars.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:06.080 align:middle line:84%
If we want to signal an epoch,
and if we are not confident

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.750 align:middle line:84%
that our language or the
documents in which we express

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:11.420 align:middle line:84%
our language will survive
for thousands of years

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:14.500 align:middle line:84%
into the future, the best
possible way we could do it

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:18.310 align:middle line:84%
would be to create a
gigantic work of architecture

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:20.840 align:middle line:84%
and to build a star
map into it that

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:25.520 align:middle line:84%
freezes the skies above
the monument at the moment

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.400 align:middle line:90%
that the monument was completed.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And this isn't even theoretical,
because it was actually

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.880 align:middle line:84%
done at the Hoover Dam
in the United States,

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:36.190 align:middle line:84%
where indeed Oscar Hanson
created a star map, which

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:38.440 align:middle line:84%
freezes the stars
above the Hoover Dam

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.880 align:middle line:84%
at the moment the
Hoover Dam was completed

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.160 align:middle line:84%
with the specific objective
that in 10,000 years

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.390 align:middle line:84%
time, those with the
knowledge of precession

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:50.028 align:middle line:84%
would be able to understand
when this gigantic structure was

00:16:50.028 --> 00:16:51.070 align:middle line:90%
made.

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:53.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And they put this
right next to the pyramids.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.615 align:middle line:84%
They put this big, giant
sculpture of a lion.

00:16:56.615 --> 00:16:57.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yes.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.540 align:middle line:90%
That's there because that's--

00:16:58.540 --> 00:16:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Such a
slap in the face.

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:01.016 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: It's such
a slap in the face.

00:17:01.016 --> 00:17:02.470 align:middle line:90%
That is as above, so below.

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:04.880 align:middle line:84%
That is speaking
to sky and ground

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:09.940 align:middle line:84%
and creating a monument
which can be decoded.

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:13.980 align:middle line:84%
I actually think we're only
at the edge of decoding it.

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:16.034 align:middle line:84%
Robert has revealed
the first key.

00:17:16.034 --> 00:17:17.950 align:middle line:84%
But there will be more
decoding to take place.

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:19.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now,
there's also a stele.

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:21.750 align:middle line:84%
There's like a shield at
the front of the Sphinx.

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:22.702 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah.

00:17:22.702 --> 00:17:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And it's got
inscriptions on it.

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:26.701 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Well, that was
put there by the Thutmose IV.

00:17:26.701 --> 00:17:28.319 align:middle line:90%
It's called the Dream Stele.

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:31.440 align:middle line:90%
It dates from the new kingdom.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.550 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's
not contemporary, even

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.880 align:middle line:84%
with the orthodox
date for the Sphinx.

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.470 align:middle line:90%
The orthodox date is 2,500 BC.

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:41.365 align:middle line:84%
Dream Stele's put there a good
1,100 years later than that.

00:17:41.365 --> 00:17:43.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But this is what your
skeptics are going to say.

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:45.366 align:middle line:90%
Well, the stele, da-da-da-da.

00:17:45.366 --> 00:17:46.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Well,
the stele itself

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.656 align:middle line:84%
is one of the worst
arguments for the skeptics

00:17:48.656 --> 00:17:51.020 align:middle line:90%
to use for two reasons.

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:54.320 align:middle line:84%
Firstly, the line--
you see, the stele

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:58.450 align:middle line:84%
used to contain the
word or the name khaf,

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:00.820 align:middle line:84%
just a single syllable
khaf, on, I think,

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:02.070 align:middle line:90%
the 13th line of the stele.

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:03.780 align:middle line:90%
It was still there in the 1900s.

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:04.770 align:middle line:90%
It's not there anymore.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:06.240 align:middle line:90%
It's worn off.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:11.350 align:middle line:84%
From that single syllable khaf
on the so-called Dream Stele,

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:15.930 align:middle line:84%
Egyptologists concluded that
Thutmose IV some 1,100 years

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:18.310 align:middle line:84%
after the time of
Khafra was telling us

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:20.640 align:middle line:90%
that Khafra made the Sphinx.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.480 align:middle line:84%
He could equally well
have been telling us

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.777 align:middle line:90%
that Khafra restored the Spinx.

00:18:24.777 --> 00:18:27.110 align:middle line:84%
Because all we had was that
single syllable in the line.

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:29.840 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the
line was wiped, OK?

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And that syllable was not
inside a royal cartouche.

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:36.820 align:middle line:84%
So we can't even be sure that he
was referring to Khafra at all.

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:39.010 align:middle line:84%
So that stele as
evidence that Khafra

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:41.794 align:middle line:84%
build the Sphinx is very
poor evidence indeed.

00:18:41.794 --> 00:18:43.210 align:middle line:84%
And there's something
else on that

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:46.010 align:middle line:84%
stele, which is very
challenging to that, which

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:49.130 align:middle line:84%
is that that stele and
that line still survives,

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:52.560 align:middle line:84%
tells us that the Sphinx
marks the splendid place

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.610 align:middle line:90%
of the first time.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And the first time was
what the ancient Egyptians

00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:00.120 align:middle line:84%
called Zep Tepi, the
time when the gods walked

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:04.756 align:middle line:84%
the earth, a time cast far
back in the past, thousands

00:19:04.756 --> 00:19:06.380 align:middle line:84%
and thousands of
years ago in the past.

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And I and my colleagues who
have worked on this subject

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:12.889 align:middle line:84%
feel that they're looking at the
same epoch of 12,500 years ago.

00:19:12.889 --> 00:19:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I'm also going to
be interviewing John Anthony

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:17.990 align:middle line:84%
West, in fact, maybe just
in like a week and a half.

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Great.

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:21.604 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But I think his
data is very important.

00:19:21.604 --> 00:19:23.270 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to hear your
perspective on it.

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:25.019 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Well, just
as I've paid tribute

00:19:25.019 --> 00:19:28.360 align:middle line:84%
to Robert Bauval for his
fundamental breakthrough

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.710 align:middle line:84%
on the astronomy at
the Giza Plateau,

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:37.220 align:middle line:84%
I want to pay tribute to my dear
friend John Anthony West, who

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:41.730 align:middle line:84%
I would say has played the
single most important role

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:45.010 align:middle line:84%
in beginning to rewrite the
history of ancient Egypt.

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Because it was John West
who himself is enormously

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:52.960 align:middle line:84%
experienced in the
study of ancient Egypt.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.530 align:middle line:84%
It was John West
who first noticed

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:58.630 align:middle line:84%
that there was something
odd about the erosion

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:00.370 align:middle line:90%
of the Sphinx.

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And this he picked up as well
from his study of an earlier

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:05.310 align:middle line:84%
scholar called
Schwaller de Lubicz.

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:08.500 align:middle line:84%
John noticed that
there was erosion

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.070 align:middle line:84%
on the body of the Sphinx,
which didn't appear

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:12.760 align:middle line:90%
to have been caused by wind.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.000 align:middle line:84%
It looked more like water
erosion of some kind.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And it was John West who
brought Professor Robert

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:21.950 align:middle line:84%
Schoch, a geologist from Boston
University, to the Giza Plateau

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:23.590 align:middle line:90%
to study the Spinx.

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And between the two of them,
John West and Professor Robert

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:30.490 align:middle line:84%
Schoch, they were able to
establish that the Sphinx bears

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:33.040 align:middle line:84%
the mark of
precipitation-induced

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.210 align:middle line:84%
weathering, in other
words, that the Sphinx

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:39.589 align:middle line:84%
has been subjected to thousands
of years of heavy rainfall.

00:20:39.589 --> 00:20:40.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Sold hold on a second.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:44.940 align:middle line:84%
When we look at the rocks, we're
not seeing a nice sharp edge.

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:48.150 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing these smooth,
feminine curves, right?

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:50.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: You're seeing
curves with deep gullies cut

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:51.320 align:middle line:90%
into them.

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And those gullies are caused
by rainfall pouring off

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.560 align:middle line:84%
the body of the Spinx
and of the trench that

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:57.500 align:middle line:90%
surrounds the Sphinx.

00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And those deep gullies
are the classic marks

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:01.040 align:middle line:90%
of rainfall weathering.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is-- we have
to cut a long story short--

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:06.420 align:middle line:84%
that there was not
sufficient rainfall in Giza

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:09.320 align:middle line:84%
in the last 5,000
years to have caused

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.070 align:middle line:90%
those marks on the Sphinx.

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:13.190 align:middle line:84%
The study of
paleoclimatology tells us

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:14.730 align:middle line:84%
we have to go back
towards the end

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:18.250 align:middle line:84%
the last ice age, back indeed
towards that period of 12,000

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:23.080 align:middle line:84%
years ago or so to find
the heavy rainfall that

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.150 align:middle line:84%
could have caused that
erosion on the Sphinx.

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:27.270 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
astronomically, the Sphinx

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:31.040 align:middle line:84%
is speaking to the Age of Leo,
a lion-bodied monument looking

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:34.090 align:middle line:84%
at the constellation of Leo
at dawn on the spring equinox.

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And geologically, the
Sphinx is bearing the marks

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.170 align:middle line:90%
of very ancient weathering.

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:42.732 align:middle line:84%
So we now have two
different disciplines

00:21:42.732 --> 00:21:44.190 align:middle line:84%
brought to bear on
the Sphinx which

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:46.780 align:middle line:84%
suggest that the Sphinx is
much older than Egyptologists

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:47.280 align:middle line:90%
say it is.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And John Anthony West has
faced huge opposition.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:53.370 align:middle line:84%
But for years and
years and years,

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:57.130 align:middle line:84%
he has been pointing
out and making the case

00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:01.360 align:middle line:84%
that Egyptian civilization is
much older than Egyptologists

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:04.380 align:middle line:84%
allow and that we need
to take seriously what

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:06.780 align:middle line:90%
the Egyptians themselves said.

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:09.740 align:middle line:84%
John's fundamental
breakthrough is the recognition

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:11.670 align:middle line:90%
of the antiquity of the Sphinx.

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:15.840 align:middle line:84%
But beyond that, the solid,
detailed years of work

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.630 align:middle line:84%
that he's done on the
ancient Egyptian texts

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:22.330 align:middle line:84%
and the ancient Egyptian
system of ideas,

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:26.340 align:middle line:84%
symbolism within ancient
Egypt, has revealed to anybody

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:29.860 align:middle line:84%
with eyes to see that ancient
Egypt must be far, far older

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:31.920 align:middle line:84%
than the Egyptologists
tell us it is.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And John has just steadily
taken those Egyptologists

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.050 align:middle line:84%
on and so on their own
grounds, because he's

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:40.230 align:middle line:90%
a real expert on ancient Egypt.

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:42.484 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now, do we need
some advanced degree

00:22:42.484 --> 00:22:44.150 align:middle line:84%
to be able to see
this water weathering?

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:46.358 align:middle line:84%
If you take a picture of it
and show it to somebody--

00:22:46.358 --> 00:22:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: It's
obvious to anybody.

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:51.100 align:middle line:84%
It's obvious to anybody
with half a brain that's

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:54.040 align:middle line:84%
the Sphinx has been subjected
to heavy weathering.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, on the body of
the Sphinx itself,

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:58.080 align:middle line:84%
there's been a lot of
restoration work done.

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.530 align:middle line:84%
That restoration work is
still being done today.

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And oddly enough, it was
being done in the Old Kingdom

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:06.080 align:middle line:84%
when the Sphinx was
built, supposedly,

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.770 align:middle line:84%
according to those
Egyptologists who

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:10.850 align:middle line:84%
say the Sphinx was built
in 2,500 BC-- well, built--

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:11.550 align:middle line:90%
carved.

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:14.240 align:middle line:84%
My God, if the Sphinx
was carved in 2,500

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.670 align:middle line:84%
BC, why were they
restoring it in 2,500 BC?

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't that alone say
it's obviously older?

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:23.220 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the weathering
marks on the Sphinx itself

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:25.810 align:middle line:84%
are covered up by
later restorations.

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:27.750 align:middle line:84%
But on the trench
surrounding the Sphinx--

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:29.880 align:middle line:84%
the Sphinx is cut
out of the bedrock--

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.100 align:middle line:84%
and in separating the
core body of the Sphinx

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:35.200 align:middle line:84%
and revealing it to us, a huge
amount of bedrock was removed,

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.670 align:middle line:84%
and a trench was
left at either side.

00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:44.280 align:middle line:84%
There we see, and unrestored
in any way, the clear evidence

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:47.310 align:middle line:84%
of massive exposure to thousands
of years of heavy rainfall.

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And anybody can
get it immediately.

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:52.270 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't take an
advanced degree.

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:54.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What do they do
with all that extra rock?

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:56.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: They cut
it into huge blocks,

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.050 align:middle line:84%
and they moved it over
here to the Sphinx

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:02.570 align:middle line:84%
temple and the so-called
Valley Temple, the two

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:04.570 align:middle line:84%
megalithic temples that
stand beside the Sphinx.

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:05.986 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: When you
say huge blocks?

00:24:05.986 --> 00:24:06.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: 100 tons.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:07.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: 100 tons?

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.340 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: 100-ton blocks.

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:09.923 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Can we move
those around now?

00:24:09.923 --> 00:24:10.989 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yes, we can.

00:24:10.989 --> 00:24:11.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: How?

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:13.196 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: We can
move those around now.

00:24:13.196 --> 00:24:17.000 align:middle line:84%
There are cranes that could
easily move them and move

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.280 align:middle line:90%
larger weights.

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.940 align:middle line:84%
But it's a damn
difficult thing to do.

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And a huge effort
was made to produce

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:26.060 align:middle line:90%
these megalithic temples.

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:28.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, the evidence suggests
since the megalithic temples are

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:32.840 align:middle line:84%
made from gigantic
blocks that were cut out

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.400 align:middle line:84%
from around the
body of the Sphinx,

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.135 align:middle line:84%
if the Sphinx is 12 and
1/2 thousand years old--

00:24:37.135 --> 00:24:39.760 align:middle line:84%
and by the way, John thinks the
Sphinx is even older than that,

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.968 align:middle line:84%
and you'll no doubt get into
that in your discussion.

00:24:41.968 --> 00:24:45.430 align:middle line:84%
If the Sphinx is 12 and 1/2
thousand years old, so also

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:48.820 align:middle line:84%
are the megalithic temples
in front of the Sphinx.

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:52.280 align:middle line:84%
They are not dating from
the epoch of the pharaohs.

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:55.560 align:middle line:84%
They are dating from 12 and
1/2 thousand years ago as well.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And that means not only
the extraordinary feat

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.990 align:middle line:84%
of moving 100-ton blocks in
the time of the pharaohs,

00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:04.280 align:middle line:84%
we have to explain how that was
done 12 and 1/2 thousand years

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.770 align:middle line:90%
ago in the upper paleolithic.

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:09.970 align:middle line:84%
This, again, is a huge
challenge to the orthodox model

00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:10.690 align:middle line:90%
of history.

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So one
last thing I'd like

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:16.600 align:middle line:84%
to cover with you is that both
you and Rupert Sheldrake, who

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm interviewing
right after you,

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:20.860 align:middle line:84%
were actually silenced
and suppressed

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:25.390 align:middle line:84%
by TED, which appears to be
an open-minded institution.

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:28.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, are you angry at
TED for what they did?

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:30.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Not at all, no.

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm not in the least
bit angry with TED.

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What exactly
happened here?

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:34.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: I was a little
bit annoyed at the time.

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:36.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Rupert and
I were both invited

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.990 align:middle line:84%
to speak what's called a
TEDx conference in London.

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:41.420 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of
that conference was

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:45.030 align:middle line:90%
to challenge existing paradigms.

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And both of us
presented talks that

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.050 align:middle line:90%
were in line with that idea.

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:52.240 align:middle line:84%
We were challenging
existing paradigms.

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And we thought that that's
what TED was all about,

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:59.990 align:middle line:84%
seemed to be a fresh new way
of thinking about the world.

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:03.115 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, within
two weeks of our talks

00:26:03.115 --> 00:26:05.360 align:middle line:84%
being put online on the
TED YouTube channel,

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:06.660 align:middle line:90%
TED took them offline.

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:08.940 align:middle line:90%
They just deleted them.

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:09.960 align:middle line:90%
I got word of this.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.480 align:middle line:84%
I got advanced notice of
this by about 12 hours.

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to put out the
message on my Facebook pages.

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And I asked people
who-- because I

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.910 align:middle line:84%
don't have a lot of technical
expertise in this area.

00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:22.970 align:middle line:84%
I asked people who had
the technical expertise,

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:27.170 align:middle line:10%
In our society, if we
want to insult somebody,

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:28.580 align:middle line:10%
we call them a dreamer.

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:30.880 align:middle line:10%
In ancient societies,
that was praise.

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.780 align:middle line:10%
And we have erected
huge apparatuses

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:36.415 align:middle line:10%
of armed bureaucracies who
will invade our privacy,

00:26:36.415 --> 00:26:38.820 align:middle line:10%
who will break down our
doors, who will arrest us,

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:40.730 align:middle line:10%
who will send us to
prison, sometimes

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:44.140 align:middle line:10%
for years, for possessing even
small quantities of psilocybin

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:48.170 align:middle line:10%
or substances like DMT,
whether in its smokable form

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:49.870 align:middle line:10%
or in the ayahuasca brew.

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:51.900 align:middle line:10%
And yet ironically,
DMT is, we now

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:53.700 align:middle line:10%
know, a natural brain hormone.

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:55.560 align:middle line:10%
We all have it in our bodies.

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.260 align:middle line:10%
And it's just that
its function remains

00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:59.140 align:middle line:10%
unknown for lack of research.

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:01.100 align:middle line:10%
And it's not as
though our society

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:03.030 align:middle line:10%
is opposed in principle
to altered states

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:04.500 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness.

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:07.790 align:middle line:10%
I mean, billions are being
made by the unholy alliance

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:13.890 align:middle line:10%
of psychiatrists and Big Pharma
in the over-prescribing drugs

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:17.590 align:middle line:10%
to control so-called syndromes
like depression or attention

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:21.930 align:middle line:10%
deficit disorder
in teenage years.

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And we have a love affair
in our society with alcohol.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.780 align:middle line:84%
We glorify this
most boring of drugs

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:33.320 align:middle line:84%
despite the terrible
consequences that it often has.

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we love
our stimulants, our tea,

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.700 align:middle line:84%
our coffee, our energy
drinks, and our sugar.

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And huge industries are built
around these substances,

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:46.430 align:middle line:84%
which are valued because of the
way they alter consciousness.

00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:48.970 align:middle line:10%
But what all these approved
altered states of consciousness

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:50.500 align:middle line:10%
have in common is
that none of them

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:53.370 align:middle line:10%
contradict or conflict with the
basic state of consciousness

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:55.110 align:middle line:10%
valued by our society,
which I would call

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:57.690 align:middle line:10%
the alert, problem-solving
state of consciousness,

00:27:57.690 --> 00:28:00.630 align:middle line:10%
which is good for the more
mundane aspects of science.

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:02.922 align:middle line:84%
It's good for the
prosecution of warfare.

00:28:02.922 --> 00:28:03.880 align:middle line:90%
It's good for commerce.

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:05.180 align:middle line:90%
It's good for politics.

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:09.430 align:middle line:84%
But I think everybody realizes
that the promise of a society

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:12.620 align:middle line:84%
over-monopolistically based
upon this state of consciousness

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:17.550 align:middle line:84%
has proved hollow and that this
model is no longer working,

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:19.900 align:middle line:84%
that it's broken in
every possible sense

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:23.560 align:middle line:84%
that a model can be broken, and
that urgently we need to find

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:25.027 align:middle line:90%
something to replace it.

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:46.612 align:middle line:84%
Now it's had millions
of views on dozens

00:28:46.612 --> 00:28:47.570 align:middle line:90%
and dozens of channels.

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:50.300 align:middle line:84%
One channel alone has
had 650,000 views.

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.000 align:middle line:90%
It's all over the place.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.700 align:middle line:84%
So TED's attempt to stiffle--
and exactly the same thing

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:58.190 align:middle line:84%
has happened with
Rupert's talks.

00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:01.150 align:middle line:84%
Rupert's talk, again, was
very popular on YouTube

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:03.950 align:middle line:84%
until TED banned it,
and then suddenly it

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:10.630 align:middle line:84%
became even more popular and
is seen everywhere today.

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:17.150 align:middle line:84%
What I had not realized
was that TED is advised

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:19.870 align:middle line:90%
by a secretive science board.

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:21.350 align:middle line:84%
They refer to their
science board,

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:24.350 align:middle line:84%
but they will not reveal
who those scientists are.

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:27.670 align:middle line:84%
What became clear is that those
scientists belong to a very

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:33.260 align:middle line:84%
dogmatic tendency of materialist
reductionist scientists who

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:35.430 align:middle line:84%
cannot bear the idea
that there's any mystery

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:36.560 align:middle line:90%
in consciousness.

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.390 align:middle line:84%
And what was in
common between my talk

00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:41.330 align:middle line:84%
and Rupert Sheldrake's talk was
the notion that consciousness

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:45.130 align:middle line:84%
may not be local to the
brain, that the brain may

00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:47.920 align:middle line:84%
be a receiver rather than a
generator of consciousness.

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And that conflicted
directly with the ideology

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:54.600 align:middle line:84%
of the dogmatists who advise
TED on what is good science

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:55.530 align:middle line:90%
and what isn't.

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:59.509 align:middle line:84%
And it was those dogmatists who
got our talks taken offline.

00:29:59.509 --> 00:30:01.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So they were
so threatened by what

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.600 align:middle line:84%
you had to say that they
wouldn't even allow people

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.460 align:middle line:90%
to make up their own minds.

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:05.251 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Exactly.

00:30:05.251 --> 00:30:08.611 align:middle line:84%
And this is what so infuriated
the global community

00:30:08.611 --> 00:30:09.110 align:middle line:90%
around this.

00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:12.670 align:middle line:84%
Because this really did become
a very hot issue for a while.

00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:14.620 align:middle line:90%
We live in a new world now.

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:16.520 align:middle line:84%
People are thinking
for themselves.

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:18.760 align:middle line:84%
They don't need to be
told what to think.

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:21.150 align:middle line:84%
It's patronizing
and insulting of TED

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:23.800 align:middle line:84%
to say that
intelligent adults are

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:26.830 align:middle line:84%
unable to make up their
own minds about the content

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:28.590 align:middle line:84%
of a presentation,
that the presentation

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:30.380 align:middle line:84%
is so dangerous
to their thinking

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:34.840 align:middle line:84%
that it must actually be
deleted from the internet.

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:38.040 align:middle line:84%
This was a huge
[INAUDIBLE] by TED.

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.760 align:middle line:84%
It was a terrible mistake
of judgment that they made.

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:43.920 align:middle line:84%
They brought themselves
into great disrepute

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.020 align:middle line:90%
as a result of doing this.

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:46.978 align:middle line:84%
And for the first time,
it showed transparently

00:30:46.978 --> 00:30:51.030 align:middle line:84%
what they really are, which is
an engine for the presentation

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:54.651 align:middle line:84%
of a rosy, glowing view
of the corporate world.

00:30:54.651 --> 00:30:56.400 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: Well, and
there's another example

00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:00.630 align:middle line:10%
you may not be familiar with--
Jim Vieira was describing

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:05.140 align:middle line:10%
over 1,500 documented reports
of giant skeletons being found.

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And he said the Smithsonian
Institution was systematically

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:10.520 align:middle line:84%
confiscating those
giant skeletons.

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And they took his
talk down as well.

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:13.861 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: They took
his talk down as well.

00:31:13.861 --> 00:31:17.030 align:middle line:84%
It's a consistent behavior
pattern and not him alone

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:20.250 align:middle line:84%
and not I and Rupert alone, but
others have also suffered this.

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:24.830 align:middle line:84%
It's just that Rupert and
I were able to mobilize

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:26.530 align:middle line:84%
a lot of public
attention to this,

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:28.390 align:middle line:84%
and that's what TED
hated, because TED

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:30.000 align:middle line:90%
wanted to get away with it.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.947 align:middle line:84%
They wanted just to delete our
talks, not to be challenged.

00:31:32.947 --> 00:31:35.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Just have it be
forgotten and nobody ever

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:35.420 align:middle line:90%
talks about it.

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:37.003 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: And just
have it forgotten.

00:31:37.003 --> 00:31:39.690 align:middle line:84%
They are so arrogant
and so confident

00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:42.120 align:middle line:84%
of their own power as
a media organization

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:45.990 align:middle line:84%
that it never occurred
to them that on this one,

00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:47.810 align:middle line:90%
the public would kick back.

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And the public did
kick back in a big way,

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:53.160 align:middle line:84%
and TED's reputation
has suffered very badly

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:53.730 align:middle line:90%
as a result.

00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:54.810 align:middle line:90%
But am I angry with TED?

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:55.480 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:57.570 align:middle line:90%
TED did me a huge favor.

00:31:57.570 --> 00:31:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And they did all
of us a huge favor

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.780 align:middle line:84%
by exposing and making
transparent what previously

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:05.940 align:middle line:84%
was hidden, that this
is an institution that

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:10.520 align:middle line:84%
does not actually represent
challenging ideas.

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:15.990 align:middle line:84%
It is giving a rosy glow
to what is often a very

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:17.570 align:middle line:90%
corrupt and dishonest world.

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:19.236 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So what have
you got coming up?

00:32:19.236 --> 00:32:21.350 align:middle line:84%
What's next for
you in the future?

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: A sequel to
"Fingerprints of the Gods."

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:25.030 align:middle line:84%
We're now 20 years
since "Fingerprints."

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:25.780 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: A sequel.

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Yes, and I'm
working on that now.

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:31.107 align:middle line:84%
And I have been working on that
for the past year, more than a

00:32:31.107 --> 00:32:32.190 align:middle line:90%
year, as a matter of fact.

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:35.012 align:middle line:84%
And I've traveled to
many new destinations

00:32:35.012 --> 00:32:37.220 align:middle line:84%
that I had not explored in
the original "Fingerprints

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:41.940 align:middle line:84%
of the Gods," Gobekli Tepe,
of course, in what is now

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:47.060 align:middle line:84%
eastern Turkey; Armenia,
incredible ancient megalithic

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:49.670 align:middle line:84%
sites in Armenia which
have never been studied.

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:53.020 align:middle line:84%
I've recently been to
Baalbek into Lebanon

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:57.600 align:middle line:84%
looking at those extraordinary
megalithic temples there.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:01.010 align:middle line:84%
I've been to India, been
to Peru, been to Bolivia,

00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:03.940 align:middle line:84%
all over the world researching
this, looking in detail

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:05.050 align:middle line:90%
into the geology.

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:08.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm about to undertake a big
research trip in the United

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:12.300 align:middle line:84%
States with Randall
Carlson, who has

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:14.010 align:middle line:84%
done more than
anybody else, I would

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:18.460 align:middle line:84%
say, to study the effects of
that comet impact on the North

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:21.420 align:middle line:84%
American ice cap
12,980 years ago.

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And Randall is going
to show me the traces

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:27.200 align:middle line:84%
of the dramatic
flooding that occurred

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.520 align:middle line:90%
following that comet impact.

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:31.230 align:middle line:84%
We're going to drive all the
way from Portland, Oregon,

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:33.700 align:middle line:84%
to Minneapolis, and we're going
to trace the southern edge

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:35.480 align:middle line:90%
of the ice cap.

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.770 align:middle line:84%
All of this is part of
the research project

00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:40.557 align:middle line:84%
that will become "Magicians
of the Gods," the sequel

00:33:40.557 --> 00:33:42.640 align:middle line:84%
to "Fingerprints of the
Gods," due to be published

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.800 align:middle line:90%
towards the end of 2015.

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still
working on my novels.

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:51.620 align:middle line:84%
We're just about to
bring out in October 2014

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:54.200 align:middle line:84%
volume two of the
"War Gods" series.

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.110 align:middle line:84%
The second volume
is called "War God,

00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:57.410 align:middle line:90%
Return of the Plumed Serpent."

00:33:57.410 --> 00:34:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And I have a third volume,
"War God, Apocalypse,"

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:02.020 align:middle line:90%
which will come out in 2016.

00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And we didn't really
talk about "Underworld,"

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:07.587 align:middle line:84%
either, but you also did you do
your own scuba diving research,

00:34:07.587 --> 00:34:08.170 align:middle line:90%
and actually--

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:10.211 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: My wife Santha,
who is a photographer,

00:34:10.211 --> 00:34:14.320 align:middle line:84%
and I did seven years of scuba
diving all around the world.

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:17.940 align:middle line:84%
Because we believe that you
cannot sit in an armchair

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:21.130 align:middle line:84%
and claim to be solving some
of the greatest mysteries

00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:22.179 align:middle line:90%
of antiquity.

00:34:22.179 --> 00:34:25.090 align:middle line:84%
You have to get out there,
and if necessary, you

00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:28.370 align:middle line:84%
have to get underwater, or
indeed to go to the Amazon

00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:30.360 align:middle line:84%
and drink ayahuasca
You have to do it.

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.250 align:middle line:90%
You have to walk the walk.

00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:34.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Graham made
a very good point

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:36.820 align:middle line:90%
towards the end of this episode.

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:40.480 align:middle line:10%
If TED is saying that their
whole premise is "ideas

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.969 align:middle line:10%
worth sharing,"
why would they be

00:34:42.969 --> 00:34:46.050 align:middle line:10%
engaging in censorship
of such an established

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:50.040 align:middle line:10%
academic as Graham Hancock
or Rupert Sheldrake?

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.679 align:middle line:84%
Are they saying
that these are ideas

00:34:51.679 --> 00:34:53.850 align:middle line:90%
that are not worth sharing?

00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, Graham sent me
an emergency email

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:58.930 align:middle line:84%
when they were first going to
pull those videos off the air,

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:01.500 align:middle line:84%
and I have a huge
following on my website.

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And I splashed something
out about this immediately.

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:05.730 align:middle line:90%
I made a big stink about it.

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And thanks to you, we all
work together as a team

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:12.320 align:middle line:84%
and helped make this
whole thing go viral

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:16.050 align:middle line:84%
so that Graham's talk would not
be lost, Sheldrake's talk would

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:19.470 align:middle line:84%
not be lost, and that
this evidence could not

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:22.240 align:middle line:84%
be suppressed,
could not be hidden,

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:25.020 align:middle line:84%
and could not be
stuffed down any longer.

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:26.840 align:middle line:90%
Now is the time.

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And also, of course, TED
suppressed Jim Vieira's talk,

00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:35.180 align:middle line:84%
because you can't say that the
Smithsonian Institution would

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:38.780 align:middle line:84%
have hidden evidence of giant
skeletons all over the world.

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:39.940 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:41.180 align:middle line:90%
They did.

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:43.000 align:middle line:84%
We heard from Andrew
Collins that there

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.250 align:middle line:84%
are massive amounts
of giant skeletons

00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:48.440 align:middle line:84%
that were found in West
Virginia and in Ohio.

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:50.590 align:middle line:84%
They've been found
all over America.

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:53.940 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Catalina Island right
off the coast of Los Angeles,

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:57.970 align:middle line:84%
they found some 4,000
giant skeletons.

00:35:57.970 --> 00:36:00.920 align:middle line:84%
So this is a huge
subject, and it's

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:03.990 align:middle line:84%
a through line that
connects us to something

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:05.810 align:middle line:90%
that's going on today.

00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:10.600 align:middle line:84%
Why are these giant skeletons
all being suppressed?

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:14.140 align:middle line:84%
Are they, in fact,
extraterrestrial humans?

00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:15.720 align:middle line:84%
We don't normally
think of giants

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:17.810 align:middle line:84%
as being extraterrestrials,
but they're

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:23.050 align:middle line:84%
an unusual human that do not fit
into the Darwinian model that

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:27.670 align:middle line:84%
has been portrayed as
infallible truth to us.

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:31.570 align:middle line:84%
Our minds have to expand as
we explore new paradigms,

00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:34.900 align:middle line:84%
and there is a distinct
possibility that, in fact,

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:38.170 align:middle line:84%
the story in the Book of
Enoch is entirely true,

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:40.270 align:middle line:84%
that we did it have
extraterrestrials

00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:43.120 align:middle line:84%
or so-called fallen
angels that came to Earth,

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:45.940 align:middle line:84%
as well as benevolent,
angelic beings who

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:49.020 align:middle line:84%
are positive who
rebuilt our civilization

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:51.320 align:middle line:90%
after a great catastrophe.

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:54.740 align:middle line:84%
Both sides are
warring here on Earth

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:56.950 align:middle line:90%
for the future of humanity.

00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And what they're
ultimately fighting over

00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:03.030 align:middle line:84%
is our ascension, the
possibility of our souls

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:05.070 align:middle line:84%
learning what
we're here to learn

00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:07.110 align:middle line:90%
and going in the next level.

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:11.590 align:middle line:84%
So as we go on in our
investigation of disclosure,

00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:13.850 align:middle line:90%
we have much more to cover.

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:16.330 align:middle line:84%
Disclosure encompasses
many things.

00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:19.880 align:middle line:84%
It encompasses the
modern-day UFO coverup.

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:23.550 align:middle line:84%
It encompasses where we
could be going in the future.

00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:27.290 align:middle line:84%
How far has the military
industrial complex expanded?

00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:29.500 align:middle line:90%
Is there a secret space program?

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:30.950 align:middle line:90%
How big is it?

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:34.260 align:middle line:84%
All of these things
are part of disclosure,

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:36.480 align:middle line:90%
because it is a vast subject.

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:39.200 align:middle line:84%
The amount of information
that has been hidden from us

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:41.770 align:middle line:90%
is truly staggering.

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:45.550 align:middle line:84%
But the next step that we
need to go into from here

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:50.090 align:middle line:84%
is investigating the cabal,
investigating the history

00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:54.720 align:middle line:84%
all of this organized, secret
occult group that has somehow

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:58.370 align:middle line:84%
managed to do an
incredible job of seizing

00:37:58.370 --> 00:38:03.350 align:middle line:84%
power of our financial
system, of our governments,

00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:04.970 align:middle line:90%
of the media.

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And it is a very
strange idea to consider

00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:12.410 align:middle line:84%
that they believe that the
fallen angels are real,

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:15.060 align:middle line:84%
that Lucifer was the
highest among them,

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:17.660 align:middle line:84%
that Lucifer actually
impregnated Eve

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:22.360 align:middle line:84%
in the Garden of Eden, and
that her offspring included

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:26.530 align:middle line:84%
one son that came from
Adam and another son that

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:30.660 align:middle line:84%
came from Lucifer, Lucifer's
son of course being Cain

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:33.350 align:middle line:90%
and Adam's son being Abel.

00:38:33.350 --> 00:38:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, the
people in the cabal

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:40.360 align:middle line:84%
do believe that they are
the descendants of Cain.

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:43.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, if these people had
extraterrestrial DNA,

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:47.050 align:middle line:84%
if they were in a sense the
descendants of the gods,

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:50.460 align:middle line:84%
they had higher IQ, they
had better technology,

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:52.870 align:middle line:84%
and they may have
actually been able to get

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:56.620 align:middle line:84%
into the governments
of the classic empires

00:38:56.620 --> 00:39:01.010 align:middle line:84%
that we've seen here on Earth,
seizing power, and continually

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:02.350 align:middle line:90%
consolidating.

00:39:02.350 --> 00:39:04.690 align:middle line:90%
It's a truly wild epic.

00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:07.810 align:middle line:84%
It's the greatest story
in Earth's history.

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And nobody has ever put it all
together in linear sequence

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:14.700 align:middle line:84%
with the finest minds of
our time in interviews

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:17.060 align:middle line:84%
like you're seeing
here on "Disclosure."

00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:19.880 align:middle line:84%
So there's much more coming
up in future episodes,

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:21.690 align:middle line:90%
and I hope you'll stay with me.

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:23.040 align:middle line:90%
I thank you for watching.

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:26.990 align:middle line:90%
