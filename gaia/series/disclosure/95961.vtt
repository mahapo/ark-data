>>DAVID WILCOCK:
I'm David Wilcock,

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.710 align:middle line:90%
and welcome to "Disclosure."

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.620 align:middle line:10%
I am very pleased
to bring you one

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.360 align:middle line:10%
of the real heroes of
the ancient civilizations

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.010 align:middle line:10%
field of scholarship, none
other than Robert Bauval.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.010 align:middle line:84%
I was very happy to
have the opportunity

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.500 align:middle line:84%
to interview him and get
a chance to talk to him

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.620 align:middle line:84%
one on one for the purposes
of your edutainment.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.150 align:middle line:84%
That's right, education
and entertainment.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.130 align:middle line:84%
"Disclosure" can be
fun, and Robert Bauval

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.760 align:middle line:84%
is the founding father of the
Orion correlation theory, which

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.190 align:middle line:84%
says that the three
pyramids in Egypt

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.680 align:middle line:84%
actually mirror the positions
and the magnitudes of the three

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.760 align:middle line:90%
stars in the belt of Orion.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, skeptics have
tried to tear apart

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.930 align:middle line:84%
Bauval's Orion correlation
theory, and we talk about that.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.890 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly, we also
talk about the Edgar Cayce

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.610 align:middle line:84%
readings which
predicted that there

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.000 align:middle line:84%
was going to be a room found
under the paws of the Sphinx

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.910 align:middle line:84%
that would be the so-called Hall
of Records, that would contain

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.290 align:middle line:84%
actual artifacts from Atlantean
times, which the Cayce

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.640 align:middle line:84%
reading said was
when this was built.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And in the Cayce readings,
they gave a window

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.750 align:middle line:84%
of 10,450 to 10,350 BC, of
when the monuments at Giza

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.090 align:middle line:90%
were constructed.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And what you're
going to find out

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.300 align:middle line:84%
is that Bauval's Orion
correlation theory triangulated

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.630 align:middle line:84%
almost exactly the
same time frame

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.530 align:middle line:84%
for when the alignment
that but these pyramids

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.160 align:middle line:84%
were built to encode
actually took place.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.770 align:middle line:90%
His data is 10,500.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.170 align:middle line:84%
It's only for 50
years off from what

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.780 align:middle line:84%
was given in the
Edgar Cayce readings.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And don't forget, Edward
Cayce was documented

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.610 align:middle line:84%
as having performed
14,000 medical readings,

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.680 align:middle line:84%
where all he had
was someone's name

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.890 align:middle line:84%
and the time of
when they were going

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.930 align:middle line:84%
to have that reading, that
they would agree to be at home.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.650 align:middle line:90%
He had no other information.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And yet in a deep
state of trance,

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.710 align:middle line:84%
he would diagnose their
medical conditions

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.210 align:middle line:84%
and prescribe a working
treatment for them.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.730 align:middle line:84%
Bauval has some really
fascinating information,

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.540 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to
check this out.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.220 align:middle line:84%
Because this is a
very important part

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.450 align:middle line:84%
of "Disclosure," an actual
fixation of a particular time

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.510 align:middle line:84%
written into stone
at the Giza Plateau.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.390 align:middle line:90%
So check it out.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.520 align:middle line:90%
Robert Bauval.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.577 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "Disclosure."

00:02:43.577 --> 00:02:45.285 align:middle line:84%
I'm really happy to
have you on the show.

00:02:45.285 --> 00:02:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT BAUVAL:
It's a pleasure.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I got your book,
"The Orion Mystery," in 1994,

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.150 align:middle line:90%
right when it came out.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.700 align:middle line:84%
I had been reading--
probably, by that point,

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.150 align:middle line:84%
I think I had already read 200
books on ancient civilizations.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.619 align:middle line:90%
>>BAUVAL: Wow.

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:03.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: At one
point-- I've lost it,

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.368 align:middle line:84%
but I had a whole list of
all the books I've actually

00:03:05.368 --> 00:03:07.730 align:middle line:90%
read as a bibliography.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And you come on the
scene, and the year

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.200 align:middle line:84%
after was "Fingerprints of
the Gods" by Graham Hancock.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.950 align:middle line:84%
We got Robert Shoch coming
out, and John Anthony West,

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.910 align:middle line:84%
showing that the
Sphinx has apparently

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.120 align:middle line:84%
been weathered by
water, and there's

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.175 align:middle line:84%
these weird erosion
patterns on it.

00:03:25.175 --> 00:03:29.800 align:middle line:84%
But your book really
was a game-changer

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.610 align:middle line:84%
for me personally,
and for the world.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.370 align:middle line:84%
Because I said, here's
a guy who's actually

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.150 align:middle line:84%
made a breakthrough in a field
where it seems like everything

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.750 align:middle line:84%
that everybody's talking about
is hundreds of years old.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.810 align:middle line:84%
Nothing's really
changed that much.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.622 align:middle line:84%
You come out with the
Orion correlation theory.

00:03:48.622 --> 00:03:51.080 align:middle line:10%
>>BAUVAL: The Orion correlation
theory-- in fact, the story

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.290 align:middle line:10%
begins a long time before.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.160 align:middle line:10%
I don't want to go
through all that.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.350 align:middle line:10%
But it's been a
long process leading

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.830 align:middle line:10%
to the publication
of the book in '94.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.022 align:middle line:90%
It started in '83.

00:04:04.022 --> 00:04:09.265 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of those
things that's-- you know,

00:04:09.265 --> 00:04:13.340 align:middle line:84%
the pyramids have been there
since at least 4,500 years,

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.025 align:middle line:90%
it not more.

00:04:15.025 --> 00:04:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And hundreds and
hundreds of researchers

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.540 align:middle line:84%
through the ages and
modern times, of course,

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.090 align:middle line:84%
have explored them,
have studied them.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.190 align:middle line:84%
It's one of those things that
for some reason that I think

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.730 align:middle line:84%
I'll take to the grave,
never to understand,

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.710 align:middle line:84%
is why nobody asked
an obvious question.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.580 align:middle line:84%
You've got two large-- there's
three major pyramids, three

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.010 align:middle line:84%
royal pyramids, that are
located, if one accepts

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.340 align:middle line:84%
the orthodox view, to
King Kheops, Khufu,

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.910 align:middle line:84%
who built the Great Pyramid,
his brother or son, Khafre,

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.390 align:middle line:84%
who built the second pyramid,
almost of equal size.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And then a third pyramid, built
by Menkaure, the grandson,

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.800 align:middle line:84%
which is much smaller-- although
it's not a small pyramid.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a 65-meter-high pyramid,
but compared to the others--

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.190 align:middle line:90%
so the third, small pyramid.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, the weird thing is that
the two largest are clearly

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.250 align:middle line:90%
on a diagonal.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.090 align:middle line:84%
You can pass a line
through their apex,

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.410 align:middle line:84%
and they're at a diagonal--
on a straight line,

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.470 align:middle line:90%
but a diagonal to the meridian.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.850 align:middle line:84%
They are about 43,
almost 45 degrees.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.040 align:middle line:90%
It looks like a plan.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it wouldn't
take a rocket engineer,

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.254 align:middle line:84%
and most architects see,
very quickly, a plan.

00:05:35.254 --> 00:05:36.920 align:middle line:84%
But nobody had asked
the question, well,

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:43.197 align:middle line:84%
in that case, why is this third
one offset from that alignment?

00:05:43.197 --> 00:05:45.780 align:middle line:84%
We have two pyramids on a line,
and then the third one offset.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.760 align:middle line:84%
It's one of those things
that-- and I myself never asked

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.580 align:middle line:84%
the question until,
for some reason,

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.390 align:middle line:84%
I was visiting the museum in
Cairo, on my way to Alexandria.

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.720 align:middle line:90%
I used to live in Alexandria.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.140 align:middle line:90%
And I saw an overhead picture.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.290 align:middle line:84%
Now in those days-- I
mean, we're talking, like,

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:06.350 align:middle line:84%
1982, long before
the Google Earth,

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.640 align:middle line:84%
and satellite pictures
were not readily

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.540 align:middle line:84%
available-- it was the first
time I'd seen an overhead shot.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:17.616 align:middle line:84%
Very nice overhead
shot, taken in the 1950s

00:06:17.616 --> 00:06:20.000 align:middle line:90%
by the Egyptian air force.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.240 align:middle line:90%
And it struck in my mind.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.940 align:middle line:90%
I mean, why is this offset?

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.580 align:middle line:90%
Why is it smaller?

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.229 align:middle line:84%
To cut a long story short, I
mean, I got into, like you,

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:30.520 align:middle line:90%
and I started looking at books.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, I was working
as an engineer in Saudi Arabia.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered
two things which

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.730 align:middle line:84%
anybody who gets into
pyramid research will know.

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:44.660 align:middle line:84%
First, that the pyramids
are well-known to have

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:49.270 align:middle line:84%
been set in such a way
that the sides face

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.330 align:middle line:90%
the cardinal directions.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.705 align:middle line:84%
So there was an astronomical
quality about them.

00:06:53.705 --> 00:06:57.560 align:middle line:84%
That there were shafts within
the Great Pyramid, one of which

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.070 align:middle line:90%
pointed to Orion's belt.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:02.190 align:middle line:90%
This was known since the 1960s.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And thirdly, that
the pyramid texts,

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.766 align:middle line:84%
not of the Fourth Dynasty,
of these three pyramids,

00:07:07.766 --> 00:07:09.140 align:middle line:84%
but of the dynasty
that followed,

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:13.110 align:middle line:84%
the Fifth Dynasty, the pyramids
Saqqara, which is about 5,

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:19.300 align:middle line:84%
6 kilometers south of the Giza
pyramids, a lot of these texts,

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.260 align:middle line:90%
known as pyramid texts.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And the main theme is the king
becomes a star after his death

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.764 align:middle line:84%
and travels to a
kingdom in the sky.

00:07:27.764 --> 00:07:29.430 align:middle line:84%
They called it Uat,
which is that region

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:30.990 align:middle line:90%
of the constellation of Orion.

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:32.475 align:middle line:90%
So all this was known.

00:07:32.475 --> 00:07:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And so the obvious
thing for me to say

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:37.050 align:middle line:84%
was that it was something
to do with Orion.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Although it did take
quite a few months,

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.080 align:middle line:84%
strange enough, until
I was in the desert

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.820 align:middle line:84%
with a friend of mine,
happened to be a navigator.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.915 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it's one
of those strange things.

00:07:48.915 --> 00:07:51.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know, since I've
written the book, that's

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.370 align:middle line:84%
there are people
who look at Orion.

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:56.650 align:middle line:84%
But in those days, I mean,
people didn't sort of

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:58.967 align:middle line:84%
go out and look at
constellations, you know?

00:07:58.967 --> 00:08:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And we're there in the
desert, a very clear night,

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:03.633 align:middle line:84%
and he said, Orion, so I said,
yeah, yeah, I've read about it.

00:08:03.633 --> 00:08:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And I explained that the
pharaohs wanted to go there.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And he pointed at
Orion at said, look,

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.419 align:middle line:84%
there's the three
stars of Orion's belt.

00:08:12.419 --> 00:08:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And he said that in
they're in a row,

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.770 align:middle line:84%
and if you project
a line through them

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.980 align:middle line:84%
and you go down
towards your eyes,

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.449 align:middle line:90%
you see the star Sirius rising.

00:08:21.449 --> 00:08:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And then, just as an
afterthought, he said,

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.210 align:middle line:84%
well, you see the
little one on the top?

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:28.310 align:middle line:90%
It's not exactly in the line.

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:30.332 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit
offset to the left.

00:08:30.332 --> 00:08:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And the proverbial penny
dropped in my mind.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.498 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I literally saw
three pyramids in the sky.

00:08:35.498 --> 00:08:36.873 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was
weird, you know?

00:08:36.873 --> 00:08:39.610 align:middle line:84%
So I rushed back home,
and I took a map,

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:41.190 align:middle line:84%
you know, and I
got very excited.

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And what's amazing
about this is not

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.030 align:middle line:84%
only that you've got this
correlation-- you know,

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:53.350 align:middle line:84%
three stars two bright
ones, the third one offset,

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:55.750 align:middle line:84%
looking like the
pyramids on the ground.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.870 align:middle line:84%
With all these connections--
the shaft pointing to the stars,

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:02.030 align:middle line:84%
the pyramids texts inviting
us to look at the stars.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:08.320 align:middle line:84%
But the stars themselves are
at a rough 45-degree angle

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.060 align:middle line:90%
to the Milky Way.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.410 align:middle line:84%
So you have a kind
of line in the sky,

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:15.664 align:middle line:84%
with those three
stars, and a map

00:09:15.664 --> 00:09:17.080 align:middle line:84%
on the ground that
looks the same.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:20.870 align:middle line:84%
You have a sort of "as
above, as below" correlation.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:23.151 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, surely
somebody's seen this, you know?

00:09:23.151 --> 00:09:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So the
Milky Way in the sky

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:26.740 align:middle line:84%
is in the same position
as the Nile River?

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.981 align:middle line:84%
>>BAUVAL: Yeah,
what's intriguing

00:09:28.981 --> 00:09:30.480 align:middle line:84%
is that pyramids
texts actually talk

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.030 align:middle line:90%
about this "Nile in the sky."

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's as if there
is an Egypt in the sky.

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:36.760 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Egyptians
fervently believed

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.100 align:middle line:84%
that there was a counterpart
of Egypt in the sky,

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:43.049 align:middle line:84%
with the Nile, and
more, which corresponded

00:09:43.049 --> 00:09:44.340 align:middle line:90%
to what they had on the ground.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:45.714 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
that Paradise was

00:09:45.714 --> 00:09:48.422 align:middle line:84%
an Egyptian celestial
world, in fact.

00:09:48.422 --> 00:09:49.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: And that's the Duat.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BAUVAL: That's the Duat.

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:53.670 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so I wrote to
several Egyptologists,

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:55.250 align:middle line:90%
and I struck a cord.

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.470 align:middle line:90%
I mean, a struck the jackpot.

00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:59.940 align:middle line:84%
Because the
authority at the time

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:03.670 align:middle line:84%
was Sir Ivan Edwards, ex-curator
of the British Museum,

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:06.699 align:middle line:84%
who wrote to me and said,
this is very interesting.

00:10:06.699 --> 00:10:07.740 align:middle line:90%
I've never heard of this.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:08.605 align:middle line:90%
Come and see me.

00:10:08.605 --> 00:10:10.396 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, now hang
on one second, too.

00:10:10.396 --> 00:10:14.280 align:middle line:84%
Because part of it is that
the two brighter stars

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.980 align:middle line:90%
in Orion's belt are more white.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:19.540 align:middle line:84%
Remember this, in your
book, that the smaller one

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.580 align:middle line:90%
is more red?

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:22.180 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BAUVAL: What you have
with a visual eye-- I mean,

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.753 align:middle line:84%
we are assuming that they didn't
have telescopes and so forth.

00:10:26.753 --> 00:10:29.210 align:middle line:84%
But you can see these
things with the naked eye.

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And what you see
is two bright stars

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.490 align:middle line:84%
in the center of the
Orion constellation.

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:37.040 align:middle line:84%
The Orion constellation
is roughly a rectangle,

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.090 align:middle line:84%
four bright stars
forming a rectangle.

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:45.425 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle of this
rectangle is Orion's belt.

00:10:45.425 --> 00:10:46.800 align:middle line:84%
I think at this
time of year, you

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.310 align:middle line:84%
see it up about 4 or 5
o'clock in the morning.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.480 align:middle line:84%
Very, very bright
constellations.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:55.265 align:middle line:84%
You can't miss it, once
you know where it is.

00:10:55.265 --> 00:10:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And the belt is formed
with two bright stars

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:00.190 align:middle line:90%
of almost equal magnitude.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:01.830 align:middle line:90%
They shine brightly.

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And then a third
one, much dimmer,

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.121 align:middle line:90%
and offset from the alignment.

00:11:06.121 --> 00:11:07.620 align:middle line:84%
Exactly what you
see on the ground--

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:10.410 align:middle line:84%
two pyramids of equal
size, or almost equal size,

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:12.110 align:middle line:90%
with a third one offset.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:14.755 align:middle line:84%
Now with all this
backing evidence--

00:11:14.755 --> 00:11:16.452 align:middle line:84%
you know, the king
wants to go there.

00:11:16.452 --> 00:11:17.910 align:middle line:84%
There's a shaft
pointing there-- it

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.460 align:middle line:84%
looks unlikely to
be a coincidence.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:23.510 align:middle line:84%
There's more to this, by the
way, which links the Sphinx.

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:26.210 align:middle line:84%
However, the story
began when I was invited

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:31.007 align:middle line:84%
to Sir Ivan Edwards' house, and
he said, you've got to publish.

00:11:31.007 --> 00:11:32.465 align:middle line:84%
And it took a while,
but eventually

00:11:32.465 --> 00:11:35.530 align:middle line:84%
I published in "The
Oxford Journal."

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:39.290 align:middle line:84%
It kind of was not--
the academic world

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:41.650 align:middle line:90%
was not so excited about it.

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:45.012 align:middle line:84%
They felt it was
some strange idea.

00:11:45.012 --> 00:11:46.720 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, I
published a book in '94

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.136 align:middle line:84%
and it hit the
scene, as you know.

00:11:48.136 --> 00:11:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And so the book's
now in 40 languages.

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:57.690 align:middle line:84%
BBC picked it up, and bang, it
went viral, like we say today.

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And what followed
was-- by that time,

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.890 align:middle line:84%
of course, because of
the attention I got,

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:09.132 align:middle line:84%
I got contacted by Graham
Hancock, who was, at the time,

00:12:09.132 --> 00:12:10.090 align:middle line:90%
writing "Fingerprints."

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And he was very
keen to incorporate

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:14.447 align:middle line:90%
these new ideas in his book.

00:12:14.447 --> 00:12:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about
writing a book together,

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.800 align:middle line:84%
because I had something
up my sleeve which

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.830 align:middle line:90%
I did not put in the book.

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:23.730 align:middle line:84%
I was very reluctant,
because I had already

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:26.620 align:middle line:84%
talked a lot about this
correlation to Egyptologists,

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.820 align:middle line:84%
and I knew the--
I didn't predict

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:31.190 align:middle line:90%
the impact it would have.

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:32.490 align:middle line:90%
And it kind of spooked me.

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:34.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had the
whole academic world

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.740 align:middle line:84%
challenging me, or
inviting me to give talks.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:42.090 align:middle line:84%
However, what I had up my
sleeve was that the correlation

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:46.520 align:middle line:84%
worked better if you brought--
if you precessed the stars.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:50.440 align:middle line:84%
There's a planetary
motion that the Earth

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.810 align:middle line:84%
wobbles in its cycle
of 26,000 years,

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:57.550 align:middle line:84%
and gives the apparent effect
that the stars change position.

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:00.341 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we're moving, but
the stars appear to move.

00:13:00.341 --> 00:13:02.465 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Right, so it's
one degree every 72 years--

00:13:02.465 --> 00:13:02.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BAUVAL: Approximately, yes.

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:03.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: At the equinox.

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.415 align:middle line:84%
>>BAUVAL: But if you
watch the meridian, what

00:13:05.415 --> 00:13:09.040 align:middle line:84%
happens-- if you watch south,
due south, particularly south,

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:13.050 align:middle line:84%
they rise, they
reach a low point,

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:16.070 align:middle line:84%
and then they reach a high point
in a cycle of 26,000 years.

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:19.780 align:middle line:84%
13,000 years up,
13,000 years down.

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:23.450 align:middle line:84%
Now what they do is
they go up and down,

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:29.104 align:middle line:84%
and they change their
angle with the horizon.

00:13:29.104 --> 00:13:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And as you brought them
down to the beginning-- now,

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:34.180 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptians speak
of a beginning time.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And they speak of
a beginning time,

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.370 align:middle line:84%
that the god Osiris
came down from the stars

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:41.730 align:middle line:90%
and set up civilization.

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:42.750 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Zep Tepi.

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:43.708 align:middle line:90%
>>BAUVAL: That's right.

00:13:43.708 --> 00:13:45.390 align:middle line:84%
They called it Zep
Tepi, the First Time.

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And they identify Osiris
to the Orion constellation.

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:54.600 align:middle line:10%
So the thing is, could we use
the stars, his counterpart

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:58.100 align:middle line:10%
in the sky, and see if there
is a First Time, this Zep Tepi?

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.730 align:middle line:10%
And the obvious thing was to
go to the low point, the nadir

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:05.357 align:middle line:10%
of the cycle, and say, OK, that
could be the beginning, what

00:14:05.357 --> 00:14:06.440 align:middle line:10%
they see as the beginning.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And as you precess
the stars down,

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.270 align:middle line:90%
you reach a date of 10,500 BC.

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold,
the angle of the stars

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:17.550 align:middle line:84%
change and lock
precisely in an angle

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:20.620 align:middle line:84%
that fits the pyramids
on the ground.

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:23.330 align:middle line:84%
But-- and here's a
big but-- while they

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:26.920 align:middle line:84%
do this, at the precise
time-- so you bring them down,

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:33.000 align:middle line:84%
10,500 BC, and when they reach
the meridian, the south line

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.120 align:middle line:84%
in alignment with the pyramids,
this is exactly the time,

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.950 align:middle line:84%
like spot-on the
time, when the sun is

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:43.400 align:middle line:90%
rising at the spring equinox.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:47.420 align:middle line:84%
In other words, that this event
only takes place in 10,500 BC

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:51.700 align:middle line:84%
and exactly when the
stars are in the south.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:54.150 align:middle line:84%
So I worked with the
computer programs

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:56.950 align:middle line:84%
now that we have-- so let's
see what happens in the south.

00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:01.010 align:middle line:84%
Well I knew that the Sphinx,
another monument on the site,

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:03.970 align:middle line:90%
was gazing directly due east.

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:08.380 align:middle line:84%
Due east, where the sun
rises at the spring equinox.

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And as I looked there, I saw
the constellation of Leo.

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:16.810 align:middle line:84%
So now what you have is two
sets of constellations--

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:18.970 align:middle line:84%
the Sphinx looking
at his counterpart,

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:22.480 align:middle line:84%
and the pyramids aligning
with an image of themselves

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:23.385 align:middle line:90%
in the sky.

00:15:23.385 --> 00:15:26.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So the Sphinx is a
lion's body, and Leo, the Lion

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:28.436 align:middle line:84%
constellation, the Sphinx
is looking at the Lion.

00:15:28.436 --> 00:15:30.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BAUVAL: So what
you had, if you like,

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:36.070 align:middle line:84%
is a simulacra of a
celestial sky image locking

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:40.560 align:middle line:84%
with what was on the ground at
exactly that date of 10,500 BC.

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.880 align:middle line:84%
Now at that time, when I
wrote "The Orion Mystery,"

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:44.640 align:middle line:90%
I thought, no.

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.590 align:middle line:84%
It's going to cause--
I mean, I was already

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:48.089 align:middle line:84%
having trouble with
the correlation.

00:15:48.089 --> 00:15:50.610 align:middle line:84%
I thought-- well, I told Graham,
listen, what do you think?

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:51.860 align:middle line:90%
Should we do a book?

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:52.810 align:middle line:90%
And we did.

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And that really exploded,
because of course, it

00:15:55.250 --> 00:16:01.140 align:middle line:84%
pushed the dates of the
pyramid age to 10,500 BC.

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And of course-- now what
was odd, at the time,

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:08.977 align:middle line:84%
in parallel with us, was that
John West and Robert Schoch

00:16:08.977 --> 00:16:11.130 align:middle line:84%
were coming with some
sort of similar date

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:13.809 align:middle line:84%
by their analysis of the
geology of the Sphinx.

00:16:13.809 --> 00:16:15.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, and
what blew me away,

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:17.910 align:middle line:84%
as soon as I heard about this,
was I'd already read books

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:21.150 align:middle line:84%
on Edgar Cayce and his
view of Atlantis, clearly

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:25.360 align:middle line:84%
saying that the pyramid was
built from 10,450 to 10,350.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BAUVAL: Well, let me tell
you, at that time, I mean,

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:32.520 align:middle line:84%
I was one of those very
grounded construction engineers,

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.520 align:middle line:84%
and Edgar Cayce was
not in my mind at all.

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.780 align:middle line:84%
But of course, the
minute we published

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:39.870 align:middle line:84%
this, people started
to attack me and said,

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:43.480 align:middle line:84%
did you know that Edgar
Cayce had that date?

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, the weird thing about
this astronomical analysis

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.080 align:middle line:84%
is that it pointed,
the whole thing

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.050 align:middle line:84%
pointed to the
position of the sun

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:53.230 align:middle line:84%
at the spring
equinox in 10,500 BC,

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:57.330 align:middle line:90%
below the constellation of Leo.

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And if the sky map was
reflected on the ground,

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.610 align:middle line:84%
then it suggested that
there was something

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:07.480 align:middle line:84%
under the Sphinx
that read 10,500 BC.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.780 align:middle line:84%
So of course, people
contacted me and said, well,

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.780 align:middle line:84%
did you know that Cayce
said there was something

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:14.500 align:middle line:84%
under the Sphinx, a Hall
of Records, in 10,500 BC?

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:15.500 align:middle line:90%
Inevitably I was called.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.750 align:middle line:84%
They asked me to go and
give a conference there.

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:22.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not-- you
know, I'm still

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:26.310 align:middle line:84%
unclear about whether to
take this as-- I mean,

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:29.980 align:middle line:84%
you know, here we had, finally,
this hard science, astronomy,

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:36.300 align:middle line:84%
curiously coming up with what
a seer had said in the 1930s.

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:39.490 align:middle line:84%
Now whether I liked it
or not, he had said it.

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:44.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, it
kind of puzzled me.

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And I got involved a bit in
finding out what was going on.

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And this led to
realizing that there

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:53.855 align:middle line:84%
was a genuine hunt for this
Hall of Records at Giza

00:17:53.855 --> 00:17:56.650 align:middle line:90%
that had started in the '70s.

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:58.200 align:middle line:84%
As you know, The
Cayce Foundation

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.200 align:middle line:84%
had several attempts to
find this Hall of Records,

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.332 align:middle line:84%
starting in the '70s all
the way to the late '90s.

00:18:04.332 --> 00:18:05.040 align:middle line:90%
So there you are.

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.850 align:middle line:90%
That's the whole thing.

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:07.350 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:08.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But they've
never been allowed

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:10.080 align:middle line:90%
to do anything that destructive.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.490 align:middle line:84%
All they can do is very
simple, non-destructive tests.

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:14.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BAUVAL: Actually, not quite.

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:16.514 align:middle line:90%


00:18:16.514 --> 00:18:18.430 align:middle line:84%
Look, I think a lot of
people don't understand

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:21.770 align:middle line:84%
this about my relationship
with The Cayce Foundation.

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:23.170 align:middle line:90%
I've never met Cayce.

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:26.010 align:middle line:84%
He died in 1945,
before I was born.

00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:28.652 align:middle line:84%
I was born in '48, in
case you're interested.

00:18:28.652 --> 00:18:30.410 align:middle line:90%
And I think he was a good man.

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:32.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have no
doubt he was genuine.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And for all I know,
he had an intuition

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:38.960 align:middle line:84%
that made him know that
there was something going on

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.660 align:middle line:90%
at Giza, at the temple.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:44.700 align:middle line:84%
However, many years
after his death,

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:47.750 align:middle line:84%
one of his sons,
Hugh Lynn Cayce,

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:51.760 align:middle line:84%
when The Cayce Foundation was
founded in Virginia Beach,

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:55.150 align:middle line:84%
the ARE, the Association for
Research and Enlightenment,

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:58.450 align:middle line:84%
decided that he was going
to do something about this.

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:00.985 align:middle line:84%
He was going to try and
find this Hall of Records.

00:19:00.985 --> 00:19:04.342 align:middle line:84%
And the story is that
he recruited a young man

00:19:04.342 --> 00:19:06.050 align:middle line:84%
at the time, a fellow
called Mark Lehner,

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:08.000 align:middle line:84%
who's now one of the
top Egyptologists.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.750 align:middle line:84%
Sent him to Egypt to
study at the American

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:17.230 align:middle line:84%
University at Cairo with a very
sort of-- almost naive mission.

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:20.090 align:middle line:84%
Find us a way to look
for the Hall of Records.

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Amazingly, Lehner
got very friendly

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:27.990 align:middle line:84%
with the then-chief inspector
of Giza, who became eventually,

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:30.520 align:middle line:90%
a minster, Dr. Zahi Hawass.

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And through this liaison,
they had their first attempt

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:36.050 align:middle line:90%
in 1978.

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:38.120 align:middle line:84%
At the time, the Stanford
Research Institute

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:43.550 align:middle line:84%
was doing research with radars
for the University of Cairo.

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And Lehner got to know
the director there,

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:49.870 align:middle line:84%
a fellow called Lambert
Dolphin, if I remember well.

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And kind of struck
a deal saying, OK,

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:58.700 align:middle line:84%
if you lend us your name and
your equipment, we'll fund it.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:00.320 align:middle line:90%
The Cayces are ready to fund it.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.310 align:middle line:84%
So they formed a kind
of a joint venture.

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:06.350 align:middle line:84%
And the idea was to use the
radars of the Stanford Research

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:09.170 align:middle line:84%
Institute to locate
or identify cavities

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:11.920 align:middle line:84%
under the Sphinx, especially
where Cayce had said,

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.751 align:middle line:84%
somewhere around the
left paw or right paw.

00:20:13.751 --> 00:20:15.625 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So this is
ground-penetrating radar,

00:20:15.625 --> 00:20:16.280 align:middle line:90%
and it can--

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:17.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BAUVAL: Well, it was very
primitive in those days.

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:18.490 align:middle line:90%
It was the '70s.

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:21.050 align:middle line:90%
But it could detect cavities.

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:24.030 align:middle line:84%
They could be sure whether
it was naturally-occurring.

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And the idea was to
drill and find out

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:28.850 align:middle line:90%
if there was something there.

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:30.490 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: To drill down in?

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:31.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BAUVAL: Indeed.

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:32.705 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:20:32.705 --> 00:20:34.410 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they did five drills.

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:37.034 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't
conclusively-- I mean,

00:20:37.034 --> 00:20:38.950 align:middle line:84%
it was very disappointing
for Hugh Lynn Cayce.

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Because the project
was stopped just

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:43.640 align:middle line:84%
on the 11th hour,
where they thought

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.440 align:middle line:90%
they might strike something.

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:51.880 align:middle line:84%
The story goes that they
were hoping to get back,

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.920 align:middle line:84%
and Hawass and Lehner, who had
become very, very good friends

00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:01.650 align:middle line:84%
at the time, now-- it's been
denied many times by Hawass.

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:04.280 align:middle line:84%
But The Edgar Cayce
Foundation claims

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:08.200 align:middle line:84%
that they had a plan,
a long-term plan.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:12.340 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to groom Hawass
to become a PhD in Egyptology.

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:18.010 align:middle line:84%
He needed a PhD to advance
within the antiquity.

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:18.840 align:middle line:90%
He denies it.

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.822 align:middle line:84%
They claim that they
paid, or arranged

00:21:20.822 --> 00:21:22.280 align:middle line:84%
for a scholarship
for him, to study

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.450 align:middle line:90%
at University of Pennsylvania.

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:25.260 align:middle line:90%
He did.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:26.480 align:middle line:90%
He spent seven years there.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And when he returned,
he was immediately

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:32.580 align:middle line:84%
placed as director-general
of the Giza Pyramids.

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:35.450 align:middle line:84%
So there he is,
in 1987, I think--

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:38.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, and I heard
the same story from the ARE.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.220 align:middle line:90%
I lived in Virginia Beach.

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:40.136 align:middle line:90%
>>BAUVAL: Oh, did you?

00:21:40.136 --> 00:21:42.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And I passed
Zahi Hawass in my car

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:44.870 align:middle line:90%
on 22nd Street.

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:46.130 align:middle line:90%
>>BAUVAL: Oh, did you?

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:49.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, look, I've written
a whole book about this,

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:52.840 align:middle line:84%
by the way, which has
just been republished.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:56.120 align:middle line:84%
In any case, leaving
that aside, there

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.200 align:middle line:84%
was another attempt to look
for this Hall of Records

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.800 align:middle line:84%
when John West and
Robert Schoch wanted

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.820 align:middle line:84%
to investigate the
erosion of the Sphinx.

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:06.242 align:middle line:90%
You know the background to this.

00:22:06.242 --> 00:22:08.575 align:middle line:84%
John West approached Robert
Schoch at Boston University.

00:22:08.575 --> 00:22:10.450 align:middle line:90%
He got interested.

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:12.850 align:middle line:84%
They went on a
preliminary visit and they

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:16.290 align:middle line:84%
were looking for funds,
using the Boston University

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:18.160 align:middle line:90%
as a front.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And Cayce, Cayce Foundation,
offered the funds.

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And they went there--
I think it was 1991--

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:26.410 align:middle line:90%
this time with seismographs.

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:29.762 align:middle line:84%
The idea was to send
shockwaves around the Sphinx

00:22:29.762 --> 00:22:31.970 align:middle line:84%
and through the Sphinx to
see if there were cavities.

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And that produced
the possibility

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:39.968 align:middle line:84%
of a rectangular chamber
under the paws of the Sphinx.

00:22:39.968 --> 00:22:44.560 align:middle line:84%
At that time, like I said,
by sheer synchronicity,

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.840 align:middle line:84%
I was writing "The
Orion Mystery,"

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.120 align:middle line:84%
unknown to me that
they were doing this.

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And Rudolph Gantenbrink, the
German robotics engineer,

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:54.270 align:middle line:84%
was exploring the Great
Pyramids, in the shafts.

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:55.990 align:middle line:84%
All this was going
on at the same time,

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:57.240 align:middle line:90%
and we didn't know each other.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: These are
the shafts that

00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:00.190 align:middle line:84%
come out of the Queen's
Chamber, pointing toward stars.

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:00.773 align:middle line:90%
>>BAUVAL: Yes.

00:23:00.773 --> 00:23:03.556 align:middle line:84%
Inside the Great Pyramid,
there are three chambers,

00:23:03.556 --> 00:23:06.910 align:middle line:84%
a subterranean chamber, a
so-called Queen's Chamber

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:09.870 align:middle line:84%
and a superstructure, and
above it, the King's Chamber.

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:15.520 align:middle line:84%
From these chambers shoot shafts
from the north and south wall.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.920 align:middle line:84%
The ones in the
King's Chamber shoot

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:21.450 align:middle line:84%
right through, out
of the pyramid.

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:24.630 align:middle line:84%
The ones in the Queen's Chamber
stopped-- nobody knew where,

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:26.990 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't
pierce the pyramid.

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:30.503 align:middle line:84%
And until 1993, nobody had
bothered to explore them.

00:23:30.503 --> 00:23:32.630 align:middle line:84%
There has been attempts
with rods and things,

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:35.310 align:middle line:84%
but nobody had thought
of sending a machine

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:37.060 align:middle line:90%
up there, a robotic machine.

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:39.250 align:middle line:84%
The first man to come
up with this idea

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:41.020 align:middle line:90%
was Rudolph Gantenbrink.

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And in March of '93,
while John West and Robert

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:48.950 align:middle line:84%
Schoch were preparing their
presentation for The Geological

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:52.630 align:middle line:84%
Association, and while I was
writing "The Orion Mystery,"

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:54.700 align:middle line:84%
I happened-- it's
a strange story.

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:57.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Professor
Edwards was still alive.

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:01.890 align:middle line:84%
He said, listen, I've heard
the Germans are exploring

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:03.670 align:middle line:84%
the pyramid with a
machine, you know?

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:05.610 align:middle line:90%
And it was all hush-hush.

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:07.989 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you go to
Egypt-- I'll give you

00:24:07.989 --> 00:24:10.530 align:middle line:84%
a letter of recommendation--
and find out what they're doing?

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:12.430 align:middle line:84%
So of course, with a letter of
recommendation from Sir Ivan

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:14.785 align:middle line:84%
Edwards, I was well-received,
and they introduced

00:24:14.785 --> 00:24:19.620 align:middle line:84%
to Rudolph Gantenbrink,
unknown to all of us,

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:21.640 align:middle line:84%
seven days before he
made the discovery.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:23.140 align:middle line:84%
I got very friendly
with Rudolph.

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:24.996 align:middle line:90%
He was a very generous guy.

00:24:24.996 --> 00:24:26.120 align:middle line:90%
He offered to give me data.

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:28.082 align:middle line:84%
I wanted data for
the-- he was going

00:24:28.082 --> 00:24:30.040 align:middle line:84%
to measure the angle of
the shafts with lasers.

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:32.450 align:middle line:84%
I needed precise measurement
to measure the alignment

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:35.019 align:middle line:90%
to the stars.

00:24:35.019 --> 00:24:37.060 align:middle line:84%
I returned-- I was living
in England at the time.

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:37.976 align:middle line:90%
I returned to England.

00:24:37.976 --> 00:24:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And he phoned me on
the 1st of April--

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:41.740 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was
April Fool-- saying,

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:43.790 align:middle line:84%
I found the door
inside the pyramid.

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:46.330 align:middle line:90%
And that's-- hell broke loose.

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:48.222 align:middle line:84%
He asked me to help him
put this in the news.

00:24:48.222 --> 00:24:49.430 align:middle line:90%
We broke the news in England.

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And then, as you know, it
went viral, in the jargon now.

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:57.540 align:middle line:90%
And so all this was going on.

00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:01.730 align:middle line:84%
Coming back to The
Cayce foundation,

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:03.560 align:middle line:90%
nothing happened after '93.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was a huge,
huge interest in finding out,

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:08.580 align:middle line:84%
because they did a program
with Charlton Heston,

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:10.170 align:middle line:90%
"The Mysteries of the Sphinx."

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:11.864 align:middle line:84%
It was exposed to
the American public,

00:25:11.864 --> 00:25:13.280 align:middle line:84%
around the world,
that there might

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.730 align:middle line:90%
be a chamber under the Sphinx.

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:18.010 align:middle line:84%
Of course, huge pressure
on the Egyptian authorities

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:20.260 align:middle line:84%
to allow this, but they
kind of blocked it.

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:23.420 align:middle line:84%
A lot of politics
went shooting about.

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:26.230 align:middle line:84%
But finally, a
couple years later,

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:31.715 align:middle line:84%
in '95, two members of
The Cayce Foundation,

00:25:31.715 --> 00:25:34.180 align:middle line:84%
and funders, life
members, a fellow

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:39.560 align:middle line:84%
called-- he's dead, now-- Joseph
Schor, with another one called

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:43.260 align:middle line:84%
Joseph Jahoda-- we just
called them the Two Joes.

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:46.670 align:middle line:84%
Joseph Jahoda had been one
of the funders and directors

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:48.450 align:middle line:90%
of the earlier project.

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:52.835 align:middle line:84%
Schor had funded, I think,
the three projects of West,

00:25:52.835 --> 00:25:54.200 align:middle line:90%
or partly funded.

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And now they took
it upon themselves

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.590 align:middle line:84%
to try and find
this Hall of Records

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:00.500 align:middle line:84%
on behalf of The
Cayce Foundation.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:03.570 align:middle line:84%
Schor created The
Schor Foundation

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:05.700 align:middle line:84%
with Zahi Hawass for
the five-year license,

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:10.229 align:middle line:84%
in '95, to look for this Hall
of Records clandestinely.

00:26:10.229 --> 00:26:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Because of course, the
Egyptian authorities

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:14.970 align:middle line:84%
were not going to
allow this openly.

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:16.710 align:middle line:84%
The official reason
was that they

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:19.220 align:middle line:84%
want to repair
chasms and faults,

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.630 align:middle line:90%
and clean up the necropolis.

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And they got very, very
close to find something.

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:31.000 align:middle line:84%
At the time, it was
known that there

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.842 align:middle line:84%
was a deep shaft
behind the Sphinx.

00:26:34.842 --> 00:26:36.800 align:middle line:84%
This shaft had been known
for many, many years.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:39.250 align:middle line:90%
But is was flooded with water.

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:42.330 align:middle line:84%
The water had been
pumped by Zahi Hawass.

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:45.120 align:middle line:84%
They went down there,
and with their radars,

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:48.710 align:middle line:84%
found, or believed they
detected a tunnel leading

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:50.280 align:middle line:90%
toward the Sphinx.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And strangely enough, leading
to that area where, in '93,

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:57.024 align:middle line:84%
they had detector
a possible chamber.

00:26:57.024 --> 00:26:59.190 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, everything
was stopped at this stage.

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:02.500 align:middle line:90%
So the story stops there.

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And of course, with a lot of
attempts by many to try and get

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:08.290 align:middle line:84%
permits, permits to
explore the pyramid.

00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:10.370 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately,
so far nobody has

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:12.570 align:middle line:84%
managed to convince the
authorities to allow

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:13.797 align:middle line:90%
further exploration.

00:27:13.797 --> 00:27:14.380 align:middle line:90%
There you are.

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:17.620 align:middle line:84%
So that's the story of
finding the secret chamber.

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:19.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm convinced.

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:22.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about the
chamber under the Sphinx.

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:24.980 align:middle line:84%
Evidence suggests there
is something there.

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:27.630 align:middle line:84%
Now whether it is the Hall
of Records, I don't know.

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:30.680 align:middle line:84%
But the doors inside the pyramid
are very, very promising.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:31.820 align:middle line:90%
Very, very promising.

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:35.190 align:middle line:84%
I've be on this story
for the last 20 years.

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of those
things that-- it's

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:43.290 align:middle line:84%
a very, very mysterious
sort of construction.

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:44.810 align:middle line:90%
I mean the pyramid itself.

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:46.360 align:middle line:84%
But these shafts
are most bizarre.

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:48.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we just
can't figure out why

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:52.690 align:middle line:84%
they would put a
door 60 meters deep

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:56.020 align:middle line:90%
inside the core of the pyramid.

00:27:56.020 --> 00:28:00.474 align:middle line:84%
It invites-- suggests
something behind it.

00:28:00.474 --> 00:28:01.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BAUVAL: But if you wanted
to conceal something,

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:07.570 align:middle line:84%
why would they bring the
shaft into the chamber?

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:10.030 align:middle line:84%
They didn't-- the best thing
would have been not to have

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:13.780 align:middle line:84%
a shaft at all, and build
the chamber within the core

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:17.140 align:middle line:84%
of the pyramid, and nobody
would have known it was there.

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Whereas by bringing
the shaft down,

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:22.820 align:middle line:84%
it invites people to say, well,
what's at the end of the shaft?

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And yet they didn't
cut it through.

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:27.670 align:middle line:84%
So they had a shaft
coming down, but it

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:29.350 align:middle line:84%
didn't cut through
to the chamber.

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:32.815 align:middle line:84%
For the life of me, I don't
know why they did this.

00:28:32.815 --> 00:28:35.470 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it baffles logic.

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:38.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And the Egyptian
authorities are not going

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:42.054 align:middle line:84%
to let anybody try to dig
their way in from the outside,

00:28:42.054 --> 00:28:42.720 align:middle line:90%
to where those--

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BAUVAL: Well,
even if they did,

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:44.728 align:middle line:84%
it would be a very
difficult thing to do.

00:28:44.728 --> 00:28:48.030 align:middle line:84%
Because there's still about
20 meters to reach that door.

00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:53.150 align:middle line:84%
20 meters is about-- well,
in feet, it's about 60 feet.

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:57.760 align:middle line:84%
There's room for several
rooms, if you like.

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:00.920 align:middle line:84%
It would mean dismantling a
large chunk of the pyramid

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.446 align:middle line:90%
to reach it.

00:29:02.446 --> 00:29:04.070 align:middle line:84%
Not only they wouldn't
allow it, but it

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:05.653 align:middle line:84%
would be one hell
of a job to do this.

00:29:05.653 --> 00:29:06.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: And dangerous.

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:07.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BAUVAL: And dangerous.

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:08.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: 'Cause you could
collapse everything on it.

00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:09.816 align:middle line:90%
>>BAUVAL: Well, it's a risk.

00:29:09.816 --> 00:29:13.850 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to play with the
monument by blasting into it.

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:17.200 align:middle line:84%
No, the only way,
really, is we have-- now,

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:20.570 align:middle line:84%
coming back to why
they did this, I mean,

00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:23.690 align:middle line:84%
the shaft is 8
inches by 8 inches.

00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:27.440 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they knew that
by doing a shaft of that size,

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:29.210 align:middle line:90%
nobody could get through it.

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:30.330 align:middle line:90%
Nobody.

00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:34.080 align:middle line:84%
Unless you had the
technology to do it.

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.820 align:middle line:90%
And that's the weird one.

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:39.560 align:middle line:84%
It's as if they designed
a system that's would only

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:43.920 align:middle line:84%
be used if the
technology was available.

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:46.230 align:middle line:84%
In other words, to know
what's behind this door,

00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:48.990 align:middle line:84%
you need a robotic
machine to go up there.

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:53.481 align:middle line:84%
You need the knowledge
of video, or television,

00:29:53.481 --> 00:29:54.730 align:middle line:90%
the knowledge of fiber-optics.

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:58.170 align:middle line:84%
This requires the
technology we have today.

00:29:58.170 --> 00:29:58.990 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BAUVAL: We have
the technology.

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:03.324 align:middle line:84%
But 20 years before, 30 years
before, we didn't have it.

00:30:03.324 --> 00:30:04.740 align:middle line:84%
That's why they
prod it with rods.

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:07.860 align:middle line:84%
So if the reasoning
is correct, whoever

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:10.450 align:middle line:90%
designed this-- it sounds crazy.

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:12.250 align:middle line:84%
But whoever designed
this designed it

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:17.040 align:middle line:84%
so that this could
only be explored

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:20.200 align:middle line:84%
with the technology that
required a robotic machine

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.620 align:middle line:84%
and be able to see
there, and therefore

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:27.122 align:middle line:84%
required the technology we
have today-- cameras, videos.

00:30:27.122 --> 00:30:28.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: That's
really fascinating.

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:30.540 align:middle line:90%
>>BAUVAL: So it's kind of weird.

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:34.650 align:middle line:84%
Because you have a
monument that not only has

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:39.356 align:middle line:84%
these weird designs, the
internal structure itself,

00:30:39.356 --> 00:30:41.230 align:middle line:84%
the chambers-- you've
been in there yourself.

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:42.660 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:44.330 align:middle line:90%
>>BAUVAL: Totally inexplicable.

00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:49.140 align:middle line:84%
We can't understand why
there is a grand gallery, why

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:52.090 align:middle line:84%
you have to crouch down,
emerge in the King's Chamber,

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:55.280 align:middle line:84%
a totally bare chamber
with an empty coffer.

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Why there's a chamber
below-- it's baffling.

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:03.430 align:middle line:84%
It's as if-- it's
as if it requires

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:08.217 align:middle line:84%
a certain advanced
knowledge to figure it out.

00:31:08.217 --> 00:31:08.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Sure.

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BAUVAL: And the shaft advance
suggests this very much.

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:13.480 align:middle line:90%
We may be entirely wrong.

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:16.350 align:middle line:84%
It may be just a crazy
idea that they had.

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:18.995 align:middle line:84%
But with the monuments like
this, you just can't dispense.

00:31:18.995 --> 00:31:21.004 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: That's
a very cool idea.

00:31:21.004 --> 00:31:23.545 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's all the time we have
for this particular episode.

00:31:23.545 --> 00:31:24.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BAUVAL: Oh, well.

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:26.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But I want to
thank you for being here.

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:26.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BAUVAL: It was a pleasure.

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It was a
fascinating conversation.

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:28.300 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Robert.

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:29.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BAUVAL: Thank you very much.

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:31.000 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: If you haven't figured
out why the Hall of Records

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:37.340 align:middle line:84%
is so tasty and so
tempting, bear in mind

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:40.030 align:middle line:84%
that the Cayce readings
said that if we could

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:43.090 align:middle line:84%
get through that tunnel that the
Egyptian authorities won't let

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:47.200 align:middle line:84%
us go through, we would find
technological artifacts that

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.610 align:middle line:84%
may have a higher technology
then we possess now,

00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:54.670 align:middle line:84%
and that those artifacts
would holographically tell us

00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:58.540 align:middle line:84%
the whole history of the
people who colonized our planet

00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:00.050 align:middle line:90%
and where they came from.

00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:02.980 align:middle line:84%
I have spoken to insiders--
we'll get into this in later

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:06.310 align:middle line:84%
parts of "Disclosure"-- who
actually have seen these

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:08.950 align:middle line:84%
so-called
extraterrestrial iPads.

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:11.830 align:middle line:84%
They basically look
like a piece of glass

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:13.200 align:middle line:90%
and they're holographic.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:16.060 align:middle line:84%
They have a heads-up display
that pops up out of the glass,

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:19.440 align:middle line:84%
and you can watch these
events take place.

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And it actually interfaces
with your consciousness.

00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:25.640 align:middle line:84%
So there are some very
great treasures hiding

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:27.820 align:middle line:84%
in that Hall of Records,
waiting to be discovered.

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it is so
tempting, when we're actually

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:34.840 align:middle line:84%
finding out that something
that Edgar Cayce said in trance

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:36.810 align:middle line:84%
actually has been
found on the plateau.

00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:40.150 align:middle line:84%
There is a cathedral-sized
rectangular room

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:41.390 align:middle line:90%
under the paws of the Sphinx.

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:44.970 align:middle line:84%
We know it's there, and we found
the shafts leading into it.

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:47.460 align:middle line:84%
But the authorities
won't let us go in.

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:49.340 align:middle line:90%
That's so frustrating.

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:51.030 align:middle line:84%
Coming up next time,
we're going to be

00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:52.760 align:middle line:90%
interviewing Andrew Collins.

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to start
out with his discovery

00:32:55.500 --> 00:33:01.790 align:middle line:84%
of his own caves that he dug
up through older research.

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out that
they were really there,

00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:06.100 align:middle line:84%
and now the Egyptian
authorities have actually

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:07.990 align:middle line:84%
acknowledged that
they were there.

00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:09.720 align:middle line:84%
Then Collins and
I are going to get

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.830 align:middle line:84%
into a very fascinating
discussion about the Garden

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:15.140 align:middle line:84%
of Eden in the
Bible, and the idea

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:18.560 align:middle line:84%
that this may actually have
been a real place in East

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:22.110 align:middle line:84%
Anatolia, Turkey,
complete with artifacts,

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:24.070 align:middle line:90%
known as Gobekli Tepe.

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:27.570 align:middle line:84%
These 23 to 24 different
Stonehenge-type circles

00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:31.320 align:middle line:84%
of stone, buried underground,
that have now been carbon-dated

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:34.290 align:middle line:90%
to 10,000-plus years ago.

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:36.820 align:middle line:84%
That's coming up next
time, here on "Disclosure."

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:40.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, David Wilcock,
and I thank you for watching.
