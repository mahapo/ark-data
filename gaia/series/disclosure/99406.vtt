I'm David Wilcock,

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.880 align:middle line:90%
and get ready for the download.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.170 align:middle line:10%
In fact, I recommend you
have your rewind button

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.100 align:middle line:10%
hot and ready.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.640 align:middle line:10%
Because in this interview with
Laird Scranton here on my show,

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.479 align:middle line:10%
"Disclosure," there is so
much information packed

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:34.990 align:middle line:10%
into the next half
hour that if I even

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.400 align:middle line:10%
tried to give you a
preview of all the things

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.650 align:middle line:10%
you're about to learn, it would
take me 5 or 10 minutes just

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.920 align:middle line:10%
to try to do an overview.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.250 align:middle line:10%
We go fast in this show.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.230 align:middle line:10%
And there's so much to discuss.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.780 align:middle line:84%
Laird Scranton's work has
tremendous implications.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And it all comes
back to the work

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.020 align:middle line:84%
of a legendary
anthropologist named Griaule

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.050 align:middle line:90%
and his partner, Dieterlen.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.880 align:middle line:84%
Griaule spent 30 years
getting initiated

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.780 align:middle line:84%
into the secrets of a tribe
in Africa in the state of Mali

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.600 align:middle line:90%
called the Dogon.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And their tradition is
that visitors from Sirius

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.670 align:middle line:84%
came here, pointed
up to the star,

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.410 align:middle line:84%
told us that's where they
came from, and gave him

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.910 align:middle line:84%
very specific information
about Sirius that wasn't even

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.100 align:middle line:84%
proven to be true
until later on,

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.670 align:middle line:84%
the full extent
of what they said,

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.210 align:middle line:84%
including the orbital periods
of this brown dwarf that

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.310 align:middle line:90%
went around Sirius.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.990 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of really,
really fascinating things

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.450 align:middle line:90%
that you're about to hear.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And the core of it is
the idea that there

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.550 align:middle line:84%
was a secret tradition
that Griaule didn't really

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.410 align:middle line:84%
get until the end, in
which they teach him

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.430 align:middle line:84%
that there is a harmony between
the laws of nature in terms

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.960 align:middle line:84%
of the creation of matter,
the creation of the universe,

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.090 align:middle line:90%
and the creation of life.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.730 align:middle line:84%
That all three are governed
by similar principles.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And that in this weird,
ancient mythology system--

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.460 align:middle line:84%
so-called mythology-- where
the people in this tribe

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.510 align:middle line:84%
are actually painting their
illustrations in the sand,

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.510 align:middle line:84%
they somehow have preserved
an incredible amount

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.510 align:middle line:84%
of information about
science as we know it today

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.790 align:middle line:84%
that is way beyond their
level of comprehension.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.520 align:middle line:84%
I know the laughter curtain
on this stuff is very large,

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.130 align:middle line:84%
and there is a later
episode coming up

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.030 align:middle line:84%
where I attack Laird
Scranton through the voices

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.400 align:middle line:90%
of his critics.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.000 align:middle line:84%
But before we even get
to the critics' voices,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.610 align:middle line:84%
let's start with this
episode where you just

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.050 align:middle line:84%
get to hear what
the man has to say,

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.970 align:middle line:84%
and it is absolutely
fascinating.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.210 align:middle line:90%
Get ready for the meltdown.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.210 align:middle line:90%
Get ready for the download.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.670 align:middle line:84%
This breaks apart orthodox
theology completely.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.020 align:middle line:84%
It changes everything
we think we know,

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.150 align:middle line:84%
and it suggests that there was a
single, unified group giving us

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.820 align:middle line:84%
an incredible body
of information

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.880 align:middle line:84%
and seeding it all
over the world.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Coming up here on
"Disclosure," Laird Scranton.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.030 align:middle line:84%
I suggest you get your pen and
paper ready because there's

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.770 align:middle line:90%
a lot of things to remember.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.527 align:middle line:90%
I hope you enjoy it.

00:03:16.527 --> 00:03:17.610 align:middle line:90%
All right, Laird Scranton.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:18.550 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "Disclosure."

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:19.430 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being here.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LAIRD SCRANTON: Thank you
very much for having me.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.370 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So if you
could just summarize

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.780 align:middle line:84%
for us what was the research
of Griaule and Dieterlen

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.510 align:middle line:84%
that started in the 1930s
that led to Robert Temple's

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.590 align:middle line:90%
conclusions.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: OK.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, Marcel Griaule
was, in his day,

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.855 align:middle line:84%
the leading anthropologist,
really, in Europe.

00:03:38.855 --> 00:03:40.210 align:middle line:10%
He was a Frenchman.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.570 align:middle line:10%
And he devoted 30
years of his life--

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.570 align:middle line:10%
not every day of those years--
but he made repeated visits

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.770 align:middle line:10%
to the Dogon over the course
of 30 years with his student,

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.040 align:middle line:10%
Germain Dieterlen.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: To the Dogon.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: To
the Dogon in Mali.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.730 align:middle line:10%
The Dogon are
situated eight hours

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.540 align:middle line:10%
into the desert along
an escarpment in a very

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.730 align:middle line:10%
inaccessible place in Mali.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.020 align:middle line:10%
And they spent their time
documenting the creation

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.610 align:middle line:10%
tradition of this tribe.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.521 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And this was an
untouched, unwesternized

00:04:10.521 --> 00:04:11.020 align:middle line:90%
culture.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.006 align:middle line:10%
>>SCRANTON: Yes, very little
contact with other cultures.

00:04:14.006 --> 00:04:15.380 align:middle line:84%
They had moved to
where they were

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.920 align:middle line:84%
to escape forced conversion, we
think, to Islam in the 1500s.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.280 align:middle line:84%
But they claim to
have originally come

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.440 align:middle line:84%
from a large lake far
to the east of them.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you have
this guy, Griaule,

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.717 align:middle line:84%
who is one of the top-- or you
said the top anthropologist.

00:04:32.717 --> 00:04:33.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: The top.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.040 align:middle line:90%
He was cutting edge in his day.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.830 align:middle line:84%
He was the first to use film
to document his studies.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.700 align:middle line:90%
He was a very cutting edge guy.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now why do you think
that he would so specifically

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.410 align:middle line:84%
focus on and devote his life
to studying the Dogon in Mali?

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.160 align:middle line:90%
What was the sizzle there?

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Well,
that's interesting.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.550 align:middle line:84%
The Dogon were not the
only culture in that area

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:57.230 align:middle line:90%
that he was studying.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.688 align:middle line:84%
There were several
related cultures

00:04:58.688 --> 00:05:00.810 align:middle line:84%
who all had a similar
creation tradition.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.290 align:middle line:84%
But I think he realized
early on that he

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:12.400 align:middle line:84%
had stumbled across some
remnants of ancient symbols

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.900 align:middle line:90%
and ancient traditions.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.580 align:middle line:90%
And he wanted to explore that.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.000 align:middle line:84%
But he came at it
without an agenda.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And he did a very good job of
documenting this tradition.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.934 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now were
these sand sketches

00:05:22.934 --> 00:05:24.850 align:middle line:84%
that they'd sketch with
their fingers in sand?

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:25.230 align:middle line:90%
That kind of thing?

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:26.355 align:middle line:90%
Or what else did they have?

00:05:26.355 --> 00:05:30.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Well, the Dogon
don't have a written language.

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And the Dogon are an
interesting culture

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.730 align:middle line:84%
because they have
civic traditions that

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.430 align:middle line:90%
are like ancient Egypt.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.150 align:middle line:84%
They have religious rituals
that are like Judaism.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And they have a creation
tradition that's like Buddhism.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.260 align:middle line:84%
So Griaule and Dieterlen studied
this tribe for a very long time

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.300 align:middle line:90%
to document these things.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.540 align:middle line:84%
It's an esoteric tradition the
way the ancient traditions are,

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:54.810 align:middle line:90%
many of them are.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.740 align:middle line:84%
By which I mean that
only students who

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.470 align:middle line:84%
continue to pursue the inner
secrets of the tradition

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:03.830 align:middle line:90%
ever learn them.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.740 align:middle line:84%
The secrets are open
to any tribe member who

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.960 align:middle line:84%
wants to pursue it, but
it's the job of the student

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.800 align:middle line:90%
to ask the next question.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.920 align:middle line:84%
If they keep asking an
appropriate question,

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.969 align:middle line:90%
they get an honest answer.

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:16.760 align:middle line:84%
If anybody were to come
in from the outside

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.510 align:middle line:84%
and ask a question that was
inappropriate to their status

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.910 align:middle line:84%
as an initiate,
they were supposed

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.330 align:middle line:84%
to be met with silence
or, if necessary, a lie.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So the thing
that I remember the most--

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.650 align:middle line:84%
just so that we can
give everybody--

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.320 align:middle line:84%
because there's going
to be some people,

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.050 align:middle line:84%
and they usually cross
their arms, right?

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.080 align:middle line:90%
That's what the skeptic does.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.100 align:middle line:90%
OK, OK, OK.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.550 align:middle line:90%
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.400 align:middle line:90%
But Sirius.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Yes.

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:43.941 align:middle line:84%
The starting point for
this, the thing that

00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:45.880 align:middle line:84%
brought the Dogon into
the public attention

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.580 align:middle line:84%
was a book that was
published in 1975

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.590 align:middle line:84%
by my publisher, Inner
Traditions, called "The Sirius

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:52.280 align:middle line:90%
Mystery."

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.560 align:middle line:10%
It was written by
Robert KG Temple.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.740 align:middle line:10%
And his concern
was that the Dogon

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.690 align:middle line:10%
seemed to have astronomic
knowledge that they shouldn't

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.270 align:middle line:10%
have, given the
fact that they're

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:04.910 align:middle line:10%
a modern day, primitive tribe.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.010 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
access to telescopes.

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And they understood that
the very bright star

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.640 align:middle line:84%
in the night sky, Sirius,
isn't just a single star.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.130 align:middle line:84%
That it's actually two stars--
a very bright sun-like star

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.610 align:middle line:84%
and a very dark dwarf star,
a very heavy dwarf star

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:25.022 align:middle line:84%
that you can't see because of
the glare of the bright star.

00:07:25.022 --> 00:07:26.480 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of
fact, modern science

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.350 align:middle line:84%
hadn't been able to
image it until well

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:33.615 align:middle line:84%
into the 20th century
with telescopes.

00:07:33.615 --> 00:07:34.969 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: And it's a brown dwarf?

00:07:34.969 --> 00:07:36.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: It's a brown dwarf.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.676 align:middle line:84%
The Dogon also knew the correct
orbital period for the two

00:07:38.676 --> 00:07:41.932 align:middle line:84%
stars and some other
details about the system,

00:07:41.932 --> 00:07:43.890 align:middle line:84%
some of which have been
confirmed and some that

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:44.570 align:middle line:90%
haven't.

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.886 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now these
people in Mali, the tribe

00:07:46.886 --> 00:07:48.010 align:middle line:90%
is called the Dogon, right?

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:48.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Right.

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:49.630 align:middle line:90%
The tribe is called the Dogon.

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And they said that they
were contacted by-- was it Umo?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Well, this gets
into areas of interpretation.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:02.070 align:middle line:84%
Robert Temple's viewpoint was
that this knowledge was likely

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:04.130 align:middle line:90%
reflecting an alien contact.

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And his approach in his book
was to describe it that way.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And he interpreted many of
the statements of the Dogon

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.290 align:middle line:84%
as being descriptions
of alien beings

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:18.340 align:middle line:84%
and being overt
confirmation of the fact

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.590 align:middle line:84%
that there had been
an alien contact.

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:26.610 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that in
these ancient cultures,

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:28.950 align:middle line:84%
many of the references
they make in relation

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:31.430 align:middle line:84%
to their cosmologies,
their creation traditions,

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:34.049 align:middle line:84%
have both historic
aspects to them

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:36.360 align:middle line:90%
and mythical aspects to them.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to be careful
as you wade through this stuff

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.390 align:middle line:84%
not to accidentally
misinterpret something

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:45.140 align:middle line:84%
that was supposed to be
mythical as being historical.

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:50.840 align:middle line:84%
So Robert Temple came into this
and cast it as being strictly

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.210 align:middle line:84%
a statement about alien contact,
which I think on one level,

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:55.640 align:middle line:90%
it probably is.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.430 align:middle line:84%
But that created an uproar
and then created controversy.

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:01.120 align:middle line:90%
And his book sold very well.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:05.514 align:middle line:84%
And it attracted the attention
of the science community.

00:09:05.514 --> 00:09:06.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well,
let's just hold off

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:09.650 align:middle line:84%
for one second and review
something you already said,

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:14.800 align:middle line:90%
which is the Dogon cosmology.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:19.580 align:middle line:84%
They're drawing
this image of Sirius

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.040 align:middle line:90%
with another companion star.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:22.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Yes.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And are they
pointing at Sirius in the sky,

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:26.505 align:middle line:84%
and they know
exactly what it is?

00:09:26.505 --> 00:09:27.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Yes.

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:29.170 align:middle line:84%
They can show the
anthropologists, here,

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:30.970 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
that particular star.

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And in the night sky,
it's easy to find Sirius.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.830 align:middle line:84%
If you can find the belt
stars of Orion, which

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:39.284 align:middle line:84%
are very obvious, you just draw
an imaginary line in your mind

00:09:39.284 --> 00:09:40.700 align:middle line:84%
down the belt
stars, and it points

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:41.930 align:middle line:90%
right to where Sirius is.

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:43.270 align:middle line:90%
So it's easy to identify.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:46.084 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And you're saying that
they had the orbital periods.

00:09:46.084 --> 00:09:47.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: They knew
the orbital period

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:49.750 align:middle line:84%
for the two stars,
which they shouldn't

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:52.247 align:middle line:84%
have had without pretty
advanced telescopes.

00:09:52.247 --> 00:09:54.080 align:middle line:84%
They shouldn't have
been able to image that.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So as the
brown dwarf crosses

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:58.100 align:middle line:84%
in front of the other star, you
can see that in the telescope.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And there's a time
period of that that has

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:00.670 align:middle line:90%
been calculated by scientists.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.044 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: If
you can filter out

00:10:02.044 --> 00:10:06.066 align:middle line:84%
the glare of the bright star,
you can see that happen.

00:10:06.066 --> 00:10:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Is it
possible that they

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.105 align:middle line:84%
could have done it
with a pinhole camera

00:10:09.105 --> 00:10:09.940 align:middle line:90%
or something like that?

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:11.523 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: No, not
really conceivable

00:10:11.523 --> 00:10:12.440 align:middle line:90%
that they could have.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: That's what skeptics
are going to say, of course.

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.148 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Now Carl
Sagan came along and said,

00:10:16.148 --> 00:10:19.470 align:middle line:84%
well, clearly,
some modern visitor

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.140 align:middle line:84%
who had knowledge of the tribe
told them about this stuff,

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.177 align:middle line:84%
and they incorporated
it into their tradition.

00:10:24.177 --> 00:10:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they
got the knowledge.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:26.259 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:10:26.259 --> 00:10:29.069 align:middle line:84%
But when was the knowledge
of Sirius B discovered?

00:10:29.069 --> 00:10:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: I think our
earliest knowledge of it,

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:33.090 align:middle line:90%
scientifically, was about 1918.

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And the Griaule
and Dieterlen stuff

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:39.980 align:middle line:84%
wasn't documented until sometime
probably in the early 1950s.

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:43.130 align:middle line:84%
So the timing is such
that Sagan could be

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:45.940 align:middle line:90%
right in terms of time frame.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:49.070 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that
the Dogon system that

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:53.010 align:middle line:84%
gives this knowledge is all
expressed using words that

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:54.830 align:middle line:90%
are ancient Egyptian words.

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:58.550 align:middle line:84%
That's part of what my work
has been, is to demonstrate how

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:01.320 align:middle line:84%
the correlations work
between those words.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And those words went out
of use around 700 BC.

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:06.950 align:middle line:84%
So the difficulty
with Sagan's position

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:10.140 align:middle line:84%
is precisely which
candidate would

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:13.480 align:middle line:84%
he suggest came in and gave
that knowledge to the Dogon

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.672 align:middle line:90%
using ancient Egyptian words?

00:11:15.672 --> 00:11:16.755 align:middle line:90%
It's not a credible thing.

00:11:16.755 --> 00:11:18.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: And Egypt is in Africa.

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:19.650 align:middle line:90%
Mali is in Africa.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:21.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a conceivable
distance that you could

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.891 align:middle line:90%
travel by caravan to go there.

00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Right.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.240 align:middle line:84%
Also, the Dogon have
civic traditions

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.340 align:middle line:84%
that are predictably like the
ancient Egyptian traditions.

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.360 align:middle line:84%
So there's every reason
to think that there

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.150 align:middle line:84%
was contact between the two
cultures, intimate contact.

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:37.660 align:middle line:84%
Because if the Dogon do it,
it's a pretty good guess

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.100 align:middle line:90%
that the Egyptians also did it.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:39.766 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:11:39.766 --> 00:11:42.410 align:middle line:84%
What's an example that would
be too obvious to ignore?

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: OK, too obvious
to ignore-- they establish

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:49.710 align:middle line:84%
their villages and districts
in pairs called upper and lower

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:50.680 align:middle line:90%
as Egypt did.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:54.780 align:middle line:84%
Egypt was established as two
kingships, upper and lower,

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.070 align:middle line:90%
or two regions, upper and lower.

00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:58.700 align:middle line:90%
That's a very obvious one.

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.310 align:middle line:84%
But there are many
others that are true.

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:04.570 align:middle line:84%
The Dogon have the same set
of complicated calendars

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:06.170 align:middle line:90%
that the Egyptians have.

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:09.505 align:middle line:84%
They have numerous
other traditions

00:12:09.505 --> 00:12:11.575 align:middle line:90%
that are like ancient Egypt.

00:12:11.575 --> 00:12:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, and this includes
counting 360 days in the year

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.180 align:middle line:84%
and then the intercalary
days of five added on, right?

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: It
includes one calendar

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.900 align:middle line:84%
that is a 360 day calendar that
is cast as a solar calendar

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.230 align:middle line:84%
but without the
intercalary days.

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:28.340 align:middle line:84%
OK, and so part of the
reason-- one of the ways

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:33.050 align:middle line:84%
that we can place the Dogon
relationship to Egypt in a time

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:35.130 align:middle line:84%
frame is by the
things they don't

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:36.980 align:middle line:90%
have that the Egyptians did.

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:40.990 align:middle line:84%
Those intercalary days appeared
in Egypt around 2,900 BC,

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:42.840 align:middle line:90%
and the Dogon don't have them.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.410 align:middle line:84%
Writing appeared in
Egypt around 3,000 BC,

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:47.450 align:middle line:84%
and the Dogon don't have
a system of writing,

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:50.480 align:middle line:84%
and nobody thinks they could
have had one and lost it.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:54.376 align:middle line:84%
And so those strongly
suggest that whatever

00:12:54.376 --> 00:12:56.000 align:middle line:84%
contact there was
between the Egyptians

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.490 align:middle line:84%
and the Dogon ended
before writing appeared.

00:12:58.490 --> 00:12:59.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Before 3,000 BC.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Right.

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:04.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You said that there
are specific words that

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:05.980 align:middle line:90%
appear in both languages.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:07.560 align:middle line:84%
Could you give us
a couple examples?

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:12.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Yes, and whoever
put the system of words,

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:16.040 align:middle line:84%
these cosmological words
together, did me a huge favor.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:20.050 align:middle line:84%
Because from a
linguistic standpoint,

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:23.490 align:middle line:84%
because there are only about
40 phonetic values in any given

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:25.740 align:middle line:84%
language that are trying
to be represented,

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.939 align:middle line:84%
there's a huge
chance of coincidence

00:13:27.939 --> 00:13:30.230 align:middle line:84%
that two words are going to
be pronounced the same way,

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:32.229 align:middle line:84%
with the same meaning in
two different languages

00:13:32.229 --> 00:13:34.335 align:middle line:84%
but without a real
connection between the words.

00:13:34.335 --> 00:13:34.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:35.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: OK.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.170 align:middle line:84%
In the cosmology
that the Dogon have,

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:42.360 align:middle line:84%
every significant term is
given at least two meanings,

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.970 align:middle line:84%
and those meanings are logically
distanced from one another.

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:46.730 align:middle line:84%
So you can't guess
the second meaning

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:48.190 align:middle line:90%
by knowing the first one.

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:51.240 align:middle line:84%
So now you go to Egypt, and
you find the same two meanings

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.850 align:middle line:84%
attached to the
same phonetic value,

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:54.390 align:middle line:84%
and you've got a
lock on meaning.

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:58.430 align:middle line:84%
It's not a traditional
etymological lock,

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:01.570 align:middle line:84%
but it's evidence that
any reasonable person

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:03.100 align:middle line:90%
ought to accept.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.549 align:middle line:90%
It goes beyond coincidence.

00:14:04.549 --> 00:14:06.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's not just
a single word that

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:08.200 align:middle line:84%
does that but an
entire system of words

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.724 align:middle line:90%
that all work that way.

00:14:09.724 --> 00:14:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And so it really goes way beyond
the possibility of coincidence.

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:14.390 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example.

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Many of the Dogon and Egyptian
words are also Hebrew words.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.130 align:middle line:84%
The Dogon creator
god, who is considered

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:23.710 align:middle line:84%
to be their hidden
god, is named "Amma."

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And he's like the
counterpart to Amen in Egypt,

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.690 align:middle line:90%
who is the hidden god.

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:32.870 align:middle line:84%
The word "Amma" also means
to grasp, or to hold firm,

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:34.680 align:middle line:90%
or to establish.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.929 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian word also means
to grasp or to hold firm.

00:14:37.929 --> 00:14:38.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:40.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: When
you go to Hebrew--

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:43.990 align:middle line:84%
I read an article a few years
back by a Hebrew scholar who

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:47.660 align:middle line:84%
was arguing that the Hebrew
word amen at the end of Hebrew

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:50.660 align:middle line:84%
prayers couldn't be related
to the Egyptian god Amen

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:55.250 align:middle line:84%
because it comes from a root
that means "to establish."

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:57.447 align:middle line:84%
So he didn't understand
the way the meanings work.

00:14:57.447 --> 00:14:58.280 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh my gosh.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.238 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: So he was
actually shooting himself

00:15:00.238 --> 00:15:02.260 align:middle line:84%
in the foot when we
made that statement.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.600 align:middle line:84%
But this is the
way the words work.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And there's lots
of other evidence

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.690 align:middle line:90%
besides that to support it.

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:10.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for example,
with the two gods,

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:14.290 align:middle line:84%
each holds a similar role in the
cosmology, similar relationship

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:16.450 align:middle line:90%
to other deities.

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:18.900 align:middle line:84%
They're credited
with the same acts.

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.970 align:middle line:84%
So they have the
same iconic objects.

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:25.280 align:middle line:84%
So there's lots of
evidence to correlate this.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:29.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now, we also
have a fascinating study

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:37.260 align:middle line:84%
of the Hebrew Sephiroth, the
original Kabbalistic tree

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:37.900 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:38.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Yes.

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.217 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And as you're telling
me this stuff, I'm thinking,

00:15:42.217 --> 00:15:44.050 align:middle line:84%
hmm, is there a Kabbalah
connection to this?

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:45.008 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Absolutely.

00:15:45.008 --> 00:15:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And the farther down towards the
bottom of the system you get,

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:51.269 align:middle line:84%
the more commonality you
can see with the Kabbala.

00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:51.935 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:15:51.935 --> 00:15:52.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Yes.

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:53.884 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Could you
give me an example?

00:15:53.884 --> 00:15:55.258 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: About
five years ago,

00:15:55.258 --> 00:15:56.740 align:middle line:90%
John Anthony West emailed me.

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:59.460 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you know, there's
a word for the kind of study

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:01.400 align:middle line:84%
you're doing, the
comparisons you're doing.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.550 align:middle line:84%
There's a tradition that
Schwaller de Lubicz,

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:06.220 align:middle line:84%
out of Egypt, the
symbolist, wrote about.

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.180 align:middle line:84%
It's called "The
Bridge of Sirah."

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:12.570 align:middle line:84%
S-I-R-A-H. And the upshot of
it is that when the truth is

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:15.800 align:middle line:84%
finally known, it will lie
along a razor's edge between two

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.780 align:middle line:84%
chasms, one that represents
science and the other that

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.020 align:middle line:90%
represents superstition.

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:23.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the
Kabbalist tradition,

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.050 align:middle line:90%
they have the same concept.

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:28.380 align:middle line:84%
It's called Nisirah, and
it describes the same sorts

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:32.200 align:middle line:84%
of elements of cosmology that
relate to this Bridge of Sirah

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.420 align:middle line:84%
concept in Islam and
that also tie back

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.680 align:middle line:84%
to the other traditions
of that site.

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.420 align:middle line:84%
So there are some fairly
compelling reasons to think.

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Yeah, and if the
words that the Dogon are using

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:48.380 align:middle line:84%
correspond to the
words in Egypt,

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:51.920 align:middle line:84%
you're saying that this
predates the written

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:55.100 align:middle line:84%
hieroglyphic delineation
of those words?

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: It's generally
understood that cosmology

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.720 align:middle line:84%
preceded writing in the
culture, the ancient cultures,

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.100 align:middle line:90%
including Egypt.

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.349 align:middle line:84%
OK, and what it looks
like is, because each

00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:08.760 align:middle line:84%
of the cosmological terms that
the Dogon define are normally

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.217 align:middle line:84%
associated with a drawing,
a cosmological drawing.

00:17:11.217 --> 00:17:12.800 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
the Dogon priests

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.150 align:middle line:84%
say they are incapable
of discussing

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:18.980 align:middle line:84%
a concept of cosmology without
also drawing it in the sand.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:19.714 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, wow.

00:17:19.714 --> 00:17:20.339 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: OK.

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:23.910 align:middle line:84%
These shapes that have multiple
meanings associated with them,

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:27.880 align:middle line:84%
there a set of about 30 of
those that take the same form

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.390 align:middle line:84%
and same meanings
as Egyptian glyphs.

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:34.390 align:middle line:84%
So it looks to me as if the
earliest hieroglyphic writing

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:39.530 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt, they adopted wholesale
these cosmological figures

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:41.895 align:middle line:84%
and meanings as
meanings for the glyphs.

00:17:41.895 --> 00:17:43.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Right, so the
key with hieroglyphics

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:47.870 align:middle line:84%
is it doesn't happen until
later that language actually

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:53.034 align:middle line:84%
uses vowels and consonants
to delineate sound per se.

00:17:53.034 --> 00:17:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: The
official viewpoint

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:56.490 align:middle line:84%
is that the Egyptian
hieroglyphic language was

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:58.355 align:middle line:90%
primarily phonetic in nature.

00:17:58.355 --> 00:17:58.980 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.771 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: But if you
consider that you've

00:18:00.771 --> 00:18:04.280 align:middle line:84%
got 40 phonetic values
and 4,000 Egyptian glyphs,

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.070 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't take a
rocket scientist

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:08.570 align:middle line:84%
to figure out that it couldn't
have been phonetic primarily.

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:10.310 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Absolutely.

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:16.290 align:middle line:84%
So we have a culture
that seems to have

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:18.270 align:middle line:90%
been in multiple locations.

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:21.900 align:middle line:84%
We could say that it was the
precedent for Hebrew culture,

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.000 align:middle line:84%
the precedent for
Egyptian culture,

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.390 align:middle line:90%
the precedent for Dogon culture.

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:27.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Right.

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.805 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: That there may
have been one seed of origin

00:18:29.805 --> 00:18:32.190 align:middle line:90%
that they all sprouted from.

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And the Dogon just sort of got
isolated into a small area.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Yes.

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:42.250 align:middle line:84%
You've just described the
last 20 years of my work--

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:45.000 align:middle line:90%
is tracing that concept.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now, what's interesting
about your work beyond what

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:52.150 align:middle line:84%
we've discussed already is
that you have advanced the idea

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:57.670 align:middle line:84%
that these allegedly
primitive myths encode

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:00.600 align:middle line:84%
a great deal of relevant
scientific information

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.704 align:middle line:84%
that is very current
for our time.

00:19:02.704 --> 00:19:03.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Yes.

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:06.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Sirius information,
as it turns out,

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:09.669 align:middle line:84%
is just the very smallest
tip of the iceberg.

00:19:09.669 --> 00:19:10.210 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: The Dogon say
that their tradition describes

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:16.410 align:middle line:84%
how their tribal god
Amma created matter.

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:18.576 align:middle line:84%
Now, I could see from
my limited perspective

00:19:18.576 --> 00:19:19.950 align:middle line:84%
at the time I
started researching

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:23.280 align:middle line:84%
is that they had the
definition of an atom right.

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.460 align:middle line:84%
They had definitions
of electrons, protons,

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:26.840 align:middle line:90%
and neutrons right.

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:29.680 align:middle line:84%
But they described a whole
descending structure from there

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.470 align:middle line:84%
that I wasn't
qualified to evaluate.

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:35.240 align:middle line:84%
So I started educating myself
about the structure of matter,

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:39.450 align:middle line:84%
reading Brian Greene and Stephen
Hawking and people like that.

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And what I discovered was
that you can take passages

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:44.680 align:middle line:84%
from Brian Greene
and Steven Hawking,

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.750 align:middle line:84%
and lay them side by
side with descriptions

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:50.090 align:middle line:84%
from the Dogon, along with
the diagram from Hawking

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:53.226 align:middle line:84%
and the drawing from
the Dogon, and lay out

00:19:53.226 --> 00:19:55.600 align:middle line:84%
the entire structure of matter
all the way down to waves,

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:56.499 align:middle line:90%
and it's right.

00:19:56.499 --> 00:19:57.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And Richard Fineman would
be included in there, too.

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:01.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Well, yes.

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:03.050 align:middle line:84%
Fineman probably
wouldn't agree with this,

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:05.180 align:middle line:84%
but many of the things
that Fineman talks about

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.136 align:middle line:90%
are included in there.

00:20:06.136 --> 00:20:07.510 align:middle line:84%
But it actually
goes a little bit

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:10.660 align:middle line:84%
beyond what traditional
astrophysicists talk about.

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:13.530 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
Dogon discuss how

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:17.610 align:middle line:84%
is it-- if matter exists
as waves originally

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:21.840 align:middle line:84%
and then becomes particles, the
Dogon talk about that process

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.210 align:middle line:90%
of how that happens.

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And Brian Greene and
Stephen Hawking don't.

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So they've got
Heisenberg's uncertainty

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:28.542 align:middle line:90%
principle nailed.

00:20:28.542 --> 00:20:30.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Yes,
and they also talk

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.470 align:middle line:84%
about things like what
preceded the Big Bang.

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:34.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:37.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: So we're
talking information

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:41.080 align:middle line:84%
that looks like it leads what
we know by maybe 50 years.

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So they're
seeing galaxies

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:46.390 align:middle line:84%
as blossoming from a
center or something?

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:48.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: OK, if
you remember that

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.510 align:middle line:84%
in these esoteric traditions,
in the hermetic tradition,

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:55.090 align:middle line:84%
the quintessential statement
of this creation tradition

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:56.815 align:middle line:90%
is as above, so below?

00:20:56.815 --> 00:20:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: OK, that
implies that at some level,

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:03.270 align:middle line:84%
the processes of the
macrocosm, the universe,

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:06.097 align:middle line:84%
are fundamentally similar
to the processes of matter.

00:21:06.097 --> 00:21:06.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Sure.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:11.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: OK, that's what
this Dogon system is all about.

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:14.730 align:middle line:84%
When they talk about
cosmology or creation,

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:17.520 align:middle line:84%
they're talking about three
themes: creation of matter,

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.750 align:middle line:84%
creation of the universe,
and creation of life.

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:24.340 align:middle line:84%
But then what they proceed
to do is define all three

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:28.810 align:middle line:84%
of those processes using a
single sequence of symbols.

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:29.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Ah, right.

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:32.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: OK, so this
sequence of symbols,

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.620 align:middle line:84%
because each symbol
can be used effectively

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:40.540 align:middle line:84%
to represent an aspect of those
processes in the right order,

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:42.630 align:middle line:84%
demonstrate that
all of those things

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:45.680 align:middle line:84%
are fundamentally similar when
you get to the bottom of it.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:52.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you therefore can
extrapolate into the science

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.430 align:middle line:90%
of DNA and chromosomes.

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Right, you could.

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:58.720 align:middle line:84%
There are statements they
make about those things that

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:03.340 align:middle line:84%
are as scientifically accurate
as the creation of matter

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:04.310 align:middle line:90%
stages they talk about.

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:08.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So for example,
human chromosomes

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:10.640 align:middle line:84%
are going to be either xx
or xy depending on gender.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.322 align:middle line:90%
You have 22 chromosomes.

00:22:12.322 --> 00:22:13.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Getting
back to the xx,

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:17.570 align:middle line:84%
xy, in Dogon
numerology, three, which

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:20.450 align:middle line:84%
is comparable to the three
branches of that Y chromosome,

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:22.300 align:middle line:90%
is the number of the male.

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:26.640 align:middle line:84%
Four, which corresponds to
the four branches of the x,

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.170 align:middle line:84%
is the number of the
female, and seven is

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:30.710 align:middle line:90%
the number of the individual.

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:33.040 align:middle line:84%
You combine the x and
the y to get the person.

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.600 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh my gosh.

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.316 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: And the tradition
is a matriarchal tradition.

00:22:37.316 --> 00:22:38.690 align:middle line:84%
What they've just
described there

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:43.140 align:middle line:84%
is the genetics of a
woman, or of a girl.

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:43.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.690 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, a skeptic
would say, well,

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:48.030 align:middle line:90%
he's just playing with numbers.

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:50.810 align:middle line:84%
But there's more
to the chromosomes

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:52.520 align:middle line:84%
that you're seeing
than just that.

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:56.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: OK, for a person
who researches the things I

00:22:56.260 --> 00:23:02.250 align:middle line:84%
research, the single greatest
danger in trying to research it

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:04.750 align:middle line:90%
is our own wishfulness.

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:07.330 align:middle line:84%
Our mind is wired
to see patterns even

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:08.360 align:middle line:90%
where they don't exist.

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.485 align:middle line:84%
If you think of a child
lying in a field looking up

00:23:10.485 --> 00:23:12.340 align:middle line:84%
at the clouds, they
often don't see clouds.

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:14.006 align:middle line:84%
They say, well, look,
there's a chicken.

00:23:14.006 --> 00:23:16.747 align:middle line:84%
And look, there's
a-- they see images.

00:23:16.747 --> 00:23:17.580 align:middle line:90%
They're imaginative.

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:19.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It's like the grilled
cheese sandwich with Jesus.

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:19.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: That's right.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:20.660 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:22.160 align:middle line:84%
So people are going
to see patterns,

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.740 align:middle line:90%
even where they don't exist.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.380 align:middle line:84%
So the difficulty
for somebody like me

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:27.510 align:middle line:84%
is how do you
distinguish between

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:31.010 align:middle line:84%
a wishful interpretation and one
that's a real interpretation?

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And the standard I set for
myself was every interpretation

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:36.770 align:middle line:84%
has to start with an
explicit statement

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:38.390 align:middle line:90%
on the part of the culture.

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:41.540 align:middle line:84%
So I don't say that the
system represents matter,

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:43.060 align:middle line:90%
the Dogon do.

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:43.750 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:46.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Now, once
you get into the arena

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.870 align:middle line:84%
where you have multiple
traditions that

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:52.070 align:middle line:84%
look like they came out
of the same system, now

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:55.630 align:middle line:84%
you can require that that
flat statement be confirmed

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:58.250 align:middle line:84%
by others of those
cultures, that they also

00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:00.090 align:middle line:90%
saw it the same way.

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:03.760 align:middle line:84%
So we have two cultures overtly
saying we see it this way.

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm in a
position to pursue that.

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And when I get to that
end of that pursuit,

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:11.330 align:middle line:84%
if I can finish a simple
sentence, a sentence that says,

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:14.010 align:middle line:84%
"we know this must
be true, because,"

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:16.730 align:middle line:84%
then I have a working
interpretation.

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:18.860 align:middle line:90%
If I can't, that gets set aside.

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:20.780 align:middle line:84%
That's something that
may or may not be true,

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:23.880 align:middle line:84%
and I hope that some
little detail will turn up

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:26.380 align:middle line:84%
in some other culture that will
pull it all together for me.

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:29.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So I've seen,
and I have in my slide

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:35.600 align:middle line:84%
shows, a sculpture allegedly
from the Dogon in Mali

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:39.283 align:middle line:84%
that has a human face
that's very unusual.

00:24:39.283 --> 00:24:39.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Yes.

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It has
large eyes that wrap

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.345 align:middle line:84%
clear across to about
here on the face.

00:24:44.345 --> 00:24:44.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: OK.

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: And a large head.

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.152 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: OK.

00:24:48.152 --> 00:24:50.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You've been really
tentative about whether there's

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:53.760 align:middle line:84%
any ET involvement in this or
not so far in our interview.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: OK, well in
the Buddhist tradition,

00:24:56.040 --> 00:25:01.570 align:middle line:84%
it's flatly stated that the
most sacred symbols were given

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:03.240 align:middle line:90%
to them by a non-human source.

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.170 align:middle line:90%
They flatly say that.

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:07.300 align:middle line:84%
In the Dogon
tradition, they say it

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:11.350 align:middle line:84%
was given to them by a non-human
source, but they qualify that.

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:13.610 align:middle line:84%
They say it was
not only non-human,

00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:15.710 align:middle line:90%
it was also non-physical.

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:16.210 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:18.335 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: But this is a
complicated non-physical,

00:25:18.335 --> 00:25:21.300 align:middle line:84%
because they tell us
that whoever gave them

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.910 align:middle line:84%
this knowledge in ancient
times was concerned about what

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:25.960 align:middle line:84%
the long term
effects on our health

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.870 align:middle line:90%
would be from being around them.

00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh wow.

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:30.258 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: And so
their solution to that

00:25:30.258 --> 00:25:33.880 align:middle line:84%
was to take eight
Dogon tribespeople

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.050 align:middle line:84%
and sequester them at
some remote location,

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:39.050 align:middle line:84%
and teach those eight the
civilizing skills they were

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:41.980 align:middle line:84%
trying to teach them, and
these civilizing skills

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:45.949 align:middle line:84%
were given in the context
of this creation system,

00:25:45.949 --> 00:25:47.740 align:middle line:84%
and then send those
eight back to the tribe

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:48.972 align:middle line:90%
to teach everybody else.

00:25:48.972 --> 00:25:50.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Do you
think it's possible

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:53.452 align:middle line:84%
that they had radioactive
isotopes coming off

00:25:53.452 --> 00:25:54.660 align:middle line:90%
of their bodies or something?

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: No, I think if
they truly were non-physical,

00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:00.710 align:middle line:84%
there are indications
that if you believe

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:04.160 align:middle line:84%
the Dogon, and the Buddhists,
and the Kabbalists,

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:07.900 align:middle line:84%
universes form in pairs-- one
material, one non-material,

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:10.660 align:middle line:84%
and that there's a boundary
between those universes that

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:13.145 align:middle line:84%
through electromagnetics
you can breach.

00:26:13.145 --> 00:26:13.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: OK, now, any
time you get into a situation

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:19.100 align:middle line:84%
where there are
electromagnetics strong enough

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:22.170 align:middle line:84%
to create these funny effects
that might potentially

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:26.682 align:middle line:84%
breach that, you get really
bad effects on human health.

00:26:26.682 --> 00:26:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's what
they were talking about.

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:29.837 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Sure.

00:26:29.837 --> 00:26:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, another thing that
I find really fascinating

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:36.570 align:middle line:84%
is you have the Dogon
in Africa, and then you

00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:39.700 align:middle line:90%
have the Dogu in Japan.

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have a personal
knowledge of this,

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:45.590 align:middle line:84%
because I studied with a guy
who was a Shinto acupuncturist,

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:47.660 align:middle line:84%
the most horrific
torture you can imagine.

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:50.210 align:middle line:84%
You'll find he'll stick the
needle all over your body

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:53.029 align:middle line:84%
and find the most painful
place and just go crazy on it.

00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Uh-huh.

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:55.653 align:middle line:84%
They were originally
tax accountants, right?

00:26:55.653 --> 00:26:58.090 align:middle line:90%


00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:00.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Probably so.

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Japanese
tradition is that they

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:06.910 align:middle line:84%
have Anemono Toribune, or the
flying boats from the universe.

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:08.220 align:middle line:90%
They land.

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:09.260 align:middle line:90%
These people get out.

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:12.690 align:middle line:90%
They're called Dogu.

00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And then the tribe in
Africa is called Dogon,

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:17.180 align:middle line:90%
which is very interesting.

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:19.122 align:middle line:84%
And these people
literally civilized Japan.

00:27:19.122 --> 00:27:20.455 align:middle line:90%
They gave them the tea ceremony.

00:27:20.455 --> 00:27:21.550 align:middle line:90%
They gave them kimonos.

00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:23.840 align:middle line:84%
They gave them--
thank God-- wasabi.

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:27.510 align:middle line:84%
Sushi, all that
technique, how to terrace

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:30.020 align:middle line:84%
for rice growth, all
this kind of stuff,

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:31.660 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately, their
written language.

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:32.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Right.

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:35.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now, if you've got
flying boats from the universe

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:38.260 align:middle line:84%
and a people calling
themselves Dogu,

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:40.160 align:middle line:84%
and then the
sculpture of the Dogon

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:43.290 align:middle line:84%
looks like the sculpture
of the Dogu from Japan,

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:45.412 align:middle line:84%
it appears there's a
common origin here.

00:27:45.412 --> 00:27:47.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Yes, I would
say there probably is.

00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:50.570 align:middle line:84%
But the way I see it,
because in the cultures

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:55.140 align:middle line:84%
I've studied from Africa, Egypt,
India, Tibet, and China, so far

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:57.850 align:middle line:84%
today through the
books I've written,

00:27:57.850 --> 00:27:59.310 align:middle line:90%
they all say the same thing.

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:01.770 align:middle line:84%
They all say that the
way they got this--

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:03.900 align:middle line:84%
they received this
tradition was it

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.360 align:middle line:84%
was an instructed tradition
given to them by somebody

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:08.120 align:middle line:90%
who knew more than they did.

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:11.540 align:middle line:84%
In Egypt, the myth
is, or the story

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:13.970 align:middle line:84%
is, that their
written language was

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:16.300 align:middle line:90%
given to them by their gods.

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:19.340 align:middle line:84%
The story in Egypt is the
plan for the Giza Plateau

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:24.780 align:middle line:84%
fell from the skies, comparable
to, say, a crop circle.

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:26.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:28.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: So in each
of these cultures,

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:31.369 align:middle line:84%
there's this idea that somebody
who knew more than we did

00:28:31.369 --> 00:28:32.910 align:middle line:84%
taught us this stuff
a long time ago.

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:37.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I've also noted
that Mesoamerican sculptures

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:42.260 align:middle line:84%
of Viracocha, the oldest ones
as well as the Hopi Kachina

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:46.380 align:middle line:84%
sculptures all have
morphological characteristics

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:51.210 align:middle line:84%
similar to the Dogon sculpture
and the Dogu sculpture.

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:54.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Yes, and I see
connections to the Hopi.

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:58.130 align:middle line:84%
The China book spells out
one very clear connection

00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:03.750 align:middle line:84%
to North American
Native American tribes.

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:09.105 align:middle line:84%
You can find that there's a
portable shrine called a yurt.

00:29:09.105 --> 00:29:09.730 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:11.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: And the
symbolism of a yurt

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:14.500 align:middle line:84%
is all the same symbolism
as a Buddhist stupa.

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Only difference is,
instead of being

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.416 align:middle line:84%
built as a permanent structure,
it's built to be portable.

00:29:18.416 --> 00:29:19.380 align:middle line:90%
It's a portable tent.

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:20.005 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:29:20.005 --> 00:29:21.649 align:middle line:84%
The stupa has the
little column on top,

00:29:21.649 --> 00:29:23.190 align:middle line:84%
but otherwise the
shape is identical.

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:24.190 align:middle line:90%
I never thought of that.

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: OK, now, there
are different forms of yurts.

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:30.420 align:middle line:84%
The most complex form
of a yurt is a match

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:33.789 align:middle line:84%
for the Navajo roundhouse, both
structurally and symbolically.

00:29:33.789 --> 00:29:34.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:36.205 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: So you know
there's a connection.

00:29:36.205 --> 00:29:37.980 align:middle line:84%
The simplest form
of yurt in Mongolia

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:39.920 align:middle line:84%
is referred to as a
teepee, and it looks just

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.380 align:middle line:90%
like a Native American teepee.

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:42.174 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:29:42.174 --> 00:29:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually
called a teepee?

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: It's
called a teepee.

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Geez.

00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:47.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: So you've
got connections there

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:49.980 align:middle line:84%
through cosmology
into North America

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:52.810 align:middle line:84%
that I know because
of the practices

00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:56.770 align:middle line:84%
the Hopi still
perpetuate that they're

00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:58.212 align:middle line:90%
likely to be connected there.

00:29:58.212 --> 00:30:00.670 align:middle line:10%
Part of what I've done through
my study in the third book I

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:03.800 align:middle line:10%
wrote, which is called "The
Cosmological Origins of Myth

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.900 align:middle line:10%
and Symbol"-- the
purpose of that book

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:10.010 align:middle line:10%
was to set out a list
of what I considered

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:12.020 align:middle line:10%
to be the signatures
of this tradition.

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:14.280 align:middle line:10%
And by signature I
mean if a culture

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:16.406 align:middle line:10%
has this, it's not reasonable
that they didn't have

00:30:16.406 --> 00:30:18.155 align:middle line:10%
the whole tradition,
or at least it wasn't

00:30:18.155 --> 00:30:19.322 align:middle line:10%
influenced by the tradition.

00:30:19.322 --> 00:30:19.946 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:30:19.946 --> 00:30:21.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: OK, and
then use that list

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:24.830 align:middle line:84%
to predict what I was going to
find when I explored a Tibetan

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:26.690 align:middle line:84%
culture called
the Nakhi who were

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:29.330 align:middle line:84%
at the borderline
between Tibet and China.

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And having done that then,
the way the books plays out,

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:36.360 align:middle line:84%
the Tibetan culture affirms
each one of those signatures.

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And so from there, you can
conclude that at bottom it

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:39.890 align:middle line:90%
was the same tradition.

00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:41.340 align:middle line:84%
They have even have
glyphs that look

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:43.714 align:middle line:84%
like the Egyptian hieroglyphs
that have the same meanings

00:30:43.714 --> 00:30:44.740 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And so this has been the
approach I've been taking,

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:48.840 align:middle line:84%
is to establish
these commonalities

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:52.360 align:middle line:84%
and then use them to
positively demonstrate

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:54.910 align:middle line:84%
the influence of this
tradition in all these places.

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It is
amazing to consider

00:30:57.830 --> 00:31:06.140 align:middle line:84%
that this pictographic depiction
of verbal, transmitted data

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:12.040 align:middle line:84%
in Africa could contain so
much information that can now

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:14.530 align:middle line:90%
be deciphered in modern times.

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:16.547 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that the
people who gave them this

00:31:16.547 --> 00:31:18.630 align:middle line:84%
wanted that to happen,
that that was their intent?

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:19.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Absolutely they did.

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:21.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure they did.

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:23.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
that the cultures that

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.770 align:middle line:84%
never developed
writing did the best

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:27.040 align:middle line:90%
job of keeping it straight.

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:32.020 align:middle line:84%
But these studies
also led me to look

00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:34.410 align:middle line:84%
at Egyptian words, initially
just the words that

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:36.461 align:middle line:90%
had those 30 common symbols.

00:31:36.461 --> 00:31:38.710 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to understand
how the hieroglyphs worked.

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:39.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:42.896 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Well, so I was
focusing on very simple words.

00:31:42.896 --> 00:31:44.270 align:middle line:84%
If I had had
perfect knowledge, I

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:46.850 align:middle line:84%
would have started with
an Egyptian word that

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:48.340 align:middle line:90%
means "week."

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:49.950 align:middle line:90%
It's written with two glyphs.

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:51.880 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian sun glyph,
which is a circle

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:54.130 align:middle line:84%
with a dot in the middle of
it, represents the concept

00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:56.010 align:middle line:90%
of a day or the sun.

00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:58.320 align:middle line:84%
Or you find it in
words whose meanings

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.760 align:middle line:90%
represent periods of time.

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And the second glyph
is an upside down

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:05.610 align:middle line:84%
U that is the
Egyptian number 10.

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And so I looked at
that word, and I said,

00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:10.720 align:middle line:84%
symbolically, this word
says to me 10 days.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And I went, and I
did some research,

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:16.210 align:middle line:84%
and discovered the Egyptians
had a ten day week.

00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:16.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: So amazingly,
this little hieroglyphic word,

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:22.970 align:middle line:84%
if you read it my way,
tells you its own meaning.

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:23.704 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:32:23.704 --> 00:32:25.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: So
then I asked what's

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:27.280 align:middle line:84%
the possibility that
other Egyptian words might

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:28.880 align:middle line:90%
work this way?

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Turns out they all do if
you know the right meaning

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.280 align:middle line:90%
for the glyph.

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.770 align:middle line:84%
But in addition, there
are certain Egyptian words

00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:38.420 align:middle line:84%
where, in addition to that
little symbolic sentence,

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:41.230 align:middle line:84%
you also have a
trailing glyphs that

00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:44.200 align:middle line:84%
is drawn into the
word for emphasis

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.040 align:middle line:90%
according to the egyptologists.

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:48.192 align:middle line:84%
But I can see, when
I read these words,

00:32:48.192 --> 00:32:49.650 align:middle line:84%
that the reason
that trailing glyph

00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:51.890 align:middle line:84%
is there is because the
symbolic sentence defines

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:53.950 align:middle line:90%
the meaning of the glyph.

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:55.780 align:middle line:84%
So now you can lay
out definitions

00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:58.910 align:middle line:84%
for all of the Egyptian glyphs
based on their own references,

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:00.480 align:middle line:90%
their own authority.

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And now you can read pretty
much any Egyptian word you want.

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:06.390 align:middle line:84%
If there's a cosmological
concept I don't understand,

00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:09.070 align:middle line:84%
the first thing I do is I go
to the Egyptian hieroglyphic

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:11.430 align:middle line:84%
dictionary and use it
like an encyclopedia

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:14.960 align:middle line:84%
to explain to me what did
they think about this concept.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: That's brilliant.

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:20.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is the
end of the time

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:24.000 align:middle line:84%
that we have for
this episode, but you

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.434 align:middle line:84%
must feel a very strong sense
of duty and responsibility

00:33:29.434 --> 00:33:30.850 align:middle line:84%
to get this out
there, because you

00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:33.220 align:middle line:84%
have such a huge body of
knowledge that would really

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:35.389 align:middle line:84%
advance humanity,
and that nobody

00:33:35.389 --> 00:33:36.930 align:middle line:84%
knows about other
than the people who

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:37.810 align:middle line:90%
have found your work.

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:38.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Well, there's
sort of a yin yang

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:41.260 align:middle line:84%
to that, because it's
also a body of knowledge

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:43.170 align:middle line:84%
that somebody went
to enormous effort

00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:45.330 align:middle line:84%
to keep secret for
thousands of years.

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And so the question
arises what right

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:52.610 align:middle line:84%
do I have at this point in time
to publish about this stuff?

00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:56.470 align:middle line:84%
But my outlook on that is the
only purpose for producing

00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:57.980 align:middle line:84%
this information
was in the hopes

00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:00.229 align:middle line:84%
that we were going to notice
that our religion matched

00:34:00.229 --> 00:34:04.290 align:middle line:84%
science and shortcut us
towards scientific ends.

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:08.639 align:middle line:84%
And if we're within 50 years now
of the sum of that knowledge,

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:10.280 align:middle line:84%
we only have a 50
year time period

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:14.090 align:middle line:84%
in which for it have any benefit
based on what was intended.

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And so I use that as a rationale
for why I should talk about it.

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:18.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, this
has been mind blowing.

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:18.600 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Laird.

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:19.239 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate it.

00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:20.447 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Thanks very much.

00:34:20.447 --> 00:34:22.000 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate it too.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.480 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: I believe that
what we're seeing here

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:28.620 align:middle line:10%
is the records of the
positive side of ET contact.

00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:32.080 align:middle line:10%
These people that were
called the Dogon in Africa

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:36.909 align:middle line:10%
also appear to be the Dogu who
contacted the people in Japan.

00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:39.350 align:middle line:84%
They also appear to be
the essence of Viracocha

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:41.250 align:middle line:90%
who contacted Mesoamerica.

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:44.449 align:middle line:84%
They also appear to be the
Kachina who contacted the Hopi.

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And consistently,
they are giving us

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:51.210 align:middle line:84%
a positive, benevolent
view of our cosmos,

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:54.460 align:middle line:84%
showing the interconnection
between the creation of matter,

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:56.540 align:middle line:84%
the creation of the
universe, and the creation

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:58.250 align:middle line:90%
of biological life.

00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:00.610 align:middle line:84%
It's also interesting
that Laird Scranton says

00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:03.680 align:middle line:84%
that their philosophy describes
how universes are created

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:07.910 align:middle line:84%
in pairs, and that there is a
metaphysical universe and also

00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:11.960 align:middle line:84%
physical universe, and
that these ancient gods had

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:16.200 align:middle line:84%
the tribesmen wear
these masks to suggest

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:19.840 align:middle line:84%
that the true face of
this parallel universe,

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:22.680 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual world,
is not visible to us.

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:26.250 align:middle line:84%
We only see a reflection
of it, but yet they

00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:31.137 align:middle line:84%
can see through the mask and can
perfectly see into our realm.

00:35:31.137 --> 00:35:33.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, this relates to things
I've said on my other show,

00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:36.250 align:middle line:84%
"Wisdom Teachings," many
times about the idea

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:38.100 align:middle line:84%
that in fact, science
does say there

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:42.410 align:middle line:84%
is a parallel reality in which
time becomes three dimensional.

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:45.610 align:middle line:84%
It's called time-space
as opposed to space-time.

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:48.970 align:middle line:84%
So I think you can see, if
you've seen my other show,

00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:51.530 align:middle line:84%
that what Scranton
is giving us really

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:54.230 align:middle line:84%
ties it all together
very beautifully.

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:56.980 align:middle line:84%
Next time, coming up
here on "Disclosure,"

00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:00.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have yet another
amazing interview with Graham

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:01.640 align:middle line:90%
Hancock.

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And this time, we get in a
lot more detail about DMT,

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:10.100 align:middle line:84%
the pineal gland,
shamanism, and how many

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:11.970 align:middle line:84%
of these ancient
cultures apparently

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:15.750 align:middle line:84%
did use shamanic
visionary states in order

00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:19.590 align:middle line:84%
to expand their consciousness
and get a greater view

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:21.440 align:middle line:90%
of the world that we live in.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:24.500 align:middle line:84%
That's coming up next
time here on "Disclosure."

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:30.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, David Wilcock,
and I thank you for watching.
