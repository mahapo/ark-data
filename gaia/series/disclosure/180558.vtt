>>DAVID WILCOCK: I'm
your host, David Wilcock,

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.290 align:middle line:10%
and I'm here with our
special guest, Pete Peterson.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.091 align:middle line:90%
Pete, welcome back.

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:26.715 align:middle line:84%
>>PETE PETERSON:
Thank you much, David.

00:00:26.715 --> 00:00:29.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So we want to focus
in on some interesting subjects

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.540 align:middle line:84%
in this episode
regarding dolphins,

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.860 align:middle line:84%
and you were involved in
some very bizarre research

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.140 align:middle line:84%
with dolphins in the
classified world.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.630 align:middle line:84%
You were telling
us that there is

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.520 align:middle line:84%
some connection between dolphins
and human life on Earth now.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.990 align:middle line:84%
So could you tell us a
little more about that first?

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.573 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well,
the humans, I think,

00:00:50.573 --> 00:00:52.110 align:middle line:84%
started out as an
aquatic animal.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.284 align:middle line:10%
>>PETERSON: And if you look
at the structure of the ears,

00:00:55.284 --> 00:00:59.640 align:middle line:10%
the structure of the
nasal passages, the eyes,

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.650 align:middle line:10%
the way that things feel, and
it appears that it becomes kind

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.120 align:middle line:10%
of obvious that we were at least
partially aquatic and probably

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.340 align:middle line:10%
if you were partially aquatic
very much earlier on you

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.140 align:middle line:10%
weren't.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Think of the fact that the
first nine months since you--

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.570 align:middle line:84%
after you had the
sperm and the egg

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:30.120 align:middle line:84%
introduced, why, you're
living in a bath of water

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.780 align:middle line:84%
and your lungs are open
to it and everything else.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And the Russians
in their research

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.820 align:middle line:84%
found out that if man
was birthed under water

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.740 align:middle line:84%
and then brought up to the
mother's breast, which was out

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.240 align:middle line:84%
of water, things
naturally occurred.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Their IQs were 20
to 40 points larger

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.210 align:middle line:90%
throughout their lifetime.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.370 align:middle line:84%
We bring him out into a
bunch of bright light,

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.140 align:middle line:84%
and it scares the
heck out of them.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And so our babies are
six to eight or nine

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.900 align:middle line:84%
months before they start to
function as a human whereas

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.710 align:middle line:84%
if you're born in a
very dimly lighted room

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.620 align:middle line:84%
underwater in a
salt water solution

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.505 align:middle line:84%
where your balance
is a certain amount--

00:02:23.505 --> 00:02:25.630 align:middle line:84%
there are a lot of things
that are not fully formed

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.690 align:middle line:84%
in your body, a lot of
things that are still there

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.280 align:middle line:90%
are stem cells.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And they form over eight or
nine or 10 months or 10 years

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.460 align:middle line:84%
or 16, 18 years,
they're still forming

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.310 align:middle line:84%
things that couldn't stand the
pressures prior to that time.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And so we immediately throw
our babies into a situation

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.240 align:middle line:84%
where they get a lot of
cells destroyed, cellular,

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.630 align:middle line:90%
they don't multiply.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And then you look
at the dolphins,

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.100 align:middle line:84%
and it's interesting
what happens

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.780 align:middle line:84%
and over a period of time
and that type of morphology.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And where are you mature, the
body gets to mature slowly,

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.980 align:middle line:84%
but the brain and the attachment
of the brain to the body

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.130 align:middle line:84%
and the attachment of
the brain to the exterior

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:26.010 align:middle line:84%
happen much faster if you
let it develop post-birth

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.010 align:middle line:84%
for a period of
three to five months.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.350 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't
do it right, you're

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.020 align:middle line:84%
going to take five or six
years before you really get

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.660 align:middle line:90%
to where you'd be a year later.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And there's a city in Russia
where the people are all

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.156 align:middle line:84%
born that way, and they
tend to have an adult IQ--

00:03:46.156 --> 00:03:47.530 align:middle line:84%
there other things
that are done,

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.250 align:middle line:84%
but they tend to have
an adult IQ somewhere

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.970 align:middle line:84%
between high genius
and super high genius.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: How does this
concept of us being possibly

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.870 align:middle line:84%
aquatic in nature
from before, how

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.470 align:middle line:84%
does that tie-in with
dolphins in the ocean today?

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.270 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, if you've
ever observed from a distance,

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.890 align:middle line:84%
you hear a lot of
things about people

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.329 align:middle line:84%
that go swimming especially,
the dolphins in the larger

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:22.450 align:middle line:84%
islands in Hawaii, have a really
tight symbiotic relationship

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.520 align:middle line:90%
with humans.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.210 align:middle line:84%
They're almost always there
when humans go out in the water,

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.990 align:middle line:84%
there have been
thousands of cases

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.290 align:middle line:84%
that humans were bumped
along the surface

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.420 align:middle line:84%
and saved when
they got little too

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:40.950 align:middle line:84%
much water in a surfing pipe
and et cetera, et cetera.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And the dolphins laugh
and jump and talk to us,

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.830 align:middle line:84%
and of course, we don't
realize that's happening.

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.430 align:middle line:84%
But I have a very brilliant
psychologist friend

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.150 align:middle line:84%
who was dying, he went out
swimming they said, no, you

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.140 align:middle line:90%
need to go swimming.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.290 align:middle line:84%
You need to work
your heart and organs

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.290 align:middle line:84%
and you can't do it running,
and you need to go swimming.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And they sent him out,
and all of a sudden, here

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.840 align:middle line:84%
came dolphin after
dolphin after dolphin

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.900 align:middle line:84%
and they crowded around and
rubbed him and brushed him

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.150 align:middle line:84%
and there was communication
going on there.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he could feel
communication going on.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And he started learning things,
just independently knowing

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:31.950 align:middle line:84%
things, and the dolphins treated
him over a period of time

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.620 align:middle line:90%
in different stages.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And he just got better and
better and better and better

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.880 align:middle line:84%
than he was and
better than he was.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.980 align:middle line:90%
His neural capabilities went up.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:46.200 align:middle line:84%
He could sense different levels
of heat, different levels

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.780 align:middle line:90%
of intellectual ability.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: That's bizarre.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.390 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Very bizarre.

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:56.520 align:middle line:84%
So that required somebody
with just his particular level

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.480 align:middle line:90%
of knowledge.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Are you
saying the dolphins

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.483 align:middle line:84%
were in some kind of
communication with him?

00:06:00.483 --> 00:06:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Most of this he
learned from the dolphins.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:03.750 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And he learned it
in a whole totally different

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:08.190 align:middle line:90%
manner.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.148 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So it was like
there was a telepathy--

00:06:10.148 --> 00:06:13.650 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: There was-- they
were giving us information.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you somehow end up
getting involved with figuring

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.130 align:middle line:84%
out how to hear from
the communications from

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:24.792 align:middle line:90%
the dolphins and working with--

00:06:24.792 --> 00:06:26.250 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well,
what happened was

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.550 align:middle line:84%
that my friend, my
psychologist friend,

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:34.788 align:middle line:84%
had all of a sudden come
up with a new psychology.

00:06:34.788 --> 00:06:36.850 align:middle line:84%
That new psychology
we went in we

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:39.700 align:middle line:84%
taught to the
colonels and generals

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.360 align:middle line:84%
of the Russian military,
and they went to--

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.580 align:middle line:84%
in Russia, they're
part of the Duma.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.500 align:middle line:84%
It's like this we have
Senate and Congress

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.600 align:middle line:90%
and they have three houses--

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.580 align:middle line:84%
one is the military, one is
academia and manufacturing,

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.680 align:middle line:84%
and one is the people
that try to make

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.660 align:middle line:84%
you think that Stalin
and Lenin were right

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:06.860 align:middle line:84%
about their psycho
political philosophies

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:12.230 align:middle line:84%
the KGB and the Politburo
and people like that.

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, we went and
taught the generals

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.960 align:middle line:90%
this, all of the group.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.470 align:middle line:84%
They all stood up when he
was done with this five day

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:24.980 align:middle line:90%
school and Nobel, Nobel, Nobel.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:30.250 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to nominate
him for a Nobel Prize.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And then they went to the
whole Politburo, and they said,

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.040 align:middle line:90%
we learn some new things.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.485 align:middle line:90%
We're not going to hold the war.

00:07:37.485 --> 00:07:38.860 align:middle line:84%
We're the military,
and we're not

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.526 align:middle line:84%
going to hold war,
so find a better way.

00:07:40.526 --> 00:07:43.440 align:middle line:90%


00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the wall
started coming down.

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:49.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And glasnost
and perestroika--

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: They were
invented by the military

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.470 align:middle line:84%
and passed down,
and they tried it,

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:58.580 align:middle line:84%
and it worked
really, really well.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.010 align:middle line:90%
And it was working very well.

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now you had mentioned
to me before that eventually

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:07.270 align:middle line:84%
you discovered that some
kind of extraterrestrial

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:10.490 align:middle line:84%
was communicating to you
through these dolphins.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.230 align:middle line:90%
So could you explain that to us?

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:18.700 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, I think that
the dolphins in one of the--

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.400 align:middle line:84%
what's happened is
you go back in history

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.610 align:middle line:84%
and you find that there
were very brilliant, very

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:27.460 align:middle line:84%
powerful civilizations
and then they'd

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:33.919 align:middle line:84%
have a war in between themselves
or with others that weren't

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:37.580 align:middle line:84%
as bright as they were,
that certain people, groups

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:40.220 align:middle line:84%
of people, the
way they educated,

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.809 align:middle line:84%
the way they birthed
their children,

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:44.480 align:middle line:84%
and all the different
factors figured in.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.620 align:middle line:84%
So they had-- we'll say
they had a higher IQ,

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:52.105 align:middle line:84%
but they really had
a higher intellect.

00:08:52.105 --> 00:08:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Not the intelligence quotient
but the actual intellect,

00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:00.200 align:middle line:84%
and they had an ability
to intercommunicate

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.920 align:middle line:84%
in a whole different
manner than speaking.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:07.250 align:middle line:84%
You don't use words to
have psychic communication,

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:11.120 align:middle line:84%
you have ideas, you have
thoughts, you have information.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So how did
you become aware

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.990 align:middle line:84%
that extraterrestrials might be
involved with these dolphins?

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:16.615 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well,
because they told us.

00:09:16.615 --> 00:09:18.840 align:middle line:90%


00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And we saw that, yes, there were
extraterrestrial bodies that

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:24.300 align:middle line:90%
were popping up here and there.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:29.030 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they had a lot of the same
eye features, nose breathing

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:35.070 align:middle line:84%
features, breath features,
muscle features, movements,

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:36.760 align:middle line:90%
body movements.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So what did you learn
about the extraterrestrials

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:42.570 align:middle line:84%
that were working
through these dolphins?

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:44.820 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: They were
here using the dolphins

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.150 align:middle line:90%
to communicate with us.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:49.320 align:middle line:84%
They were here communicating
with the dolphins

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.470 align:middle line:84%
so they could
communicate with us.

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:54.600 align:middle line:84%
So they were entertrained,
and the dolphins

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.860 align:middle line:84%
were a more ancient
people and so

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.470 align:middle line:84%
they had higher
abilities than we had

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:06.630 align:middle line:90%
in these informational arenas.

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think we were
put here very innocent

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.700 align:middle line:90%
so that we would learn--

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:21.480 align:middle line:84%
we would have the ability to
bring to the overall mankind

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:27.220 align:middle line:90%
or intelligent being kind--

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:31.370 align:middle line:84%
they were operative in
different solar systems,

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:36.530 align:middle line:84%
different galaxies, different
parts of the universe.

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:39.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So are you saying that
there were extraterrestrials

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.980 align:middle line:84%
that were not living on
Earth that were using

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.454 align:middle line:90%
these dolphins like avatars?

00:10:43.454 --> 00:10:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Some that were
living here and some that

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.435 align:middle line:90%
weren't.

00:10:46.435 --> 00:10:50.924 align:middle line:84%
Some that were living way
the hell across the galaxies.

00:10:50.924 --> 00:10:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Different types
of extraterrestrials?

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.460 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, I'm sure
they were different types.

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:56.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they were
doing different things,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:57.700 align:middle line:90%
new different things.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.440 align:middle line:90%
They were very, very advanced.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.590 align:middle line:90%
They had to go down--

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:04.450 align:middle line:84%
it's like them having
to learn to talk

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:09.190 align:middle line:90%
to a worm to talk to us.

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:11.900 align:middle line:90%
And some it was obvious.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:18.420 align:middle line:84%
It was a whole different type of
knowledge that these people had

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.610 align:middle line:90%
and that the dolphins had.

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:24.164 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't so
knowledge that we had,

00:11:24.164 --> 00:11:25.580 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't the
knowledge that--

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:28.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we were
intellectual to that point

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:31.380 align:middle line:84%
at that time that we
could have used it.

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So did the protocol
involve swimming out

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:36.170 align:middle line:84%
into the ocean, and then
this group of dolphins

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:37.220 align:middle line:90%
would surround you?

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.386 align:middle line:90%
Was that what was happening?

00:11:38.386 --> 00:11:41.210 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: That was where
the major transformations took

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:46.140 align:middle line:84%
place, and they took place
with people who had illnesses.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:48.606 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Now when
you have illnesses,

00:11:48.606 --> 00:11:52.890 align:middle line:84%
you have genetic
mutations many times.

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:55.460 align:middle line:84%
Those genetic mutations
gave us the ability

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:58.130 align:middle line:90%
to have better communications.

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:01.250 align:middle line:90%
The dolphins could pick this up.

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:02.919 align:middle line:84%
And in my feeling,
they were probably

00:12:02.919 --> 00:12:04.460 align:middle line:84%
in the hundreds of
thousands of years

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:08.610 align:middle line:84%
older than we were when they
knew much the same things,

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:12.650 align:middle line:84%
but they were tied to the ocean
or tied to freshwater, mostly

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:13.640 align:middle line:90%
to the ocean.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Would the person who
goes out there, if they're ill,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.040 align:middle line:84%
and they get
surrounded by dolphins,

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.160 align:middle line:84%
would they be aware as this is
happening that communication

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.530 align:middle line:84%
was taking place or would
they just get new ideas

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:25.810 align:middle line:90%
after they came back to shore?

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I've
studied lot of them,

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:30.300 align:middle line:84%
some people weren't
aware, many people

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:35.631 align:middle line:84%
were highly aware because we
are evolving rather rapidly.

00:12:35.631 --> 00:12:37.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Would the information
be available right away

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.950 align:middle line:84%
or would some of it
come in stages and not--

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Some of it
had to come in stages.

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:47.030 align:middle line:84%
You had to say to yourself,
this must be happening.

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:49.100 align:middle line:84%
So you'd look for
this to happen,

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:53.060 align:middle line:84%
and then you'd see, oh,
I see where it happened.

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:55.160 align:middle line:84%
Like all of a sudden
one day, you'd

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.210 align:middle line:84%
just be frustrated
about something, and all

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:03.500 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden, that seemed
like a childlike thing

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.702 align:middle line:90%
to be frustrated over.

00:13:05.702 --> 00:13:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Something that was
happening, but by now you're

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:08.960 align:middle line:90%
used to it happening.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:14.420 align:middle line:84%
You knew how to call it to come
into being like you learn how

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:16.170 align:middle line:84%
to do remote
viewing or you learn

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:18.390 align:middle line:90%
to do how remote influencing.

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:22.400 align:middle line:84%
You learn to hold your mind
in a different posture.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: There's a report from
Jacques Cousteau where they

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:29.270 align:middle line:84%
scuba dived down into the ocean
and they saw a circle of, I

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:32.692 align:middle line:84%
believe he said, eight dolphins
standing on their tails

00:13:32.692 --> 00:13:34.400 align:middle line:84%
and they were like
talking to each other,

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.417 align:middle line:90%
like moving their fins--

00:13:35.417 --> 00:13:38.000 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Like a bunch of guys
sitting in a bar around a bar

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.434 align:middle line:90%
table talking.

00:13:39.434 --> 00:13:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And then
when one of them

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:43.016 align:middle line:84%
noticed that Cousteau and
his buddies were up there,

00:13:43.016 --> 00:13:44.840 align:middle line:90%
they all fled very quickly.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.410 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
was going on there?

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:48.244 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, I've
seen that phenomenon.

00:13:48.244 --> 00:13:49.043 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:13:49.043 --> 00:13:49.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:54.124 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And I used to
do a lot of deep sea diving.

00:13:54.124 --> 00:13:55.790 align:middle line:84%
Good friends of mine
were the people who

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:57.540 align:middle line:90%
supported Cousteau for years.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:58.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh.

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:01.299 align:middle line:84%
What were some of the things
that you saw that were unusual?

00:14:01.299 --> 00:14:02.840 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well,
the same phenomenon

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:03.920 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.220 align:middle line:84%
They would be doing
something and you'd

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:11.060 align:middle line:84%
swim up through seaweed
or underwater structures

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:15.630 align:middle line:84%
and you'd see them
definitely socializing.

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:16.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:18.800 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And it was
obvious they were socializing.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.560 align:middle line:84%
It was obvious, therefore,
there was communication,

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.350 align:middle line:84%
and the communication
was always at a distance.

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:28.070 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have to be bumping
heads or touching hands

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:30.830 align:middle line:90%
or holding hands or--

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:35.300 align:middle line:84%
they could be 10 or 20 feet
apart, and all of a sudden,

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:38.870 align:middle line:90%
they'd split in every direction.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And there was no like, hey guys,
and everybody looks this way,

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:45.110 align:middle line:84%
and hey, this is
happening and they hear it

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:46.677 align:middle line:90%
and then they all fly off.

00:14:46.677 --> 00:14:48.260 align:middle line:84%
It's just like, all
of a sudden, boom,

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.840 align:middle line:90%
they're gone, just in a flash.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And if you've seen
anything underwater,

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:55.940 align:middle line:84%
you've seen a lot of this
kind of behavior go on.

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now do you think,
based on what you just said,

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:01.505 align:middle line:84%
that other types of cetaceans
besides dolphins could also--

00:15:01.505 --> 00:15:03.554 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Oh,
all the cetaceans.

00:15:03.554 --> 00:15:04.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: They could
be avatars for

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:06.684 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial intelligence?

00:15:06.684 --> 00:15:08.600 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, I don't
know whether avatars

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.600 align:middle line:84%
is the proper name
for it, but they

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:18.260 align:middle line:84%
held their own very highly
developed intelligence,

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.110 align:middle line:84%
and most had the ability
to communicate anywhere

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:24.430 align:middle line:90%
in the universe instantaneously.

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:27.440 align:middle line:84%
It's like when we did a
remote viewing, there's no--

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.710 align:middle line:84%
we can say, well, I want
to go out about maybe 2

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:32.600 align:middle line:90%
million light years.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.730 align:middle line:90%
Well, you do, you find people.

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:37.550 align:middle line:90%
They don't seem to bother you.

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:41.350 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you can recognize
they see you're there.

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And what you're doing is you're
using your eyes and your ear

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:47.870 align:middle line:84%
function, and you
can be underwater,

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:52.690 align:middle line:84%
you can be in space in a space
suit in a vacuum with air

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:56.840 align:middle line:84%
and oxygen, with certain
favorable substances,

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:59.090 align:middle line:84%
and you can find ways
of tuning and ways

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:02.510 align:middle line:84%
of enhancing that
intercommunication.

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And you don't
intercommunicate in English.

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:07.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Did you
guys ever figure out

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:11.720 align:middle line:84%
how the dolphins caused
the body to heal itself?

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.700 align:middle line:90%
Was it a sound frequency?

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.820 align:middle line:90%
Was it some psychic energy?

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Actually, you
said it inadvertently.

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:22.420 align:middle line:90%
You already knew.

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:24.280 align:middle line:90%
You call it into being.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.870 align:middle line:90%


00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:29.990 align:middle line:84%
It's like a cross between
prayer and in other words,

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:35.940 align:middle line:84%
asking for it and also making
it OK that it happened.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:41.180 align:middle line:84%
You have free agency,
so when you get up

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:44.450 align:middle line:84%
into where you realize
you have free agency,

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:46.590 align:middle line:84%
then you can start doing
all kinds of things

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:48.860 align:middle line:84%
and you can do
remote influencing.

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:53.480 align:middle line:84%
You can do biolocation,
you can do--

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:57.660 align:middle line:84%
turn off the sound where you
can focus the eyes better.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:59.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So these
dolphins somehow

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.880 align:middle line:84%
would help us to activate
our own potential?

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.369 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: They would teach us.

00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:06.980 align:middle line:84%
We would get
information, not in a way

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:09.307 align:middle line:84%
we're normally used to
getting information.

00:17:09.307 --> 00:17:11.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now one of the
weird things that you said

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:14.030 align:middle line:84%
to me, Pete, and
this goes back to,

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:16.190 align:middle line:84%
I had a book that
came out in 2010,

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:18.589 align:middle line:84%
"Source Field
Investigations," and you

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:21.020 align:middle line:84%
said that when you
read that book,

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:24.050 align:middle line:84%
you had never seen something
that came as close to what

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:25.756 align:middle line:90%
the dolphins taught you before.

00:17:25.756 --> 00:17:26.839 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yeah, exactly.

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:28.922 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So could you
explain a little about that?

00:17:28.922 --> 00:17:31.340 align:middle line:84%
What was what was in the
book that reminded you

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.020 align:middle line:90%
of what the dolphin said?

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:36.110 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: You
had a point of view

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:38.490 align:middle line:84%
is the best way I can
say because that's

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:40.500 align:middle line:90%
exactly what it was.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:44.370 align:middle line:84%
You had a new
viewpoint on things

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:47.400 align:middle line:84%
you sensed from the
universe and things

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.210 align:middle line:90%
you sent to the universe.

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:55.640 align:middle line:84%
You realized that it was
somehow like prayer, perhaps.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.520 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there aren't words.

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:02.590 align:middle line:84%
But it was a communication
that took place

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:05.170 align:middle line:90%
that you realized was two way.

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:06.640 align:middle line:84%
You realize you're
thinking about,

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:10.450 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'm thinking about this
and this is a new thought.

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:14.200 align:middle line:90%
Then you'd think, I wonder if--

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.940 align:middle line:84%
and then when you wonder
if, that's really asking,

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.647 align:middle line:90%
is it like this.

00:18:19.647 --> 00:18:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And then you'd get an answer
back-- yes, it's like that,

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:23.210 align:middle line:90%
and you go, whoa.

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:24.460 align:middle line:90%
Like where did that come from.

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:25.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.432 align:middle line:84%
And this is while you're
swimming with dolphins?

00:18:27.432 --> 00:18:28.640 align:middle line:90%
Or it could be after as well?

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: It
could be any time,

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:33.710 align:middle line:84%
but predominantly when
you got done swimming with

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:37.340 align:middle line:84%
the dolphins, you came
out and you were--

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.590 align:middle line:84%
and again, the only
words I know to use

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:43.470 align:middle line:84%
were you were more enlightened
than you'd ever been before.

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And enlightenment lasts
for a period of time.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.970 align:middle line:84%
It's like at
nighttime, you turn on

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:55.400 align:middle line:84%
and you can hear radio stations
you can't hear in the daytime.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
forget those and tune

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.700 align:middle line:84%
to another channel
in the daytime

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.741 align:middle line:84%
and then at night, you
want to go back and listen

00:19:00.741 --> 00:19:02.420 align:middle line:84%
to the other half
of that program

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:05.030 align:middle line:84%
and you don't know where to
tune for it because you didn't

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:06.500 align:middle line:90%
really look at the radio.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.000 align:middle line:84%
You were just tuning
through and you

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.892 align:middle line:84%
heard a really
interesting conversation

00:19:10.892 --> 00:19:11.850 align:middle line:90%
and you're stuck on it.

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:13.580 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's kind of like that.

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon, that's 990 AM
at 1 o'clock in the morning.

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:24.140 align:middle line:84%
So you can go back and tune to
that particular type of thing.

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:26.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, you get so you
can do the same thing

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:28.760 align:middle line:90%
with intuitive things.

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So, Pete, were there
any physiological changes

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.580 align:middle line:84%
in these dolphins
that you observed

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:40.050 align:middle line:84%
if they were in contact or
being used by extraterrestrials

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:40.850 align:middle line:90%
of some kind?

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:42.766 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I wouldn't
have any idea because I

00:19:42.766 --> 00:19:44.960 align:middle line:90%
wasn't an extraterrestrial.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.460 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you
that there were

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.440 align:middle line:84%
very different things
they did when they

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:51.230 align:middle line:90%
were in communication with us.

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:53.030 align:middle line:84%
Like we were very
joyful and they

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:56.540 align:middle line:84%
like to jump out of the
water and splash back,

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:59.000 align:middle line:84%
and they like to let
us know that they were

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.110 align:middle line:90%
getting communication, I think.

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And they had their
ways of doing that,

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:07.790 align:middle line:84%
and they were the same
amongst different groups

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:09.740 align:middle line:90%
of these animals.

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:12.110 align:middle line:84%
But it's like they all
spoke together, they all

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:17.130 align:middle line:84%
spoke the same language, or
they all had the same things.

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:19.710 align:middle line:90%


00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Depends on whether you learn
to ride a bicycle from having

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.170 align:middle line:90%
ridden a tricycle or not.

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And you have ways in a
tricycle, you protect yourself

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:29.327 align:middle line:90%
from tipping over.

00:20:29.327 --> 00:20:30.910 align:middle line:84%
When you then learn
to ride a bicycle,

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:33.840 align:middle line:90%
you use the same actions.

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And I did that study to
determine exactly the answer

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:39.300 align:middle line:90%
to the question that you asked.

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:42.900 align:middle line:84%
I was doing that
study to see where

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:44.989 align:middle line:90%
did this knowledge come from.

00:20:44.989 --> 00:20:46.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Was this
a secret government

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:47.614 align:middle line:90%
study that you were doing?

00:20:47.614 --> 00:20:49.571 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I don't know
whether it was secret.

00:20:49.571 --> 00:20:51.380 align:middle line:84%
I know we didn't talk
about it very much

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.700 align:middle line:90%
except to those people--

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:55.870 align:middle line:84%
it was done pretty
well isolated.

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But it was for an
aspect of the US government?

00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.500 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: I believe that.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:00.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:03.690 align:middle line:84%
You'd mentioned to me years
ago that there was something

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:05.850 align:middle line:84%
about these particular
dolphins where

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:09.644 align:middle line:84%
they would have extra bumps
on the side of their heads.

00:21:09.644 --> 00:21:10.560 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Different.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:10.910 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:11.560 align:middle line:90%
They had can different--

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:12.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Could you tell
us a little about that.

00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:13.650 align:middle line:90%
What was that?

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, they
had they had different--

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:18.930 align:middle line:84%
groups of them had different
talents and skills.

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:22.780 align:middle line:90%
They also had different organs.

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:24.630 align:middle line:90%
And I could see that they had--

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:27.930 align:middle line:90%
those that had certain--

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:33.690 align:middle line:84%
different shaped areas of
their outer skin or they

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:39.290 align:middle line:84%
had things that were very
soft and very soft things,

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:40.890 align:middle line:84%
many times, you'd
touch one of those

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:42.306 align:middle line:84%
and they'd have
the reaction of as

00:21:42.306 --> 00:21:44.200 align:middle line:90%
if somebody touched your eye.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.005 align:middle line:84%
You react differently if
somebody touches your eye

00:21:47.005 --> 00:21:51.510 align:middle line:84%
than if they touch your forehead
or your skin or your hand.

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:55.380 align:middle line:84%
You have different reactions
when someone touches your hand.

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And if you just look
at human nature,

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:00.450 align:middle line:84%
you like holding
your girl's hand.

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:02.340 align:middle line:84%
There's something
more happens when

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:06.270 align:middle line:84%
you're holding their hand than
if you're sitting like this.

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:09.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So are you saying that
this was abnormal physiology

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:10.050 align:middle line:90%
that--

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:11.508 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: No, it
wasn't abnormal.

00:22:11.508 --> 00:22:13.560 align:middle line:84%
It was their normal
physiology, but it

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.570 align:middle line:84%
was different from
other animals'

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:19.590 align:middle line:84%
physiology or your physiology,
but you could determine,

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:22.920 align:middle line:84%
you could tell that there
was something happening there

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:25.420 align:middle line:90%
that didn't happen otherwise.

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:26.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: All right.

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.380 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to ask
you some questions

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.510 align:middle line:84%
now about a few
different subjects

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:33.840 align:middle line:84%
just to try to get your take on
things because a lot of people

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.330 align:middle line:84%
wrote in comments about
different subjects

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:38.740 align:middle line:84%
and they want to hear
your take on this.

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:41.130 align:middle line:84%
So let's start
with the first one.

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:42.745 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of
silly, but people

00:22:42.745 --> 00:22:44.370 align:middle line:84%
want to hear what
you think about this.

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:45.745 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: No
question is silly.

00:22:45.745 --> 00:22:47.412 align:middle line:90%
You always learn something.

00:22:47.412 --> 00:22:49.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: There's a lot of
speculation on the internet

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:53.850 align:middle line:84%
right now that the
Earth is actually flat.

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:54.960 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:59.727 align:middle line:84%
And so from your experience, is
the Earth flat or is it round?

00:22:59.727 --> 00:23:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I think
the way I'll start

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:05.160 align:middle line:84%
if off is by saying that no
one who ever took a physics

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:09.130 align:middle line:84%
class would ever be
part of such a movement

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:11.380 align:middle line:84%
because they would know
it's ludicrously stupid.

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:14.630 align:middle line:90%


00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:18.100 align:middle line:84%
Were it flat, if you took
the mass of the Earth

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:21.120 align:middle line:84%
and made it flat,
you would find out

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:24.360 align:middle line:84%
that it would very
soon be 500 or 600

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:26.779 align:middle line:84%
or 6,000 separate
little satellites

00:23:26.779 --> 00:23:28.695 align:middle line:84%
all flying different
directions through space.

00:23:28.695 --> 00:23:31.500 align:middle line:90%


00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:34.460 align:middle line:84%
You need to have a
central focus, which

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:38.990 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have perfect
central focus with a sphere

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:43.050 align:middle line:84%
and it will hold together, and
otherwise it will fly apart.

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Just based on the
inertia, the centrifugal force.

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:48.800 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Inertia and
centripetal and centrifugal

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:49.650 align:middle line:90%
force.

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:50.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.490 align:middle line:10%
So so, Pete, another
thing that we're

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:55.830 align:middle line:10%
hearing so many people talking
about in our own comment

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:58.940 align:middle line:10%
section here on Gaia and
on the internet in general

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:01.910 align:middle line:10%
is a lot of
speculation about CERN,

00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:04.880 align:middle line:10%
the idea that smashing
particles together

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.650 align:middle line:10%
might be that the
Cabal is trying

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:10.490 align:middle line:10%
to create some portal that
negative entities could come

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:13.222 align:middle line:10%
through or that they're
trying to mess with the fabric

00:24:13.222 --> 00:24:14.430 align:middle line:10%
of time, something like this.

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:17.090 align:middle line:10%
So what are your
thoughts on CERN?

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:20.169 align:middle line:84%
Are there any weird things
they're trying to do with CERN?

00:24:20.169 --> 00:24:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well,
I think the biggest

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:27.110 align:middle line:84%
thing is it's the stupidest
damn thing I've ever heard of.

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:30.110 align:middle line:84%
What we're doing is we're
sitting there continuously

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:35.520 align:middle line:84%
lighting a pyramid
sized chunk of gunpowder

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:38.235 align:middle line:84%
and expecting it not to
go off and blow us away.

00:24:38.235 --> 00:24:40.760 align:middle line:90%


00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.540 align:middle line:84%
There are many things
that could happen

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:48.200 align:middle line:84%
that we know of for a fact
that CERN could trigger.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And a good part of our galaxy,
if not the whole galaxy,

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:54.150 align:middle line:90%
would wink out of existence.

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:59.000 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And
I think it's best

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.610 align:middle line:84%
not to go see if
you can reach out

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:03.770 align:middle line:84%
and poke the nose
of a rattlesnake

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:07.310 align:middle line:84%
and get your finger
back before you get bit.

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:11.832 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that I
think is a smart thing to do.

00:25:11.832 --> 00:25:13.290 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
there are things

00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:16.800 align:middle line:84%
that we know we can do with
it that won't cause reactions

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:20.685 align:middle line:84%
like that and we can study those
things and discern what we can

00:25:20.685 --> 00:25:25.260 align:middle line:84%
from it, which was originally
it was supposed to prove or not

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:33.150 align:middle line:84%
prove a certain particle,
and it proved that.

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:34.270 align:middle line:90%
And we had that proof.

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:36.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was a lot of
money to spend to do that,

00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:38.920 align:middle line:90%
but that told us so much more.

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.580 align:middle line:84%
It's like quadrupled
our knowledge

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:47.840 align:middle line:84%
or multiplied by 1,000 times our
knowledge in space time matter

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.410 align:middle line:90%
physics.

00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:53.395 align:middle line:84%
So it was a good thing to
do, but to play with it,

00:25:53.395 --> 00:25:55.770 align:middle line:84%
to let a bunch of little boys
that don't have a hint what

00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:59.940 align:middle line:84%
they're doing play with
it when we know for a fact

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:01.970 align:middle line:84%
that things happen
in outer space

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:04.860 align:middle line:84%
that we have no explanation
for and then we're

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:08.380 align:middle line:84%
trying to recreate those
in a small place on Earth.

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:09.180 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:14.100 align:middle line:84%
So another question we have here
regards this idea of portals,

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:17.280 align:middle line:84%
and this would be, I guess,
an Einstein-Rosen Bridge,

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.460 align:middle line:90%
a traversable wormhole.

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:21.510 align:middle line:90%


00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:26.070 align:middle line:84%
Based on your insider
knowledge, are there traversable

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:29.670 align:middle line:84%
wormholes in the universe, and
are there ways to access them?

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:31.320 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I believe
that there are.

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.810 align:middle line:84%
I believe there are
ways to access them.

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:35.890 align:middle line:84%
I think they are
few and far between.

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:38.730 align:middle line:84%
I think they're
very misunderstood,

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:40.320 align:middle line:84%
and I would suggest
you don't play

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:44.300 align:middle line:84%
with one unless you want to
be somewhere where you're not.

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:47.220 align:middle line:84%
God knows you might be
in the middle of a sun,

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:49.260 align:middle line:84%
or you might be out
in the middle of space

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:53.370 align:middle line:84%
where you can't even
see another sun.

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:54.970 align:middle line:90%
It's just not something to do.

00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:55.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:59.040 align:middle line:84%
Another question that we
have here from the audience

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:02.730 align:middle line:84%
is regarding artificial
intelligence.

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
are now looking

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:06.360 align:middle line:84%
at artificial
intelligence that if it

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.670 align:middle line:84%
did occur that it
could potentially

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:12.180 align:middle line:84%
be very threatening to us,
that it might see itself

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:16.590 align:middle line:84%
as superior to humans, it might
try to destroy life on Earth.

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:19.220 align:middle line:84%
What are your thoughts on
artificial intelligence?

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:21.345 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: It's a definite
up and coming field.

00:27:21.345 --> 00:27:23.970 align:middle line:90%


00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:27.620 align:middle line:84%
I only agree about 50%
with Raymond Kurzweil

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:35.850 align:middle line:84%
where he thinks that artificial
intelligence will destroy what

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:37.830 align:middle line:90%
we call intelligence today.

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:41.210 align:middle line:84%
I like to think that most
of artificial intelligence--

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:42.840 align:middle line:90%
and this is a joke--

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:47.370 align:middle line:84%
most of artificial intelligence
occurs in famous colleges

00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:49.330 align:middle line:90%
and universities.

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:52.470 align:middle line:84%
But I think that what they teach
as artificial intelligence,

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:54.300 align:middle line:84%
there is real
intelligence there,

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:58.330 align:middle line:84%
but it's not found in
colleges predominantly.

00:27:58.330 --> 00:28:04.710 align:middle line:84%
But artificial intelligence
is indeed that.

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:07.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's going to
be hard at all to supersede

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:13.260 align:middle line:84%
man's intelligence
there, but that's

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:19.640 align:middle line:84%
assuming that man doesn't take
some classes in what are taught

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:24.230 align:middle line:84%
in remote viewing and remote
influencing and biolocation

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:27.200 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Man has yet a lot to learn and
may become far more intelligent

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:32.780 align:middle line:90%
than any--

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:36.310 align:middle line:84%
what we would call
artificial intelligence.

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:43.040 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, for years,
I've known of soldiers--

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:46.040 align:middle line:84%
electromechanical soldiers
that could outfight humans

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.690 align:middle line:90%
without any question.

00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:51.680 align:middle line:84%
At first off, they could fly
by knifing people so fast--

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.100 align:middle line:84%
they'd be going so fast,
you couldn't even see them.

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:55.370 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And they
could outrun bullets

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:04.490 align:middle line:84%
or dodge bullets, so they'd
be very hard to put them down.

00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:06.240 align:middle line:84%
Some of them would be
very hard to sense.

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.240 align:middle line:84%
Some of them could come
through the air, some

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:10.800 align:middle line:90%
through the water.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
these things now.

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:18.340 align:middle line:84%
They're getting better
and better and better.

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:22.080 align:middle line:90%
They may show that man can--

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.570 align:middle line:84%
mankind can do
something intelligent,

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:27.831 align:middle line:84%
like they can eliminate
most of war as we know it.

00:29:27.831 --> 00:29:29.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: All right,
well, thank you, Pete.

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:32.730 align:middle line:84%
This has been incredibly
fascinating, as always.

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:36.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, David Wilcock,
here with our special guest

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:37.350 align:middle line:90%
Pete Peterson.
