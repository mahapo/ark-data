>>DAVID WILCOCK:
I'm David Wilcock,

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.900 align:middle line:90%
and welcome to "Disclosure."

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.230 align:middle line:10%
This is my third interview
with Graham Hancock

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.220 align:middle line:10%
all about pyramids.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.230 align:middle line:10%
We're going to go pyramid
crazy on this episode

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.960 align:middle line:10%
and for good reason.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.130 align:middle line:84%
If you think that
pyramids have only

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.760 align:middle line:84%
appeared in Egypt
and in South America,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.030 align:middle line:84%
then you're
absolutely incorrect.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.300 align:middle line:10%
Believe it or not,
pyramids have been we found

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.040 align:middle line:10%
all over the world.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.200 align:middle line:10%
Pyramids have been
found, for example,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.410 align:middle line:10%
in India, except that
they're called temples.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.370 align:middle line:84%
There are temples in India that
are very much pyramid-like.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.710 align:middle line:84%
There's also over
100 pyramids that

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.540 align:middle line:84%
have been found in the
Xian province of China.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And they come up
at shallow angles

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.420 align:middle line:84%
and then have flat tops looking
very similar to the ones

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.750 align:middle line:90%
in Mesoamerica.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.200 align:middle line:84%
We also have the mound
builders in North America.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And many of these
mounds actually

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.370 align:middle line:84%
originally were covered
with white plaster,

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.857 align:middle line:84%
and they also looked
like pyramids.

00:01:17.857 --> 00:01:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And if you remember what I
was talking about with Andrew

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.010 align:middle line:84%
Collins, those mounds
were excavated,

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.180 align:middle line:84%
and over and over
again giant skeletons

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.090 align:middle line:90%
were found inside of them.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.850 align:middle line:84%
All the evidence of the mound
builders in North America

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.000 align:middle line:90%
has been completely swept away.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Most of the mounds
were destroyed.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.670 align:middle line:84%
The skeletons that
were found in them

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.400 align:middle line:84%
were confiscated by the
Smithsonian Institution.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And then they acted like
nothing ever happened.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.547 align:middle line:84%
But then we go
over to Indonesia,

00:01:43.547 --> 00:01:44.963 align:middle line:84%
and there's a
pyramid you're going

00:01:44.963 --> 00:01:49.010 align:middle line:84%
to hear about in Indonesia
called Sukuh that looks exactly

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.360 align:middle line:84%
like the pyramid of Kukulkan
in the middle of South America.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.680 align:middle line:90%
What the heck is going on here?

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.440 align:middle line:84%
Pyramids are appearing
all over the world.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.110 align:middle line:84%
There's even pyramids that
have been found in Australia,

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.602 align:middle line:90%
like the Gympie pyramid.

00:02:02.602 --> 00:02:04.310 align:middle line:84%
There's actually a
pyramid that was found

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.320 align:middle line:90%
in Indonesia called Lalakon.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.870 align:middle line:84%
They've been found
all over the planet.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.220 align:middle line:84%
There's an island in
the middle of Indonesia

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.210 align:middle line:84%
in which they have
found over 1,776

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.800 align:middle line:84%
individual cone-shaped mounds
that are basically pyramids,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.850 align:middle line:84%
it's just that they're
round at the bottom.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.900 align:middle line:84%
So this is something
that's ongoing.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.740 align:middle line:84%
I am going to have some pyramid
episodes coming up on my show

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.660 align:middle line:84%
"Wisdom Teachings" probably
later in this coming year,

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.620 align:middle line:84%
2015, but this is just
tapping the beginning

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.570 align:middle line:90%
of what there is to explore.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.580 align:middle line:84%
Graham Hancock is
also going to talk

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.410 align:middle line:84%
about the idea of shamanism
through psychedelic drug

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.740 align:middle line:84%
ingestion, something that
some people are really into.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.240 align:middle line:84%
It is a very
dangerous thing to do.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.830 align:middle line:90%
I do not recommend it.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.220 align:middle line:84%
But Graham does describe that
many indigenous cultures see

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.850 align:middle line:84%
half animal, half human
beings called therianthrops

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.880 align:middle line:84%
and that these beings apparently
are responsible for giving us

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.660 align:middle line:90%
a great deal of knowledge.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.170 align:middle line:84%
So there's a whole lot of
interesting information

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.570 align:middle line:84%
in this section of
my groundbreaking

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.340 align:middle line:90%
interview with Graham Hancock.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And I invite you to
enjoy it with me.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.740 align:middle line:90%
Let's check it out.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:20.710 align:middle line:84%
So when we see the step
pyramids in Mesoamerica,

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.210 align:middle line:84%
there is, of
course, as you know,

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.960 align:middle line:84%
the Pyramid of the
Sun in Teotihuacan

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.850 align:middle line:84%
has almost exactly the
same base perimeter

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.257 align:middle line:90%
as the Great Pyramid of Giza.

00:03:28.257 --> 00:03:29.590 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM HANCOCK: It does, yeah.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And it has the same
pi relationship

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.730 align:middle line:84%
between its height
and its perimeter,

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.640 align:middle line:84%
except it's two pi
instead of one pi,

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.780 align:middle line:90%
if I remember correctly.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.301 align:middle line:10%
There's a geometrical connection
between the Pyramid of the Sun

00:03:47.301 --> 00:03:48.550 align:middle line:10%
and the Great Pyramid of Giza.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.476 align:middle line:10%
I went into it at some depth
in "Fingerprints of the Gods."

00:03:53.476 --> 00:03:55.533 align:middle line:90%
But it's not only there.

00:03:55.533 --> 00:03:57.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: How do
conventional archaeologists

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.364 align:middle line:84%
explain pyramids on both
sides of the Atlantic Ocean?

00:04:00.364 --> 00:04:01.530 align:middle line:90%
What are they trying to say?

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Well, this is, again,
a very interesting question.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.990 align:middle line:84%
Until the last 10
years or so, the answer

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.870 align:middle line:84%
of conventional archaeologists
to the appearance of pyramids

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.990 align:middle line:84%
and, indeed, step pyramids
all over the world

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.527 align:middle line:84%
was that this is a
complete coincidence,

00:04:19.527 --> 00:04:21.610 align:middle line:84%
that there's no causal
connection between the two.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.080 align:middle line:90%
And their argument was this.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.000 align:middle line:10%
They said, look, OK, you've
got the step pyramid of Djoser

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.190 align:middle line:10%
in Saqqara in lower Egypt.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.140 align:middle line:10%
And you have the
Pyramid of the Sun

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.920 align:middle line:10%
in Mexico, which is
also a step pyramid.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.550 align:middle line:84%
But the Pyramid of the
Sun is much younger

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.120 align:middle line:84%
than the pyramid of Djoser by
a factor of thousands of years.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.940 align:middle line:84%
The pyramid of Djoser is
2500-- 2700, actually, BC.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And the Pyramid of the Sun
is 300 BC at the oldest,

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.652 align:middle line:84%
possibly as late
as 300 or 400 AD.

00:04:54.652 --> 00:04:56.610 align:middle line:84%
So how could there be a
connection when they're

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.130 align:middle line:90%
separated so far in time?

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And the general
argument was that there

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.520 align:middle line:84%
are no old-world
pyramids that are

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.370 align:middle line:90%
as old as the pyramids of Giza.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.400 align:middle line:90%
They're all much, much younger.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it
must be a coincidence

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.783 align:middle line:84%
that the pyramid shape has been
replicated all over the world.

00:05:10.783 --> 00:05:15.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, what's utterly destroyed
that argument is the excavation

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.862 align:middle line:84%
and discovery of the site
known as Caral in the Supe

00:05:18.862 --> 00:05:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Valley about 60 miles
north of Lima in Peru.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And I've just been
at Caral recently.

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And this is a gigantic
pyramid complex.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.450 align:middle line:90%
And they are step pyramids.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And they've been excavated
by mainstream archaeologists.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately
for the argument

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.900 align:middle line:84%
of mainstream archaeology that
there can be no connection

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.460 align:middle line:84%
because of these chronological
differences, the pyramids

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.110 align:middle line:84%
of Caral and of Bandurria
a little further south

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.670 align:middle line:84%
do date precisely
to 2500 to 3000

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:51.310 align:middle line:84%
BC, exactly the same period
as the pyramids seemingly pop

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.295 align:middle line:84%
up out of nowhere
in Ancient Egypt.

00:05:54.295 --> 00:05:56.670 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly the argument that
there can't be a connection

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.680 align:middle line:84%
because there's a huge
chronological difference

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.555 align:middle line:84%
between pyramids in the
old world and the new

00:06:00.555 --> 00:06:02.470 align:middle line:90%
is destroyed completely.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.576 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And they did
stratigraphy and dated with

00:06:05.576 --> 00:06:06.200 align:middle line:90%
carbon dating--

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.485 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Absolutely.

00:06:06.485 --> 00:06:07.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: --the dirt
around these pyramids?

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah, very, very
thorough, massive excavation.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.110 align:middle line:84%
And there's just
no doubt about it.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.430 align:middle line:84%
These pyramids date
2500 to 3000 BC.

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And appear to have been
built on a site that

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.130 align:middle line:84%
was older before that, that
there was something there

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:21.630 align:middle line:90%
before that.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.380 align:middle line:90%
They're still getting into that.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's, again, the same
story that you get at Giza.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:35.450 align:middle line:84%
I was recently in Indonesia
about four hours' drive

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.110 align:middle line:84%
from the famous
pyramid of Borobudur.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.807 align:middle line:84%
And Borobudur is
a kind of pyramid.

00:06:40.807 --> 00:06:41.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, it's amazing.

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:43.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: It's an
amazing pyramid, which

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.250 align:middle line:90%
I spent several days exploring.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And it looks
like a step pyramid.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.786 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: It looks
like a step pyramid.

00:06:47.786 --> 00:06:50.240 align:middle line:84%
But about four hours' drive
from there, up in the hills,

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.515 align:middle line:84%
there's another pyramid, place
called Sukuh-- S-U-K-U-H.

00:06:54.515 --> 00:06:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And that, when my wife
Santha and I arrived there--

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.790 align:middle line:84%
my wife Santha is
a photographer--

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:05.020 align:middle line:84%
when we arrived there, we felt
that we had been transported

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.240 align:middle line:84%
by some magical machine
to Central America.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.290 align:middle line:84%
We felt that we were
looking at a Mayan pyramid.

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:14.080 align:middle line:84%
It looked just almost exactly
like the Pyramid of Kukulkan

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.420 align:middle line:84%
at Chichen Itza or the
Pyramid of the Inscriptions

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.830 align:middle line:84%
at Palenque, or the
pyramids of Tikal.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.550 align:middle line:90%
This pyramid confronts us.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:24.460 align:middle line:90%
It's a step pyramid.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.040 align:middle line:84%
And there's this eerie mist
floating around it as well.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.120 align:middle line:84%
It looked exactly like
Tikal in the dawn.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.830 align:middle line:90%
It was just an incredible thing.

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And there it is sitting
there in the mountains.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And fairly firmly dated to
about the last 1,000 years,

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:42.110 align:middle line:84%
pretty much the same sort of
age as the pyramid of Kukulkan,

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:44.290 align:middle line:90%
actually, in Chichen Itza.

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:48.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I think
we have to consider

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:52.990 align:middle line:84%
is the possibility that
a remote common influence

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:55.290 align:middle line:84%
has left its imprint
around all the world,

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:59.311 align:middle line:84%
that this pyramid idea is
not popping up accidentally.

00:07:59.311 --> 00:08:01.060 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we've
established that there

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.210 align:middle line:84%
are pyramids every bit as old as
the Egyptian pyramids in South

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:05.220 align:middle line:90%
America.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.979 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, we must
consider that, yes,

00:08:06.979 --> 00:08:08.770 align:middle line:84%
there are pyramids that
were built later as

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:11.420 align:middle line:84%
well in many different
parts of the world,

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:14.340 align:middle line:84%
but it's not a coincidence
that they're being built.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.620 align:middle line:84%
What we're looking at
here is the manifestation

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:22.980 align:middle line:84%
of a very ancient worldwide idea
of how monuments should be made

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.970 align:middle line:84%
and what they should be
dedicated to, because

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.480 align:middle line:84%
in almost all cases--
actually all cases as far

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.100 align:middle line:84%
as I know-- these
monuments are dedicated

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.049 align:middle line:84%
to the quest for
immortality of the soul.

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:35.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Doesn't it
seem, too, like there

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.249 align:middle line:84%
couldn't be a more difficult
architectural project

00:08:38.249 --> 00:08:40.080 align:middle line:90%
to take on?

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Why would you go to such
incredible difficulty?

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:48.840 align:middle line:84%
How do you even organize the
people to move these blocks?

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.569 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: You have to have a
very strong motive to do it.

00:08:51.569 --> 00:08:53.610 align:middle line:10%
Actually, Borobudur is
quite an interesting case,

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:56.020 align:middle line:10%
because this was built
in the historical period.

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:59.160 align:middle line:10%
We do have records of the
construction of Borobudur.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And Borobudur, which
is, by the way,

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:04.100 align:middle line:84%
very large, but,
really, very small

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.080 align:middle line:84%
by comparison with the
Great Pyramid of Giza,

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.910 align:middle line:84%
Borobudur took the best
part of 90 years to build.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:11.419 align:middle line:90%
90 years.

00:09:11.419 --> 00:09:11.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: And how then can
Egyptologists say and continue

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.720 align:middle line:84%
to insist that the
Great Pyramid was built

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:25.150 align:middle line:84%
during the reign of Khufu
in just 20 or 23 years, when

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:29.010 align:middle line:84%
at a later time in a very
advanced culture in Indonesia,

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.640 align:middle line:84%
the monumental
project of Borobudur,

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.350 align:middle line:84%
which is smaller than
the Great Pyramid

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:38.670 align:middle line:84%
by several orders of magnitude,
that the pyramid of Borobudur,

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.550 align:middle line:90%
it takes 90 years to build.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.890 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, it doesn't make
sense that the Great Pyramid

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:44.840 align:middle line:90%
was built in just 20-23 years.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And that writes off its
connection-- direct connection

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.479 align:middle line:90%
to the Pharaoh Khufu.

00:09:49.479 --> 00:09:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, let's talk
about the casing stones

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.980 align:middle line:84%
that Colonel Howard
Vyse eventually

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.130 align:middle line:84%
discovered at the base
of the Great Pyramid.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:58.460 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't know
the pyramid was originally

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:02.490 align:middle line:84%
faced with white limestone
that was mirror polished.

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.122 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Indeed.

00:10:04.122 --> 00:10:05.580 align:middle line:84%
When we look at
the pyramids today,

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:09.260 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at the core
of the former pyramids.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:13.690 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, parts of the
casing stones have survived.

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:17.155 align:middle line:84%
They've survived near the
top of the pyramid attributed

00:10:17.155 --> 00:10:20.510 align:middle line:84%
to Khafre, the second
pyramid at Giza.

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:24.420 align:middle line:84%
You can see that
highly-polished sheer limestone

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.690 align:middle line:84%
facing up near the summit
of the second pyramid.

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And you can see it, but
in this case in granite,

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.250 align:middle line:84%
around the base of
the third pyramid,

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:35.020 align:middle line:84%
the pyramid attributed
to Menkaure.

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.850 align:middle line:84%
In the case of the
Pyramid of Giza,

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:38.230 align:middle line:84%
the pyramid
attributed to Khufu--

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:40.563 align:middle line:84%
and I'm saying attributed to
because, actually, we don't

00:10:40.563 --> 00:10:43.080 align:middle line:90%
know who made these pyramids.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.400 align:middle line:84%
When Egyptologists blithely
say the Pyramid of Khufu,

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.250 align:middle line:84%
the Pyramid of Khafre,
the Pyramid of Menkaure,

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:52.310 align:middle line:84%
there really is no
authority to say that.

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:54.284 align:middle line:90%
It's like a fairytale.

00:10:54.284 --> 00:10:55.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, as you
know, Colonel Vyse

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:57.600 align:middle line:90%
was running out of money.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.067 align:middle line:84%
And on the last day he
finds these quarry marks

00:11:01.067 --> 00:11:03.150 align:middle line:84%
that had the same errors
in them as Wallis Budge's

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:03.899 align:middle line:90%
book for the time.

00:11:03.899 --> 00:11:06.170 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah, this is
a very interesting thing.

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:09.570 align:middle line:84%
I've spent quite a lot of
time in the relieving chambers

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:12.920 align:middle line:84%
above the King's Chamber
in the Great Pyramid.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And there are some factors which
militate against the forgery

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:18.460 align:middle line:90%
argument.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And we need to keep that in
mind when we're discussing this.

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:26.270 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you shine a
bright light into the gaps,

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:28.860 align:middle line:84%
and in some cases, the gaps
between the blocks up there

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.120 align:middle line:84%
in the relieving chambers
are about that wide,

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.041 align:middle line:84%
you know, about an inch
wide in some cases.

00:11:34.041 --> 00:11:35.540 align:middle line:84%
You can shine a
bright light and you

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:40.610 align:middle line:84%
can see that there are glyphs
appearing way back in that gap.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.050 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh really?

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:44.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: There are glyphs
of some kind appearing

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.470 align:middle line:90%
way back in that gap.

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:48.810 align:middle line:84%
There's no way that
Howard Vyse made those.

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:52.850 align:middle line:84%
However, the Khufu
cartouche, which

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:55.480 align:middle line:84%
is the single piece
of evidence that

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.250 align:middle line:84%
connects the Great
Pyramid to Khufu

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.190 align:middle line:90%
is not in one of those gaps.

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:05.310 align:middle line:84%
The Khufu cartouche is out
there in the open in plain view.

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And that actually easily
could have been forged.

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:12.770 align:middle line:84%
The fact that there is
evidence of writing going back

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:16.300 align:middle line:84%
between the blocks, which
could not have been forged,

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.825 align:middle line:84%
doesn't rule out the possibility
that the Khufu cartouche

00:12:18.825 --> 00:12:19.700 align:middle line:90%
could've been forged.

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And there is, indeed, compelling
evidence that Howard Vyse did

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:28.390 align:middle line:84%
forge that cartouche and that
he had strong motives to do so,

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:29.980 align:middle line:84%
given that he was
running out of money

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.816 align:middle line:84%
and was in need of
a major discovery.

00:12:31.816 --> 00:12:33.565 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And they
didn't find any statues?

00:12:33.565 --> 00:12:34.892 align:middle line:90%
They didn't find any treasure?

00:12:34.892 --> 00:12:36.100 align:middle line:90%
They didn't find any writing?

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:36.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: No, no, no.

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:37.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: They just go
inside the Great Pyramid,

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:39.860 align:middle line:84%
it's just a bunch of
halls and chambers?

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:43.210 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: The Great Pyramid
still guards its secrets.

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:46.455 align:middle line:84%
I believe we will
find other chambers

00:12:46.455 --> 00:12:50.520 align:middle line:84%
within the Great Pyramid, those
little so-called airshafts,

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.140 align:middle line:84%
which are not airshafts,
that run north and south out

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.250 align:middle line:84%
of the so-called
Queen's Chamber--

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:57.910 align:middle line:84%
and we need to say
so-called because we

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:00.367 align:middle line:84%
don't know what these chambers
were called in antiquity--

00:13:00.367 --> 00:13:01.200 align:middle line:90%
run north and south.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.964 align:middle line:84%
They don't terminate
outside the pyramid.

00:13:02.964 --> 00:13:03.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: That's right.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: They terminate
somewhere inside the pyramid.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And just as we
know that there is

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:12.420 align:middle line:84%
a large chamber at the bottom
of the northern and southern

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:13.840 align:middle line:84%
shafts of the
Queen's Chamber-- we

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.050 align:middle line:84%
call that chamber
the Queen's Chamber--

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:17.520 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very
likely that we're

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.570 align:middle line:84%
going to find chambers at
the other end of those shafts

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:21.180 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And as, I think, many
people are aware,

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:26.960 align:middle line:84%
there has been robotic
exploration of those shafts.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:31.716 align:middle line:84%
Those robots have, first of all,
found doors with metal handles.

00:13:31.716 --> 00:13:33.340 align:middle line:10%
When they've drilled
through the doors,

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.620 align:middle line:10%
they find a gap and then
another door behind it.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:36.980 align:middle line:10%
It's a challenge.

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:39.442 align:middle line:10%
It's a technical
challenge to find out

00:13:39.442 --> 00:13:40.400 align:middle line:10%
what's in those shafts.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.010 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like somebody's
playing games with us.

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:46.280 align:middle line:84%
But it's a kind of
invitation to look further,

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.030 align:middle line:90%
if you've got what it takes.

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
have what it takes.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:54.022 align:middle line:84%
You can't be the Caliph
Mamun in the ninth century;

00:13:54.022 --> 00:13:55.730 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to
explore those shafts.

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:57.604 align:middle line:84%
There's no way you're
going to get into them.

00:13:57.604 --> 00:14:00.396 align:middle line:84%
You have to have a pretty high
level of technical advancement

00:14:00.396 --> 00:14:01.770 align:middle line:84%
in order to explore
those shafts.

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:03.360 align:middle line:90%
Well, we've got that level now.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.679 align:middle line:84%
And it'll be interesting
to see what comes.

00:14:05.679 --> 00:14:07.220 align:middle line:84%
I think other chambers
will be found.

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:10.750 align:middle line:84%
Will those chambers turn out to
be the burial place of Khufu?

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.950 align:middle line:90%
Personally, I don't think so.

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:17.110 align:middle line:84%
I think they're going to rewrite
history, but I could be wrong.

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:17.960 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going on
my gut feeling,

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:21.089 align:middle line:84%
but I think we're going
to find something.

00:14:21.089 --> 00:14:24.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't buy that cartouche
in the relieving chambers.

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But isn't that almost
the sole datum point that they

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:28.080 align:middle line:90%
use to--

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: That is the
sole datum point connecting

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.060 align:middle line:90%
the pyramid to Khufu.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Another datum point
is his name has

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.670 align:middle line:84%
been found on one of
the wooden boats buried

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.289 align:middle line:84%
on the south side of
the Great Pyramid.

00:14:39.289 --> 00:14:41.205 align:middle line:84%
But that isn't in the
pyramid, that's outside.

00:14:41.205 --> 00:14:43.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: That could have been a
post-hoc construction project--

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Of course,
of course, it could.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: --that
honored the gods.

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Of course, it could.

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:46.818 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: --that came
in the flying boats.

00:14:46.818 --> 00:14:49.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah, well, whatever,
however one construes it,

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:52.620 align:middle line:84%
one cannot take the name of
Khufu found outside the pyramid

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.007 align:middle line:84%
as evidence that Khufu
built the pyramid.

00:14:55.007 --> 00:14:55.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Absolutely.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:59.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: This matter is
seriously under dispute.

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:01.140 align:middle line:84%
It'll be very
exciting, ultimately,

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:05.210 align:middle line:84%
to see if we're told the
truth, because I have

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:08.590 align:middle line:84%
a problem in believing anything
that mainstream archaeology

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:10.694 align:middle line:84%
tells us about the Giza
Plateau these days.

00:15:10.694 --> 00:15:12.110 align:middle line:84%
But if we're told
the truth, it'll

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:14.110 align:middle line:84%
be interesting to see what's
at the end of those shafts.

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:15.484 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now,
let's also remember

00:15:15.484 --> 00:15:19.820 align:middle line:84%
that the Great Pyramid is built
on actually a mount of bedrock.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: About 30 feet high.

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:23.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And the whole
descending chamber

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:27.120 align:middle line:84%
and that passage, the whole room
at the bottom, that's all been

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.137 align:middle line:90%
dug into solid stone.

00:15:28.137 --> 00:15:28.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yes, yes.

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.845 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is something
that casual visitors

00:15:30.845 --> 00:15:33.580 align:middle line:84%
to the Great Pyramid
don't often realize

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:39.050 align:middle line:84%
is that the Great Pyramid was
built around a natural mound,

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:39.870 align:middle line:90%
or hill.

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:42.550 align:middle line:84%
It may even be the
original primeval mount

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:45.240 align:middle line:84%
that is spoken of in the
Ancient Egyptian texts.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And cut down into that mound
is the descending corridor

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:55.640 align:middle line:84%
that goes all the way down
to the subterranean chamber.

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And the subterranean
chamber is cut

00:15:57.250 --> 00:16:01.110 align:middle line:84%
out a bedrock, as indeed is
most of the descending corridor.

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:03.080 align:middle line:84%
The subterranean chamber
is cut out of bedrock

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.940 align:middle line:84%
and it lies 100 feet
vertically beneath the base

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:09.080 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid and
exactly beneath the apex

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.260 align:middle line:90%
of the Great Pyramid.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.977 align:middle line:84%
That is itself an extraordinary
feat of geometry--

00:16:12.977 --> 00:16:13.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Absolutely.

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: --in order
to achieve that.

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:19.090 align:middle line:84%
So what we are to envisage
is a natural mound,

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:23.450 align:middle line:84%
which, I believe, was
sacred for thousands

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:27.230 align:middle line:84%
and thousands of years going
way back into the past.

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:30.950 align:middle line:84%
At some point, a
channel is cut down

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:34.730 align:middle line:84%
into that mound, a
perfectly straight corridor

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:36.757 align:middle line:84%
about 3 feet 5 inches
high and 3 feet

00:16:36.757 --> 00:16:38.840 align:middle line:84%
5 inches wide, which means
you have to kind of ape

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.590 align:middle line:84%
walk down it or almost
crawl, actually.

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:43.140 align:middle line:90%
You can't stand up in there.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I've been
there; I know.

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Many times
I've been there.

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's an eerie
feeling to go down there.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:48.890 align:middle line:84%
You come down to
the bottom and you

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:50.680 align:middle line:84%
get into a horizontal
section where

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.024 align:middle line:90%
the ceiling is even lower.

00:16:52.024 --> 00:16:53.690 align:middle line:84%
You crawl through the
horizontal section

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:55.620 align:middle line:84%
and you find yourself in
the subterranean chamber,

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:56.828 align:middle line:90%
which is cut out the bedrock.

00:16:56.828 --> 00:16:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And on the opposite
side of it is

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:01.260 align:middle line:84%
another corridor, which
I've also been into,

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:05.494 align:middle line:84%
which comes to a dead end
after about 50 or 60 feet.

00:17:05.494 --> 00:17:07.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: The ceiling is
flat, but the floor is wavy.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:08.869 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: The
floor is all wavy.

00:17:08.869 --> 00:17:08.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: It's very strange.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.461 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: It's a
very strange place.

00:17:10.461 --> 00:17:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And this, I would
say, without a doubt,

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:16.215 align:middle line:84%
is the beginning of the
Great Pyramid project.

00:17:16.215 --> 00:17:22.859 align:middle line:84%
This is the sacred place that
is deeply and remotely ancient.

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And around it is then
built the Great Pyramid.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And when exactly that
was done is not clear.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.720 align:middle line:84%
I personally am not
one of those who

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.810 align:middle line:84%
would divorce the Ancient
Egyptians entirely

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:35.060 align:middle line:90%
from the project.

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:38.140 align:middle line:84%
I think the Ancient Egyptians
were involved in the completion

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.800 align:middle line:84%
and finishing off
of that project,

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.950 align:middle line:84%
and their handiwork
is everywhere to see.

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's foolish to
deny that they were involved.

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.790 align:middle line:84%
But they themselves
said that they

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:50.150 align:middle line:84%
had received their
knowledge from the gods,

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:52.240 align:middle line:84%
that they were the
descendants of the gods,

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:56.290 align:middle line:84%
that the followers of Horus
were the teachers of wisdom

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:57.660 align:middle line:90%
to Ancient Egyptians.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.590 align:middle line:84%
So the Ancient Egyptians didn't
see themselves as separate.

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:02.940 align:middle line:84%
They saw themselves as
part of that continuity.

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:06.940 align:middle line:84%
I think the site itself-- and
I've been making this point

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.350 align:middle line:84%
since I published
"Fingerprints of the Gods"--

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:13.430 align:middle line:84%
the site itself we have to date
back 12 and a half thousand

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:18.030 align:middle line:84%
years ago or so,
possibly further.

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:22.580 align:middle line:84%
But it's a site on which there
are periods of inactivity,

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.050 align:middle line:90%
and then activity resumes.

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:25.690 align:middle line:84%
There's some kind
of continuity that's

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:26.950 align:middle line:90%
being maintained on that site.

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
Ancient Egyptian notion

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:33.310 align:middle line:84%
of a secretive brotherhood
called the Followers of Horus

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:36.200 align:middle line:84%
is particularly intriguing
in that respect.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.270 align:middle line:84%
I envisage something like a
monastery being established

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:42.000 align:middle line:84%
on that site 12 and a
half thousand years ago

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.650 align:middle line:84%
being responsible for the
creation of the sphinx,

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:47.950 align:middle line:84%
of the giant megalithic temples
that stand beside the sphinx,

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:51.040 align:middle line:84%
of the so-called mortuary
temples that stand

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:53.844 align:middle line:90%
beside the Great Pyramids.

00:18:53.844 --> 00:18:55.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that those
were mortuary temples

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.840 align:middle line:90%
for particular pharaohs.

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:58.798 align:middle line:84%
I think they had some
other function altogether

00:18:58.798 --> 00:19:02.250 align:middle line:84%
and that they all belong
to this prehistoric period,

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:06.000 align:middle line:84%
that the platforms, the base
platforms of the pyramids

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.490 align:middle line:90%
were created at that time.

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:10.470 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe the
pyramids were finished off

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:12.470 align:middle line:84%
when the Followers
of Horus switched

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:16.340 align:middle line:84%
on Egyptian civilization,
historical Egyptian

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:18.542 align:middle line:84%
civilization,
roundabout 3000 BC.

00:19:18.542 --> 00:19:20.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Let's talk
about these Followers

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:21.780 align:middle line:90%
of Horus a little bit.

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:26.310 align:middle line:84%
Manetho's pharaonic dynasty
lists, the king lists,

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:29.390 align:middle line:84%
conventional archaeologists
start at a certain point

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:31.350 align:middle line:84%
and they find all
this evidence that

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:33.850 align:middle line:84%
validates that Manetho's
king list was correct.

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:34.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: I know, I know.

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But then
they arbitrarily say,

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:37.830 align:middle line:84%
as soon as their
belief system can't

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:41.514 align:middle line:84%
stretch past, all the other
stuff before that he made up.

00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:43.430 align:middle line:84%
So could you tells us
that story a little bit?

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: I remain
stunned by the hypocrisy

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.850 align:middle line:84%
of the archaeological
establishment in that respect,

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:53.480 align:middle line:84%
because the entire chronology of
historical Ancient Egypt as we

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:57.295 align:middle line:84%
have it is based on
those king lists.

00:19:57.295 --> 00:19:58.920 align:middle line:84%
They occur in quite
a number of places.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.200 align:middle line:10%
One of the best of
them is in the temple

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.580 align:middle line:10%
of Seti I in Abydos
in upper Egypt,

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:10.270 align:middle line:10%
where we see the pharaoh Seti I
showing his young son, Ramesses

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:16.600 align:middle line:10%
II, a list of all the pharaohs
who've ruled before their time.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:20.440 align:middle line:84%
They're in the New Kingdom,
these guys, 1300-1400 BC,

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.940 align:middle line:90%
thereabouts.

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And Seti is showing his son this
is the lineage from which you

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:27.490 align:middle line:90%
descend.

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:30.420 align:middle line:84%
Here are the pharaohs
who ruled before us.

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And there are the cartouches
cut into the wall,

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:39.280 align:middle line:84%
extending away from you for
the best part of 200 feet down

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.670 align:middle line:90%
that wall.

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And that list of pharaohs,
along with others like it,

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:48.850 align:middle line:84%
is used by Egyptologists
to compile their chronology

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:52.110 align:middle line:84%
of Ancient Egypt, which for
them begins in roundabout 3000

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:54.610 align:middle line:90%
BC with the first dynasty.

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:58.580 align:middle line:84%
What they neglect to tell us,
and inconveniently for them,

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:04.180 align:middle line:84%
is that the list doesn't stop
at 3000 BC; it goes back.

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:05.880 align:middle line:90%
It goes back beyond that.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.600 align:middle line:84%
It goes back tens of
thousands of years

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:12.120 align:middle line:84%
beyond that 30 plus thousand
years back into the past

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.950 align:middle line:90%
that list continues.

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And to me it's extraordinary
that Egyptologists say,

00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:18.800 align:middle line:84%
well, this list is perfectly
accurate for the period

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.340 align:middle line:84%
that we recognize as the
historical development

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:22.210 align:middle line:90%
of civilization.

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:25.740 align:middle line:84%
But anything before that,
the Egyptians made it up.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:28.890 align:middle line:90%
It was like a fantasy novel.

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:29.590 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:32.400 align:middle line:84%
I think the Ancient
Egyptians knew much more

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.740 align:middle line:84%
about their history than any
modern Egyptologists does.

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think we need to take
those kings lists extremely

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:42.770 align:middle line:84%
seriously, that there is
a lineage stretching back

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:44.342 align:middle line:90%
deep into prehistoric times.

00:21:44.342 --> 00:21:46.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And those people
get more interesting,

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:47.575 align:middle line:90%
the Neteru, if you go back.

00:21:47.575 --> 00:21:48.450 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yes, yeah.

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:49.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Let's talk
a little about that.

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:51.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: The gods, well--

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: They become different.

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.730 align:middle line:84%
They're not like what the
pharaohs looked like later,

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:54.230 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Well, I wouldn't
comment so much on how they

00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:59.995 align:middle line:84%
looked, but how they
were, their powers--

00:21:59.995 --> 00:22:01.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Their description.

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.170 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: --their abilities,
what they could do.

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:11.510 align:middle line:84%
How Isis could control and
move objects with her voice,

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:17.440 align:middle line:84%
how she could freeze a man in
his tracks with a single word.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.510 align:middle line:90%


00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:24.000 align:middle line:84%
This is what is
wonderful about the gods,

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.030 align:middle line:84%
that these were
human-like in form.

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:32.380 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them are depicted,
of course, with animal heads.

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:35.590 align:middle line:84%
This is what are referred
to as therianthrops,

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:37.840 align:middle line:84%
from the Greek "therion,"
which means "wild beast"

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.540 align:middle line:84%
and "anthropos,"
which means "man."

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:41.414 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
all of the Egyptian gods

00:22:41.414 --> 00:22:45.250 align:middle line:84%
are depicted as animal-headed--
the god Thoth depicted

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:48.790 align:middle line:84%
with a head of an
ibis, also sometimes

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:55.700 align:middle line:84%
as an ape; the Anubis,
with the head of a jackal.

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:59.974 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting that
all of that is done there.

00:22:59.974 --> 00:23:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think we have to
consider the possibility

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:09.500 align:middle line:84%
that in the lineage
of Ancient Egypt,

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:13.640 align:middle line:84%
there was an embracing of
shamanistic altered states

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.680 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:20.280 align:middle line:84%
The Ancient Egyptian priesthood
was, generally speaking,

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.280 align:middle line:84%
one says that priests
are not shamans,

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:25.510 align:middle line:84%
but the priests of
Ancient Egypt descended

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:27.560 align:middle line:90%
from a shamanistic lineage.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:30.070 align:middle line:84%
There's no doubt that
they used the blue water

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:32.660 align:middle line:84%
lily as a means of
entering altered states

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:33.830 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:36.450 align:middle line:84%
The Ancient Egyptian
tree of life

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:39.720 align:middle line:84%
has recently been identified by
the ethnopharmacologist Dennis

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:42.380 align:middle line:90%
McKenna as Acacia nilotica.

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And Acacia nilotica
is a DMT-bearing tree.

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:48.890 align:middle line:84%
So when we see those pictures
of the Ancient Egyptians passing

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:53.747 align:middle line:84%
a pipe to one another, we now
know what they were smoking.

00:23:53.747 --> 00:23:55.830 align:middle line:84%
I believe they were entering
deeply-altered states

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:56.538 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:23:56.538 --> 00:23:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Their exploration of the
mystery of life after death,

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.630 align:middle line:84%
of what happens to us
beyond the veil of death

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:05.720 align:middle line:84%
was not an idle pursuit
indulging in fantasy.

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.032 align:middle line:84%
This was an exploration
in altered states

00:24:08.032 --> 00:24:08.740 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's well known that in
altered states of consciousness

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:14.430 align:middle line:84%
you can see the same results on
the walls of the painted caves

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:18.610 align:middle line:84%
all around the world, that in
altered states of consciousness

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:23.090 align:middle line:84%
we see visions and
images of therianthrops,

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:26.250 align:middle line:84%
of beings that are part
animal and part human in form.

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And I prefer that
explanation to the appearance

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:33.000 align:middle line:84%
of the Egyptian
gods, that they are

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.930 align:middle line:84%
encountered in vision, which
does not mean they're not real.

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And entering a
visionary state may

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:41.980 align:middle line:84%
allow us to receive other levels
of reality that are normally

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:44.120 align:middle line:90%
closed off to our senses.

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:47.340 align:middle line:84%
But I prefer that than to
a simple anatomical notion

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:49.960 align:middle line:84%
that they were some
kind of hybrid beings.

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.390 align:middle line:84%
That's my own
personal preference.

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:53.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't claim necessarily
that I'm right,

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.450 align:middle line:84%
but that's where I come
from when I look at this.

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:57.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, you wrote
a book that's basically

00:24:57.450 --> 00:24:58.830 align:middle line:90%
a box called "Supernatural."

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:01.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah, I've
written some boxes, yes.

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:05.410 align:middle line:10%
I did. "Supernatural"
is a large book.

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:09.100 align:middle line:10%
In the US hardback edition,
they published the entire book.

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:10.600 align:middle line:10%
But in the paperback,
they felt they

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:14.970 align:middle line:10%
should take mercy on readers and
do a slightly abridged version.

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:17.470 align:middle line:84%
So about eight
chapters on cave art

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:19.540 align:middle line:90%
were cut out of the paperback.

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And I boiled them
down into one chapter.

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:25.670 align:middle line:84%
But if people want to
read the whole story,

00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:27.660 align:middle line:84%
it's in the hardback,
which is still available.

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:30.250 align:middle line:84%
But if they want a quicker
read, the paperback

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:32.990 align:middle line:84%
boils down the essential
information on cave art

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:35.379 align:middle line:90%
into a single chapter.

00:25:35.379 --> 00:25:37.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It doubles as
an excellent weapon.

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:38.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: It doubles as an
excellent weapon or a door

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:39.700 align:middle line:90%
stop.

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:42.950 align:middle line:84%
You can keep your door
open with "Supernatural."

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And what I was looking
at was the phenomenon

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:50.550 align:middle line:84%
of visionary art,
which is undoubtedly

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:52.320 align:middle line:84%
what the art of the
painted caves is

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.990 align:middle line:84%
and which is coupled
with a radical leap

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:57.520 align:middle line:84%
forward in the evolution
of human behavior.

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And the subtitle
of "Supernatural"

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.940 align:middle line:84%
was "Meetings With the
Ancient Teachers of Mankind."

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And the idea that I'm
exploring in that book

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:08.540 align:middle line:84%
is could we be
encountering intelligences,

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:11.890 align:middle line:84%
other intelligences,
in visionary states?

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:13.860 align:middle line:84%
In a normal, alert,
problem-solving state

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:16.560 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, we may
never encounter them.

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.530 align:middle line:84%
But in a trance
state, which is what

00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:21.350 align:middle line:84%
shamans are the
masters of creating,

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:23.940 align:middle line:84%
that we might
encounter teachers,

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:27.700 align:middle line:84%
teaching entities, who have
an interest in the human race

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.200 align:middle line:84%
and who have an interest
in bringing us on,

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:34.560 align:middle line:84%
or manipulating our
evolution in certain ways.

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you're
basically theorising

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:39.100 align:middle line:84%
that there's a commonality
in cave paintings

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:41.140 align:middle line:84%
and shamanic visions
throughout the world that

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:44.520 align:middle line:84%
can't be explained by any
type of conventional migration

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:45.020 align:middle line:90%
patterns?

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:45.645 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yes.

00:26:45.645 --> 00:26:47.210 align:middle line:84%
What I'm suggesting,
first of all,

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:51.540 align:middle line:84%
it involves looking at the
whole mystery of consciousness,

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:54.430 align:middle line:84%
which any honest
scientist will admit

00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:57.980 align:middle line:84%
is one of the great unsolved
mysteries of science.

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:00.680 align:middle line:84%
We know we're
conscious, but we don't

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:02.270 align:middle line:90%
know what consciousness is.

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:05.840 align:middle line:84%
Or the conventional view
of mainstream materialist

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.340 align:middle line:84%
scientists-- and a
lot of scientists

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:09.020 align:middle line:84%
are materialists,
in other words,

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:11.920 align:middle line:84%
they seek to reduce
everything to matter--

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:14.910 align:middle line:84%
that the human being is not
more than the sum of his or her

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:17.910 align:middle line:84%
parts, that we are
just these bodies,

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:22.480 align:middle line:84%
and that somehow in
the story of evolution,

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:26.410 align:middle line:84%
we grew these big brains, which
helped us to survive-- survival

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:27.210 align:middle line:90%
of the fittest.

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And an accidental byproduct
of these big brains

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:32.210 align:middle line:84%
is the thing that we
call consciousness.

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:34.140 align:middle line:90%
I don't agree with that view.

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:36.320 align:middle line:84%
I think consciousness
comes first,

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.640 align:middle line:84%
and the material
body comes second.

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.980 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the ancient
traditions were right

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:43.880 align:middle line:84%
when they saw us as
spirits, if you wish,

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.920 align:middle line:90%
incarnated in material form.

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps for a
particular reason.

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:53.370 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps we are here to learn
lessons, to grow, to develop,

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:55.430 align:middle line:84%
so that, ultimately,
we can ascend

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:58.940 align:middle line:90%
to another level of existence.

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And what I explored
in "Supernatural"

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:05.800 align:middle line:84%
was the absolute mystery, that
the same entities and beings

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:09.430 align:middle line:84%
are depicted in rock and cave
art all around the world.

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And those same
entities and beings

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:17.560 align:middle line:84%
appear in the Ancient
Egyptian works of art as well.

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:22.529 align:middle line:84%
So we cannot separate Ancient
Egypt from this system of ideas

00:28:22.529 --> 00:28:24.070 align:middle line:84%
that altered states
of consciousness.

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
sometimes get myself

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:29.260 align:middle line:90%
into trouble with the UFO lobby.

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:31.990 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that
there are UFOs.

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:33.740 align:middle line:90%
I don't deny it for a moment.

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And I have no
doubt that there is

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:40.110 align:middle line:84%
something real behind the
phenomenon that we call aliens.

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And furthermore, that it has
powerful physical aspects.

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:49.200 align:middle line:84%
But I do not believe that
we will solve those problems

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:53.040 align:middle line:84%
if we confine
ourselves exclusively

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.200 align:middle line:90%
to physical investigations.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:58.380 align:middle line:84%
We have to investigate the
mystery of human consciousness

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:01.140 align:middle line:84%
and the fact that, in altered
states of consciousness,

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:04.450 align:middle line:84%
encounters with these
entities are registered

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:09.070 align:middle line:84%
and are enormously influential
and effective upon those

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:10.449 align:middle line:90%
who have those encounters.

00:29:10.449 --> 00:29:12.240 align:middle line:84%
If we're going to solve
this mystery, which

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:14.580 align:middle line:84%
is a very ancient
mystery, we need

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:18.180 align:middle line:84%
to look at the mystery of
human consciousness as well.

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:21.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that there isn't
a physical aspect to the UFO

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:23.300 align:middle line:90%
phenomenon, because there is.

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:26.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying there isn't
the physical aspect to what we

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:28.800 align:middle line:84%
call alien abductions,
because there is.

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.630 align:middle line:84%
But if we confine
ourselves to that

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:33.660 align:middle line:84%
and don't consider the
consciousness implications,

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:38.660 align:middle line:84%
the fact that you can induce
these experiences by putting

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:42.400 align:middle line:84%
a volunteer into a deeply
altered state of consciousness,

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.290 align:middle line:84%
if we don't take that
into account as well,

00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:46.373 align:middle line:84%
we'll never fully understand
what's going on here.

00:29:46.373 --> 00:29:48.710 align:middle line:84%
I would think if I
were asked to put money

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:50.600 align:middle line:84%
on this, some kind
of bet, I would

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:53.850 align:middle line:84%
say that the UFO/alien
phenomenon has as much

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:56.580 align:middle line:84%
to do with
interdimensional contact

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:59.880 align:middle line:84%
as it has to do with
interstellar contact.

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:01.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: So you heard the man.

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:04.880 align:middle line:10%
UFO contact may
have as much to do

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:08.220 align:middle line:10%
with interdimensional
contact as it does

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:10.850 align:middle line:10%
with interplanetary contact.

00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:13.340 align:middle line:10%
So if you're wondering where
you can score some blue water

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:16.440 align:middle line:10%
lily or acacia,
again, please, we're

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.900 align:middle line:10%
not telling you to
take psychedelic drugs.

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:20.760 align:middle line:90%
They are dangerous.

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:25.290 align:middle line:84%
If you don't do it correctly or
even if you do do it correctly,

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:27.280 align:middle line:84%
there is always a
risk of developing

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:30.420 align:middle line:84%
severe mental
illness and problems,

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:33.880 align:middle line:84%
including schizophrenia,
which can be irreversible.

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:36.120 align:middle line:84%
So when people use
these drugs, they

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.720 align:middle line:84%
are taking risks
with their lives,

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:40.490 align:middle line:84%
and we do not
recommend doing it.

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want to talk to you about
all of the implications of what

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:49.960 align:middle line:84%
Hancock has to say, because what
we're ultimately seeing here

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:54.350 align:middle line:84%
is that Atlantis was not just
some civilization in the middle

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:58.350 align:middle line:84%
of the Atlantic ocean, it
was a worldwide civilization.

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:01.710 align:middle line:84%
That's the implications of what
Graham Hancock is telling us.

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:05.170 align:middle line:84%
These people could toss around
100-ton blocks of stone,

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:08.230 align:middle line:84%
just like they're
juggling Lincoln Logs.

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:09.880 align:middle line:90%
It was no big deal for them.

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:12.970 align:middle line:84%
They did these pyramids
all over the place.

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
is so fascinating.

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.330 align:middle line:84%
Coming up next time, we're
going to be interviewing

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:22.740 align:middle line:84%
one of the truly new
groundbreaking pioneers

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:24.860 align:middle line:84%
in this field of
ancient civilizations

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:28.950 align:middle line:84%
research for the purposes of
our disclosure investigation.

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:31.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
Laird Scranton.

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:33.600 align:middle line:84%
If you haven't heard
of them before,

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.530 align:middle line:84%
you probably will be hearing a
lot more of him in the future,

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:40.500 align:middle line:84%
because he has put together an
incredible trail of breadcrumbs

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:44.260 align:middle line:84%
suggesting that a single
primordial civilization was

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:47.570 align:middle line:84%
responsible for Ancient
Egypt, for what happened

00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:50.960 align:middle line:84%
with Buddhism, for what
happened with the Tibetans,

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:54.970 align:middle line:84%
and that a remnant of
their society migrated

00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:59.900 align:middle line:84%
off and survived in secret
in a little tribe in Mali

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:01.460 align:middle line:90%
called the Dogon.

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And among other
things, they preserved

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:09.880 align:middle line:84%
records of their origins
coming from the star Sirius.

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:12.760 align:middle line:84%
That's coming up next
time here on "Disclosure."

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'm your host,
David Wilcock.

00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:16.400 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for watching.
