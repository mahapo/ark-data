00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID WILCOCK:
Welcome to Disclosure.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host,
David Wilcock, and I

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.690 align:middle line:84%
am deeply and profoundly
grateful to have

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.100 align:middle line:84%
had the opportunity to interview
one of the greatest scientists,

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.860 align:middle line:90%
in my view, in modern history.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
Rupert Sheldrake.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.610 align:middle line:84%
It was a tremendous honor
for me to get the chance

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.000 align:middle line:84%
to geek out with Rupert
Sheldrake on the same camera,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.090 align:middle line:84%
because this guy
almost more than anyone

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.440 align:middle line:84%
else in modern times, has
really created a unified field

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.830 align:middle line:84%
theory of consciousness,
showing how

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.550 align:middle line:84%
all of these things that
conventional science refuses

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.670 align:middle line:84%
to accept are true,
are nonetheless

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.530 align:middle line:90%
scientifically provable.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.860 align:middle line:84%
Rupert Sheldrake is showing
how all of these things that

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.280 align:middle line:84%
have been discredited
by mainstream science

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.370 align:middle line:84%
are nonetheless,
scientifically provable.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that
is very exciting.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.490 align:middle line:84%
I've been aware of Rupert
Sheldrake's work for years.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.710 align:middle line:84%
I honestly never expected
that I'd get the chance

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.260 align:middle line:90%
to talk to him like this.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And I can also say
that when I first

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.670 align:middle line:84%
came up to him at this
conference where we found him,

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.281 align:middle line:90%
he didn't know who I was.

00:01:27.281 --> 00:01:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't know
whether he wanted to do

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.630 align:middle line:90%
an interview with me or not.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.120 align:middle line:84%
But when I started
to talk to him,

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.550 align:middle line:84%
and he realized how much
I knew about his work,

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.800 align:middle line:90%
he was totally blown away.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.100 align:middle line:84%
So what I discussed
with him was I

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.590 align:middle line:84%
wanted to do a
series of episodes

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.860 align:middle line:84%
where we would try to bang out
as many different scientific

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.490 align:middle line:84%
facts that are totally
amazing as possible.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.650 align:middle line:84%
So buckle in your seat
belt, because this

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.669 align:middle line:90%
is going to be a wild ride.

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:55.460 align:middle line:84%
There's a little bit
at the beginning where

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.230 align:middle line:84%
he talks about his field theory,
this morphogenetic or morphic

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.160 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.596 align:middle line:84%
And he says that it's
a habit in nature.

00:02:03.596 --> 00:02:04.970 align:middle line:84%
You might be a
little overwhelmed

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.428 align:middle line:84%
by the geek speak
at the beginning.

00:02:06.428 --> 00:02:07.490 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.210 align:middle line:84%
The theory is implicitly
within the data itself.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.400 align:middle line:84%
So by presenting
the data, you will

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.890 align:middle line:90%
understand what the theory is.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.170 align:middle line:84%
So this is very
exciting stuff for me.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.150 align:middle line:90%
You'll see how jazzed I am.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And I keep throwing
all this stuff at him.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And he just bounces back
with incredible answers.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.840 align:middle line:90%
So let's check it out.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.840 align:middle line:84%
Rupert Sheldrake, it's a
pleasure to have you here.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.220 align:middle line:84%
I feel that you are one of the
greatest scientific pioneers

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.660 align:middle line:90%
of our time.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.910 align:middle line:10%
I became aware of
your work a long time

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.470 align:middle line:10%
ago through what you originally
called "morphogenetic fields",

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.050 align:middle line:10%
and you're now calling
"morphic fields".

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And basically, a
lot of the research

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.960 align:middle line:84%
that you've done that
I was attracted to

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.980 align:middle line:84%
suggests that we are
receiving information

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.170 align:middle line:84%
that appears in our
minds as if it's

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.030 align:middle line:84%
a conscious original
personal thought--

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.570 align:middle line:84%
a thought that we
generated ourselves.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And what we're not seeing
is how those thoughts might

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.380 align:middle line:90%
be other people's thoughts.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.530 align:middle line:84%
In our mind, what we're
using as the intellect

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.220 align:middle line:84%
is drawing on some greater
collective databank.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.960 align:middle line:90%
But it's biased as personal.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.230 align:middle line:84%
So it appears as if we're only
having a conscious thought.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.290 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually coming
from some greater whole.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.120 align:middle line:90%
So I'd like to talk about that.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'd specifically like to
talk about the scientific data

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.640 align:middle line:84%
that you've brought to the
surface that helps argue

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.530 align:middle line:84%
this idea that
we're interconnected

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.820 align:middle line:90%
on a level of consciousness.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.850 align:middle line:84%
So what was the
first book that you

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.095 align:middle line:84%
wrote that started to
put all this together?

00:03:44.095 --> 00:03:45.470 align:middle line:10%
>>RUPERT SHELDRAKE:
My first book

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.400 align:middle line:10%
came out in 1981 called
"A New Science of Life".

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.800 align:middle line:10%
The third edition has just
been published under the title

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.170 align:middle line:10%
"Morphic Resonance" in America.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.795 align:middle line:10%
In Britain, the new edition is
called "A New Science of Life"

00:03:56.795 --> 00:03:58.850 align:middle line:10%
still.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.950 align:middle line:84%
What I'm doing in
that book is arguing

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.400 align:middle line:84%
that the so-called laws of
nature are more like habits.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.390 align:middle line:10%
Instead of all the laws, the
laws of electricity, magnetism,

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.380 align:middle line:10%
gravity, all the laws that
govern chemistry and life,

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.600 align:middle line:10%
being fixed at the moment
of the big bang, which

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.620 align:middle line:10%
is the usual assumption,
instead, the universe

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.290 align:middle line:10%
is evolutionary,
and what evolves

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.850 align:middle line:10%
are the habits of nature.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.880 align:middle line:84%
In biology, what this means
is that each species has

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.740 align:middle line:90%
a kind of collective memory.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.860 align:middle line:84%
So every individual draws
upon and contributes

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.790 align:middle line:84%
to the collective
memory of the species.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And what the hypothesis of
morphic resonance says--

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.940 align:middle line:84%
because morphic resonance
is the basis of this memory

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.520 align:middle line:90%
on my hypothesis--

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.170 align:middle line:84%
is that, for
example, if you train

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.210 align:middle line:84%
rats to learn a new
trick in one place,

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.851 align:middle line:84%
then rats all around
the world should

00:04:48.851 --> 00:04:51.100 align:middle line:84%
learn it quicker just because
the rats have learned it

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.900 align:middle line:90%
in one place.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.700 align:middle line:84%
They're picking up by morphic
resonance, this habit,

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.850 align:middle line:90%
this new form of learning.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's similar to the idea
of the collective unconscious

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.220 align:middle line:84%
of Jung, the psychologist,
which suggests we all

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.610 align:middle line:84%
draw upon a collective
memory and contribute to it.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.470 align:middle line:84%
So in essence, that's what
the hypothesis is about.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.710 align:middle line:84%
I started off as a
developmental biologist.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And I was already working
on the development of form

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.220 align:middle line:84%
in plants and animals, how
animals and plants inherit

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.220 align:middle line:84%
their form, why
a palm tree looks

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.760 align:middle line:84%
like a palm tree, when a oak
tree looks like an oak tree.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Genes alone can't
account for this.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:31.790 align:middle line:90%
I can explain why.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:36.500 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm saying is that
a large part of inheritance

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.100 align:middle line:84%
is collective memory, both
of form and in animals

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.330 align:middle line:84%
of behavior, instincts, are a
kind of habit of the species.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: We have this simple
worm, Caenorhabditis elegans.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.940 align:middle line:90%
It's studied by biologists.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And the Human Genome Project
ended up mapping out our genes.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And they expected,
as I'm sure you know,

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.749 align:middle line:84%
there was going to be one
gene for every protein,

00:05:58.749 --> 00:06:01.040 align:middle line:84%
and that there'd be a certain
number of genes set aside

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.690 align:middle line:90%
for consciousness.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.350 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
that we only have--

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.030 align:middle line:84%
I think it was 10,000 genes
more than this very simple

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.161 align:middle line:90%
roundworm.

00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:12.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELDRAKE: Yes, and we've
got less genes than a rice

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.680 align:middle line:90%
plant or a sea urchin.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.940 align:middle line:84%
So the gene thing
people used to think

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:25.280 align:middle line:84%
that all inheritance was genes
a gene for each characteristic.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.000 align:middle line:84%
That simple model is
falling apart very fast

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.600 align:middle line:84%
at the moment, partly because of
the success of the Human Genome

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.650 align:middle line:90%
Project.

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's possible to sequence
the genomes of people.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.820 align:middle line:84%
They've sequenced the genomes
of tens of thousands of people,

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.210 align:middle line:84%
and then looked at the genomes
to see which genes code

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.370 align:middle line:90%
for which characteristics.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:51.200 align:middle line:84%
With height, for example,
it's easy to measure height.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's known that if you
measure parents and children

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.510 align:middle line:84%
when they're grown,
then with just a tape

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.510 align:middle line:84%
measure, the tall parents
tend to have tall children.

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Short parents tend to
have short children.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.479 align:middle line:84%
And you can predict the
height of the children

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:09.020 align:middle line:84%
if you know the
height of the parents

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.330 align:middle line:90%
with an accuracy of about 80%.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:16.010 align:middle line:84%
In other words, in the technical
term, height is 80% heritable.

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:19.010 align:middle line:84%
So they looked at the
genes of 30,000 people.

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:20.030 align:middle line:90%
They knew their height.

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:21.470 align:middle line:90%
They looked at the genes.

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:24.540 align:middle line:84%
They figured out were about
50 genes involved in height.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:25.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, wow.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELDRAKE: Then
they modeled which

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.310 align:middle line:84%
were more important,
which were less important

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.850 align:middle line:84%
and their best
mathematical models.

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:35.810 align:middle line:84%
Then they took random
people from the sample,

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.180 align:middle line:84%
looked at their genes,
worked out the height,

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.790 align:middle line:84%
and compared it with
the actual height.

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And they found they could
predict people's height

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:48.040 align:middle line:84%
on the basis of their genes
with an accuracy of 5%.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.020 align:middle line:84%
With just a tape measure
and several billion dollars

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:55.320 align:middle line:84%
less expenditure, you can do
it with an accuracy of 80%.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.130 align:middle line:84%
So the gap between
the 5% you can predict

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.080 align:middle line:84%
on the basis of
genes and the 80%

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:04.370 align:middle line:84%
that is known to be inherited is
called the missing heritability

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:05.580 align:middle line:90%
problem.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is a really big problem
in biology at the moment.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:12.780 align:middle line:84%
Everyone expected the genes
would explain everything.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:13.910 align:middle line:90%
And they don't.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.010 align:middle line:84%
Well I always expected
that they wouldn't.

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:19.220 align:middle line:84%
I have to admit it came
as no surprise to me

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.800 align:middle line:84%
when they discovered the
missing heritability problem,

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.540 align:middle line:84%
because for years,
I had been saying

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.700 align:middle line:90%
genes are grossly overrated.

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And they don't do most
things people say they do.

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:32.630 align:middle line:84%
What they do do is code for
the sequence of amino acids

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:33.799 align:middle line:90%
and proteins.

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:35.480 align:middle line:84%
But there's a huge
gap between making

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.230 align:middle line:84%
the right proteins and
the shape of a poppy leaf,

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:45.860 align:middle line:84%
or the shape of a mouse, or the
shape of a human nose or arm.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.750 align:middle line:90%
It's more than just proteins.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And so form, I think, is largely
determined by morphic resonance

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:55.460 align:middle line:84%
on the basis of this kind
of collective memory.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, the memory is
strongest from the closest

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:02.229 align:middle line:84%
relatives, from the parents
and immediate ancestors.

00:09:02.229 --> 00:09:03.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And you
mentioned originally

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:08.000 align:middle line:84%
that nature is not something
that all the laws started out

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.910 align:middle line:84%
with the big bang, that
it's an evolving habit.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:15.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So in
that sense, nature

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:18.770 align:middle line:84%
is adapting to its
challenges that it's

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:21.380 align:middle line:90%
presented with as time goes on.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And those adaptations then
become available sort of

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.400 align:middle line:84%
like on the internet, that's
available to all the members

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.050 align:middle line:90%
of that particular species.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:31.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SHELDRAKE: Exactly like that.

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:34.220 align:middle line:84%
So when these rats
learn a new trick,

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.620 align:middle line:84%
then other rats
elsewhere confronted

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.430 align:middle line:84%
with the same problem can
learn the same thing quicker.

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:42.020 align:middle line:84%
There is actually experimental
evidence that that happens.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:43.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
actually been done

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.650 align:middle line:84%
in experiments at
Harvard, and in Edinburgh,

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:47.010 align:middle line:90%
and Melbourne, Australia.

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:49.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right, like Lamarck.

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELDRAKE: Well,
except that in this case,

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.365 align:middle line:84%
Lamarck's theory is that you get
the inheritance of an acquired

00:09:54.365 --> 00:09:55.164 align:middle line:90%
character.

00:09:55.164 --> 00:09:57.210 align:middle line:84%
If the parents learn
something, the children

00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:59.020 align:middle line:84%
should be able to
learn it easier.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And that happened
in this experiment.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.380 align:middle line:84%
But what also happened
in this experiment

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:07.490 align:middle line:84%
was that rats whose parents
had not been trained also

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:09.370 align:middle line:90%
learned it quickly.

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:11.255 align:middle line:84%
So morphic resonance
doesn't involve

00:10:11.255 --> 00:10:12.650 align:middle line:90%
it having to go through genes,

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:13.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: All right.

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:14.660 align:middle line:84%
So the rats don't have to get
it from their own parents.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:15.826 align:middle line:90%
>>SHELDRAKE: No, they don't.

00:10:15.826 --> 00:10:16.730 align:middle line:90%
They can do--

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:20.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if they're
descended from rats

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:24.230 align:middle line:84%
that have been trained, then
it could be through the genes,

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:27.765 align:middle line:84%
or it could be by morphic
resonance, or it could be both.

00:10:27.765 --> 00:10:30.140 align:middle line:84%
But actually, the fact that
rats whose parents have never

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.420 align:middle line:84%
been exposed to it shows
that morphic resonance

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:33.830 align:middle line:90%
can explain this.

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:35.630 align:middle line:84%
It's a bit like
telepathy, if you like.

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:39.950 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't require an
immediate genetic contact.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And what's more, if you
train the rats in Los Angeles

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.350 align:middle line:90%
to learn something today.

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:49.190 align:middle line:84%
Then rats in London and New
York and Sydney, Australia

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.620 align:middle line:84%
should be able to
learn it straightaway.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you don't have to take
the rats from here to there.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.250 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
breed for them.

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:57.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: And this, of course--

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.080 align:middle line:84%
and I've discussed this with
you when we first spoke--

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.270 align:middle line:84%
people say, oh the
hundredth monkey effect--

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.220 align:middle line:90%
that's what he's talking about.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And what I've heard
of the story is

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.360 align:middle line:84%
that Japanese researchers
dropped sweet potatoes down

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.510 align:middle line:90%
for monkeys.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.510 align:middle line:84%
Some of the sweet potatoes
were falling in sand.

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:16.250 align:middle line:90%
The monkeys couldn't eat them.

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And once approximately
100 monkeys

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:20.780 align:middle line:84%
learned to wash
off the potatoes,

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.340 align:middle line:84%
then they could eat
them comfortably.

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:25.190 align:middle line:84%
Then all of a sudden, all the
monkeys on all of the islands

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:29.090 align:middle line:84%
and the mainland all started
to be able to do this washing.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:30.860 align:middle line:90%
So is that how you see it?

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:31.660 align:middle line:90%
Or is--

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:33.618 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELDRAKE: Well, no,
that's the usual version

00:11:33.618 --> 00:11:35.350 align:middle line:90%
of the hundred monkey story.

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:37.460 align:middle line:84%
The hundred monkey story
is saying something very

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:38.900 align:middle line:90%
similar to what I'm saying.

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.270 align:middle line:90%
It looks like morphic resonance.

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:44.160 align:middle line:84%
The only problem is it's not
scientifically very reliable.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.230 align:middle line:84%
I prefer the thousandth
rat, because that's

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.210 align:middle line:90%
a proper laboratory experiment.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.190 align:middle line:84%
But the hundredth
monkey story is actually

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:55.530 align:middle line:84%
misleading in one sense,
that I don't think

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:56.870 align:middle line:90%
it's a critical threshold.

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:58.986 align:middle line:84%
The hundredth monkey
implies that nothing happens

00:11:58.986 --> 00:12:00.110 align:middle line:90%
until the hundredth monkey.

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:02.150 align:middle line:90%
Then they all do it.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.890 align:middle line:90%
That's not how it works.

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And how that story
originated is interesting.

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:09.240 align:middle line:84%
The writer, Lyall Watson,
who is a biologist,

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.365 align:middle line:90%
and I knew him quite well--

00:12:10.365 --> 00:12:12.073 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Yeah, He's
got some great books.

00:12:12.073 --> 00:12:13.573 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELDRAKE: Some
very good books.

00:12:13.573 --> 00:12:17.630 align:middle line:84%
Lyall Watson worked with
researchers in Japan

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:19.340 align:middle line:90%
who were working on monkeys.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And they told him
they'd noticed that when

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.830 align:middle line:84%
they fed them sweet potatoes
to get them out on the beach

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:27.470 align:middle line:84%
so they could film them,
they couldn't see them

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:29.050 align:middle line:90%
if they were in the forest.

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And they fed them deliberately
to get them out on the beach.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.370 align:middle line:84%
They did this with
monkeys on one island.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And when they went
to other islands

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:38.840 align:middle line:84%
after the monkeys
on the first island

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:42.976 align:middle line:84%
had learned to wash the potatoes
to get the sand off them,

00:12:42.976 --> 00:12:44.350 align:middle line:84%
on the other
islands, the monkeys

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.500 align:middle line:90%
seemed to pick this up quicker.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.550 align:middle line:84%
That's what they
told him and that's

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:52.210 align:middle line:84%
probably a perfectly
reliable fact,

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:56.000 align:middle line:84%
although, it wasn't published
in a quantitative way.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.340 align:middle line:84%
In his book "Lifetide", Lyall
Watson says, let us imagine,

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:04.190 align:middle line:84%
for the purpose of argument,
that on a particular day,

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:07.460 align:middle line:84%
say Tuesday, an
extra monkey, say

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:10.970 align:middle line:84%
the hundredth monkey,
learned to wash the potatoes,

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:13.970 align:middle line:84%
then all over Japan
and all over the world,

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:15.800 align:middle line:84%
all the monkeys
started doing it.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.940 align:middle line:84%
He makes it clear that
he's exaggerating.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:19.190 align:middle line:90%
He's telling a story.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:22.760 align:middle line:84%
"Let us suppose for the
purposes of argument", etc.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.700 align:middle line:84%
When this was repeated,
when people heard the story

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:29.720 align:middle line:84%
in lectures and that sort
of thing or from friends,

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.300 align:middle line:84%
then the story gradually
improved in the telling,

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:36.380 align:middle line:84%
until, in some versions, it ends
up with sweet potatoes actually

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:39.320 align:middle line:84%
growing there, and monkeys
suddenly all over Japan

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.170 align:middle line:84%
digging them up, and finding
this whole new food source,

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:44.630 align:middle line:84%
and washing them when
you reach a critical mass

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:46.720 align:middle line:84%
of a hundredth
monkey until then.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And it was used in the
anti-nuclear movement

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:52.040 align:middle line:84%
as an argument-- you know,
if enough people think

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:56.180 align:middle line:84%
peaceful thoughts, suddenly the
whole world will turn peaceful.

00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:00.710 align:middle line:84%
That was where it was mostly
propagated, this story.

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:04.130 align:middle line:84%
But interestingly, you see, they
were using a nuclear metaphor

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:05.480 align:middle line:90%
in the anti-nuclear movement.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.700 align:middle line:84%
Critical mass is a
nuclear metaphor.

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:10.550 align:middle line:84%
Until you get a certain amount
of uranium, nothing happens.

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly you've
got an explosion.

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.340 align:middle line:84%
But actually, the data
from these rat experiments

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:18.500 align:middle line:84%
show something
much more gradual.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:22.277 align:middle line:84%
The more rest that learn
it, the easier it gets.

00:14:22.277 --> 00:14:24.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So give me an
example of a behavior

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:25.070 align:middle line:90%
that a rat learns.

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:27.537 align:middle line:84%
And what are you saying
is happening, like a maze,

00:14:27.537 --> 00:14:29.120 align:middle line:84%
for example-- would
it be a labyrinth?

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:29.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:31.430 align:middle line:84%
What was happening was
it was a water maze.

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:34.430 align:middle line:84%
They had to swim
through a water maze.

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:35.630 align:middle line:90%
And they had to get out.

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:36.640 align:middle line:90%
There were two exits.

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.360 align:middle line:90%
One of them was lit up.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:43.440 align:middle line:84%
The other one was more or less
in dim light or semidarkness.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of those
old-style, cruel experiments,

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:49.940 align:middle line:84%
where if they got
out the lit one,

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:51.290 align:middle line:90%
they get an electric shock.

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:54.380 align:middle line:84%
If they got out the dim
exit, they were fine.

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And they kept changing
which exit was lit up

00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:58.550 align:middle line:90%
and which one was dim.

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:01.310 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't a matter of
going to the right or left.

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:05.050 align:middle line:84%
They had to learn that it
was to do with the light.

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And in the first rats
that were tested,

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:13.020 align:middle line:84%
it took about 250 trials before
they learned how to get out,

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.350 align:middle line:84%
and to get out of the dim
exit, not the bright one.

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:17.016 align:middle line:84%
And then after they'd
learned, then they

00:15:17.016 --> 00:15:18.950 align:middle line:90%
did it right every time.

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:22.070 align:middle line:84%
The next generation
took about 200 trials.

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:24.470 align:middle line:90%
The next generation, about 150.

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.590 align:middle line:84%
It got much, much
easier quite fast,

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:34.010 align:middle line:84%
until it got down to about 25
errors before they learned it.

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:35.780 align:middle line:90%
That happened at Harvard.

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:37.790 align:middle line:84%
Then people took
up this research

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:43.310 align:middle line:84%
in Edinburgh, Scotland,
and Melbourne, Australia.

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And their rats, they
used the same breed

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:47.470 align:middle line:84%
as the Harvard rats, the
same kind of apparatus.

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:49.730 align:middle line:84%
Their rats started
more or less where

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:52.820 align:middle line:90%
the Harvard rats left off.

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:54.850 align:middle line:90%
They didn't go back 250 errors.

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:57.080 align:middle line:90%
They started off about 25 or 30.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: That's incredible.

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:00.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELDRAKE: And then
in Melbourne, they

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.450 align:middle line:84%
tested in each
generation, rats that

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:04.700 align:middle line:84%
have been descended
from trained parents,

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.650 align:middle line:84%
and rats whose parents had
never been exposed to this water

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:08.450 align:middle line:90%
maze.

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:10.250 align:middle line:90%
They found they all got better.

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And so it wasn't
to do with genes.

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.290 align:middle line:84%
You see, Lamarckian
inheritance, named

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:17.440 align:middle line:84%
after Lamarck, the
biologist who said

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.610 align:middle line:84%
that acquired characters
could be inherited,

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:24.170 align:middle line:84%
parents could pass on things
they learned or adaptations

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:27.500 align:middle line:84%
they required to their
children, that was usually

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:31.550 align:middle line:84%
assumed to be due to the
modification of genes.

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And people said, oh,
you can't modify genes.

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:35.990 align:middle line:84%
It defies all the
laws of genetics.

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:37.880 align:middle line:90%
And therefore it's impossible.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.800 align:middle line:84%
So this was intensely
controversial

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.330 align:middle line:90%
in the 20th century.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:44.420 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't have an inheritance
of acquired characteristics.

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.070 align:middle line:84%
When I started
biology at Cambridge,

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:48.560 align:middle line:84%
this was the biggest
taboo in biology.

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:49.640 align:middle line:90%
You simply could not.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.140 align:middle line:90%
It was prohibited.

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:53.390 align:middle line:90%
But in spite of the evidence--

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: If you have such a
solid data point as these rats

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.640 align:middle line:84%
learning it so
fast, how do they--

00:16:58.640 --> 00:16:59.980 align:middle line:90%
what's the debunking--

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:01.688 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELDRAKE: Well,
they didn't debunk it;

00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:02.790 align:middle line:90%
they just ignored it.

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:05.776 align:middle line:84%
And why they ignored
it-- you see,

00:17:05.776 --> 00:17:07.609 align:middle line:84%
originally, the chap
at Harvard who did this

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:09.530 align:middle line:90%
was called William McDougall.

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:11.510 align:middle line:84%
When McDougall
got these results,

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:14.160 align:middle line:84%
it looked as if there was
a Lamarckian inheritance.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And because he was at
Harvard, because he

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:20.350 align:middle line:84%
was a respected professor,
people couldn't ignore it.

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:22.339 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
tried repeating it

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:25.058 align:middle line:90%
in Edinburgh and Melbourne.

00:17:25.058 --> 00:17:26.599 align:middle line:84%
And when in Melbourne
they discovered

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:28.730 align:middle line:84%
that actually all the
rats were getting better,

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:31.710 align:middle line:84%
not just the ones descended from
the trained ones, they said,

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:32.510 align:middle line:90%
well look.

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.130 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is,
it's not Lamarckian.

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Because it all the rats
are getting better.

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:38.880 align:middle line:84%
So it can't be due
to modified genes.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.580 align:middle line:90%
So it's not Lamarckian.

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:43.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's back to
business as usual,

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:47.810 align:middle line:84%
ignoring the fact that
these series of experiments

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:50.660 align:middle line:84%
have demonstrated a very
remarkable effect that

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:54.470 align:middle line:84%
wasn't either genetic or
Lamarckian, but something else.

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:57.260 align:middle line:84%
But nobody had a theory as
to what else it could be.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:01.700 align:middle line:84%
So it was simply ignored
as a kind of anomaly.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:07.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now, eventually you
ran some very high-profile tests

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:11.860 align:middle line:84%
on television, where you have
these hidden figure puzzles.

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And tell us a little
bit about that.

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:17.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, the hidden figure
puzzle is what, first of all?

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELDRAKE: Well, what we had
is hidden figures where you

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:22.330 align:middle line:90%
have black and white blotches.

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And when you get it, you
suddenly see an image there.

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:27.725 align:middle line:84%
But before you get it,
you can't see what it is.

00:18:27.725 --> 00:18:29.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you've
got to stare at this

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:31.870 align:middle line:84%
and try to see if there's
a hidden picture in there.

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:32.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SHELDRAKE: Yes, that's right.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:34.506 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know there's
a hidden picture there.

00:18:34.506 --> 00:18:36.370 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to
see what it is.

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:38.690 align:middle line:90%
And in this experiment--

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:42.040 align:middle line:84%
the purpose of the experiment
to see whether if lots of people

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.060 align:middle line:90%
get it.

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:47.260 align:middle line:84%
If you show them the answer,
then you get it straight away.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.420 align:middle line:84%
If I show you one of
these hidden images,

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.340 align:middle line:84%
then I show you the
answer, when I show you

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:54.850 align:middle line:84%
the hidden image again, you
instantly guet it, of course.

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very quick
form of learning.

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:59.410 align:middle line:84%
If you see the same hidden
image 10 years later,

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:01.170 align:middle line:90%
you'll get it straightaway.

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:01.970 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:03.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you can
quantifiably measure

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.774 align:middle line:84%
how long it takes somebody to
solve the puzzle as they're

00:19:05.774 --> 00:19:07.691 align:middle line:84%
staring at it if they've
never seen it before.

00:19:07.691 --> 00:19:09.399 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELDRAKE: Well,
what we quantitatively

00:19:09.399 --> 00:19:10.990 align:middle line:84%
measured was how
many people get it

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:13.000 align:middle line:90%
without being shown the answer.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.420 align:middle line:84%
We deliberately made these
hard so only about 2% or 3%

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:20.140 align:middle line:84%
of people get it without
being shown the answer.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:23.230 align:middle line:90%
What we had was two puzzles.

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:26.570 align:middle line:84%
We did this experiment
with British television.

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:28.990 align:middle line:84%
And this was done before
the internet came along.

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And we knew the shows were only
shown in the United Kingdom.

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:36.250 align:middle line:90%


00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:39.370 align:middle line:84%
So we had then tested
people in Germany

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:41.770 align:middle line:90%
and in the United States.

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And we had large groups
of people tested.

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:49.800 align:middle line:84%
We tested people before
with two images--

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:53.620 align:middle line:84%
two puzzle pictures to see what
proportion of people got them.

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:56.650 align:middle line:84%
Then we tested similar
groups of different people

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:59.920 align:middle line:84%
afterwards, in
Germany in the US.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.830 align:middle line:84%
But what happened in the
meantime was in Britain.

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:05.590 align:middle line:84%
On the show, at random, and
one of these two pictures

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:09.700 align:middle line:90%
was selected on the show itself.

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:12.700 align:middle line:84%
That picture was shown
to millions of viewers.

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And then on the screen,
it melted into the answer.

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And then it melted back
into the hidden image.

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:22.480 align:middle line:84%
So millions of people
in Britain got it.

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.730 align:middle line:90%
And that's a form of learning.

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:26.170 align:middle line:84%
If they saw it again,
they'd know what it was.

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:29.620 align:middle line:84%
We then tested people after
that in Germany and the United

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:30.820 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: There was no way they
could have seen this show.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:33.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELDRAKE: There's no way
they could have seen the show.

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:35.320 align:middle line:84%
There was no internet
in those days.

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.640 align:middle line:90%
This was done in the--

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.440 align:middle line:90%
when was this?

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:42.670 align:middle line:84%
In the 1980s we did
this experiment.

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:46.840 align:middle line:84%
So the question was, would the
second lot of people we tested

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.080 align:middle line:84%
get the one that had been
shown on television easier

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.190 align:middle line:90%
than the control picture?

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:53.900 align:middle line:84%
We had a control picture
that no one had seen.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And so we knew how
well people did before.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And then after, did
this one get easier,

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:01.590 align:middle line:90%
the one that millions had seen?

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:02.650 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is it did.

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:06.170 align:middle line:90%
We did this twice in Britain.

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, one of them
was the figure of a Cossack,

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:10.117 align:middle line:90%
the guy with his mustache?

00:21:10.117 --> 00:21:11.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SHELDRAKE: That's right.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.160 align:middle line:90%
But we could show them.

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:18.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is there in my
book, "Morphic Resonance".

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:24.002 align:middle line:84%
So the results
showed that people

00:21:24.002 --> 00:21:25.210 align:middle line:90%
were getting the more easily.

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:26.830 align:middle line:90%
It was a significant effect.

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:28.930 align:middle line:84%
But for some reason, on
the second experiment,

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:31.960 align:middle line:84%
it worked better in Germany
than the United States.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:32.900 align:middle line:90%
We didn't know why.

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:37.220 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless, it was a
significant, positive result.

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:40.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So this suggests
that everyone in their waking

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:44.470 align:middle line:84%
mind, when you're having what
you think are private thoughts,

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:47.110 align:middle line:84%
there's some greater
databank, that when you yearn

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:50.080 align:middle line:84%
for an answer, you're
adapting to your environment,

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:54.490 align:middle line:84%
you're trying to learn how to
cope with your environment,

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:57.190 align:middle line:84%
you're looking for the
answer, a seemingly

00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:00.610 align:middle line:84%
personal, private thought
pops into your head,

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:03.190 align:middle line:84%
but there's some greater
databank that is coming from?

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And when other people
see the answer,

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:07.794 align:middle line:84%
and now you're trying
to find the answer,

00:22:07.794 --> 00:22:09.460 align:middle line:84%
you think it's your
own private thought,

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.470 align:middle line:84%
but it's actually coming
from something greater?

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:11.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And you were able
to scientifically prove that?

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:14.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:18.025 align:middle line:84%
It gets easier to learn,
or to do something,

00:22:18.025 --> 00:22:19.990 align:middle line:90%
or to solve a problem.

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:21.730 align:middle line:84%
There was a catch
in this experiment.

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:24.880 align:middle line:84%
Experiments are rarely
totally clear-cut.

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.100 align:middle line:84%
The Germans then wanted to do
this experiment in Germany.

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:31.740 align:middle line:84%
We tested people in
Britain when they showed us

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:35.050 align:middle line:84%
new, hidden images
on a German TV show.

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And the skeptics
predicted there'd

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:40.570 align:middle line:84%
be no effect, that there'd
be no difference in Britain

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:42.400 align:middle line:84%
as a result of
showings in Germany.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.030 align:middle line:84%
I predicted it would get
easier for people in Britain

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:47.800 align:middle line:90%
to recognize the image.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.530 align:middle line:84%
But what actually happened
is what no one had predicted.

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:53.890 align:middle line:84%
The image that people had seen
in Germany after Sunday lunch--

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:55.600 align:middle line:84%
it was a Sunday
afternoon program--

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.410 align:middle line:84%
and so there were
lots of probability

00:22:57.410 --> 00:23:01.810 align:middle line:84%
around the drowsy Germans
watching TV after a big German

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:04.130 align:middle line:90%
Sunday lunch.

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:06.730 align:middle line:84%
It actually got harder
for people in Britain

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:10.100 align:middle line:84%
to recognize this picture
after seeing it in Germany--

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.960 align:middle line:84%
significantly,
statistically significant.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.540 align:middle line:84%
So somehow, the
Germans seeing it

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.620 align:middle line:84%
made it harder for the
British to recognize it.

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know
exactly why people

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:23.520 align:middle line:90%
can speculate about this.

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.980 align:middle line:84%
It would be great to do more
experiments of this kind.

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.700 align:middle line:84%
But it was hard to organize
such large-scale experiments.

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:31.730 align:middle line:90%
So that's not been done again.

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:34.130 align:middle line:84%
But one piece of data
that is extremely

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:38.949 align:middle line:84%
interesting in this connection
is the data from IQ tests.

00:23:38.949 --> 00:23:41.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you are
familiar with the Flynn effect.

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:42.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:47.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the 1980s in my book,
"The Presence of the Past",

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:51.830 align:middle line:84%
which is my main theoretical
book about morphic resonance,

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:55.940 align:middle line:84%
I predicted that IQ tests
should be getting easier

00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:57.860 align:middle line:84%
to do because millions
of people have

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:00.540 align:middle line:84%
done more or less the same
tests over many years.

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:03.530 align:middle line:84%
They were first
introduced around 1918.

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:06.050 align:middle line:84%
And they've been administered
to millions and millions

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:07.160 align:middle line:90%
of people.

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:09.920 align:middle line:84%
So I predicted that the
average score on IQ test

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.230 align:middle line:84%
should be getting
higher and higher--

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:14.150 align:middle line:84%
not because people
are getting smarter,

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:17.240 align:middle line:84%
but because the tests
are getting easier.

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.220 align:middle line:90%
But I couldn't find the data.

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:21.650 align:middle line:84%
I asked friends in the
psychology department

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:24.510 align:middle line:84%
at Cambridge University,
how can I get the data?

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:26.330 align:middle line:90%
And they asked their friends.

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:27.290 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knew.

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:30.980 align:middle line:84%
But then a psychologist
called James Flynn came along,

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:33.020 align:middle line:84%
and, for different
reasons, not because he

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:35.030 align:middle line:84%
was interested in
morphic resonance,

00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:38.270 align:middle line:84%
started looking at IQ
test data and found

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:41.960 align:middle line:84%
that there had been spectacular
improvements, more than 30%,

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:44.840 align:middle line:84%
during the 20th century
in intelligence,

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:48.170 align:middle line:84%
in many different countries--
in the US, Japan, Germany,

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:50.130 align:middle line:90%
Britain, etc.

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:52.760 align:middle line:84%
This is now called, as you
say, the Flynn effect--

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:56.142 align:middle line:84%
this mysterious rise
in IQ test scores.

00:24:56.142 --> 00:25:01.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think that this is
because of morphic resonance.

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing is
if you look at the detail data,

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:08.540 align:middle line:84%
there hasn't been an improvement
on factual questions,

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:10.660 align:middle line:84%
like what is the
capital of Germany?

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:14.390 align:middle line:84%
Or how many states are
there in the United States.

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:17.210 align:middle line:84%
Those things you either
know or you don't know.

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Where the improvement
has occurred

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:24.920 align:middle line:84%
is in the puzzles, which you
have to solve on the spot--

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:28.340 align:middle line:84%
puzzles, the previous knowledge
doesn't help you with.

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:31.850 align:middle line:84%
You can only figure it out
if you're being intelligent.

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:33.830 align:middle line:84%
Those are the bits
that have improved

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:35.330 align:middle line:84%
under the basis of
the Flynn effect.

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:38.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Yeah, and it's
nonverbal abstract knowledge.

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:40.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELDRAKE: Yes,
it's nonverbal.

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's not so much knowledge,
it's solving a problem.

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And the fact, after
lots of people

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:49.050 align:middle line:84%
have solved those problems,
they get easier to solve.

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And this has a bearing
on a debate that

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.750 align:middle line:84%
goes on in Britain,
and the United States,

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:57.590 align:middle line:84%
and in many other countries
about dumbing-down of tests,

00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:00.690 align:middle line:84%
because we have endless
debates in Britain about this,

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:06.620 align:middle line:84%
that people's grades
in regular school exams

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:08.400 align:middle line:90%
have been going up and up.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And the government says,
that's because our education

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:13.897 align:middle line:90%
policies are working.

00:26:13.897 --> 00:26:14.980 align:middle line:90%
Kids are getting brighter.

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:17.420 align:middle line:84%
Their critics say,
it's because the exams

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:21.140 align:middle line:84%
are being dumbed-down to create
the illusion of the education

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:22.542 align:middle line:90%
policy is working better.

00:26:22.542 --> 00:26:24.500 align:middle line:84%
But it could be like the
Flynn effect, you see.

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.500 align:middle line:84%
It could be something that's a
morphic resonance phenomenon.

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, in this movie,
"Waking Life" that's all

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:32.960 align:middle line:84%
rotoscoped and everybody
looks like a cartoon,

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.750 align:middle line:84%
they refer to this "London
Evening Standard" crossword

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:39.560 align:middle line:84%
puzzle and how the
crossword puzzles get easier

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.000 align:middle line:90%
to solve the day after.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, it all
started from you just

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:47.570 align:middle line:84%
leaving a comment in your
discussion forum, right?

00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:49.790 align:middle line:84%
Tell me a little bit
about the crossword.

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:52.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELDRAKE: Well the
crossword experiment

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:54.880 align:middle line:84%
actually arose from
a student project

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.780 align:middle line:90%
at the University of Nottingham.

00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And how that arose is
that this student, a girl,

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:02.120 align:middle line:84%
wanted to do a project
on morphic resonance

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.400 align:middle line:90%
and asked me for a suggestion.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And I'd been getting letters
from people who'd read my book,

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:13.140 align:middle line:84%
"A New Science of
Life" saying, I

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:16.550 align:middle line:84%
found that when I'm doing "The
Times" crossword puzzle, which

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:20.570 align:middle line:84%
is a very difficult one, I can
solve it much more easily if I

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:22.820 align:middle line:84%
leave it till the
evening or the next day

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:26.120 align:middle line:84%
rather than doing it first
thing in the morning.

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:29.210 align:middle line:84%
So I had letter after
letter of people telling me

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:31.260 align:middle line:84%
this kind of thing
about crossword puzzles

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:33.480 align:middle line:84%
and "The Times", "The
Daily Telegraph", etc.

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.550 align:middle line:90%
These are the difficult one.

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And they said, maybe
it's morphic resonance.

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:41.940 align:middle line:84%
Maybe so many people have
solved it, it's got easier.

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:44.490 align:middle line:84%
So when this girl asked for
a suggestion, I said, well,

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:47.570 align:middle line:84%
why not try a crossword
puzzle experiment?

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:50.660 align:middle line:84%
But we got to get the crossword
puzzle before it's published.

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's got to be
from a newspaper

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:55.400 align:middle line:84%
that people can't read in
Nottingham, where she lived.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.810 align:middle line:84%
Now the "London
Evening Standard"

00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:59.150 align:middle line:84%
is not distributed
in Nottingham.

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And I managed to persuade
the "London Evening Standard"

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:06.320 align:middle line:84%
people to supply a
crossword in advance.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And she tested groups
of people before it

00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:11.330 align:middle line:84%
was published with
the test crossword

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:13.400 align:middle line:84%
and a control crossword
that had been published

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.920 align:middle line:84%
a few weeks before,
and then tested

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:18.260 align:middle line:84%
another group of similar
people afterwards

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:21.620 align:middle line:84%
with the test crossword
and the control crossword.

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And the control crossword
should have stayed the same,

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:26.629 align:middle line:84%
because no extra
people had done it,

00:28:26.629 --> 00:28:28.670 align:middle line:84%
whereas the test crossword
should have got easier

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:29.470 align:middle line:90%
to solve.

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And how we measured that
was how many clues people

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:34.220 align:middle line:90%
would solve in 10 minutes.

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:36.680 align:middle line:90%
It was an easy crossword.

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:40.890 align:middle line:84%
It gave positive
significant results.

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:43.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So people involved
in much more easily

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:44.300 align:middle line:90%
after it was published?

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:45.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:48.926 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you confirmed
that "old wives tale."

00:28:48.926 --> 00:28:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELDRAKE: Well,
or this report

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.940 align:middle line:84%
that people had found from
just their experience of doing

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:54.070 align:middle line:90%
"The Times".

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:57.080 align:middle line:84%
It was just people
reporting their experience.

00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:59.560 align:middle line:84%
But there are many possible
tests for morphic resonance.

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:04.400 align:middle line:84%
My teenage son, when he
was 16, came up with one.

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:07.610 align:middle line:84%
He came to me one
day, and he said--

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:10.070 align:middle line:84%
he was about to do the
British national exam

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:13.400 align:middle line:84%
called GCSE, General Certificate
of Secondary Education,

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:17.870 align:middle line:84%
where kids in Britain have
to do eight subjects or nine

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:18.740 align:middle line:90%
subjects.

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:20.330 align:middle line:90%
And it's a standardized exam.

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:23.870 align:middle line:84%
They all do it at the same
time to prevent cheating.

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:27.020 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you could call up
and tell people the questions.

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:30.760 align:middle line:84%
So he came to me very
excited one day and said, I

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:34.550 align:middle line:84%
and my friends have worked out
a way of getting extra marks

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:37.340 align:middle line:84%
without doing extra
work in our exams.

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:38.630 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, how's that?

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, what
we're going to do, is say,

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:44.120 align:middle line:84%
in the physics paper,
there's 15 questions,

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:47.940 align:middle line:84%
he said we're going to do
questions 14 and 15 first.

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:50.410 align:middle line:84%
Then we'll go back to
questions 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And we'll be about 10
minutes behind everyone else

00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:54.380 align:middle line:90%
in Britain for those questions.

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:56.840 align:middle line:84%
So we should get a boost
by morphic resonance.

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:58.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, that's very cool.

00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:59.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELDRAKE: It was
a really good idea.

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:00.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:01.940 align:middle line:10%
>>SHELDRAKE: So I said to him,
well, some of your friends

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:03.905 align:middle line:10%
must have been morphic
resonance skeptics,

00:30:03.905 --> 00:30:07.610 align:middle line:10%
I'm used to skeptical
responses to these ideas.

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:10.130 align:middle line:10%
He said, yes, the worst of the
morphic resonance skeptics.

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:11.880 align:middle line:10%
And I said, well,
what did they say?

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.150 align:middle line:10%
They said, what if morphic
resonance doesn't really

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:15.230 align:middle line:10%
happen?

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:17.563 align:middle line:10%
And he said, we worked out,
if it doesn't really happen,

00:30:17.563 --> 00:30:18.660 align:middle line:10%
we wouldn't lose anything.

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:21.230 align:middle line:10%
But if it does happen,
we'd get this extra boost.

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:24.200 align:middle line:84%
So they actually did
this in the exams.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And they all got
brilliant results.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:29.280 align:middle line:84%
But they may have been brilliant
to start with, of course.

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:34.520 align:middle line:84%
But this does suggest one
way of doing this experiment

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:37.010 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend who was
in charge of the science

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:38.630 align:middle line:84%
exams for the
Oxford and Cambridge

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:42.980 align:middle line:90%
examination board for schools.

00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:45.350 align:middle line:90%
And so I said to him, look.

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:48.560 align:middle line:84%
We could do a massive
morphic resonance test.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Just change the
order of questions

00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:51.830 align:middle line:90%
in a subsample of papers.

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:55.250 align:middle line:84%
So a random sample of
children in Britain

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:56.620 align:middle line:90%
do them in different order.

00:30:56.620 --> 00:31:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And the question, would they
get higher marks on average

00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:02.817 align:middle line:84%
if they did the questions
later than other people?

00:31:02.817 --> 00:31:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And I said, it
wouldn't cost anything.

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:08.060 align:middle line:84%
Just print a few papers
differently, and analyze

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:09.400 align:middle line:90%
the results and stuff.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And at first, he
was quite excited.

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:13.980 align:middle line:84%
But then he called
me a few days later.

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:14.854 align:middle line:90%
He said, look Rupert.

00:31:14.854 --> 00:31:16.220 align:middle line:90%
He said, I'm due to retire soon.

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:18.230 align:middle line:84%
He said, I want to
get a full pension.

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:21.290 align:middle line:84%
He said, if I turn our
national examination system

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:23.540 align:middle line:84%
into a morphic resonance
experiment, that's

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:24.440 align:middle line:90%
not going to happen.

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:25.240 align:middle line:90%
So sorry.

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:26.457 align:middle line:90%
I can't do it.

00:31:26.457 --> 00:31:28.790 align:middle line:84%
Because he was frightened,
because this is controversial

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:29.590 align:middle line:90%
stuff.

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I think the idea
of a science exam being turned

00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:37.310 align:middle line:84%
into a science experiment that
would be a harmless experiment,

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:40.470 align:middle line:90%
no one would be harmed by it--

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:42.320 align:middle line:84%
well, it might give
an unfair advantage

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:47.919 align:middle line:84%
to the minority sample who got
the morphic resonance boost.

00:31:47.919 --> 00:31:49.335 align:middle line:84%
I thought that it
was a good idea.

00:31:49.335 --> 00:31:50.570 align:middle line:90%
Well, anyway he didn't.

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:52.190 align:middle line:90%
And so it didn't happen.

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:54.812 align:middle line:84%
But that would be a
really good experiment.

00:31:54.812 --> 00:31:56.395 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I hope
you're starting to see

00:31:56.395 --> 00:31:58.250 align:middle line:84%
that what Rupert
Sheldrake is doing

00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:02.720 align:middle line:84%
is inviting us into an
entirely new way of looking

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:07.010 align:middle line:84%
at ourselves, and others, and
the universe that we live in.

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:10.340 align:middle line:84%
We are still addicted to
this ridiculous concept

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:14.930 align:middle line:84%
that all of the things that
make a biological life form,

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:17.990 align:middle line:84%
the way that it is, and the
consciousness that it has

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:20.360 align:middle line:84%
and the personality
characteristics that it has,

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:24.890 align:middle line:84%
are all contained within the
DNA in what we call genes.

00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And yet, that theory has
just been demolished.

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:30.860 align:middle line:84%
Furthermore, we're
seeing that there are

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:33.320 align:middle line:90%
definite telepathic effects.

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.916 align:middle line:84%
People are solving
crossword puzzles better

00:32:35.916 --> 00:32:37.290 align:middle line:84%
after others have
looked at them.

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:40.040 align:middle line:84%
You can even try to
cheat on tests that way.

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:42.950 align:middle line:84%
It's sad that there's such
institutional opposition

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:45.260 align:middle line:84%
to this, that the
college professor didn't

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:50.150 align:middle line:84%
want to turn a basic exam
into a morphic resonance test.

00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:52.430 align:middle line:84%
But that proves the
level of opposition

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:54.210 align:middle line:90%
that's still out there.

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:56.870 align:middle line:84%
So we have a lot more coming up
for you with Rupert Sheldrake.

00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:58.880 align:middle line:90%
This is just the beginning.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is
disclosure in action,

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:04.460 align:middle line:84%
because the cabal does not want
you to know about this stuff.

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:06.650 align:middle line:84%
It restores our
divine potential.

00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:09.260 align:middle line:90%
It brings the power back to us.

00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's what disclosure
for me is all about.

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:14.120 align:middle line:84%
It's about stripping
away the lies

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:17.330 align:middle line:84%
and getting back to all
of the suppressed things

00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:20.270 align:middle line:84%
that the power elite
do not want us to know.

00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:23.360 align:middle line:84%
So I hope you're enjoying
watching Disclosure, speaking

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:27.290 align:middle line:84%
truth to power, and
giving power to the truth.

00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:30.040 align:middle line:90%
