00:00:16.172 --> 00:00:17.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID WILCOCK:
I'm David Wilcock.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.290 align:middle line:90%
And welcome to "Disclosure."

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.000 align:middle line:10%
I recommend that you
have a good cappuccino,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.890 align:middle line:10%
a nice cup of coffee, or
some chocolate before you

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:25.990 align:middle line:10%
watch this episode.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.950 align:middle line:10%
Make sure you've had good sleep,
that you're not too tired,

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.040 align:middle line:10%
because this is a fast and
furious download with Laird

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.090 align:middle line:10%
Scranton, part two,
where I grill him

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.430 align:middle line:10%
and put his feet
to the fire using

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.520 align:middle line:10%
the words of his own skeptics
to try to tear him apart

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.779 align:middle line:10%
and see if he can
come back swinging.

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:46.320 align:middle line:10%
I think what you're
going to find out

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.346 align:middle line:10%
is that the results are
impressive to say the least.

00:00:50.346 --> 00:00:52.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the things that
happens in this episode

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.840 align:middle line:84%
that I want to give you a
little bit of backstory on

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.330 align:middle line:90%
is when we mention Wallis Budge.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, EB Wallis Budge wrote
the defining standard book

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.310 align:middle line:84%
on how to interpret
Egyptian hieroglyphics.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's so interesting
about Laird Scranton's work

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.860 align:middle line:84%
is how he has shown that there
are remarkable similarities

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.510 align:middle line:84%
between Egyptian words,
Hebrew words, and the words

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.440 align:middle line:84%
of the Dogon and
that we also see

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.310 align:middle line:84%
remarkable similarities
in Buddhism

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.900 align:middle line:84%
and in Tibetan
traditions as well.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.230 align:middle line:84%
When we start to have these
core groups telling us

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.710 align:middle line:84%
the same things
in the same words,

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.580 align:middle line:84%
having the same cosmological
concepts, including the idea

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.250 align:middle line:84%
that the universe
forms in pairs,

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.120 align:middle line:84%
all these very
specific things, it

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.220 align:middle line:84%
becomes an extremely
compelling notion.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the things that the
haters most consistently try

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.430 align:middle line:84%
to use to tear
apart Laird Scranton

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.860 align:middle line:84%
is the work of Walter van
Beek, an anthropologist who

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.420 align:middle line:84%
in just a few years tried to
get from the Dogon of Mali

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.190 align:middle line:84%
the same things that it took
Griaule some 30 years to get.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, remember,
Griaule didn't hear

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.040 align:middle line:84%
the true initiated
tradition until he'd

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.570 align:middle line:90%
been there for 30 years.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.470 align:middle line:84%
It was only at the very
end of that 30 years

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.780 align:middle line:84%
that they trusted him enough
to tell him the truth.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And they also revealed
that they are obligated

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.320 align:middle line:84%
to either remain silent
or to tell a lie if you

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.500 align:middle line:84%
ask a specific question that
they don't want to tell you

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.010 align:middle line:84%
the answer for because you are
not at the level of initiation

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.850 align:middle line:90%
to be given the answer.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.180 align:middle line:84%
So what do you think is going to
happen if Walter van Beek goes

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.220 align:middle line:84%
to Mali, talks to the
Dogon in only a few years,

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.710 align:middle line:84%
and tries to go after all
their deepest secrets?

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.517 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to
tell him the truth.

00:02:50.517 --> 00:02:52.100 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
either remain silent,

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.200 align:middle line:84%
which apparently
they did many times,

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.140 align:middle line:84%
or they're going
to tell him a lie.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.610 align:middle line:90%
But what do the skeptics do?

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.580 align:middle line:84%
They say, well, van
Beek's data doesn't

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.840 align:middle line:90%
say that the Dogon said this.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.920 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't say that
they said that.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.740 align:middle line:90%
They're missing the point.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.650 align:middle line:84%
Since Griaule committed
to a much longer term

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.350 align:middle line:84%
process of initiation
with these people

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.010 align:middle line:84%
and he had the street
cred of working

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.750 align:middle line:84%
with many other African tribes
as well, he got in there

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.840 align:middle line:90%
and finally got the truth.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is the
meanings of the words

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.280 align:middle line:84%
and the underlying
philosophy of what they said

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.360 align:middle line:84%
and how Laird Scranton
has been able to draw

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.300 align:middle line:84%
incredible correlations and
correspondences between what

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.120 align:middle line:84%
he got once he was
initiated through Griaule

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:45.410 align:middle line:84%
and what we see in Judaism, in
Egypt, in Buddhism, in Tibet.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.310 align:middle line:84%
It does appear that there was a
worldwide fount of information

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.090 align:middle line:84%
disseminated through
many ancient cultures,

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.550 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to hear
that in fact there have been

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.780 align:middle line:90%
other universes before ours.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.650 align:middle line:84%
Apparently we are the
fourth rebooted version

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.340 align:middle line:84%
of the universe and that
there's a total of seven

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.560 align:middle line:84%
on an ascending spiral,
like the DNA helix almost.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.700 align:middle line:84%
Some very, very
fascinating stuff

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.140 align:middle line:90%
that you're going to get here.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.690 align:middle line:84%
So again, I recommend you
have your thumb ready to go

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.250 align:middle line:90%
for the rewind button.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.660 align:middle line:84%
Or you may end up
wanting to just

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.890 align:middle line:84%
watch this whole thing
twice, because this

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:20.279 align:middle line:90%
is information dense.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:21.660 align:middle line:90%
It goes fast.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.350 align:middle line:84%
There's no time for you to
zone off or fall asleep.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.290 align:middle line:84%
You've got to be
totally focused.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:28.280 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready?

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.130 align:middle line:90%
Strap on your parachute.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.730 align:middle line:84%
Let's open the hatch
and take a dive.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:33.750 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.560 align:middle line:84%
Laird Scranton, part two,
here on "Disclosure."

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.727 align:middle line:90%
Check it out.

00:04:37.727 --> 00:04:38.435 align:middle line:90%
All right, Laird.

00:04:38.435 --> 00:04:39.024 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:04:39.024 --> 00:04:40.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LAIRD SCRANTON: Thank you.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad to be back.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now, I have
done some reading on you.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.066 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Uh-oh.

00:04:45.066 --> 00:04:47.020 align:middle line:90%
None of it's true.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.312 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And I found
the hate-orade.

00:04:49.312 --> 00:04:50.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Oh, really?

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, yeah.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.560 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.210 align:middle line:84%
You read the Amazon
reviews on your book,

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.132 align:middle line:84%
and there are some really
spiteful, nasty things.

00:04:58.132 --> 00:05:00.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Oh, especially
the Velikovsky book.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.830 align:middle line:84%
People are really invested
in not liking Velikovsky.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.520 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: So here's the deal.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.330 align:middle line:84%
The argument that the
skeptics are going to pose--

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.260 align:middle line:84%
and as your work
becomes more popular,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.540 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
dogged with this--

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.140 align:middle line:84%
is they're saying
that you're just

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:23.360 align:middle line:84%
looking at illiterate
paintings or illustrations.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And you're making these huge
conjectures, leaps in logic,

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.140 align:middle line:84%
completely irrational
conclusions

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.690 align:middle line:90%
based on scanty evidence.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And that you've only just
learned enough Hebrew

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:35.742 align:middle line:90%
to make your conclusions.

00:05:35.742 --> 00:05:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And you've only just
learned enough Egypt

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.090 align:middle line:90%
to make your conclusions.

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.230 align:middle line:84%
So how do you answer
this scathing attack

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.960 align:middle line:84%
that you're just making all
these arbitrary graspings

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.585 align:middle line:90%
at straws to build a theory?

00:05:48.585 --> 00:05:49.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: OK.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.480 align:middle line:10%
First of all, the approach
I've taken from the start

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.190 align:middle line:10%
is realizing that we're
dealing with subjects where

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.170 align:middle line:10%
absolute proof is not possible.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.540 align:middle line:10%
What I'm trying to do is
demonstrate, not prove.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.100 align:middle line:10%
So when we talk about things
like structure of matter

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.740 align:middle line:10%
with the Dogon, first,
the interpretation

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.770 align:middle line:10%
begins with their statement
that their tradition

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.604 align:middle line:10%
describes how their
tribal god created matter.

00:06:15.604 --> 00:06:16.520 align:middle line:90%
It's not my statement.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.247 align:middle line:90%
It's theirs.

00:06:17.247 --> 00:06:17.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: And all
I've done is I've

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.500 align:middle line:84%
taken their statements about
matter and their drawings that

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.720 align:middle line:84%
support those statements
and lay them side by side

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.110 align:middle line:84%
with statements by modern
authorities on the same subject

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.930 align:middle line:84%
and demonstrated a relationship
and let the reader look at it

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.910 align:middle line:90%
and see the relationship.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't insert
me into the process.

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:41.330 align:middle line:84%
What that does is it simply
lays it side by side,

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.670 align:middle line:84%
demonstrates that this
is likely to be true.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.560 align:middle line:10%
And that's the approach I've
taken at all levels of my book,

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:53.390 align:middle line:10%
is to always prefer the
simple, overt demonstration

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:55.940 align:middle line:10%
of something being true.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.580 align:middle line:10%
When it comes to
meanings of words,

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.370 align:middle line:10%
the Dogon flatly define
what their words mean.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.340 align:middle line:10%
And it predictably agrees with
what Budge says the words mean.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And again, all I'm doing is
I'm taking a set of words

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.050 align:middle line:84%
and comparing them
to a set of words

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.690 align:middle line:84%
and demonstrating
that they match.

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:14.620 align:middle line:84%
So the interpretation
comes out of that.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.540 align:middle line:84%
The interpretation comes
out of what they're

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:20.810 align:middle line:90%
saying these symbols represent.

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.320 align:middle line:84%
In terms of my approach to
Egyptian hieroglyphic language,

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm starting with the very
simplest words, words that

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.030 align:middle line:90%
involve a couple of glyphs.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:31.150 align:middle line:84%
The word for "week" is
extremely intuitive.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.540 align:middle line:84%
It's written with two
glyphs, a sun glyph that

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.850 align:middle line:84%
represents the concept of a
day and the Egyptian number 10.

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:40.420 align:middle line:84%
Symbolically, a child could
see there that says 10 days,

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.610 align:middle line:84%
and it's known that the
Egyptians had a 10-day week.

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:47.490 align:middle line:84%
That's the kind of level
that my interpretation is on.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't see there's a whole lot
of wiggle room for argument.

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:51.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.520 align:middle line:84%
I would also point out
that you have essentially

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.980 align:middle line:84%
passed the alternative
science peer review

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:01.300 align:middle line:84%
team because you've been heavily
endorsed by Graham Hancock.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.070 align:middle line:84%
You've had John Anthony
West write forewords

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:05.354 align:middle line:90%
for two of your books.

00:08:05.354 --> 00:08:06.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Yes.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:12.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So what
do you feel is--

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.380 align:middle line:84%
I may have asked
you this last time,

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.320 align:middle line:84%
but maybe I'll get a
different answer now.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:24.360 align:middle line:84%
What do you feel is the most
compelling proof that you have

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.610 align:middle line:84%
that there was a
primordial civilization

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:29.255 align:middle line:84%
responsible for all this
stuff that ferreted out

00:08:29.255 --> 00:08:31.440 align:middle line:90%
in different places?

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.159 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Because my standard
is that interpretations begin

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:37.740 align:middle line:84%
with overt statements on
the parts of the cultures,

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:39.440 align:middle line:84%
every ancient
culture that I have

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:44.290 align:middle line:84%
looked at that has preserved the
same set of symbols and myths

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.890 align:middle line:90%
are telling us the same thing.

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:52.100 align:middle line:84%
They're not saying we learned
agriculture by ourselves.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.980 align:middle line:84%
It was a great development
of our society.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.550 align:middle line:84%
We trumpet that as
our great achievement.

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:00.120 align:middle line:84%
They're saying, someone who
knew more about these things

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.550 align:middle line:84%
than we did taught
us how to be farmers.

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Someone who knew
more than we did

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.620 align:middle line:90%
provided us with these symbols.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:07.350 align:middle line:84%
Even in Ancient
Egypt, they flatly

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:12.370 align:middle line:84%
say their hieroglyphic
language was given to them.

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:14.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, because they're all
saying the same thing,

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:18.590 align:middle line:84%
my standard says that I need
to take that at face value.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:23.030 align:middle line:84%
I could say something else, and
people say, well, why don't you

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:25.240 align:middle line:84%
attribute this to
some other source?

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And my answer is, find me a
culture that thinks it happened

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:30.960 align:middle line:90%
that way, and we'll look at it.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: That's fascinating.

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:39.610 align:middle line:84%
With the immersion into
the Hebrew language,

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:43.030 align:middle line:84%
the Old Testament would
seem to only backdate

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:44.120 align:middle line:90%
to a certain point.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.560 align:middle line:84%
So would you say that the
penetration into Hebrew

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.456 align:middle line:84%
is a more recent phenomenon
of these words appearing

00:09:50.456 --> 00:09:51.080 align:middle line:90%
or reappearing?

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:51.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: No.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.980 align:middle line:90%
I think they're contemporaneous.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.400 align:middle line:84%
As I said, Budge-- who is an
authority on Egyptian language

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:01.400 align:middle line:84%
that is not well respected
by modern egyptologists

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.500 align:middle line:84%
but who's dictionary
I use anyway.

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.639 align:middle line:84%
The reason I use it is
because it predictably

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:07.930 align:middle line:90%
agrees with what the Dogon say.

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:12.680 align:middle line:84%
I happen to have the luxury of
having an independent source

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.710 align:middle line:84%
to compare it to, and
it's a set of words

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.380 align:middle line:90%
that are not just random words.

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:19.020 align:middle line:90%
It's a system of words.

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And so to my way of thinking,
when an egyptologist tells

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:25.905 align:middle line:84%
me, well, Budge could barely
even read the hieroglyphs,

00:10:25.905 --> 00:10:28.150 align:middle line:84%
he's flatly wrong
about the language,

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:31.310 align:middle line:84%
my answer is, he can't be
flatly wrong about the language

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:33.310 align:middle line:84%
in a way that predictably
agrees with the Dogon.

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:36.060 align:middle line:90%
That can't happen.

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:38.890 align:middle line:84%
So my independent source
has all the same words

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:42.534 align:middle line:84%
with the same meanings,
some of the same symbols.

00:10:42.534 --> 00:10:44.700 align:middle line:84%
To the extent that that
agrees with what Budge says,

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.030 align:middle line:84%
I have to conclude Budge must
be right, or substantially right

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:52.050 align:middle line:84%
at least about the
cosmological words.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:53.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: You also--

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.705 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Now, to answer
your question about the Hebrew

00:10:55.705 --> 00:10:58.210 align:middle line:84%
words, Budge uses
Hebrew words as examples

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:01.410 align:middle line:84%
to explain pronunciations and
meanings of various words.

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:04.330 align:middle line:84%
Many of the Dogon words
are also Egyptian words

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.500 align:middle line:90%
and Hebrew words.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And so the suggestion is that
all three of those languages

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.807 align:middle line:84%
were contemporaneous
in their origin.

00:11:11.807 --> 00:11:12.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Well, now--

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.014 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Another
example-- I'm

00:11:14.014 --> 00:11:15.970 align:middle line:84%
sorry to interrupt
you again-- is

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:17.910 align:middle line:84%
one of the characteristics
of these very

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:19.929 align:middle line:84%
early symbolic languages
and one of the things

00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:21.470 align:middle line:84%
that tells us that
they were symbolic

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:24.916 align:middle line:84%
is they don't represent the
vowel sounds originally.

00:11:24.916 --> 00:11:27.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you were going to
have a phonetic language,

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.910 align:middle line:84%
it would be absolutely crazy
not to find the vowel sounds.

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:32.470 align:middle line:90%
The vowel sounds are essential.

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.350 align:middle line:84%
You change two vowel
sounds in English,

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:37.300 align:middle line:84%
as they do in New Zealand,
and you render the language

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:39.800 align:middle line:90%
almost indistinguishable.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.470 align:middle line:84%
So if it was frenetic, you
would need the vowel sounds.

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:46.030 align:middle line:84%
So one of the character
traits that shows us

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:48.140 align:middle line:84%
we have the same
system at play is

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.640 align:middle line:84%
you have a symbolic language
that has no vowel sounds,

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.240 align:middle line:90%
and that's where Hebrew sat.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You were saying before
that the Dogon-- you're not

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.410 align:middle line:84%
making wild conjectures when
you're looking at, for example,

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:04.320 align:middle line:90%
the model of the atom.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.630 align:middle line:84%
They're saying, this
is what matter is.

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:09.040 align:middle line:90%
They draw a diagram of it.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.240 align:middle line:84%
The diagram corresponds
to what we see.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:12.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Right.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Does that
same logic apply

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:18.810 align:middle line:84%
to your genetic model
regarding X and Y

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:20.009 align:middle line:90%
chromosomes and all that?

00:12:20.009 --> 00:12:21.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Yes, it does.

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:21.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:23.350 align:middle line:84%
Could you explain
that in detail for us?

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:23.974 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: OK.

00:12:23.974 --> 00:12:25.830 align:middle line:84%
There was a chapter in
my first book, which

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:27.490 align:middle line:84%
is called "The
Science of the Dogon,"

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:30.580 align:middle line:84%
that talks about how the
biological symbolism plays out.

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:32.600 align:middle line:84%
In the Dogon system,
we have three themes.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.310 align:middle line:84%
We have a theme of the
creation of the universe,

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:36.860 align:middle line:84%
a theme of the
creation of matter,

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:39.190 align:middle line:84%
and a theme of the
creation of life.

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And they use a
single set of symbols

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.509 align:middle line:84%
to simultaneously
represent all three themes.

00:12:44.509 --> 00:12:46.300 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason why
some of these symbols

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.070 align:middle line:90%
are so hard to interpret.

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Before you give
an interpretation,

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:54.300 align:middle line:84%
you have to first state which
theme am I talking about?

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:57.620 align:middle line:84%
The Dogon diagrams, as
they're explaining the stages,

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:01.440 align:middle line:84%
they again get-- these are
pictures they draw on the sand.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.830 align:middle line:84%
The picture is a very
presentable and credible

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:10.450 align:middle line:84%
representation of the process
of mitosis, a cell splitting.

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:12.129 align:middle line:84%
They understand
how a gene works.

00:13:12.129 --> 00:13:13.670 align:middle line:84%
They understand what
the relationship

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:18.860 align:middle line:84%
is between a fertilized egg
and the genetic process.

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And they understand how
the process evolves up

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:25.740 align:middle line:84%
to an expanding womb, which
they compare to mass expanding

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:28.640 align:middle line:90%
in relation to matter.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.500 align:middle line:84%
Part of the reason that
you have the symbol

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.230 align:middle line:84%
of the cosmogonic egg
in all these cultures

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.910 align:middle line:84%
is because since an
egg is the starting

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:38.890 align:middle line:84%
point for biological
reproduction

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:42.100 align:middle line:84%
and they want parallelism
in these themes,

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.430 align:middle line:84%
they also use an egg to
represent the starting point

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:46.560 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, that is a very
interesting concept, the idea

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:54.910 align:middle line:84%
that biology is an intrinsic
aspect of the universe itself

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:57.256 align:middle line:84%
that it's built into the
origin of the universe.

00:13:57.256 --> 00:13:59.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: It actually
goes much deeper than that.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.850 align:middle line:84%
It goes down to
what the Dogon say

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:07.200 align:middle line:84%
the structure of the
formation of the universes is.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.020 align:middle line:84%
From their conception-- and
this is supported by an outlook

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.610 align:middle line:84%
by Buddhism, it's
there in Kabbalism,

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:14.800 align:middle line:84%
there are other references
in other cultures.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:19.260 align:middle line:84%
But in the Dogon conception,
universes emerge in pairs.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And ours is the
fourth of a series

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:25.220 align:middle line:84%
of seven pairs of universes
that evolve as a helix.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And that helix is a
functional equivalent,

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:31.070 align:middle line:84%
or a least a conceptual
equivalent, to DNA.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:36.805 align:middle line:84%
And if they're right, then
life is an inherent foundation

00:14:36.805 --> 00:14:37.870 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:39.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: That's fascinating.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:45.250 align:middle line:84%
You obviously went back to
Griaule and Dieterlen and some

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:48.420 align:middle line:84%
of the sources that were in
Robert Temple's book, "Sirius

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.000 align:middle line:90%
Mystery."

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.970 align:middle line:84%
If somebody wanted
to independently try

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:55.690 align:middle line:84%
to verify what you're
saying for themselves,

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:58.770 align:middle line:84%
what would be the best way for
them to go about doing that?

00:14:58.770 --> 00:14:59.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: OK.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:04.080 align:middle line:84%
Anything that Griaule and
Dieterlen wrote is useful.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:07.110 align:middle line:84%
My main references for
the Dogon information

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:09.790 align:middle line:84%
are their finished
anthropological study

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:12.660 align:middle line:84%
of the Dogon tribe, which
is called "The Pale Fox."

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.620 align:middle line:10%
These were all originally
written in French,

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:17.470 align:middle line:10%
so they have different
titles in French.

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:19.520 align:middle line:10%
"The Pale Fox" is the
anthropological study

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.610 align:middle line:10%
that defines the details
of their religion.

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:24.980 align:middle line:84%
There's a second work,
a very short book

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.830 align:middle line:84%
called "Conversations
with Ogotemmeli."

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:31.230 align:middle line:10%
And it describes-- it's actually
a diary of Griaule's initiation

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:36.130 align:middle line:10%
in the tradition, 33 days
he spent with a Dogon priest

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:39.010 align:middle line:10%
asking the innermost
questions and getting

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:44.310 align:middle line:10%
answers and explanations for
how this entire system works.

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:46.850 align:middle line:84%
The third critical piece
from the Dogon side

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:49.990 align:middle line:84%
is a French Dogon
dictionary that

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.430 align:middle line:84%
was written by Griaule's
adult daughter who was

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:55.900 align:middle line:90%
with him on the expeditions.

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:59.590 align:middle line:84%
It's called "The
Dogon Dictionary,"

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:00.510 align:middle line:90%
"Dictionnaire Dogon."

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:03.180 align:middle line:90%
And it's extremely helpful.

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:06.670 align:middle line:84%
Many times she'll give
explanations that are not even

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:08.455 align:middle line:84%
in the anthropological
study about why

00:16:08.455 --> 00:16:10.010 align:middle line:90%
a word means what it means.

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And very often those
explanations-- and she'll

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.950 align:middle line:84%
identify as an
archaic form words

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:17.480 align:middle line:84%
that look to me like archaic
forms in Budge's dictionary,

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.610 align:middle line:90%
or that Budge says are archaic.

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:23.630 align:middle line:84%
So you have
cross-comparison there.

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:26.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, now, some
of the haters, I've read,

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:32.440 align:middle line:84%
said that the exoteric
interpretation that most people

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:35.150 align:middle line:84%
get if you go and
talk to the Dogon

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:39.450 align:middle line:84%
doesn't support the esoteric
interpretations that you're

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:44.490 align:middle line:84%
giving, and therefore that you
are drawing off of unproven

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:47.990 align:middle line:84%
and dubious sources in
terms of the other--

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:49.860 align:middle line:84%
so could you talk about
that a little bit?

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:50.568 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Sure.

00:16:50.568 --> 00:16:53.170 align:middle line:84%
Griaule describes the tradition
as an esoteric tradition

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:55.200 align:middle line:90%
in the ancient sense.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And the way he says it
works is if I'm an initiate

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:03.250 align:middle line:84%
and you're a priest, and I
ask you a question that's

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:05.329 align:middle line:84%
appropriate to my
initiated status,

00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:09.619 align:middle line:84%
you are obligated to
give me an honest answer.

00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:11.319 align:middle line:84%
However, if I ask
you a question,

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:13.319 align:middle line:84%
or any other person asks
you a question, that's

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:15.819 align:middle line:84%
inappropriate to
their initiate status,

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:21.390 align:middle line:84%
you're obligated to either
remain silent or to lie.

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:24.390 align:middle line:84%
So in the 1980s, a
Belgian anthropologist

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:27.660 align:middle line:84%
named Walter van Beek took
a team into Dogon country

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:30.504 align:middle line:84%
to re-study what
Griaule had study.

00:17:30.504 --> 00:17:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are
some unusual things

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.250 align:middle line:90%
about his choice to do that.

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:35.500 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it's not
unusual to re-study

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.490 align:middle line:84%
some aspect of another
anthropologist's work.

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:41.320 align:middle line:84%
It's extremely rare
on a short time frame

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:44.910 align:middle line:84%
to try to re-study 30 years
of an anthropologist's work.

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:46.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: He was
there for 30 years?

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:47.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Griaule was.

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:49.850 align:middle line:84%
van Beek was there
for only a few years.

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:50.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.305 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: OK.

00:17:51.305 --> 00:17:54.450 align:middle line:84%
The second thing is that
van Beek's specialty prior

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:56.010 align:middle line:90%
to this study was not religion.

00:17:56.010 --> 00:18:00.670 align:middle line:90%
It was ecology.

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:03.150 align:middle line:84%
So van Beek took a team
into Dogon country,

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:06.330 align:middle line:84%
understanding that Griaule
described this tradition

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:09.660 align:middle line:84%
as a closely held secret,
went in and started

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.090 align:middle line:84%
asking leading questions
about the cosmology,

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:18.490 align:middle line:84%
and was met with silence or
with answers that flatly denied

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:21.710 align:middle line:84%
that they knew anything about
it, which is what Griaule said

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:22.745 align:middle line:90%
was going to happen.

00:18:22.745 --> 00:18:23.328 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:18:23.328 --> 00:18:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And you go in there with pot
bellies and white tube socks

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.460 align:middle line:84%
and shorts and a fanny
pack on the front,

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:32.580 align:middle line:84%
they're not necessarily
going to trust you.

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: So van Beek declared
the system to be a fabrication.

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:40.095 align:middle line:84%
His first generous outlook
was that the Dogon priests

00:18:40.095 --> 00:18:42.310 align:middle line:84%
had fabricated
answers to satisfy

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:45.590 align:middle line:90%
Griaule's persistent questions.

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:47.900 align:middle line:84%
That's very difficult
to disprove.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.660 align:middle line:84%
But more damningly,
there's a central symbol

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:53.120 align:middle line:90%
of this tradition.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.640 align:middle line:84%
It's an aligned shrine
called the Dogon granary

00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:01.540 align:middle line:84%
that van Beek claimed to be a
chimera-- basically a mirage--

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:05.090 align:middle line:90%
known only to Griaule.

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:06.850 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, he falls
short of saying this

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:09.150 align:middle line:90%
is something Griaule made up.

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:11.890 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't exist, he said.

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:17.360 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, van Beek, like
60 years of other researchers,

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.990 align:middle line:90%
missed a critical point.

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And that is that this granary is
a matching form for a Buddhist

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:25.360 align:middle line:90%
stupa.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And the cosmology
that Griaule said

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:30.020 align:middle line:84%
goes with the granary
is a point for point

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:33.110 align:middle line:84%
match for the cosmology that
goes with a Buddhist stupa.

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:37.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, a Buddhist stupa exists
all across Asia and India,

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:40.520 align:middle line:84%
is a well documented form,
and the cosmology that

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:45.430 align:middle line:84%
goes with it is a known,
accepted, legitimate cosmology.

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:49.070 align:middle line:84%
So knowing that, van Beek's
argument falls to the ground.

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:50.940 align:middle line:90%
This is legitimate cosmology.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And van Beek simply failed
to penetrate the tradition.

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:57.230 align:middle line:84%
I compare it to going to a
college campus on parents

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:59.580 align:middle line:84%
weekend and coming
away with no evidence

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:00.620 align:middle line:90%
of alcohol or drug use.

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:05.477 align:middle line:90%


00:20:05.477 --> 00:20:08.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, I would have been
guilty as charged myself back

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:10.110 align:middle line:90%
then, but that was another time.

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:13.520 align:middle line:84%
So van Beek is
essentially thinking

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.850 align:middle line:84%
that he can just sort
of crash in the gate

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:21.890 align:middle line:84%
and just be given the
deepest, innermost

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:24.660 align:middle line:90%
secrets of a secret society.

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:25.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Right.

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:28.920 align:middle line:84%
Although I think that there
may have been an agenda there.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.410 align:middle line:84%
Given his background and
given the controversy that

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:35.030 align:middle line:84%
surrounded the Dogon system
and Griaule's study of them,

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:38.150 align:middle line:84%
I think there may have
been an initial agenda

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:40.220 align:middle line:90%
to discredit this.

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And he did a very good
job of trying to do that,

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:45.230 align:middle line:84%
but they missed
a critical point.

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:49.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, in fairness to van
Beek, when I discovered this,

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:52.260 align:middle line:84%
I had been in communication
with van Beek by email.

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:56.715 align:middle line:84%
And I offered to co-report my
finding in the academic journal

00:20:56.715 --> 00:21:00.026 align:middle line:84%
that he edited called Current
Anthropology, because I thought

00:21:00.026 --> 00:21:01.900 align:middle line:84%
that was the best way
of allowing him to save

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:07.740 align:middle line:84%
some face in the light of
the piece of information

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:08.960 align:middle line:90%
that he missed.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And he never
answered that offer.

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:15.330 align:middle line:84%
So then I started approaching
other academic journals,

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:17.610 align:middle line:84%
explained to them what
I had, that I wanted

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:22.160 align:middle line:84%
to write a short piece
outlining the identity

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.220 align:middle line:84%
between the Buddhist
and the Dogon system.

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.341 align:middle line:84%
And Anthropology News, another
anthropological journal

00:21:27.341 --> 00:21:29.340 align:middle line:84%
that's published with the
University of Chicago,

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:31.750 align:middle line:84%
agreed on the
condition that I not

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:35.370 align:middle line:84%
make it an attack
piece against van Beek.

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And so in April of 2007,
I published that article.

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And that, to my knowledge,
is the last word

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:44.470 align:middle line:84%
on the question of
whether the Dogon

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:46.650 align:middle line:90%
cosmology is legitimate or not.

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:50.320 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: Well, now, the
typical hater is going to say,

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:57.880 align:middle line:10%
OK, you think that this granary
and this stupa are the same.

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.300 align:middle line:10%
You've grabbed one
little data point,

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:02.190 align:middle line:10%
and you've made this
huge conjecture, which

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:05.280 align:middle line:10%
is that Buddhism and
the Dogon in Mali

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.770 align:middle line:10%
are part of a
primordial civilization.

00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:09.990 align:middle line:84%
So do you have
other linkage points

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:12.670 align:middle line:90%
between Buddhism and the Dogon?

00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:16.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: OK, first
of all, in both systems,

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:20.090 align:middle line:84%
the aligned shrine is considered
to be a grand mnemonic

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:21.720 align:middle line:90%
for the entire system.

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.240 align:middle line:84%
If you've got that, you've
got the entire cosmology

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.560 align:middle line:90%
in a culture.

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:29.770 align:middle line:84%
They evoke the same series of
shapes in the same sequence

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:33.426 align:middle line:84%
with the same symbolism assigned
to them, aligned the same way,

00:22:33.426 --> 00:22:34.800 align:middle line:84%
set out with the
same dimensions.

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And they only differ
in the very final stage

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:39.110 align:middle line:90%
of the creation of this form.

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:42.060 align:middle line:84%
The Dogon begin with
a round base and end

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.000 align:middle line:90%
with a square roof.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.850 align:middle line:84%
The Buddhist stupa
begins with a round base,

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:48.600 align:middle line:84%
but they square it
at the final stage

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.620 align:middle line:84%
and then end up
with a round roof.

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:52.810 align:middle line:84%
That's really the only
difference in the form.

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:56.920 align:middle line:84%
The cosmology, when I
was trying to understand

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.820 align:middle line:84%
the relationship
between those two forms,

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.660 align:middle line:84%
I settled on as my
source a book called

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:05.056 align:middle line:84%
"The Symbolism of the Stupa,"
written by Adrian Snodgrass.

00:23:05.056 --> 00:23:06.555 align:middle line:84%
He's a professor
from the University

00:23:06.555 --> 00:23:08.380 align:middle line:90%
of West Sydney, Australia.

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:11.840 align:middle line:84%
He's considered to be a
leading worldwide source

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:14.100 align:middle line:84%
on Buddhist architecture
and symbolism.

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And what I did was I simply
read his book and sort

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:20.180 align:middle line:84%
of ticked off the points of
agreement between the two--

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:23.290 align:middle line:84%
all the same symbolic
elements laid out

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:25.940 align:middle line:84%
in the same way understood
in the same way.

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:27.700 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of
fact, any time I'm

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:29.440 align:middle line:84%
in doubt about some
new concept I'm

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.920 align:middle line:84%
not familiar with that
relates to the systems,

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.840 align:middle line:84%
I cross-compare
what Snodgrass says

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:37.390 align:middle line:84%
to what the Dogon says to
what the Egyptians say and try

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:39.510 align:middle line:90%
to triangulate in on a meaning.

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:42.465 align:middle line:84%
I even look at what the symbols
of the Egyptian words say.

00:23:42.465 --> 00:23:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I'm going to make a
very mundane statement here,

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:50.030 align:middle line:84%
but the stupa is not just
some offshoot, some side

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:51.456 align:middle line:90%
note of Buddhism.

00:23:51.456 --> 00:23:52.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: No.

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.140 align:middle line:90%
It's a starting point.

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:54.973 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
if you were an initiate

00:23:54.973 --> 00:23:57.400 align:middle line:84%
in this tradition,
the first thing

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.560 align:middle line:84%
they teach you is
how to align a stupa.

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they do that is
because ostensibly the purpose

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:05.430 align:middle line:84%
of this, the
civilizing plan that

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:06.970 align:middle line:84%
is associated with
this tradition,

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:08.720 align:middle line:90%
was to teach us agriculture.

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And in order to do that,
one of the prerequisites

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:14.450 align:middle line:84%
was we needed to be
able to tell time.

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And so this base
plan of these shrines

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.730 align:middle line:84%
involves-- you place
a stick in the ground

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:22.050 align:middle line:84%
and measure a circle
around that stick.

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, that's
the shape of a sundial.

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:28.561 align:middle line:84%
If you have that much, you can
track the hours of the day,

00:24:28.561 --> 00:24:30.852 align:middle line:84%
you know how long the day
is, you know what time of day

00:24:30.852 --> 00:24:32.360 align:middle line:90%
it is.

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:35.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, if every morning
you get up in the morning

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:37.580 align:middle line:84%
and mark the longest
shadow of the day

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:40.824 align:middle line:84%
at the point where it crosses
the circle and then at night

00:24:40.824 --> 00:24:42.240 align:middle line:84%
mark the longest
shadow of the day

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.950 align:middle line:84%
where it crosses the
circle, those two points

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:48.450 align:middle line:84%
define an east-west
aligned line that

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:50.610 align:middle line:84%
through the course of the
year move back and forth

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:51.950 align:middle line:90%
across the circle.

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And on the equinoxes, it
passes through the stick.

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And then it moves
continually farther away

00:24:57.390 --> 00:24:59.490 align:middle line:84%
till the next solstice
and then back.

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:02.570 align:middle line:84%
So now the same figure that lets
you tell the hours of the day

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:04.770 align:middle line:84%
also lets you track the
seasons of the year.

00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:06.936 align:middle line:84%
And you have the tool you
need to be able to lay out

00:25:06.936 --> 00:25:08.850 align:middle line:90%
an agricultural calendar.

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:11.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I know that John
Anthony West actually

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:13.850 align:middle line:84%
wrote the forewords
to two of your books.

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking here about
a very interesting summary

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:22.190 align:middle line:84%
thought, which is
I've done episodes

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:25.710 align:middle line:84%
on the Tibetan practice
of the rainbow body,

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:29.480 align:middle line:84%
the idea of an ascension into
an immortal state, a light body

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:30.450 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:35.135 align:middle line:84%
And when their bodies
transform into light

00:25:35.135 --> 00:25:37.420 align:middle line:84%
and it leaves behind a
little ashy figurine,

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:39.440 align:middle line:84%
there's no skeleton
anymore, they'll

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:44.510 align:middle line:84%
put those in the stupa,
the little figurine.

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:46.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, John, in interviews
that I did with him,

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:52.210 align:middle line:84%
said that the whole basis of
the ancient, ancient Egyptian

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:55.150 align:middle line:84%
teachings is all
about immortality.

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:58.200 align:middle line:84%
So do you see this
similar aspiration

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:02.794 align:middle line:84%
to light body appearing
in the Dogon system?

00:26:02.794 --> 00:26:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Yes.

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:04.670 align:middle line:90%
It's a complicated answer.

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:09.070 align:middle line:84%
When you get to the bottom
of the tradition, all

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:12.770 align:middle line:84%
of the themes of this
ancient cosmology end

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:16.160 align:middle line:84%
up being metaphors for the
hermetic phrase as above,

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:20.040 align:middle line:84%
so below-- even
the idea, OK, they

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.610 align:middle line:84%
have the figure of a circle
associated with the heavens,

00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:25.080 align:middle line:84%
a square associated
with the Earth--

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:28.150 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
macrocosm and microcosm--

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:31.200 align:middle line:84%
the idea of reconciling
a circle with a square,

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:34.130 align:middle line:84%
squaring the circle is
a metaphor for as above,

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:35.280 align:middle line:90%
so below.

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.190 align:middle line:84%
But when you take that
out in the ever larger--

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:43.110 align:middle line:84%
this cosmology involves ever
larger steps or ever decreasing

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:43.850 align:middle line:90%
steps.

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:47.112 align:middle line:84%
The Dogon say it's like peeling
back the skins on an onion,

00:26:47.112 --> 00:26:49.320 align:middle line:84%
that every time you think
you're done with one level,

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.500 align:middle line:90%
there's another level.

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:54.010 align:middle line:84%
So as you move upward with this,
that same symbolism ultimately

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:56.940 align:middle line:84%
relates to these universes
that form in pairs.

00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And the pairs are one is
non-material in nature,

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:02.390 align:middle line:90%
the other is material in nature.

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:04.400 align:middle line:84%
The difference, the way
the Dogon describe it,

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.860 align:middle line:90%
I compare to sushi.

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:13.470 align:middle line:84%
It's a question of at what point
in the process membranes form.

00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And according to the
Dogon, that stage

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.040 align:middle line:84%
in the formation of our
universe came out of sequence

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:22.540 align:middle line:84%
and caused our universe to be
material as opposed to not.

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:24.910 align:middle line:84%
With sushi, you have
the kind of sushi

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:26.530 align:middle line:84%
where the seaweed's
wrapped up coiled

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:28.510 align:middle line:84%
inside the sushi
and the kind where

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:30.660 align:middle line:84%
it's wrapped around the
outside of the sushi.

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:33.570 align:middle line:84%
That's the essential
difference between the two.

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:35.985 align:middle line:84%
But with these pairs of
universes, one non-material

00:27:35.985 --> 00:27:40.160 align:middle line:84%
and one material, the idea
is the non-material side

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:43.230 align:middle line:84%
can see the material side,
but we can't see back.

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:46.210 align:middle line:10%
That's what the Dogon masks
are all about, one side being

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:47.800 align:middle line:10%
able to see, the other one not.

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.030 align:middle line:10%
And one of the upshots
of the tradition

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:53.650 align:middle line:10%
is to try to make us aware
of the non-material side,

00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:56.750 align:middle line:10%
to try to make us aware of
what our true relationship

00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:59.650 align:middle line:10%
to the whole creation
structure is.

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:02.010 align:middle line:84%
Because in the modern
view, we see ourselves

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:04.870 align:middle line:90%
as the top of the chain.

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:08.070 align:middle line:84%
But when you know the correct
view according to the Dogon,

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:09.380 align:middle line:90%
we're not the top of the chain.

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:10.920 align:middle line:90%
We're just another step upwards.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:12.320 align:middle line:84%
There are things
that go on, that

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.970 align:middle line:90%
continue on upwards from us.

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And when we perceive
ourselves as just

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.530 align:middle line:84%
being another step
on the chain, it's

00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:22.660 align:middle line:84%
a whole different outlook on
how what our proper role is.

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:24.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: That's amazing.

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:28.750 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that they have
a set of spiritual teachings

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:33.310 align:middle line:84%
that were intended to help their
initiates reach this rainbow

00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:34.105 align:middle line:90%
body?

00:28:34.105 --> 00:28:35.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: The tradition does.

00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:40.340 align:middle line:84%
The Dogon may, but it's
not emphasized by Griaule.

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Concepts of ascension, which
is the idea in Buddhism

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:45.645 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to
attain enlightenment

00:28:45.645 --> 00:28:47.020 align:middle line:84%
over the course
of your lifetime,

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:48.850 align:middle line:84%
you're turning this
cosmology inward

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:54.321 align:middle line:84%
and talking about personal
ascension considered to rise

00:28:54.321 --> 00:28:55.820 align:middle line:84%
from the center of
your body upward,

00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:59.760 align:middle line:84%
through the top of your head
or the third eye or whatever,

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:02.570 align:middle line:84%
that's a concept that relates to
the formation of matter, which

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:05.930 align:middle line:84%
is also-- those stages are
also considered extension.

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:07.609 align:middle line:84%
And the formation of
the universe, there

00:29:07.609 --> 00:29:09.775 align:middle line:84%
are stages that are also
considered to be ascension.

00:29:09.775 --> 00:29:11.950 align:middle line:84%
You have parallelism
all the way down,

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:14.101 align:middle line:84%
and parallelism sort
of deep, because you're

00:29:14.101 --> 00:29:15.600 align:middle line:84%
talking about
personal stuff, you're

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.360 align:middle line:84%
talking about
things in the world

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:21.360 align:middle line:84%
and things in the universe and
things beyond the universe.

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:24.870 align:middle line:84%
So yes, I think that's
built into the system.

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:28.730 align:middle line:84%
It's not emphasized in Griaule
and Dieterlen's studies.

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: How long did it
take Griaule and Dieterlen

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:35.560 align:middle line:84%
to actually start to get the
esoteric portion of the Dogon

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:36.150 align:middle line:90%
teaching?

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:37.649 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: They
thought they had it

00:29:37.649 --> 00:29:41.900 align:middle line:84%
when they were writing
in the early 1950s,

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:46.250 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't finally
get it until the very end.

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:47.955 align:middle line:84%
I can see from
articles they wrote,

00:29:47.955 --> 00:29:51.790 align:middle line:84%
say, in 1952 that the
way they formulated it

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:55.700 align:middle line:84%
is significantly different
than the way they formulated it

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:58.450 align:middle line:90%
in the final study.

00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And those are
critical differences.

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:02.610 align:middle line:84%
If you understand
it the earlier way,

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:06.320 align:middle line:84%
you're going to miss the points,
because the priests still

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:10.470 align:middle line:84%
had not given Griaule the
actual real stuff until he

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:11.699 align:middle line:90%
was fully initiated.

00:30:11.699 --> 00:30:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And he hadn't had permission
yet to be initiated.

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And this essentially
took almost 30 years.

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:17.348 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: It took 30 years.

00:30:17.348 --> 00:30:19.590 align:middle line:84%
But that's no different
than the Greek priests who

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:22.310 align:middle line:84%
say they went to Egypt
for 20 or 30 years

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:24.040 align:middle line:84%
to study before they
came back and wrote

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:28.710 align:middle line:84%
their philosophical
or poetic treatises.

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:29.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Sure.

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, Laird, you've
impressed me.

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:32.497 align:middle line:90%
I think your work is phenomenal.

00:30:32.497 --> 00:30:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really glad to
have you on the show.

00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:35.496 align:middle line:90%
So thank you for being here.

00:30:35.496 --> 00:30:38.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Thank you very much.

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:40.350 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: I love where we
ended on this interview

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:44.460 align:middle line:10%
because it's the distinct
suggestion that even

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:47.230 align:middle line:10%
though Griaule didn't
really get into it too much,

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:51.960 align:middle line:10%
the ultimate point of what
the Dogon were being taught

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:55.370 align:middle line:10%
was the notion of ascension.

00:30:55.370 --> 00:30:57.970 align:middle line:84%
These higher beings,
these extraterrestrials

00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:01.030 align:middle line:84%
allegedly from Sirius,
came here to give us

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:05.360 align:middle line:84%
a cosmology that ultimately
liberates the soul from needing

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:08.260 align:middle line:84%
to reincarnate in
this world of flesh,

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:10.760 align:middle line:84%
coming back in each time,
forgetting who we are,

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.960 align:middle line:84%
forgetting what we're
supposed to be doing here,

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.830 align:middle line:84%
and having to make mistakes
and accrue karma and work off

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:20.050 align:middle line:84%
karma and come back and be
saying you're sorry over

00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:23.020 align:middle line:84%
and over again and having to be
tortured because you tortured

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:25.960 align:middle line:84%
other people-- they want
us to break free of that.

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And there is a point
at which we learn

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:30.430 align:middle line:84%
what the true essence
of the universe is,

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:32.560 align:middle line:84%
and we break free
from the shackles

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:34.260 align:middle line:90%
of having to reincarnate here.

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And we graduate into
becoming light beings

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:42.195 align:middle line:84%
and truly grasping our
essence as immortal souls.

00:31:42.195 --> 00:31:44.460 align:middle line:84%
Do you think maybe
Walter van Beek

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:49.380 align:middle line:84%
had an agenda if in
fact Scranton comes out

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:51.710 align:middle line:84%
with information that
is very compelling that

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:54.010 align:middle line:90%
clearly contradicts his view?

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And van Beek completely refused
to publish Scranton's work

00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:01.020 align:middle line:84%
in his own academic
journal, and Scranton then

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:03.890 align:middle line:84%
had to go to others
who were also

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:06.850 align:middle line:84%
academics in the same
field and they were

00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:08.780 align:middle line:90%
able to be more open-minded?

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:12.750 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's entirely possible
that somebody like van Beek

00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:16.720 align:middle line:84%
may have been paid to discredit
the work of Laird Scranton.

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:20.360 align:middle line:84%
There is a force that doesn't
want us to know the truth, that

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:22.700 align:middle line:84%
doesn't want us to
know what's going on

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:26.540 align:middle line:84%
and wants to keep the blanket
over this so that we're all

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:30.390 align:middle line:84%
sleeping in that consensus,
warm blanket of reality that

00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:32.420 align:middle line:90%
says everything's fine.

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And civilization
really began in Sumer

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.700 align:middle line:84%
and it didn't start to get
anywhere until Ancient Greece,

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.310 align:middle line:84%
and it's all had
a nice progression

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:41.690 align:middle line:84%
from hunter-gatherers
up to the present day.

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:42.920 align:middle line:90%
It's not true.

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:45.790 align:middle line:84%
Civilization had
attained a high peak,

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:49.170 align:middle line:84%
and then it completely
collapsed in this great flood.

00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And only a few of the
remnants survived.

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And the Dogon gone apparently
inherited some of the attempts

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:59.190 align:middle line:84%
by extraterrestrials
to rebuild our society

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:02.220 align:middle line:84%
and give us a working spiritual
philosophy that we could

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:07.010 align:middle line:84%
use as the seeds of that new
era that we are now reaching

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:10.400 align:middle line:84%
the fruition of as we head
into something completely

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:13.950 align:middle line:84%
unexpected, which we are
exploring and co-creating here

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:16.070 align:middle line:90%
on "Disclosure."

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the next
episode, I'm going

00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:19.690 align:middle line:90%
to be talking to Graham Hancock.

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we really get
into the Ark of the Covenant

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:27.850 align:middle line:84%
in even more detail, describing
the incredible properties

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:31.470 align:middle line:84%
of this super-weapon that
is extensively referenced

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:34.260 align:middle line:84%
in the Old Testament, that
apparently had the ability

00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:36.650 align:middle line:84%
to take entire walls, like
in the case of the wall

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:40.340 align:middle line:84%
of Jericho, and turn those
stones into something so soft

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:42.420 align:middle line:84%
that they just
melted right down.

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:46.450 align:middle line:84%
We're also going to get into
the equally fascinating category

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:49.140 align:middle line:84%
of the tunneling under
the Giza Plateau.

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:52.310 align:middle line:84%
These secret tunnels--
what do they contain?

00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:55.250 align:middle line:84%
What are the mysteries that
they might have in store for us?

00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:57.830 align:middle line:84%
That's coming up next
time on "Disclosure."

00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:59.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, David Wilcock.

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.880 align:middle line:90%
And I thank you for watching.

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:10.346 align:middle line:90%
