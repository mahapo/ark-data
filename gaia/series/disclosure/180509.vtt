00:00:19.625 --> 00:00:22.000 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID WILCOCK: All right,
welcome back to "Disclosure."

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.920 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, David
Wilcock, and I am here

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.340 align:middle line:10%
with Dr. Pete Peterson, one of
the most remarkable insiders

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.600 align:middle line:10%
I've ever had the
pleasure of knowing.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.220 align:middle line:84%
So, Pete, welcome
back to the program.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.844 align:middle line:84%
>>PETE PETERSON:
Thank you much, David.

00:00:32.844 --> 00:00:36.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So let's hit the
ground running on this.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.920 align:middle line:84%
As far as the
informational field goes,

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.760 align:middle line:84%
we talked about it in
a previous episode.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.480 align:middle line:84%
We also got into
the Vatican library

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.120 align:middle line:84%
and some of the ancient
books that were found there.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And you mentioned that
those books indicated

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.460 align:middle line:84%
that the people
who wrote them had

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.830 align:middle line:84%
an awareness of this cosmic
consciousness in some way.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.820 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yes.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.350 align:middle line:84%
I think they had a better
awareness than we have now,

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.890 align:middle line:90%
to some extent.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And then progress, as
always, go forward.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.100 align:middle line:84%
So there are a lot of
things that we know now

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.660 align:middle line:90%
that they didn't know.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And the question is
how helpful they are

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.500 align:middle line:90%
compared to what they did know.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.530 align:middle line:84%
They were capable of
doing a lot of things

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.240 align:middle line:84%
that we have found that we
aren't capable of doing yet.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And we're just now
learning a lot of things

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.010 align:middle line:84%
that we're becoming very
capable of doing that they

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.020 align:middle line:90%
did for ages and ages.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.930 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very interesting
time, not the least of which

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.395 align:middle line:90%
is interesting for that reason.

00:01:40.395 --> 00:01:41.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: This is
kind of separate

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.394 align:middle line:84%
from the rest of the
topic of the show,

00:01:43.394 --> 00:01:46.130 align:middle line:84%
but it's related to
what you just said.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.612 align:middle line:84%
Do you think we're ever
going to get the truth?

00:01:48.612 --> 00:01:50.320 align:middle line:84%
Do you think we're
ever going to find out

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.111 align:middle line:84%
that extraterrestrials
are real and that it

00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:53.329 align:middle line:90%
will become commonly known?

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:55.870 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Oh, I think that's
already pretty commonly known.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.460 align:middle line:84%
But it depends on who you are
and what level of government

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.185 align:middle line:84%
or what level of
leadership you're--

00:02:02.185 --> 00:02:04.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, let me
ask it a different way.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that we will see
UFOs and extraterrestrials,

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.350 align:middle line:84%
in our lifetime,
becoming something

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.750 align:middle line:84%
that would be known enough that
it's just we can talk to them,

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.760 align:middle line:84%
we can see their ships
in the sky easily?

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.740 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I would say,
in the last 10 years,

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:27.010 align:middle line:84%
if you want to see that
now, you can see it.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.280 align:middle line:84%
If you want to go to
places that are remote,

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.330 align:middle line:84%
if you want to be awake
at night and observe

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:43.000 align:middle line:84%
with such tools as infrared
night vision devices

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.560 align:middle line:84%
or other type of night vision
devices, or if you want to be--

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.590 align:middle line:84%
if you want to use particle
or charge detectors,

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.750 align:middle line:90%
you can see these things.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.150 align:middle line:90%
And we talk about them.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.150 align:middle line:84%
If you want to go down
to Gulf Breeze, Florida,

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.720 align:middle line:84%
and sit there in an armchair
at night and look at the sky,

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.130 align:middle line:90%
you're going to see craft.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.810 align:middle line:90%
And that's all there is to it.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.904 align:middle line:84%
Because they fly
there all the time.

00:03:09.904 --> 00:03:11.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: The Gulf
Breeze sightings

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.480 align:middle line:84%
are a classic in modern
UFO lore, for sure.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.280 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yup.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.988 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So, Pete, it
really sounds to me

00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:22.960 align:middle line:84%
like your informational field
science is a bridge to what we

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.740 align:middle line:84%
would normally think of as
extraterrestrials, that it

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.710 align:middle line:84%
opens up the possibility of
advanced human potentials

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.350 align:middle line:84%
that we wouldn't normally
consider that we have.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.600 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: It's a
way to see things

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.150 align:middle line:90%
that we have no way to see.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.060 align:middle line:84%
I like to look
back at technology

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.350 align:middle line:84%
to see where it's come, to
see if I can't maybe steer

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.170 align:middle line:90%
a little bit more out of it.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And so, from time to time, maybe
once a month, I take a review.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And I see the things
that we're learning

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.060 align:middle line:90%
on a rapidly increasing basis.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.760 align:middle line:84%
Things that we know, things
that we have available.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.820 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
I've considered myself

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.800 align:middle line:84%
over the years is
an instrument maker.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.150 align:middle line:84%
I like to make instruments that
are highly, highly sensitive

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.779 align:middle line:84%
and can see things that
we don't have instruments

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:17.890 align:middle line:90%
right now that can see.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.430 align:middle line:84%
I've made a lot of things in
the areas of remote viewing.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.320 align:middle line:84%
I made a lot of things
in the areas of locating,

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:33.920 align:middle line:84%
for example, aircraft
and for seeing entities.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And there are entities that
come here and observe us,

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.190 align:middle line:90%
and we can observe them.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: People are not going
to want that one to go by.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.714 align:middle line:84%
How do you see
entities with a device?

00:04:44.714 --> 00:04:46.630 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, I think
that's another show.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.720 align:middle line:84%
But you can see
them by temperature.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.460 align:middle line:84%
One of the areas I see
them mainly by is charge.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.630 align:middle line:84%
I have what I call
a charge telescope.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And I can see entities, as well
as I can see their conveyances.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Is the background
that your grandfather had

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.750 align:middle line:84%
as Nikola Tesla's lab assistant,
and then all your uncles

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.820 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, is
that part of how

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.150 align:middle line:84%
you got to understand
these subtle fields?

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.460 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Those
and anybody else

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.670 align:middle line:84%
I could study that
was intelligent.

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:18.710 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Or had
something that was new.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it, I found the
reasons why, and it wasn't what

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.320 align:middle line:90%
I thought.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it I
found were reasons

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.880 align:middle line:90%
that nobody seems to know about.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.370 align:middle line:84%
I know, for example, that
you take the gentleman that

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.890 align:middle line:84%
wrote the first field equations
in electromagnetic theory,

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.537 align:middle line:84%
and I went to his
laboratories in England--

00:05:43.537 --> 00:05:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You're talking
about James Clerk Maxwell?

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.150 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: James Clerk Maxwell.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And I went to his laboratories,
and they had almost everything

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.320 align:middle line:90%
he'd ever written on paper.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.220 align:middle line:84%
They'd collected a whole
large group of things.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.580 align:middle line:84%
I realized that
what we had read,

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.190 align:middle line:84%
what the average person
had available to read

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.100 align:middle line:84%
about James Clerk Maxwell
was 3% of what he did.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.080 align:middle line:84%
There were all kinds
of brilliant things.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.860 align:middle line:84%
But the things that he did
that they grabbed first

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:18.690 align:middle line:84%
were so brilliant that they
were whole centuries of study.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:24.080 align:middle line:84%
For example, all of our
electromagnetic communication--

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.900 align:middle line:84%
radio, television,
microwave-- is all

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.480 align:middle line:90%
based on Maxwell's theories.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And yet, to me, that was one of
the more uninteresting things

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:34.970 align:middle line:90%
that he did.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.511 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, let
me say this, Pete,

00:06:36.511 --> 00:06:39.200 align:middle line:84%
since you bring up
Maxwell, one of the really

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:44.480 align:middle line:84%
cool and interesting things that
I've read in terms of physics

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.190 align:middle line:84%
was people who were tearing
apart conventional science

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.830 align:middle line:90%
and showing alternatives.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.940 align:middle line:84%
They make the point
that Maxwell's equations

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.090 align:middle line:90%
are used widely.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:58.340 align:middle line:90%
We use them for electronics.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.040 align:middle line:84%
We use them for
radio communication.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Everybody accepts it,
because the technology works.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And yet, Maxwell's equations
postulate and require

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.040 align:middle line:84%
a field, which
supposedly Einstein

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.660 align:middle line:84%
said didn't exist when he came
up with the space-time fabric.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.720 align:middle line:84%
So this is this kind
of embarrassing thing

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.830 align:middle line:84%
where the Maxwell equations
are part of our world.

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.800 align:middle line:90%
But their field equations--

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.390 align:middle line:84%
when physicists say,
oh, well, those fields

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:28.190 align:middle line:90%
have been debunked.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:29.500 align:middle line:90%
They don't exist.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.880 align:middle line:84%
But the equations have
them right in there.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.130 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Einstein is has
a whole different subject.

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:38.650 align:middle line:90%


00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:43.610 align:middle line:84%
We read about Einstein, and
we get the E equal MC squared.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And we get the
work that he tried

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:49.520 align:middle line:84%
to do for years and years and
years and he wasn't able to do

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.960 align:middle line:90%
and others weren't able to do.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.600 align:middle line:84%
What Einstein got
his Nobel Prize for

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:58.610 align:middle line:84%
was the photoelectric theory,
and I wrote my first physics

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:03.440 align:middle line:84%
thesis in college on the
photoelectric theory.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, I
read all the things

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.660 align:middle line:84%
that were out there
about it instead

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.340 align:middle line:84%
of digging deeper and finding
the things that were about it

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.400 align:middle line:90%
that weren't out there.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And I heard a national public
radio show driving across

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:21.680 align:middle line:84%
the great Mojave Desert
one night with my wife,

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.930 align:middle line:84%
and we were listening
to national public radio

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.570 align:middle line:84%
show on Einstein and
the photoelectric theory

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:30.710 align:middle line:90%
that he got his Nobel Prize for.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And I had worked
with some scientists

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:37.280 align:middle line:84%
and some mathematicians
that had proven

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.129 align:middle line:84%
that virtually everything
that he said about E

00:08:40.129 --> 00:08:46.730 align:middle line:84%
equals MC squared had
no part in anything.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:48.540 align:middle line:90%
It was completely incorrect.

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:50.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, Pete, also,
in a previous episode,

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:55.040 align:middle line:84%
you'd mentioned that he
set the speed of light

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:58.137 align:middle line:84%
at a ceiling of 186,000
miles per second.

00:08:58.137 --> 00:08:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And you said something
I hadn't heard,

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.511 align:middle line:84%
which is that there's
French scientists who

00:09:01.511 --> 00:09:05.444 align:middle line:84%
have now seen it going as fast
as 660,000 miles per second.

00:09:05.444 --> 00:09:06.360 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Well, yes.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.600 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't seem to have a limit.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And French and Italians-- it
was first postulated, I think,

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:16.084 align:middle line:90%
by a Frenchman.

00:09:16.084 --> 00:09:17.750 align:middle line:84%
So there are a number
of them that have.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:22.670 align:middle line:84%
And it was because of the
flaws in measuring the speed

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:25.310 align:middle line:90%
of light way back when.

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And some of the experiments
were done for doing that.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:33.140 align:middle line:84%
Also, in the logic and
reasoning behind it.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And so there are a lot
of things that are being

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:37.940 align:middle line:90%
done in that area right now.

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:41.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing a bunch of work
with a brilliant, brilliant

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:45.130 align:middle line:84%
mathematician friend
in that field.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'm waiting for him
to publish his book on it,

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.860 align:middle line:84%
because it debunks
most of mathematics.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, let's get back to
this information for a second.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:10:00.340 align:middle line:84%
Because let's just say if
Einstein turns out to be wrong,

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:03.040 align:middle line:90%
if there is actually--

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.990 align:middle line:84%
or let's even say
it differently.

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:07.720 align:middle line:84%
Because I wrote
in "Source Field"

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.600 align:middle line:84%
that in Einstein's later
works that nobody, none

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.670 align:middle line:84%
of these skeptics,
talk about, he

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:16.120 align:middle line:84%
dispensed with the idea
of a space-time fabric.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And he said there has to
be some kind of medium

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:24.620 align:middle line:84%
that space and time
is acting within.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:29.380 align:middle line:84%
So if that is true, then how
could you divorce consciousness

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:30.220 align:middle line:90%
from that medium?

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.900 align:middle line:84%
They must, fundamentally,
be intertwined.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: No, you can't
separate consciousness.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:40.249 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is the
third, one of the three,

00:10:40.249 --> 00:10:41.290 align:middle line:90%
that I always talk about.

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:44.350 align:middle line:90%
There has to be three things--

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:47.740 align:middle line:84%
body, mind, and spirit;
Father, Son, Holy Ghost;

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.070 align:middle line:90%
volts, amps, and resistance.

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:50.954 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:10:50.954 --> 00:10:52.870 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And all these
things fit together.

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:55.730 align:middle line:84%
They fit within
Zhegalkin algebra,

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:59.350 align:middle line:84%
which tiles the entire
universe and everything in it

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:01.380 align:middle line:90%
with six-sided tiles.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.730 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere the tile
you have a junction,

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:06.190 align:middle line:90%
you have three things meeting.

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:08.440 align:middle line:90%
It's built like a soccer ball.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So that's a lot
for people to take in,

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:13.420 align:middle line:84%
but I understand
what you're saying.

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:15.700 align:middle line:84%
I've talked a lot on my
show "Wisdom Teachings"

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.100 align:middle line:90%
about sacred geometry.

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that I've gone into

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:24.770 align:middle line:84%
is Dr. Robert Moon
modeled the atom.

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:27.160 align:middle line:84%
He was one of the guys who
developed the Manhattan

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.500 align:middle line:90%
Project.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And he has gone in
and shown that protons

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:34.360 align:middle line:84%
in the nucleus of
the atom are actually

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.390 align:middle line:84%
the corners of
geometric forms that

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:39.040 align:middle line:90%
exist as like a standing wave.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:43.780 align:middle line:84%
So, in fact, we now
have a geometric rewrite

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:47.360 align:middle line:84%
of matter and
energy, in a sense.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And so what you're saying
is this Zhegalkin algebra

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:56.050 align:middle line:84%
works because the universe
itself is fundamentally

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:57.940 align:middle line:90%
geometric in nature.

00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.680 align:middle line:90%
It's all tiled, as you say.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.920 align:middle line:84%
The tiling means there's
a geometric structure that

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.910 align:middle line:90%
underlies reality.

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:05.780 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Right.

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:09.910 align:middle line:84%
A tripod holds
anything up, and it

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:13.300 align:middle line:84%
seems that it works
that way and everything.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't just
work in mechanics.

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:17.750 align:middle line:90%
It works in electronics.

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:19.090 align:middle line:90%
It works in hydraulics.

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:21.560 align:middle line:90%
It works in philosophy.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.510 align:middle line:84%
It works in speech
and linguistics.

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.260 align:middle line:90%
It works in everything.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And to you can't reference
something from one other thing.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:33.010 align:middle line:84%
You have to reference it
from two other things.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And all of Penrose's work
in tiling works this way.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I have at least two
or three episodes on Penrose

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:43.740 align:middle line:84%
tiling, which wouldn't have
happened if it wasn't for you

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:47.830 align:middle line:84%
telling me about this
hexagonal aspect of--

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:51.160 align:middle line:84%
or you know, the
junctions of three lines.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.630 align:middle line:84%
Anywhere you look, most
of the platonic solids,

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:54.430 align:middle line:90%
except for maybe--

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:57.010 align:middle line:90%


00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:58.930 align:middle line:84%
I guess the only
one that doesn't

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:00.640 align:middle line:90%
do it would be the octahedron.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.730 align:middle line:84%
But if you have the tetrahedron,
each corner of the tetrahedron

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:05.020 align:middle line:90%
is three lines.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:07.124 align:middle line:84%
Each corner of the
cube is three lines.

00:13:07.124 --> 00:13:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Each corner of the
icosahedron is three lines.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Each corner the dodecahedron
is three lines all

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:12.910 align:middle line:90%
coming together.

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:14.297 align:middle line:90%
So you're actually saying--

00:13:14.297 --> 00:13:15.880 align:middle line:84%
I believe what you're
saying, in part,

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.450 align:middle line:84%
is that if that geometric
structure underlies

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:24.400 align:middle line:84%
our reality, where most of
it is these geometries that

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:28.360 align:middle line:84%
have nexus points of three
lines coming together,

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:32.560 align:middle line:84%
then if we use a mathematical
system that harmonizes

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.804 align:middle line:84%
into three, then
all of a sudden,

00:13:34.804 --> 00:13:36.220 align:middle line:84%
everything's going
to work better.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.678 align:middle line:84%
Everything's going
to be a lot more

00:13:37.678 --> 00:13:41.830 align:middle line:84%
favorable when we start trying
to make geometric calculations.

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And the whole
entire field of mathematics

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.206 align:middle line:90%
works perfectly.

00:13:46.206 --> 00:13:47.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It's kind
of amazing that this

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:50.225 align:middle line:84%
would have been missed by
our mainstream scientists.

00:13:50.225 --> 00:13:52.600 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: It's stunning that
it would have been missed.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.058 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Do you think there's
some deliberate effort for it

00:13:55.058 --> 00:13:55.990 align:middle line:90%
not to be known?

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:57.850 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: I don't think that--

00:13:57.850 --> 00:13:59.710 align:middle line:84%
it's happened for so
long, I don't think

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:02.170 align:middle line:90%
that would have been possible.

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:05.390 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just
something that we missed.

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
something that we

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:17.380 align:middle line:84%
had back before the confusing
of man's mind by what

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.610 align:middle line:84%
we were talking about
in the last show

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:21.700 align:middle line:90%
in the Tower of Babel.

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And it was a different
type of confusing, I think,

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:27.410 align:middle line:90%
than we thought.

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:31.180 align:middle line:84%
I think it was a mathematical
confusing from a base three

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:32.320 align:middle line:90%
number system.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, it
does appear that we

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.370 align:middle line:84%
have a physical
gland in our bodies

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:40.090 align:middle line:84%
that gives us a link,
a physical link,

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:41.920 align:middle line:90%
to this informational world.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And that would be
the pineal gland.

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:46.660 align:middle line:90%
I've done a lot of work on that.

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.180 align:middle line:90%
It's in "Source Field."

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Talking about the idea
that, for example,

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:54.060 align:middle line:84%
the pineal gland is
about the size of a pea.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.120 align:middle line:90%
It sits inside your brain.

00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:00.330 align:middle line:84%
There's water in there
that has crystals in it.

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And then the entire
interior of the pineal gland

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.650 align:middle line:84%
is lined with cells that,
for all intents and purposes,

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:11.010 align:middle line:84%
are just like the rods and
cones in the retina of the eye.

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And they're wired into the
visual cortex of the brain

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:15.930 align:middle line:84%
with the same exact
type of wiring

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:17.582 align:middle line:84%
that we see coming
off of the eyes.

00:15:17.582 --> 00:15:18.540 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Absolutely.

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:21.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So why the
heck do you think

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.640 align:middle line:84%
this thing in the
middle of our brain

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.190 align:middle line:84%
is wired up exactly
like our other two

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:27.800 align:middle line:90%
eyes, the so-called third eye?

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:28.650 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:31.170 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: So that we
can see this third piece

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:34.140 align:middle line:84%
of information, that
makes information,

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.120 align:middle line:90%
that stabilizes it.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.070 align:middle line:90%
Two things are not stable.

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:43.660 align:middle line:84%
A two-legged stool
wiggles around,

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.960 align:middle line:84%
where a three-legged
stool is solid.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.410 align:middle line:84%
You have to have three
things for basing things on.

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:54.090 align:middle line:84%
And that holds throughout
all of the universe, which

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:55.585 align:middle line:90%
is shown by Zhegalkin algebra.

00:15:55.585 --> 00:15:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But somebody
is going to say--

00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:58.980 align:middle line:84%
and I've supplied
the answer for this,

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:01.250 align:middle line:84%
but I want to get
your take on it--

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:04.770 align:middle line:84%
OK, what the heck is this
retinal tissue seeing?

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:07.420 align:middle line:84%
It's dark in the
middle of your brain.

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.194 align:middle line:84%
What could it
possibly be seeing?

00:16:09.194 --> 00:16:10.485 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: That that's unseen.

00:16:10.485 --> 00:16:13.740 align:middle line:90%


00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:19.710 align:middle line:84%
This is the Taoist
answer for that.

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:22.030 align:middle line:90%
It's not seeing something.

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:25.620 align:middle line:90%
It's sensing it.

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And that particular sense,
it covers three other things.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:36.630 align:middle line:84%
It covers seeing, and not
seeing, and feeling or sensing.

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And so it's an extension
of the three things.

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:46.860 align:middle line:84%
It's the other end of the
third limb, if you would.

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:49.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you're
saying that, in some way,

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.380 align:middle line:84%
the water that's
inside the pineal gland

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:55.620 align:middle line:84%
is acting as a medium
for the unseen, which

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:59.760 align:middle line:84%
these retinal cells can
then pick up from somehow?

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: The water is
acting as a filter modulator,

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:09.420 align:middle line:84%
and then there are
sensors, other sensors,

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:15.390 align:middle line:84%
that sense those two things
mixed with a third thing

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:19.839 align:middle line:84%
to give it a third
point of reference.

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:24.960 align:middle line:84%
It's building another point
of reference that finishes off

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.097 align:middle line:90%
what the two others started.

00:17:27.097 --> 00:17:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I seem to remember
you telling me at some point

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:33.270 align:middle line:84%
that there was research that
was done that may or may not

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:35.200 align:middle line:90%
be public, I don't know.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.310 align:middle line:84%
You had said that in the
middle of the pineal gland

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:41.130 align:middle line:84%
that there's kind of
like a ring of sensors

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:43.890 align:middle line:84%
that are different than what
the rest of the pineal gland's

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:45.360 align:middle line:90%
interior has.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, there
are three types of sensors,

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:49.720 align:middle line:90%
and yes, they're there.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:53.800 align:middle line:84%
And they can recognize
things across space and time.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:57.150 align:middle line:84%
So with the advent
of the other two

00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:00.180 align:middle line:84%
as kind of holding
them in one place,

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.550 align:middle line:84%
than the place that
they go is the place

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:07.180 align:middle line:84%
that you couldn't go without
having a reference to it,

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:09.540 align:middle line:84%
but has the rest of
the three that it

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:11.310 align:middle line:90%
needs for a full reference.

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:14.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now, I've had about
five different insiders

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:20.070 align:middle line:84%
all independently tell me
that, apparently, Atlanteans

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:22.530 align:middle line:84%
or whoever it was,
we don't know,

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:27.750 align:middle line:84%
were able to build a much larger
version of the pineal gland

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:32.100 align:middle line:84%
as, like, a barrel of water
that was shaped the right way.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And that by hitting it with
certain energetic fields,

00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:37.740 align:middle line:84%
that they could duplicate some
of the pineal gland's effects,

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.050 align:middle line:84%
including being able
to see at a distance,

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:42.029 align:middle line:84%
and that this was
called looking glass.

00:18:42.029 --> 00:18:44.070 align:middle line:84%
So I'm wondering if you
know anything about that.

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:46.930 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I have
heard a lot about it.

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:52.260 align:middle line:84%
I haven't heard enough
about it to build one,

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.200 align:middle line:84%
and I've wanted to
do it for years.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: I'm sure.

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.765 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And I've
studied everything

00:18:56.765 --> 00:18:59.540 align:middle line:90%
I can find on it so far.

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:03.090 align:middle line:84%
There are places I haven't
yet had the ability to search,

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:05.700 align:middle line:84%
and there are experiments
that I haven't had the--

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:10.270 align:middle line:84%
I have the equipment now, but I
don't have a place to set it up

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:11.640 align:middle line:90%
to do the research on it.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:19.410 align:middle line:84%
But it's very much part of what
I call an informational field.

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:21.870 align:middle line:84%
It is one of the
informational fields.

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:24.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: When people go
into an astral body state,

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:27.750 align:middle line:84%
like astral
projection, they claim

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:31.410 align:middle line:84%
to be seeing, in many
cases, a silver cord, which

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:34.710 align:middle line:84%
appears to go from their
head in their astral body

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:38.890 align:middle line:84%
to what appears to be, in
many cases, their pineal gland

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:40.950 align:middle line:90%
in their physical body.

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:43.590 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
that silver cord is?

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:48.900 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I think it's
a visible connection

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:52.890 align:middle line:84%
for something that doesn't
have a physical basis.

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:56.130 align:middle line:84%
It's a connection
that's there, but we

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:58.950 align:middle line:84%
don't have a blood
vessel, a blood

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:04.790 align:middle line:84%
vein, a neural connection,
a piece of tissue that

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:05.590 align:middle line:90%
goes there.

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:08.210 align:middle line:90%
It goes there in a--

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:11.260 align:middle line:84%
well, I just call it
an informational body.

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.100 align:middle line:84%
It's built with information,
which may or may not

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.960 align:middle line:90%
have a mass structure.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:19.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now, I have
traced back through so many

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.090 align:middle line:90%
different ancient cultures.

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:25.490 align:middle line:84%
Pine cones all over the
world in ancient iconography.

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:27.360 align:middle line:90%
They're in Egyptian art.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:32.370 align:middle line:84%
They are in so many
different things.

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:36.810 align:middle line:84%
The pine cone appearing to be
a symbol of the pineal gland.

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:39.375 align:middle line:84%
It's on the pope's staff,
right below the cross.

00:20:39.375 --> 00:20:42.570 align:middle line:90%


00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:44.910 align:middle line:84%
There's a third
eye symbol at Mecca

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:47.070 align:middle line:84%
where the Kaaba
stone is located.

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:48.810 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: That's
a universal form.

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:52.440 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: So why do you
think this pineal gland

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.920 align:middle line:10%
is so widely known about?

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.220 align:middle line:10%
Do you think this came
from extraterrestrials?

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.519 align:middle line:90%
Or how did this pine cone--

00:20:58.519 --> 00:21:00.310 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I never
thought of it that way,

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:01.570 align:middle line:90%
and so I don't know.

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:07.630 align:middle line:84%
But it certainly was studied
by the mystics of the world.

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And it was studied by some
who perceived it through we

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:13.740 align:middle line:90%
would call psychic phenomena.

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:17.670 align:middle line:84%
It was perceived by some who
were more physical in nature

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:21.480 align:middle line:84%
and studied it because it was
there in physical phenomena.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's much like
this mathematics

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:26.700 align:middle line:84%
that I talk about,
where we're going

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:30.760 align:middle line:90%
to be changing the mathematics.

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:33.970 align:middle line:90%
It shows up everywhere.

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:37.200 align:middle line:84%
So there must be something
universal about it.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:42.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Even in terms of
more terrestrial phenomena,

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:47.250 align:middle line:84%
we have Dr. Paul Pearsall, who
has done some truly remarkable

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:51.030 align:middle line:84%
research, showing
the non-locality

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:56.310 align:middle line:84%
of mind, in which he has looked
at heart transplant recipients.

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And these people got a
heart from someone else.

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of a sudden,
they start craving mustard.

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:04.530 align:middle line:84%
Or somebody who was a total
prude becomes a sex fanatic.

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:06.316 align:middle line:84%
And then you find
out, oh, the guy

00:22:06.316 --> 00:22:08.190 align:middle line:84%
who had the heart before--
even though that's

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:10.320 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be
confidential, the guy

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.990 align:middle line:84%
who had the heart
before loved mustard.

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:18.280 align:middle line:84%
Or the guy who had the heart
before was a sex freak.

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:21.396 align:middle line:84%
Pearsall has done incredible--
a lifetime of work,

00:22:21.396 --> 00:22:22.770 align:middle line:84%
because he was a
heart transplant

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:25.860 align:middle line:84%
physician, in following
up on these things.

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And showing time
after time after time

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:32.850 align:middle line:84%
that really remarkable
specific personality attributes

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:35.430 align:middle line:84%
that we would think of
as a function of privacy

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:39.540 align:middle line:84%
and personal identity can be
transferred to someone else

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:41.940 align:middle line:90%
when you give them that heart.

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:44.250 align:middle line:84%
So how does this tie in with
your informational field

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:45.050 align:middle line:90%
theory?

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: They are
stored in the body

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:51.810 align:middle line:90%
in some different ways.

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And some account for different
types of things or feelings

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:01.700 align:middle line:90%
that we might have.

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:07.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's no mistake that
we think of Valentine's Day,

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:08.490 align:middle line:90%
we think of the heart.

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:12.540 align:middle line:84%
We think of love, we
think of the heart.

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:16.650 align:middle line:84%
The universal symbol
for love is the heart.

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:22.290 align:middle line:84%
There are connections that are
out there that are absolute.

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And they're the same for
animals and for people.

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.950 align:middle line:90%
They're rather amazing.

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:30.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What is going
on with the heart?

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.910 align:middle line:84%
I still don't
understand why a heart

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:34.924 align:middle line:90%
transplant is going to do this.

00:23:34.924 --> 00:23:36.840 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, because
the heart transplant

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:38.730 align:middle line:90%
has stored that information.

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:42.120 align:middle line:90%


00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.250 align:middle line:90%
You talk about mustard.

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:46.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can have people that
love mustard and people that

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:53.290 align:middle line:84%
don't like mustard, but it's
stored in the same location.

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And so there's another
thing that's involved in it.

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.900 align:middle line:90%
It may go one way or another.

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:03.720 align:middle line:84%
You look at it,
and it's a matrix,

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.720 align:middle line:84%
but it's a matrix of
triangles rather than a matrix

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:11.444 align:middle line:90%
of, say, cubes or squares.

00:24:11.444 --> 00:24:13.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You're saying
that, ultimately,

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:15.249 align:middle line:84%
this information itself
is stored in what

00:24:15.249 --> 00:24:17.040 align:middle line:84%
looks like triangles,
if you could actually

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.270 align:middle line:90%
see its structure?

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:22.020 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: No, it's that
the structure let's say

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:26.130 align:middle line:84%
mathematically, or
intuitively or--

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:28.860 align:middle line:90%
it's a subtle storage.

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:32.250 align:middle line:84%
But it's stored based
on three things.

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:35.220 align:middle line:84%
It gets its power from
being in all three.

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:38.010 align:middle line:84%
It's not an easy thing to talk
about, because it requires

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:39.480 align:middle line:90%
a whole new mathematics.

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, in
simpler terms, I

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:46.860 align:middle line:84%
remember you saying that if you
were to take a piece of heart

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:51.120 align:middle line:84%
tissue and hand it
to a brain surgeon,

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.560 align:middle line:84%
what would he
think, if he didn't

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:53.899 align:middle line:90%
know what he was looking at?

00:24:53.899 --> 00:24:55.440 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well,
hopefully, he would

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.250 align:middle line:90%
know what he was looking at.

00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:00.880 align:middle line:90%
And I can take a heart--

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:03.180 align:middle line:84%
I could teach him
to take a heart,

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:06.510 align:middle line:84%
take it apart into constituent
parts, and hand him apart,

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:09.250 align:middle line:84%
and he would look at it and
say, that's brain tissue.

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:10.050 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:12.120 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: No,
it's in the heart.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:15.600 align:middle line:84%
Comes from the heart,
but it's brain tissue.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And it has a very
interesting structure.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:25.830 align:middle line:84%
It's based on cholesterol,
and cholesterol,

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:28.980 align:middle line:84%
as we're just now
finding out in medicine,

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:31.900 align:middle line:84%
is absolutely critical
to a human being.

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Deprive them of the
cholesterol, you deprive them

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:39.690 align:middle line:90%
of 1/3 of their brain tissue.

00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Pineal, pituitary, the
heart, all these things

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:46.830 align:middle line:84%
are primarily made
out of this tissue.

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:47.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:49.980 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And it's the
part of the tissue that

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:53.430 align:middle line:84%
communicates over distance,
over time and distance.

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:55.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So are
you actually saying

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:58.170 align:middle line:84%
that if someone gets a heart
transplant, that they are also

00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:00.420 align:middle line:84%
getting some form of
a brain transplant?

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:01.680 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Exactly.

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And that brain has
information stored within it,

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:05.140 align:middle line:90%
in its tissue?

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: It has its
likes, its dislikes.

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:08.160 align:middle line:90%
It has its emotions.

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:10.860 align:middle line:90%
It has its love.

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:13.230 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
we did, we happened

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:18.720 align:middle line:84%
to have a friend that was
a very, very jealous woman.

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:23.750 align:middle line:84%
So we anesthetized the
tissue in her heart--

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:26.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: The tissue that
looks neurological in nature,

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:26.600 align:middle line:90%
you're saying?

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Well, no.

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:29.070 align:middle line:90%
All tissue looks neurological.

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:32.010 align:middle line:84%
It's the tissue in
her heart that that

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:34.530 align:middle line:90%
is based on cholesterol.

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:37.320 align:middle line:90%
So you anesthetized meaning--

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: We
anesthetized that tissue.

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:39.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: --the nerves
are not going to fire.

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:41.321 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Then,
we opened the door.

00:26:41.321 --> 00:26:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And out in the
hallway, there he was

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:51.270 align:middle line:84%
in the possession of
some tonsil licking,

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:55.200 align:middle line:84%
and she never thought
a thing of it.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.310 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:59.230 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Then we, the
next day, did the same thing.

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And we damn near had to have a
straight jacket and the police

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:04.470 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And we showed that the love,
if you want to call it that--

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:11.502 align:middle line:90%


00:27:11.502 --> 00:27:12.690 align:middle line:90%
which it wasn't love.

00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:16.180 align:middle line:84%
Had it been love, then there
wouldn't have been a problem.

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:19.280 align:middle line:84%
But the jealousy was
stored in the heart.

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:20.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And the desire
was stored in the heart.

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:26.930 align:middle line:84%
She wanted that man,
not somebody else.

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:31.090 align:middle line:84%
So what that says about
future medicine, I don't know.

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:35.480 align:middle line:84%
But it was very,
very interesting.

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:39.200 align:middle line:84%
So we found we found
things that we could give,

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:42.770 align:middle line:84%
herbal substances, that
would block a little of that.

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And she became un-jealous
enough to actually live

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:49.490 align:middle line:90%
with as a human being.

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Could you say what
those herbal substances are?

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:54.717 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I wouldn't off
the top of my head right now.

00:27:54.717 --> 00:27:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But your
research at the time

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:57.370 align:middle line:90%
determined what would be good?

00:27:57.370 --> 00:27:59.036 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, I
know that people are

00:27:59.036 --> 00:28:01.910 align:middle line:90%
working on the ultimate thing.

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there are five
or six different things that

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:10.560 align:middle line:90%
have the same molecules.

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And each one seems to work
a little bit differently.

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:17.550 align:middle line:84%
Like one might work on
physical attraction.

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:23.000 align:middle line:84%
One might work on amorous
or psychological attraction.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So if this is not only
just the idea of brain tissue,

00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:29.635 align:middle line:84%
but it's also some
kind of field effect--

00:28:29.635 --> 00:28:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: It is
a field effect.

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:33.384 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Then what's going on
when people hug each other?

00:28:33.384 --> 00:28:35.540 align:middle line:84%
Is there actually an
exchange between the hearts?

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:37.160 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Oh, yes, absolutely.

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.030 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: There is?

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:40.130 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: There's an
exchange, an amplification.

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:46.820 align:middle line:90%


00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:49.460 align:middle line:84%
I studied oriental
medicine for years.

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:52.760 align:middle line:84%
My wife was an oriental
medical doctor.

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And there are certain foods that
are used for love attractants.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And so she and I were
interested in that part of it.

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:03.560 align:middle line:90%
We studied it.

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And so what we found out was
that there were certain foods

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.720 align:middle line:90%
that you could eat.

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:15.430 align:middle line:84%
But what we found out
was without her knowing

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:18.920 align:middle line:84%
or without me knowing, and then
with several other couples that

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:24.590 align:middle line:84%
were acupuncturists or royal
medical doctor friends of hers,

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:29.990 align:middle line:84%
we found that without
much prompting,

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:32.090 align:middle line:90%
they would find out about this.

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And they would, without
any study of it,

00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:39.330 align:middle line:84%
start serving certain
foods to their husband

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:41.390 align:middle line:84%
to gain these feelings
that they wanted

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:44.880 align:middle line:90%
to get from their husband.

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And they would know which
foods because they'd eaten

00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:50.630 align:middle line:84%
them and they'd had
an internal sensing.

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:54.590 align:middle line:84%
So there's a whole set
of internal sensing

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:56.306 align:middle line:90%
that goes on with this.

00:29:56.306 --> 00:29:57.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What
happens in the case

00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:02.300 align:middle line:84%
of a baby that's just
being newly formed

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:05.230 align:middle line:84%
and the mother tending
to always cradle

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:06.560 align:middle line:90%
the baby next to her heart?

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.130 align:middle line:90%
What's going on there?

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:11.030 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, what's
going on there is interesting.

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:16.430 align:middle line:84%
If the baby is a preemie
and is put in a center

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:20.284 align:middle line:84%
to be kept separate
from the other babies--

00:30:20.284 --> 00:30:21.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: An incubator.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:26.020 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: An incubator
or similar type things.

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:28.910 align:middle line:84%
If that baby is kept in
there 12 to 14 weeks,

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:31.460 align:middle line:84%
it will very rarely
ever develop the ability

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:36.290 align:middle line:90%
to show love or have love.

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:41.340 align:middle line:84%
It needs the field, the
informational field--

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:43.760 align:middle line:90%
that's a measurable thing--

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:45.860 align:middle line:84%
that comes from
the mother's heart.

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:47.430 align:middle line:90%
It needs that field.

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:49.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Do you think
this is also why--

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:52.040 align:middle line:84%
and I've got the
research to prove this.

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:54.050 align:middle line:84%
There was an Indian
guy who wrote a book

00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:55.835 align:middle line:90%
about mind of scientist--

00:30:55.835 --> 00:30:58.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to think of his
name off the top of my head--

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:00.290 align:middle line:84%
in which one of the
many studies they

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:03.080 align:middle line:84%
had that was
phenomenal stuff was

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:06.350 align:middle line:84%
that if you take the
blastula, the developing

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:09.452 align:middle line:84%
zygote and embryo out
of a mother's womb,

00:31:09.452 --> 00:31:10.910 align:middle line:84%
even though it's
perfectly healthy,

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:13.580 align:middle line:84%
you put it in nutrient bath,
it gets everything it needs,

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:16.790 align:middle line:84%
it will never go
beyond about 80 cells.

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And then it just pauses
in its development.

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:20.360 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't go any further.

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And their conclusion--
Sava was the guy's name.

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:23.654 align:middle line:90%
Sava.

00:31:23.654 --> 00:31:25.070 align:middle line:84%
His conclusion was
that there must

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:28.040 align:middle line:84%
be some kind of fields
in the mother's womb

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:31.510 align:middle line:84%
that are actually telling
the embryo how to develop.

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:33.290 align:middle line:84%
So that when you take
it out of the womb,

00:31:33.290 --> 00:31:35.010 align:middle line:84%
it no longer has
that information.

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:36.840 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, it doesn't
develop properly.

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Even if you misshape
the mother's womb externally.

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I don't understand
what you're saying.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.790 align:middle line:90%
Misshape it?

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:47.005 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: The womb
has a particular shape.

00:31:47.005 --> 00:31:49.190 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I was just thinking
about this yesterday.

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:50.100 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:53.030 align:middle line:84%
Maybe because you were
going to bring it up today.

00:31:53.030 --> 00:32:02.810 align:middle line:84%
But on the island of
Okinawa, all the burial tombs

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:05.030 align:middle line:90%
are shaped like a womb.

00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:07.430 align:middle line:84%
Stylized, but they're
shaped as a womb.

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:11.120 align:middle line:84%
It was found out from
someone independently--

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:15.140 align:middle line:90%
I read in a different place--

00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:22.170 align:middle line:84%
that when you change
that stylized shape

00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:25.770 align:middle line:84%
while the baby's in the womb,
there's certain developments

00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:26.760 align:middle line:90%
won't happen.

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:28.625 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, really?

00:32:28.625 --> 00:32:30.000 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And
most of them have

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.060 align:middle line:84%
to do with affection,
attraction, love,

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:39.390 align:middle line:84%
being a mean person
or a loving person.

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:43.550 align:middle line:84%
Many of those things change
just from the shape of the womb.

00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:46.360 align:middle line:84%
There are several diseases that
misshape the womb slightly,

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:50.040 align:middle line:84%
and they have all kinds of
problems with those people.

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, this gets into a
really interesting thing, which

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.234 align:middle line:90%
maybe is too geeky for you guys.

00:32:55.234 --> 00:32:57.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, but I'm
going to give it to you.

00:32:57.150 --> 00:32:58.500 align:middle line:90%
We'll see what we can do here.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.320 align:middle line:90%
Projective geometry.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:03.240 align:middle line:84%
It's a very interesting
science in which

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.710 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at
two intersecting

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:08.520 align:middle line:84%
counter-rotating
fields, which could be

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:11.070 align:middle line:90%
considered different realities.

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And then, the
projective geometry

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:16.380 align:middle line:84%
means that you project
how they interact.

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And what that does is it creates
what's called a path curve.

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And the ideal shape
for two matrices

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.400 align:middle line:84%
of two alternate realities
intersecting and creating

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:30.360 align:middle line:84%
a path curve, the ideal form
that that takes is the egg.

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:31.740 align:middle line:90%
Just like the chicken egg.

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:33.300 align:middle line:90%
Just like the pineal gland.

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:34.860 align:middle line:90%
Just like the womb.

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:36.540 align:middle line:84%
It appears that that
shape is somehow

00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:40.740 align:middle line:84%
capturing two realities that
counter-rotate together.

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:43.770 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: It's a whole science
that's not been explored,

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:45.360 align:middle line:90%
as best I can tell.

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:48.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, on the other
hand, there are

00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:51.650 align:middle line:84%
schools of oriental
medical thought

00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:53.160 align:middle line:90%
where this is taken care of.

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And also, in our Ayurvedic
medicine, in some places,

00:33:57.510 --> 00:34:05.290 align:middle line:84%
it's taken into account, and
massive results occur from.

00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:06.940 align:middle line:90%
Massive changes occur.

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:09.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: As in like healing
of problems in the body?

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:16.030 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Healing of,
usually, future problems.

00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:18.760 align:middle line:84%
Healing of relationships
is another one.

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:22.989 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you're saying
that if the womb is not shaped

00:34:22.989 --> 00:34:27.429 align:middle line:84%
properly, that perhaps
this alternate reality

00:34:27.429 --> 00:34:29.980 align:middle line:84%
that we're interfacing
with, that the normal path

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:32.139 align:middle line:84%
curve of the egg
shape of the womb

00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:34.764 align:middle line:84%
would be capturing that energy,
thus leading to a loving

00:34:34.764 --> 00:34:35.889 align:middle line:90%
consciousness in the being.

00:34:35.889 --> 00:34:38.170 align:middle line:84%
But maybe that's not
happening now as much.

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:41.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: There's
an informational form

00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:48.610 align:middle line:84%
that takes place over
time that acts over time

00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:51.370 align:middle line:90%
that's based on these shapes.

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's some of the
best research going

00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:59.380 align:middle line:84%
on in that area now is research
and things where people have

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:03.070 align:middle line:84%
natural misshapes
like, for example,

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:07.200 align:middle line:84%
down syndrome and
this new disease

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.520 align:middle line:84%
that we're now talking
about that's going around.

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:10.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Zika.

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Zika.

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that it changes
the shape of the skull.

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:19.360 align:middle line:84%
It changes the shape of
the pineal, the pituitary.

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Changes the shape of a
number of other things.

00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:25.900 align:middle line:84%
I've just heard
about this, so I've

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:28.450 align:middle line:84%
asked for some
information on what

00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:31.480 align:middle line:84%
seems to happen on the
shape of the glands

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:35.920 align:middle line:84%
that I know that
contain organs that

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:40.360 align:middle line:84%
fit within this thing, which
is the pineal, pituitary,

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:50.300 align:middle line:84%
the actual pituitary gland,
the heart, and the shape

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:51.100 align:middle line:90%
of the heart.

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:52.890 align:middle line:84%
There are people that
have hearts that are

00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:55.230 align:middle line:90%
left-handed and right-handed.

00:35:55.230 --> 00:36:00.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, as another example,
almost all warring governments

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:02.860 align:middle line:90%
have what they call wet workers.

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:06.180 align:middle line:84%
They have people that
they find are very

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:08.010 align:middle line:90%
easy to train as assassins.

00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:10.606 align:middle line:90%


00:36:10.606 --> 00:36:14.292 align:middle line:84%
A lot of that going on
in the Middle East now.

00:36:14.292 --> 00:36:16.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Why are they
called wet workers?

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.234 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Just people
that are assassins.

00:36:20.234 --> 00:36:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So wet meaning like
the blood that they generate?

00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I have no idea
why they call it that.

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:25.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: OK, but that's
what they're called?

00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:26.975 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: That's
what they're called.

00:36:26.975 --> 00:36:28.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Anyway, it
turns out that if they

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:38.190 align:middle line:84%
have been not nurtured
to the mother's breast,

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:41.190 align:middle line:84%
if they don't have
that connection,

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:48.030 align:middle line:84%
they're people that grow
up mean, naturally mean.

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:53.340 align:middle line:84%
They don't seem to have an
ethical basis whatsoever.

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And they're picked out, and
have been for centuries,

00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:59.880 align:middle line:90%
by societies for assassins.

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:03.280 align:middle line:84%
They don't have a feeling
about it one way or the other.

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:05.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Let's talk a
little bit about how

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:08.430 align:middle line:84%
some of these things
that you discovered

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:11.760 align:middle line:84%
were then able to be
turned into technology.

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's a huge
subject, and we don't have

00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:15.400 align:middle line:90%
very much time in this episode.

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.432 align:middle line:84%
So maybe, for right
now, you can just

00:37:17.432 --> 00:37:19.140 align:middle line:84%
give us an overview
of some of the things

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:20.520 align:middle line:90%
that you invented based on this?

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:22.019 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll get
more of it later.

00:37:22.019 --> 00:37:24.150 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I built
some diagnostic machines

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:25.020 align:middle line:90%
based on that.

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:27.690 align:middle line:84%
I built some treatment
machines based on it.

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Diagnostic machines are
easy to build legally,

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:33.060 align:middle line:84%
and treatment
machines are almost

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:35.040 align:middle line:90%
impossible to build legally.

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:38.880 align:middle line:84%
Because the whole medical
profession, in my opinion,

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:42.260 align:middle line:84%
is afraid you're going to treat
someone and get them well.

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:45.540 align:middle line:90%


00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:48.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have to look at the
American Medical Association.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Up until the 1950s, it was
called the American Medical

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:55.530 align:middle line:84%
Association-- a trade
union for doctors.

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:56.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:37:56.610 --> 00:37:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: It was
designed only to make

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:01.050 align:middle line:90%
the doctors more wealthy.

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:03.420 align:middle line:84%
You look at a lot of
the medications today.

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:06.510 align:middle line:84%
We don't have medications
for treating many diseases,

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:09.870 align:middle line:84%
where we have thousands
of medications,

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:12.720 align:middle line:84%
or hundreds of very
powerful medications,

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.520 align:middle line:90%
for treating the symptoms.

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, to get back
to Wilhelm Reich, which

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:19.890 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned a
little bit before, I

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:21.690 align:middle line:90%
did a whole mini series on him.

00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And he had this very
simple orgone box,

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:27.480 align:middle line:84%
which appeared to be
just a combination

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:29.940 align:middle line:84%
of inorganic and organic
materials in layers,

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:32.910 align:middle line:84%
like you might have
foil and then wool.

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And you just put
somebody inside that box.

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And he was claiming that he was
getting remarkable healings,

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:40.860 align:middle line:90%
even from things like cancer.

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:43.380 align:middle line:84%
Is that an example
of a treatment?

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:47.100 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: That's an
example of a treatment.

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:52.800 align:middle line:84%
I was not particularly
enamored with his work in that.

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:58.080 align:middle line:84%
But after practicing
it with baby squirrels,

00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:01.390 align:middle line:84%
I found out that
there was a lot to it.

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And I have not been able
to go further than that.

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:08.280 align:middle line:84%
But there are a number
of different groups--

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:10.350 align:middle line:84%
in France, there's
a couple of groups

00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:13.740 align:middle line:84%
that have done a lot of
research in that area

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:17.740 align:middle line:84%
and have done a lot
of good in that area.

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And there are a
number of other things

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.310 align:middle line:84%
that they've done
over there that

00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:27.180 align:middle line:84%
were more toward
treating the illness

00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:29.250 align:middle line:84%
rather than treating
the symptom.

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:32.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What do you think about
the practice of sun gazing,

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:35.634 align:middle line:84%
where some people claim that
if you look at the sun--

00:39:35.634 --> 00:39:37.800 align:middle line:84%
and we don't advocate this,
because you could really

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:38.640 align:middle line:90%
damage your retinas.

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:41.550 align:middle line:84%
But the idea of looking
at the sun right as it's

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:46.677 align:middle line:84%
setting and getting some sort
of energetic benefit from that.

00:39:46.677 --> 00:39:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Anything
you'd get from the sun,

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:52.470 align:middle line:84%
you'd get with absolutely
dark glasses on,

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:56.170 align:middle line:84%
would be electromagnetic
in nature.

00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:59.070 align:middle line:84%
You'd probably get it, but
people that do sun gazing they

00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:02.010 align:middle line:90%
call blind.

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:05.119 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, but these
fields exist in nature.

00:40:05.119 --> 00:40:06.660 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that everybody here

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:10.800 align:middle line:84%
is familiar with, incredible
Russian research into pyramids.

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And that just this structure
that stands there and doesn't

00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:17.730 align:middle line:84%
have any moving parts,
we're curing cancer,

00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:21.510 align:middle line:84%
we're curing diabetes, we're
curing all the illnesses.

00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:24.630 align:middle line:84%
There's something about
that structure harnessing

00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:25.710 align:middle line:90%
certain energy.

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: There are
a number of structures.

00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:30.240 align:middle line:90%
Each does something different.

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.590 align:middle line:90%
And yes, the structure is--

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:37.890 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned the universe
of threes and sixes.

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Each of those
structures is something

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:44.310 align:middle line:84%
that gives what's happening
something else to anchor

00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:48.210 align:middle line:84%
to anchor to it in a
manner such that it

00:40:48.210 --> 00:40:50.330 align:middle line:90%
will do something positive.

00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:53.730 align:middle line:84%
I've found that there are
many, many plants that

00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:56.040 align:middle line:84%
will kill, the
toxicity will kill,

00:40:56.040 --> 00:41:00.780 align:middle line:84%
or many plants that the
non-toxicity will heal.

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:03.670 align:middle line:84%
But there are also many plants
that the toxicity will heal.

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:05.250 align:middle line:90%
Like I'm taking rat poison.

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:09.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm taking belladonna for
diabetic complications.

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:10.980 align:middle line:90%
People don't die of diabetes.

00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:12.600 align:middle line:90%
They die of other complications.

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:14.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Rat poison
meaning warfarin?

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.980 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Warfarin, yeah.

00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:21.420 align:middle line:84%
There are structures--
and this is

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:25.680 align:middle line:84%
part of what comes out,
again, in these three things.

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:29.720 align:middle line:84%
You may have a neurological
tie, an electrical tie,

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:31.410 align:middle line:90%
a chemical tie.

00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And then, up at the
top, you might have

00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:36.390 align:middle line:90%
a physical structural type.

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:39.420 align:middle line:84%
For example, in Chinese
and Tibetan medicine,

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:45.180 align:middle line:84%
a lot of things are healed
by just a diagram, a yantra,

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:49.650 align:middle line:84%
or a picture, or a
piece of writing,

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:51.990 align:middle line:90%
something that's written.

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:54.630 align:middle line:84%
In the science of radionics,
which is a science,

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:57.450 align:middle line:84%
many people are healed
by a witness, which

00:41:57.450 --> 00:42:01.980 align:middle line:84%
may be the person's signature
or their initials or their date

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:08.140 align:middle line:84%
or their birth date or
their date of a problem.

00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot
of healings that

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:16.630 align:middle line:84%
are done in Tibetan medicine
that are genuine healings.

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:18.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the people
have a problem.

00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:20.670 align:middle line:90%
Now they don't have a problem.

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:23.745 align:middle line:84%
And they went to
the local doctor,

00:42:23.745 --> 00:42:25.620 align:middle line:84%
and the doctor didn't
have anything for them.

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:27.328 align:middle line:84%
And they went to a
priest, and the priest

00:42:27.328 --> 00:42:30.760 align:middle line:84%
said, here, take this symbol
and carry it in your pocket.

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:36.687 align:middle line:84%
Or look at it each day
lit by the bright sun.

00:42:36.687 --> 00:42:38.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So I think
what you're saying here,

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Pete, is that this
intrinsic consciousness

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:46.410 align:middle line:84%
that the universe is
ultimately made of

00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:48.570 align:middle line:84%
has a lot more to offer
us than what we're

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:51.750 align:middle line:90%
using right now in the world.

00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:53.440 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: We tend
to be very physical.

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:56.250 align:middle line:84%
We want to use chemicals
to make us well.

00:42:56.250 --> 00:43:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And many times,
a hug will do it.

00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:02.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, that's all
the time we have for--

00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:04.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host,
David Wilcock, here

00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:07.020 align:middle line:84%
with Pete Peterson,
our special guest.

00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And as always, I thank
you for watching.

00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:12.140 align:middle line:90%
