00:00:19.735 --> 00:00:20.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID WILCOCK: All right.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.090 align:middle line:10%
Welcome to "Disclosure."

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.770 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host,
David Wilcock, and I

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.250 align:middle line:10%
am very excited to bring you Dr.
Pete Peterson today, in which

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.049 align:middle line:10%
we are going to get into the
secret history of classified

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:33.100 align:middle line:10%
computer chips.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And what you're going
to learn in this episode

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.560 align:middle line:84%
is one of the main
reasons why insiders

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.030 align:middle line:84%
have said that the technology
level in the classified world

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.380 align:middle line:84%
could be 20, 50, or even
hundreds of years ahead

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.540 align:middle line:84%
of what we have out
there in the open world.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.600 align:middle line:84%
It's truly fascinating
information.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And here to share it
with us is Pete Peterson,

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.580 align:middle line:84%
who is arguably one of
the most significant

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.550 align:middle line:84%
technological figures in
the world of black ops.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.337 align:middle line:84%
So Pete, welcome
back to the show.

00:01:02.337 --> 00:01:03.670 align:middle line:90%
>>PETE PETERSON: Thank you much.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.690 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: This business of
computer technology potentially

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.410 align:middle line:10%
being much better in
the classified world

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.380 align:middle line:10%
than what's out
there now may seem

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.480 align:middle line:10%
unbelievable to some people.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.010 align:middle line:84%
But before we get
into this, I just

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.960 align:middle line:84%
want to say that you
have introduced me

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.200 align:middle line:84%
to several people who
are aware of your chip

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.700 align:middle line:84%
and who have
independently confirmed

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.980 align:middle line:84%
to me how powerful it is and
that it really does work.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And in some cases, they're
working on the software for it.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.280 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well,
that's correct.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.060 align:middle line:84%
I can't take full
credit for the chip,

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:44.260 align:middle line:84%
but I have marshaled it
for various organizations--

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.090 align:middle line:90%
I'll just leave it at that--

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.020 align:middle line:84%
who were good
people, white hats.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And I saw that there was a
computer language some years

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.720 align:middle line:84%
ago in the early '70s, at
least when I got into it.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, I was
studying under a gentleman

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.449 align:middle line:84%
by name of Chuck Peddle, who was
responsible for the chip that

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:14.140 align:middle line:84%
became the Apple
2, and the Atari,

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.760 align:middle line:84%
and the Commodore
64, and et cetera.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.890 align:middle line:84%
I consider it the first
chip that was actually

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.700 align:middle line:90%
designed to be a computer chip.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.060 align:middle line:90%
Intel's chip was designed to--

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.450 align:middle line:84%
and I was involved a
small amount in that

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.980 align:middle line:90%
from a higher level.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And it was designed
to be a chip that

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.280 align:middle line:90%
ran an intelligent terminal.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And it was way
too slow for that,

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.260 align:middle line:90%
so it never did really take on.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And then a computer
hobbyist down in Arizona

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.460 align:middle line:84%
made it into a kit,
a computer kit,

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:02.830 align:middle line:84%
and it worked similar to
the very early things that

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.070 align:middle line:84%
were going on in those days
before there were actually

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.860 align:middle line:84%
microprocessor chips
out in the world.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Were you trained
by some of these instructors

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.770 align:middle line:84%
that you had in
computer technology?

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.690 align:middle line:84%
Did you have a background
in understanding how

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:17.995 align:middle line:90%
computers work and all that?

00:03:17.995 --> 00:03:18.795 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: No.

00:03:18.795 --> 00:03:22.770 align:middle line:84%
As with many things,
the government

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.730 align:middle line:84%
wanted me to
understand computers,

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.820 align:middle line:84%
and so they put me with
people that designed chips.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And then they put
me with some people

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.760 align:middle line:84%
that were, very
early on, making what

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.320 align:middle line:84%
are called high-level computer
languages, like BASIC.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.910 align:middle line:84%
It's really a
high-level language,

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.610 align:middle line:84%
but it's higher
than the language

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.362 align:middle line:84%
you write for the hardware
that's inside the chip.

00:03:46.362 --> 00:03:48.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now, you
mentioned Chuck Peddle.

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.860 align:middle line:84%
Was he the first computer expert
that you worked with, or were

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.270 align:middle line:90%
there others before him?

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: There were
a few others before him.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.720 align:middle line:84%
But these were all on what were
called bit slice computers,

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.060 align:middle line:90%
PDP-8s.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.540 align:middle line:84%
The Russians have done just
about everything with a PDP-8

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.720 align:middle line:84%
that we can do with all the
different computers we've

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.520 align:middle line:90%
come up with.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.520 align:middle line:84%
That was a very early chip by
Digital Equipment Corporation,

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.320 align:middle line:90%
or DEC.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Is PDP-8 like
a punch card computer?

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.519 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: It started
out punch card.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.160 align:middle line:84%
It has some switches
on the front of it

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.585 align:middle line:84%
that look like
tongue depressors.

00:04:26.585 --> 00:04:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I remember
being a little kid,

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.600 align:middle line:84%
and my mom had a job at General
Electric where she worked

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.430 align:middle line:90%
on a punch card computer.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And in my closet, I
found some of the cards.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And I remember being
really puzzled by this.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.060 align:middle line:84%
It was like thin
cardboard, and there

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.780 align:middle line:84%
were a lot of little
rectangular cut-outs on it.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.210 align:middle line:84%
Those cards were intended to
have computer programs on them

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.010 align:middle line:90%
of some kind?

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.843 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, that's
how you programmed.

00:04:49.843 --> 00:04:56.620 align:middle line:84%
You had a little piece
of sponge material,

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.570 align:middle line:84%
and you set the card
on the sponge material,

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.420 align:middle line:84%
and then you had a
little plastic stick

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.240 align:middle line:90%
with a little square.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.420 align:middle line:84%
There were punches in the
card, but they weren't

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.669 align:middle line:90%
punched all the way out.

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:10.210 align:middle line:84%
They were punched
so it would be easy

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.540 align:middle line:90%
for you to hit it and punch a--

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.690 align:middle line:90%
they called them chaff--

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.470 align:middle line:90%
loose.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And you'd set it on
this sponge material,

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.330 align:middle line:84%
like a very thin brillo
pad-- brillo sponge.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And you could go down and
punch out certain numbers.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:30.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, you mentioned Chuck
Peddle, you mentioned

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.660 align:middle line:84%
that this chip that
he had developed

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.970 align:middle line:84%
became commonly
used in the Apple,

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.090 align:middle line:84%
the Commodore 64,
Atari, et cetera.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.210 align:middle line:90%


00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Because what we're
leading up to--

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.108 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want to spend too
much time talking about stuff

00:05:47.108 --> 00:05:49.510 align:middle line:90%
that's already well-known.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.800 align:middle line:84%
When did you start to find
out about the possibility

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.560 align:middle line:84%
of building a computer chip
that might be much more

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.540 align:middle line:84%
powerful than
anything that we even

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.360 align:middle line:90%
have now in the open world?

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, the
association that I had--

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.340 align:middle line:84%
a very minor association
that I had with a fellow

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:15.190 align:middle line:84%
by name of Chuck Moore, who
wrote a computer operating

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.470 align:middle line:90%
system called Forth--

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.960 align:middle line:84%
F-O-R-T-H. It would
have been F-O-U-R-T-H,

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.340 align:middle line:84%
but we didn't have enough bits
in the systems at that time

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.140 align:middle line:90%
to put the U in.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:31.660 align:middle line:84%
So it was just F-O-R-T-H. And
he built it to run the telescope

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.200 align:middle line:84%
at the Kitt Peak
Observatory down in Arizona.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And he had a very
bright young lady

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.590 align:middle line:84%
that was working with him by
the name Elizabeth Rather.

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.500 align:middle line:84%
She still, as far as I
know, has a company called

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.290 align:middle line:90%
Forth Incorporated.

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And then I was also
working with my cousin, who

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.700 align:middle line:84%
we were working on the
gas chromatographic mass

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.570 align:middle line:84%
spectrometer and computer system
that went on the Viking Lander.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.370 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, OK.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And at a company
called Universal Monitor.

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And he had a couple
of Forth geniuses

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.720 align:middle line:90%
that were working for him.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:12.580 align:middle line:84%
Forth was just
new as a language.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, it
was a read only language.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And when you wrote in it, it was
hard to go back and look at it

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:21.700 align:middle line:84%
and determine what
you actually--

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.840 align:middle line:90%
how it was actually working.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.100 align:middle line:84%
So they called it a
read only language.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And later on, other
not nearly so powerful

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:39.320 align:middle line:84%
languages allowed you to write
in a higher-level language

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.080 align:middle line:84%
and read in a
higher-level language,

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.140 align:middle line:84%
and it made it
easier to program,

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:47.357 align:middle line:84%
but nothing ever as powerful
and as fast as Forth.

00:07:47.357 --> 00:07:48.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: One of the
things you told me

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.310 align:middle line:84%
which follows up with what
you just said-- and I just

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:53.846 align:middle line:84%
want to make this
statement without getting

00:07:53.846 --> 00:07:56.470 align:middle line:84%
into a lot of detail because we
don't want to lose our viewers.

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:59.620 align:middle line:84%
I know you're extremely
knowledgeable on all this stuff

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:02.140 align:middle line:90%
because you designed the chip.

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.800 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking to
a scientific audience.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.220 align:middle line:84%
But anyway-- they appreciate
some of this stuff,

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:12.640 align:middle line:84%
but if we get too technical,
we're going to lose people.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.720 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
you told me off camera

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.540 align:middle line:84%
in previous conversations
we've had over the years

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:23.200 align:middle line:84%
is that if our
computers had gone

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.590 align:middle line:84%
in the direction of using
Forth instead of the languages

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:30.520 align:middle line:84%
that they're actually using even
now, that they would be vastly

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.900 align:middle line:90%
faster and more powerful.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.809 align:middle line:84%
So would you say that
all the stuff that we've

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:38.230 align:middle line:84%
done with computers
up until now was

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:41.200 align:middle line:84%
based on some original software
that was never intended

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.546 align:middle line:90%
to be used in a fast machine?

00:08:42.546 --> 00:08:44.920 align:middle line:84%
They didn't realize where this
was going to end up going?

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.280 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, I personally
think that Chuck Moore

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.240 align:middle line:90%
knew all the time.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:54.330 align:middle line:84%
But it was designed to do
some very complex operations.

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.750 align:middle line:84%
It was a very good
chip for robotics.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:58.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: What was?

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:00.820 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well,
the Forth language

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.890 align:middle line:84%
was a good language for
robotics-- very simple,

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:05.170 align:middle line:90%
very easy to write.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:08.530 align:middle line:84%
And it has some
limitations that way,

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:11.480 align:middle line:84%
but those have
mostly been overcome.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:16.870 align:middle line:90%
And Russia has probably--

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't know off
the top of my head,

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.700 align:middle line:84%
but I would think
probably 75% to 80%

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.850 align:middle line:84%
of all Russian programming
is done in Forth.

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:29.720 align:middle line:84%
I know that I'm a member of
one of the Russian astronautics

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.910 align:middle line:84%
associations, and I know
that their programming

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:37.630 align:middle line:84%
is done almost entirely
in Forth because it's

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:42.820 align:middle line:84%
perfect for that kind of
operation, robotic operation.

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So I think one of the
stumbling blocks that somebody

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:47.060 align:middle line:90%
watching this show might have--

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.260 align:middle line:84%
so let's try to get into this
now for a little bit-- is

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.330 align:middle line:84%
somebody is going to be
there at home thinking

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:54.220 align:middle line:84%
that they're the highly
intelligent skeptic,

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:55.569 align:middle line:90%
that they're smarter than you.

00:09:55.569 --> 00:09:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And what they're going to
be saying in their mind

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:02.200 align:middle line:84%
is Pete is a fraud because we
know that chips are printed

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.650 align:middle line:84%
on silicon, that there's
only so many processors you

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:08.740 align:middle line:84%
can cram onto one chip
before it overheats.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:11.020 align:middle line:84%
You can only get to so
many speeds of megahertz

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:14.650 align:middle line:90%
before you can't go any farther.

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:16.930 align:middle line:84%
How could this guy
say that he's designed

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:19.650 align:middle line:84%
a chip back in the
'70s or whenever

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.500 align:middle line:84%
that was vastly more powerful
than what we even have now?

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.630 align:middle line:90%
This guy is a crazy old man.

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Unfortunately,
that's not a thing that I say.

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't say that
back then it was.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:34.710 align:middle line:84%
I say the chips today are more
powerful by far than anything

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:36.360 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And there's one chip that does
about 86 billion operations

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:43.500 align:middle line:90%
per second.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So Pete,
the fastest computers

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:49.950 align:middle line:84%
that people are using
now have processors

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:54.150 align:middle line:84%
that would be somewhere usually
between 2.1 gigahertz to 3.5

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.130 align:middle line:90%
gigahertz in speed.

00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And when you say that
you're dealing with billions

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.920 align:middle line:84%
of operations per
second, could you just

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.020 align:middle line:84%
give us a very
generic statement?

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:10.650 align:middle line:84%
Is that is that 10 times more
powerful than a typical chip?

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:13.150 align:middle line:84%
Is that 100 times more
powerful than a typical chip

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:13.950 align:middle line:90%
that we have now?

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:17.700 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, right now,
what we're working with is

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:18.690 align:middle line:90%
probably--

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:22.140 align:middle line:84%
if you take the
2 and 3 gigahertz

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:26.340 align:middle line:84%
chips that are out there,
most of them have four cores,

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:29.400 align:middle line:90%
or some have eight cores now.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.266 align:middle line:84%
The chip I'm working
with now has 144 cores.

00:11:33.266 --> 00:11:34.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: On one chip?

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:35.190 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: On one chip.

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:38.070 align:middle line:84%
The chip is about a
tenth of an inch square,

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.620 align:middle line:84%
so it's not like
these big chips.

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.500 align:middle line:90%
It runs on very, very low power.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.230 align:middle line:90%
It can run at--

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:50.370 align:middle line:90%
one of the chips one of the--

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:53.260 align:middle line:84%
one of the cores on
one of the new chips

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.520 align:middle line:84%
will take 5 to 10
times as much power

00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.810 align:middle line:84%
as all 144 cores
on the small chip.

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And then it's the way the
software and the chips

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:07.830 align:middle line:84%
work together that
around the outside,

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:12.780 align:middle line:84%
they're in a matrix,
an xy matrix,

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:16.350 align:middle line:90%
like ice cubes in a tray.

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:19.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So would it be like a
matrix of 12 by 12 for the 144?

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: No,
it's not 12 by 12.

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:24.700 align:middle line:90%
There are reasons for that.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:28.200 align:middle line:90%
But it comes up to 144.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And the chips can
run concurrently,

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.790 align:middle line:84%
they can run individually,
and they can run together.

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.910 align:middle line:84%
You can say, well, these
five chips go do this,

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:44.670 align:middle line:84%
these two chips go do that, and
maybe this one chip does this.

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:46.800 align:middle line:90%
And you try to--

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:52.530 align:middle line:84%
the software after you write
it looks at itself and decides,

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:57.000 align:middle line:84%
if I ran this project with
three chips and this project

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.530 align:middle line:84%
with six chips, they would
both finish about the same time

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:03.220 align:middle line:90%
doing very different things.

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:09.330 align:middle line:84%
For example, in a
cell phone computer,

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.880 align:middle line:84%
one chip is doing
graphics work and writing

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.860 align:middle line:90%
the picture on the screen.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:18.330 align:middle line:84%
One chip is converting
that from things

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.340 align:middle line:90%
that have been transmitted.

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:25.320 align:middle line:84%
One chip is making the
sound, or two chips

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:29.160 align:middle line:90%
are making the stereo sound.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You told
me at one point

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.270 align:middle line:84%
when we were talking
about this chip

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:39.810 align:middle line:84%
that 85% of all the components
in a modern smartphone

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:41.670 align:middle line:84%
could be eliminated,
and they could all

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:43.734 align:middle line:90%
be put into one of these chips.

00:13:43.734 --> 00:13:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And how much of
the chip would you

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:48.581 align:middle line:90%
have leftover if you did that?

00:13:48.581 --> 00:13:50.865 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Depending on
what smartphone, probably

00:13:50.865 --> 00:13:52.740 align:middle line:90%
as much as 90%.

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:54.990 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And how much faster is
this chip, do you think?

00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:00.885 align:middle line:84%
At the billions of
operations per second

00:14:00.885 --> 00:14:02.260 align:middle line:84%
you mentioned,
how much faster is

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:03.469 align:middle line:90%
it than what's out there now?

00:14:03.469 --> 00:14:05.301 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, there
are things out there

00:14:05.301 --> 00:14:06.970 align:middle line:84%
that are as fast,
but the problem

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:10.510 align:middle line:84%
is that they're running
much, much more software

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:13.440 align:middle line:84%
code in order to
accomplish the same task.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.740 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:16.784 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: So it's
one of the things

00:14:16.784 --> 00:14:18.700 align:middle line:84%
that there are five or
six things that are all

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.110 align:middle line:90%
relative one to the other.

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:23.200 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that it's
a very tiny chip.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.000 align:middle line:90%
It takes very little power.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.560 align:middle line:90%
It has a lot of cores in it.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:30.380 align:middle line:84%
It's able to do a lot
of tasks simultaneously.

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And it could reduce the
cost of virtually anything

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:40.529 align:middle line:84%
that it was doing immeasurably,
and it would be faster.

00:14:40.529 --> 00:14:42.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: At one point, Pete,
you told me that there was

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:46.300 align:middle line:84%
a certain group of people who
didn't know about your chip

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:49.620 align:middle line:84%
but were interested
in it, and that they--

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:53.040 align:middle line:84%
you told me that they ran
some kind of calculation on it

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.230 align:middle line:84%
that was supposed to take,
I guess, two weeks to solve.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And how long did it actually
take with this chip?

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: As I remember,
it was about 40 seconds.

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:04.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: 40 seconds
instead of two weeks?

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:05.712 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Right.

00:15:05.712 --> 00:15:08.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And that would have
been two weeks with, I assume,

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:10.540 align:middle line:84%
a really good computer,
like a powerful computer?

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.120 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well,
it wouldn't-- yes,

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.661 align:middle line:84%
it would have been an
off-the-shelf computer.

00:15:15.661 --> 00:15:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So this kind
of stuff that you're

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:21.560 align:middle line:84%
describing right now, there is
some things online that sound

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.360 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's normally called
quantum computing, the idea

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:29.110 align:middle line:84%
being that if you work
within the wave particle

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:34.060 align:middle line:84%
duality, that you could get
serial calculations instead

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:35.659 align:middle line:90%
of parallel calculations--

00:15:35.659 --> 00:15:37.450 align:middle line:84%
where, in other words,
all the calculations

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:41.010 align:middle line:84%
are happening at the same
time instead of one at a time.

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:44.670 align:middle line:84%
Is that somehow related to
what you were doing with this?

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:47.600 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, it's
where I was headed.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I'm
actually headed now,

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:56.460 align:middle line:84%
is I'm trying to make a new
type of quantum computer.

00:15:56.460 --> 00:16:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And you're right that you
can do parallel processing,

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:05.430 align:middle line:90%
but with the same circuitry.

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:06.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: All right.

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:09.530 align:middle line:84%
So I was curious, and we
just did a little break here

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:13.700 align:middle line:84%
so I could look this up
regarding the millions

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:15.920 align:middle line:90%
of instructions per second.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And Pete, let me just
read some of this to you.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to get
your comments at the end.

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:23.330 align:middle line:90%
I just want to get this out.

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.010 align:middle line:90%
And this is just--

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Wikipedia seems to
be the best resource

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:32.324 align:middle line:84%
that I could find easily
on instructions per second.

00:16:32.324 --> 00:16:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And so what we
have here-- when we

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:36.500 align:middle line:84%
get into millions of
instructions per second,

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:40.790 align:middle line:84%
they say that in the late
1970s, mini computer performance

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:44.690 align:middle line:84%
was compared using VAX, MIPS,
or Millions of Instructions

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:46.010 align:middle line:90%
Per Second.

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:49.730 align:middle line:84%
And then they say that
the IBM System 370

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:54.860 align:middle line:84%
model was running at 1 million
instructions per second.

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.540 align:middle line:84%
Then they also say
that there's millions

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:59.180 align:middle line:84%
of whetstone
instructions per second.

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:01.680 align:middle line:84%
But here's where it
gets interesting.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:06.700 align:middle line:84%
The first PC compiler had a
4.8-megahertz processor with

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:10.910 align:middle line:84%
0.01 MWIPS, or Millions of
Whetstone Instructions Per

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:12.079 align:middle line:90%
Second.

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:14.880 align:middle line:84%
Then they say, OK, we'll just go
with millions of instructions.

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:23.329 align:middle line:84%
So results on a 2.4-gigahertz
Intel Core 2 Duo vary from 9.7

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:27.530 align:middle line:84%
million instructions per second,
59 million instructions per

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:31.910 align:middle line:84%
second via BASIC compiler, 347
million instructions per second

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:37.640 align:middle line:84%
using 1987 FORTRAN, 1 billion,
534 million instructions per

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:41.720 align:middle line:84%
second through HTML
Java to 2 billion,

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.900 align:middle line:84%
4 million instructions per
second using a modern C,

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.940 align:middle line:90%
C++ compiler.

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:49.940 align:middle line:84%
So it looks like 2.4
billion is about as high

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:53.670 align:middle line:84%
as you can get with the
kind of standard processors

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:54.470 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:59.720 align:middle line:84%
So what's the instructions
per second that your chip is

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.444 align:middle line:90%
running at this point?

00:18:01.444 --> 00:18:03.860 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, it's not a
matter of what it is running.

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:07.030 align:middle line:90%
It's what it can run.

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:11.830 align:middle line:84%
It's fairly new, and we're
still writing software for it.

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:16.540 align:middle line:84%
But at least 86 billion
instructions per second.

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:17.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: 86 billion?

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Right.

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So the processors that
most people are using, as we

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.770 align:middle line:90%
just saw, are only 2.4 billion.

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And you're doing 86
billion with this chip.

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:27.000 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Right.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.060 align:middle line:84%
There are more
individual chips--

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:35.022 align:middle line:84%
individual processors
on the chip itself.

00:18:35.022 --> 00:18:36.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: People are
going to think that--

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:39.670 align:middle line:84%
again, they're going to have a
hard time with this if they're

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:40.900 align:middle line:90%
from a technical background.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:42.275 align:middle line:84%
And I think another
thing they're

00:18:42.275 --> 00:18:43.810 align:middle line:84%
going to have a
hard time with is

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:46.330 align:middle line:84%
nobody could put 144
cores on one chip

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:49.400 align:middle line:84%
without the thing completely
overheating and smoking.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.769 align:middle line:90%
So what's the secret sauce?

00:18:50.769 --> 00:18:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Oh, this chip
has been out for seven years.

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:54.310 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:59.050 align:middle line:84%
But what can you tell us about
why this chip is so fast?

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:01.930 align:middle line:84%
What is different about it
from other chips out there?

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:05.860 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: It's just a
matter of architecture.

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.590 align:middle line:84%
The architecture-- the basic
software it was designed

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:09.880 align:middle line:90%
to run--

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:14.340 align:middle line:84%
it was designed to run a
moderately high-level language,

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:22.830 align:middle line:84%
Forth, directly rather than
compile a bunch of simple--

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:28.080 align:middle line:84%
the basic processor runs simple
instructions, any processor.

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.640 align:middle line:84%
The Forth instructions are
probably just as simple,

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.190 align:middle line:84%
but there they were chosen
right in the beginning.

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:34.990 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:39.040 align:middle line:84%
I remember you telling me
that Forth involves principles

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:41.380 align:middle line:90%
of stacking in which--

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:44.080 align:middle line:84%
you had said that a
typical computer, if you

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:47.280 align:middle line:84%
hit the J key and then a
J shows up on the screen,

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.760 align:middle line:84%
that there could
be transfers going

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.470 align:middle line:84%
on between the
CPU and the memory

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:52.990 align:middle line:84%
back and forth, just for
that one little thing.

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:55.990 align:middle line:84%
So there's all
this wasted effort.

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:58.019 align:middle line:84%
And you said with
the Forth language

00:19:58.019 --> 00:20:00.310 align:middle line:84%
that you could have a whole
series of instructions that

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:02.950 align:middle line:84%
can be taken from
one stack to another,

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:06.530 align:middle line:84%
which eliminates so much of that
redundancy from the actual--

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:08.890 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: It eliminates
a lot of redundancy

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:11.230 align:middle line:90%
in typical calculations, yes.

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So that's
part of the secret?

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.330 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: It's
part of the secret.

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:19.600 align:middle line:84%
Part of the secret is obviously
new technology and building

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:24.400 align:middle line:84%
chips, and building
chips much smaller.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.860 align:middle line:84%
A smaller chip
takes less current.

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:28.310 align:middle line:90%
Less current makes less heat.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:31.590 align:middle line:84%
Less heat lets you
run the chip faster.

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:33.790 align:middle line:84%
You get more
instructions per second.

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And this chip is
a CMOS-type chip,

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:43.390 align:middle line:84%
which means it's complimentary
metal oxide semiconductor.

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:48.190 align:middle line:84%
It runs on voltage
rather than amperage.

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:52.180 align:middle line:84%
So by its nature and
its architecture,

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:53.481 align:middle line:90%
it takes less current.

00:20:53.481 --> 00:20:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: When we've talked
about this privately,

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.830 align:middle line:90%
you mentioned the Novix chip.

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.450 align:middle line:84%
Is that something
we can talk about?

00:20:58.450 --> 00:20:59.250 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yeah.

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:03.100 align:middle line:84%
The Novix chip was
an early chip that

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:07.480 align:middle line:84%
tried to run Forth directly
and did run Forth directly.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:12.316 align:middle line:84%
It was used in
several areas that I

00:21:12.316 --> 00:21:13.940 align:middle line:84%
don't know whether
I should talk about,

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:17.990 align:middle line:84%
or I can't talk about right now
without maybe getting approval.

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:19.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:21.270 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: But it
was made available.

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:22.820 align:middle line:90%
It was hidden in plain sight.

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.720 align:middle line:84%
It was made available
to the world.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think probably today,
most of those Novix chips are

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.510 align:middle line:84%
bought-- and they're
still being produced--

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:35.530 align:middle line:84%
are being bought
by the Russians.

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now, is it
possible that somebody

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.650 align:middle line:84%
could get a Novix chip
and not understand

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:40.970 align:middle line:90%
how to harness its power?

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:42.350 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Oh, absolutely.

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Run much
simpler software on it,

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:45.260 align:middle line:90%
that kind of thing?

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:46.060 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: No.

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.200 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't run simpler
software, I don't think.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.107 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:21:49.107 --> 00:21:51.440 align:middle line:84%
But they just wouldn't be
able to access its capability?

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.780 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: No, they would
be able to access it.

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:57.600 align:middle line:84%
The problem is in learning
the language Forth

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.510 align:middle line:90%
and then applying it.

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:03.810 align:middle line:90%


00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:05.970 align:middle line:84%
I've always called Forth
the best-kept secret

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:09.270 align:middle line:84%
in almost all
computer laboratories,

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:16.890 align:middle line:84%
because they run into places
where running a typical system,

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:19.140 align:middle line:84%
the software wouldn't run
fast enough to really do

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:23.202 align:middle line:84%
the job, especially when you're
in a high-end graphics area.

00:22:23.202 --> 00:22:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: One of
the things that you

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:29.280 align:middle line:84%
said that is truly
remarkable was

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.850 align:middle line:84%
who attended the
class that you taught

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:35.760 align:middle line:84%
in the '70s on how to build
a personal computer back

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.344 align:middle line:90%
when nobody was doing it.

00:22:37.344 --> 00:22:39.510 align:middle line:84%
So could you tell us some
of the names of the people

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:42.016 align:middle line:84%
that were in that
class that you taught?

00:22:42.016 --> 00:22:43.890 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, it
wasn't a class I taught,

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:45.510 align:middle line:90%
but it was a class that--

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:49.830 align:middle line:84%
I had a company by
the name of Cyberdyne

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:58.440 align:middle line:84%
that took a computer that used
the same chip that the Apple 2

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:04.110 align:middle line:84%
and the Commodore 64, the
Atari, early days in the Atari,

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:07.590 align:middle line:90%
and that type of thing.

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:10.560 align:middle line:84%
These were computers that
didn't even have keyboards.

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.240 align:middle line:84%
As far as I know,
ours was the first one

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.905 align:middle line:84%
that had a typical
typewriter keyboard on it.

00:23:15.905 --> 00:23:20.100 align:middle line:84%
It was a single,
12-inch square board.

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:21.570 align:middle line:90%
It had input, output.

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:22.960 align:middle line:90%
It had memory manipulation.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And the idea was to
use it to teach people

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:32.950 align:middle line:84%
to use microprocessor chips
and to use machine language

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:33.750 align:middle line:90%
programming.

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And then we had other
chips that would go in.

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:39.620 align:middle line:84%
So you could get a pair of
chips that would allow you

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:41.610 align:middle line:90%
to program in Forth.

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:43.760 align:middle line:84%
We had a pair of chips
you could program in Lisp.

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.849 align:middle line:84%
We had a pair of chips you
could program in BASIC.

00:23:46.849 --> 00:23:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But you said something
very provocative there,

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:52.679 align:middle line:84%
which is that your company
was called Cyberdyne Systems.

00:23:52.679 --> 00:23:53.970 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: No, just Cyberdyne.

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:56.505 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Or just Cyberdyne,
which a lot of people

00:23:56.505 --> 00:23:58.380 align:middle line:84%
are going to be familiar
with if they've ever

00:23:58.380 --> 00:23:59.700 align:middle line:90%
seen certain films.

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.210 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Oh, they are.

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:03.160 align:middle line:90%
And we copyrighted it.

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And we ran that company
for about five or six years

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:14.250 align:middle line:84%
and then went off to do other
things, and specific things

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:15.084 align:middle line:90%
in that area.

00:24:15.084 --> 00:24:16.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But what
I was getting to

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:20.100 align:middle line:84%
was that the guy who actually
built the first Apple

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Computer, Steve Wozniak, you
claim he was in your class.

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:29.910 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: The first class that
we held was a mail order class,

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:32.790 align:middle line:84%
and he was a buyer
of that system.

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And then he built
an Apple 1 computer

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:40.140 align:middle line:84%
that was very much like
know the one that we did.

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:48.470 align:middle line:84%
Also in the same class was the
gentleman that started Atari.

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:49.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Nolan Bushnell?

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:51.030 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Nolan Bushnell.

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:55.920 align:middle line:84%
His class project
came out, as far

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.830 align:middle line:90%
as I know, as the "Pong" game.

00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:59.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: "Pong," right.

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:00.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.660 align:middle line:90%
I remember playing that in 1976.

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:05.580 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And it was, I
think, the first microprocessor

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:06.822 align:middle line:90%
game in the marketplace.

00:25:06.822 --> 00:25:09.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It might have been
a little later than 1976,

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:10.290 align:middle line:90%
but I do remember "Pong."

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:11.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:12.210 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yeah.

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And so there was
"Pong," and then

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:23.130 align:middle line:84%
and he came out with
the CBM computers.

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:26.100 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember what the--

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:27.720 align:middle line:90%
Commodore Business Machines.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:28.872 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, OK.

00:25:28.872 --> 00:25:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And they came
out with several computers,

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.690 align:middle line:90%
and then the Commodore 64.

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:35.520 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: So you actually have--

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:40.320 align:middle line:84%
and your company, Cyberdyne,
has this very interesting role

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:43.410 align:middle line:84%
in the history of
computing in terms of Apple

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:48.030 align:middle line:84%
is now probably the dominant
computer company in the world.

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:50.430 align:middle line:84%
Atari has been a very,
very successful video game

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:51.390 align:middle line:90%
manufacturer.

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:54.610 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Which is
now Chuck E Cheese

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:59.040 align:middle line:84%
with all of its robotically
controlled games and things.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: That's another thing.

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:01.680 align:middle line:84%
When we looked up
Nolan Bushnell,

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.221 align:middle line:84%
that's another thing
that he founded.

00:26:03.221 --> 00:26:04.860 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yeah.

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:08.820 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of those
people started out

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:14.880 align:middle line:84%
programming a little push-button
computer called the KIM.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And then we made a
computer that was

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:24.779 align:middle line:84%
similar to that called an
AIM-65 and wrote books for it.

00:26:24.779 --> 00:26:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But we're dancing
around something here.

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:28.403 align:middle line:84%
We're getting
dangerously close to it,

00:26:28.403 --> 00:26:30.480 align:middle line:84%
but we're still
dancing around it.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:34.090 align:middle line:84%
You build this computer that
obviously is not the one

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:38.070 align:middle line:84%
that Steve Wozniak ordered
by mail in the class

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:39.190 align:middle line:90%
to learn how to build.

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:39.460 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: No.

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.340 align:middle line:84%
It was the one he
ordered as far as I know.

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But you built
another computer chip that

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:48.750 align:middle line:90%
had very powerful capability.

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:50.092 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: That was much later.

00:26:50.092 --> 00:26:51.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: That was much later.

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:52.620 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yeah.

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:57.610 align:middle line:84%
We wanted a chip that
would run Forth directly.

00:26:57.610 --> 00:27:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And when I say "we,"
this was a thing

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:05.880 align:middle line:84%
that was done by a
private corporation that

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:09.390 align:middle line:90%
was owned by the government.

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:12.120 align:middle line:84%
I never got the
exact thing on that.

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:15.900 align:middle line:84%
But the government was
trying to get things done,

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.280 align:middle line:90%
and it would come out.

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And it wanted to hide
it in plain sight.

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:23.580 align:middle line:84%
So they would come out and
put money behind doing things

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:24.780 align:middle line:90%
in that field.

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And I was involved in
some of the planning

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:29.040 align:middle line:90%
stages of those things.

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And I was involved
in putting people

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:35.730 align:middle line:84%
together and making corporations
and making those things happen.

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now, you said, when
we were talking about this chip

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:41.490 align:middle line:84%
a little while ago,
that if, for example, it

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:46.320 align:middle line:84%
was doing smartphone
emulation, that it

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.570 align:middle line:84%
would be able to
assess its own needs

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:51.990 align:middle line:84%
and repurpose its
processors accordingly.

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And that, to me, starts
to sound like a form

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:56.125 align:middle line:90%
of electronic intelligence.

00:27:56.125 --> 00:27:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: That was,
of course, a goal

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:00.620 align:middle line:84%
that we had to come up to
electronic intelligence.

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:05.120 align:middle line:90%
And then we found out--

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:09.120 align:middle line:84%
I was working with another
gentleman in mathematics,

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:13.090 align:middle line:84%
and we found out that most
of mathematics is wrong.

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:16.830 align:middle line:84%
He's in the process now of
writing a book that he plans

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:18.037 align:middle line:90%
to come out with very soon.

00:28:18.037 --> 00:28:19.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Yeah, and
I've spoken to him.

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:20.786 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: That shows that.

00:28:20.786 --> 00:28:23.670 align:middle line:90%
And I think you've met him.

00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:25.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Yeah,
we've spoken to him.

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:27.380 align:middle line:90%
And met him in person.

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.704 align:middle line:84%
It's fascinating, but it's
probably way more technical

00:28:29.704 --> 00:28:30.870 align:middle line:90%
than we could get into here.

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:32.078 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: It definitely is.

00:28:32.078 --> 00:28:34.800 align:middle line:90%
It's way more technical.

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I'll just say
that what I took from it

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:42.150 align:middle line:84%
is that if you count in
base 6 instead of base 10,

00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:44.850 align:middle line:84%
that all of a sudden, you
get all these benefits

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:48.800 align:middle line:84%
like these dimensionless
constants like pi and phi,

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:51.672 align:middle line:84%
and the e natural
base of logarithms.

00:28:51.672 --> 00:28:53.130 align:middle line:84%
But these numbers
that are supposed

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:56.490 align:middle line:84%
to have eternal decimal
points that never change,

00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:58.740 align:middle line:84%
you start to get a
string that actually

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:00.720 align:middle line:84%
keeps repeating after
the decimal point,

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.300 align:middle line:84%
suggesting that the
universe is running

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:06.300 align:middle line:84%
in some kind of six-based
counting system.

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:09.210 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, it's
three-based counting system,

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:10.500 align:middle line:90%
trinary system.

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I wanted to build
a quantum computer that

00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:18.510 align:middle line:90%
would run in trinary.

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And then we could
put a whole new spin

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:27.700 align:middle line:90%
behind the mathematics.

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And I'm waiting for
him to release his book

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:34.560 align:middle line:90%
before I say anything about it.

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:38.490 align:middle line:84%
But it will change virtually
everything in mathematics

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:40.290 align:middle line:90%
that I know of.

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You mentioned
Zhegalkin algebra to me before.

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Is that something we
can talk about, or no?

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: A little
bit about that.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:51.780 align:middle line:84%
Zhegalkin algebra is a
complete, closed algebra.

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:56.520 align:middle line:84%
It allows you to do a lot of
artificial intelligence type

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:58.360 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:02.310 align:middle line:84%
It allows the computer
to, in many cases,

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:05.520 align:middle line:84%
program itself to
do certain things.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.840 align:middle line:84%
The more you teach it,
the more it learns.

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:09.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But Zhegalkin
algebra basically

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:11.070 align:middle line:90%
is using this trinary system.

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:13.610 align:middle line:90%
Is that right in some sense?

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:16.015 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: It can.

00:30:16.015 --> 00:30:18.940 align:middle line:90%
It's very complex.

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:22.870 align:middle line:84%
These are very,
very complex things.

00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But you mentioned
that once a computer chip uses

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:27.450 align:middle line:84%
Zhegalkin algebra,
then it could develop

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:29.770 align:middle line:90%
artificial intelligence.

00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:31.410 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yes.

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:34.440 align:middle line:90%
It can be programmed to do that.

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:36.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So the thing
that is obviously

00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:38.190 align:middle line:84%
going to be on
everybody's mind here

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:40.620 align:middle line:84%
is you mentioned that your
company was called Cyberdyne.

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:42.661 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned that you're
working on a very, very

00:30:42.661 --> 00:30:44.250 align:middle line:90%
powerful computer chip.

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:46.860 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned that it may
have artificial intelligence.

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And anybody who's seen
the movie "Terminator"

00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:52.500 align:middle line:84%
knows that it's about cyborgs
with artificial intelligence

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:55.200 align:middle line:84%
built by a company
called Cyberdyne.

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.040 align:middle line:90%
So what's going on here?

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I have no
idea how they got--

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:02.370 align:middle line:90%


00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:03.430 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:05.846 align:middle line:84%
I just know that
we copyrighted it.

00:31:05.846 --> 00:31:08.617 align:middle line:84%
And as far as I know, the
copyright is still valid.

00:31:08.617 --> 00:31:10.200 align:middle line:84%
We didn't care if
other people used it

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:12.430 align:middle line:90%
because we weren't using it.

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:14.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if we'll
use it in the future

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:16.920 align:middle line:90%
because we have one--

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:21.060 align:middle line:84%
something that will,
I think, a little bit

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:24.540 align:middle line:84%
better describe what
we're doing now.

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And we're waiting
for publication

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:30.720 align:middle line:84%
of the new mathematics
to come out.

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:35.550 align:middle line:84%
For example, there
was a huge contest

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:39.990 align:middle line:84%
to solve Fermat's Last Theorem,
and it was finally solved.

00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And I can't remember how
many pages and pages.

00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Fermat said he solved
it in the blank spaces

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:48.820 align:middle line:90%
in one of his textbooks.

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:50.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, let me
just stop you right there.

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:54.000 align:middle line:84%
Are you aware of there being
any type of Androids or cyborgs

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.190 align:middle line:90%
that have ever been built?

00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:58.320 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Oh, yes, of course.

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:01.120 align:middle line:84%
Especially-- just
as an example, Honda

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:02.650 align:middle line:90%
has built all kinds of cyborgs.

00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:05.400 align:middle line:90%


00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:08.530 align:middle line:84%
And there are
quite a few others.

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:13.200 align:middle line:84%
There's another one
that hopefully we'll

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:14.700 align:middle line:90%
be able to talk about very soon.

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:18.640 align:middle line:84%
You and I have talked
about that extensively.

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And the man is
retired now, and I

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:24.240 align:middle line:84%
want to make sure
that everything

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:27.120 align:middle line:90%
is OK to discuss that.

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:30.030 align:middle line:84%
But as far as I
can tell, I can't

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:35.100 align:middle line:84%
tell the difference between
that particular cyborg

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:36.565 align:middle line:90%
and a human being.

00:32:36.565 --> 00:32:37.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: That's
very provocative.

00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:38.770 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yep.

00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you're
saying that this guy,

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:42.330 align:middle line:84%
who you and I both
know his name--

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:44.220 align:middle line:84%
and we've talked about
him extensively--

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:46.530 align:middle line:84%
was able to design and
build a cyborg that

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:49.267 align:middle line:84%
was indistinguishable
from a human being?

00:32:49.267 --> 00:32:50.350 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Well, if you--

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: For all
intents and purposes.

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:53.058 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: For all
intents and purposes.

00:32:53.058 --> 00:32:55.740 align:middle line:84%
If you took it apart, you could
tell it wasn't a human being.

00:32:55.740 --> 00:33:02.580 align:middle line:84%
I think I remember telling you
I was introduced to this being,

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:06.780 align:middle line:84%
and then it was turned around,
and the back was unzipped,

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:09.710 align:middle line:84%
and I could see the
inside of it was

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:14.430 align:middle line:84%
mechanical and fluidic and
electronic and so forth.

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:17.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And what year
was this, roughly?

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:23.550 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Probably
about 1988, maybe '89.

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:28.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So if the technology
was at that level at 1988,

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:31.020 align:middle line:84%
do you think it's possible
that when James Cameron wrote

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:35.310 align:middle line:84%
"Terminator," that maybe he was
worried about where this could

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:38.280 align:middle line:84%
go if he was aware of some
research that was already

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:39.240 align:middle line:90%
being conducted?

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:39.570 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Well.

00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:42.190 align:middle line:84%
I think there's been a lot of
worry about where it can go,

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:45.940 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not too sure that
it's not well-founded.

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:49.800 align:middle line:84%
We hear Kurzweil now talking
about within 20 years,

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:54.540 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be
probably 20% or 30%

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:57.150 align:middle line:90%
mechanical as human beings.

00:33:57.150 --> 00:34:00.540 align:middle line:84%
We'll adopt
mechanical parts that

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:02.420 align:middle line:84%
allow us to do
things much faster,

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:05.490 align:middle line:90%
or electronic or mechanical.

00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And he thinks that
that will very rapidly

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:14.550 align:middle line:84%
spread to where probably
the only thing left is the--

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:18.429 align:middle line:84%
maybe the basic brain,
if even that much,

00:34:18.429 --> 00:34:22.110 align:middle line:90%
will be left as biological.

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:24.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Would you say that
these chips that you built

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:27.780 align:middle line:84%
could help facilitate
that type of AI?

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:31.980 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, I certainly
was hoping they might.

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:36.550 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, I won't say
there is a moral obligation,

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:40.679 align:middle line:84%
but there's certainly
sometimes an ethical obligation

00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:43.020 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that we don't
generate something that's

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:47.420 align:middle line:84%
going to wipe us out,
which is of course the text

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:50.310 align:middle line:90%
for many sci-fi movies.

00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:52.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, you've
actually just said

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:58.530 align:middle line:84%
here that you saw this being
that was indistinguishable

00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:00.360 align:middle line:84%
from a human being,
but was actually

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:01.590 align:middle line:90%
some kind of a machine.

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:04.650 align:middle line:84%
So clearly, the
technology is there.

00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:07.660 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, technology
increases rapidly.

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:09.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And this was--
you said '88 or something?

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:11.982 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: '88.

00:35:11.982 --> 00:35:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: The movie
"The Terminator"

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:17.790 align:middle line:84%
said that the guy who developed
the chip that led to these

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:20.910 align:middle line:84%
cyborgs needed to be
murdered-- in "Terminator 2,"

00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:22.890 align:middle line:90%
I think is what it said--

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:24.300 align:middle line:90%
to save humanity.

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:28.760 align:middle line:90%
So why would they say that?

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: The
technology, if it got away,

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:34.230 align:middle line:84%
would exceed the technology
of an average human.

00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:35.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: So these could be--

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:36.658 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Capability.

00:35:36.658 --> 00:35:41.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So these machines could
be potentially living among us,

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:43.710 align:middle line:84%
and we wouldn't necessarily
know that they were there.

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:50.190 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: That certainly
could be a problem

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:51.084 align:middle line:90%
that we would have.

00:35:51.084 --> 00:35:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: This is one
of the reasons why,

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:55.260 align:middle line:84%
as I started to learn
about all this stuff--

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:57.080 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: If we
look at people,

00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:00.810 align:middle line:84%
if we look at people now and
look at how they react and act

00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:03.020 align:middle line:84%
with each other, we
can see that there

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:06.330 align:middle line:84%
are major, major, major
problems in the world

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:10.450 align:middle line:84%
because of how they're
acting, how they're thinking.

00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:17.310 align:middle line:84%
So if we have cyborg things
that think the same way,

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:20.790 align:middle line:84%
then they probably would
think that they were better

00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:26.070 align:middle line:84%
than biological things, which
in many cases they would be.

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:29.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So the things that
you're talking about here are

00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:32.410 align:middle line:84%
in development,
like these cyborgs--

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:34.230 align:middle line:84%
they're in development
at the same time

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:37.830 align:middle line:84%
that "Terminator 1" and
"Terminator 2" are coming out.

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:40.364 align:middle line:84%
Cameron apparently is using
the name of your company

00:36:40.364 --> 00:36:42.780 align:middle line:84%
as the name of the company
that built these in the movies.

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:45.120 align:middle line:90%
So let's just get right to it.

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that somebody
was leaking information to him

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.230 align:middle line:90%
to make movies about this?

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:51.600 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, I know
Cyberdyne was easy for me

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.415 align:middle line:90%
to come up with years ago.

00:36:53.415 --> 00:36:54.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: What does it mean?

00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:55.920 align:middle line:90%
What's the term mean?

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.060 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Cyber--

00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:57.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:58.220 align:middle line:90%
Which means what?

00:36:58.220 --> 00:36:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Having
to do with brain.

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:02.600 align:middle line:90%
Dyne being dynamic.

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.050 align:middle line:90%
It was a good name at the time.

00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:06.510 align:middle line:84%
I took a class on
the fella that name

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:09.220 align:middle line:90%
Exxon and a few other things.

00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:10.980 align:middle line:90%
And we had to name a--

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:13.080 align:middle line:84%
in that class, we had
to make up a name.

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And that was one I made
up, and got a good grade.

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So do you think
Cameron knows something

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:20.776 align:middle line:84%
or knew something,
was tipped off?

00:37:20.776 --> 00:37:23.040 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, most people
have to know something.

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.510 align:middle line:90%
I look at things--

00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:26.730 align:middle line:84%
I look at modern
science fiction movies,

00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:31.410 align:middle line:84%
and I see craft and
things that I know exist.

00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:33.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Do you think that
the robotic chassis that we

00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:36.540 align:middle line:84%
see in the first
"Terminator" film

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:39.450 align:middle line:84%
might be a good design for how
these things might actually

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:40.830 align:middle line:90%
look?

00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:42.120 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Well, it could.

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:48.060 align:middle line:84%
There are many people who are
making that type of thing now.

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:52.437 align:middle line:84%
Some are making it to emulate
a human and look like a human.

00:37:52.437 --> 00:37:54.270 align:middle line:84%
Some make it look like
something you'd never

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:57.336 align:middle line:90%
guess that it was a robot.

00:37:57.336 --> 00:37:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And there are
things that you may

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:02.460 align:middle line:84%
want to do that don't require
having any human aspect.

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well,
let's talk about--

00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:07.920 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
keep it hypothetical.

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:13.350 align:middle line:84%
Hypothetically, if
somebody built these,

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:15.355 align:middle line:84%
what might be some of
the weapons systems

00:38:15.355 --> 00:38:16.230 align:middle line:90%
that they would have?

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:18.420 align:middle line:84%
What might be some of the
things that they could do?

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:23.490 align:middle line:84%
If you have a human cyborg,
a human-looking cyborg,

00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:25.560 align:middle line:84%
but you've got the
power of obviously very

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:31.200 align:middle line:84%
high-density metals, very
powerful motors and equipment,

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.540 align:middle line:90%
what could that be and do?

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:35.490 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well,
I've seen three things

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:42.570 align:middle line:84%
within the last month on either
a motion picture or television

00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:43.889 align:middle line:90%
and in the newspapers.

00:38:43.889 --> 00:38:45.930 align:middle line:84%
It was announced two or
three days ago the Marine

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:49.920 align:middle line:90%
Corps had a new cyborg soldier.

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:51.555 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yes.

00:38:51.555 --> 00:38:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And it could
independently determine

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.220 align:middle line:90%
who was good and who was bad.

00:38:56.220 --> 00:39:02.700 align:middle line:84%
I know of a bullet,
we'll call it,

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:06.840 align:middle line:84%
that you can fire into a room,
and look around in the room,

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:10.830 align:middle line:84%
figure out who are the bad guys
and who are innocent children,

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:15.030 align:middle line:84%
people, women, et cetera,
and take care of the bad guys

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:17.010 align:middle line:90%
and not harm the good guys.

00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:19.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You mentioned
in a previous episode

00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:22.980 align:middle line:84%
the microcopter, this
little maple key thing that

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:24.780 align:middle line:84%
can have a piston
inside of it, and it

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:26.040 align:middle line:90%
can control where it goes.

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:27.373 align:middle line:90%
Would it be something like that?

00:39:27.373 --> 00:39:29.080 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Something like that.

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:34.860 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of things
going on in research that I

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:39.120 align:middle line:90%
read about in magazines that--

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:42.600 align:middle line:84%
a lot of trade magazines
about intelligent ammunition

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:44.580 align:middle line:90%
of various kinds.

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:45.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.610 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: There
are a lot of things--

00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:52.740 align:middle line:84%
there was a thing I saw on the
internet about three days ago,

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:53.610 align:middle line:90%
four days ago.

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:56.550 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to bring it back up.

00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:58.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure who sent it to me.

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And it was maybe meant
for a one-time show.

00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:09.070 align:middle line:84%
But it was about some
Russian robotic technology.

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:11.210 align:middle line:84%
They had a small
six-wheeled vehicle.

00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:16.440 align:middle line:84%
They had a cannon that could
run around and place itself

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:20.100 align:middle line:84%
and fire and and run
off somewhere else,

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:24.420 align:middle line:84%
just like it was a cannon
built onto a Olympic sprinter.

00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: If a fully capable
cyborg went up to a human being

00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:33.420 align:middle line:84%
and kicked that human
being as hard as it could,

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:34.670 align:middle line:90%
what would happen to the body?

00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:36.169 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well,
it depends on what

00:40:36.169 --> 00:40:37.870 align:middle line:90%
you designed your cyborg to do.

00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:41.302 align:middle line:84%
But basically, make the
body look like a football.

00:40:41.302 --> 00:40:43.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What do you mean
look like a football?

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Fly through
the air in pieces.

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:48.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So there could be
that much power to cause--

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Oh, yeah,
absolutely, an infinite power,

00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:54.510 align:middle line:90%
just depending on how much--

00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:58.770 align:middle line:84%
a lot of work going on now
on storing energy, new ways

00:40:58.770 --> 00:41:01.170 align:middle line:90%
to store energy.

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:06.570 align:middle line:84%
There are some new cells out
are lithium iron phosphate

00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:09.390 align:middle line:84%
cells that hold a
tremendous amount of energy,

00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:11.130 align:middle line:84%
and they're very,
very lightweight.

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:13.463 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Let me ask you this,
because we're out of time,

00:41:13.463 --> 00:41:15.930 align:middle line:84%
and I just want to wrap it
up with one little thing.

00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:19.470 align:middle line:84%
With a movie like "The
Terminator" coming out,

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:22.260 align:middle line:84%
that would suggest that some
people with enough money

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:25.470 align:middle line:84%
to finance a big-budget
Hollywood film are

00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:29.410 align:middle line:84%
aware of the potential
problem this could present,

00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:32.770 align:middle line:84%
and I would assume
are making sure

00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:35.200 align:middle line:84%
that it's not going to be
something that would turn out

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:37.690 align:middle line:84%
like the paranoid
scenario in the movie,

00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:41.260 align:middle line:84%
that there are stopgaps in place
to prevent that from becoming

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:43.104 align:middle line:90%
a big, epic world disaster.

00:41:43.104 --> 00:41:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I think they've
done a wonderful job on trying

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:48.689 align:middle line:90%
to warn us of what is possible.

00:41:48.689 --> 00:41:50.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Do you think there
are sureties and safeguards

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:54.110 align:middle line:84%
in place that could prevent
that from happening?

00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I haven't seen
mankind do that very well.

00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, we have
heard quite a bit in "Cosmic

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:04.660 align:middle line:84%
Disclosure" about the
problem of predatory AI,

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:08.140 align:middle line:84%
and we've heard that there
are some very serious security

00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:10.450 align:middle line:84%
steps and countermeasures
taken to try

00:42:10.450 --> 00:42:13.000 align:middle line:90%
to stop it from spreading.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And so let's hope
that there are.

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:17.650 align:middle line:90%
Let's hope that that's true.

00:42:17.650 --> 00:42:19.420 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well,
like I say, I think

00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:24.730 align:middle line:84%
that the world is coming to
a great change very soon.

00:42:24.730 --> 00:42:28.090 align:middle line:90%


00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:31.210 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a
financial collapse coming,

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:34.150 align:middle line:90%
or at least a partial one.

00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And I think that a lot
of these things, we'll

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:40.460 align:middle line:84%
have time to think
about before we do them.

00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:41.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: All right.

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:44.110 align:middle line:84%
That's all the time we have for
this episode of "Disclosure"

00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:45.970 align:middle line:90%
with Dr. Pete Peterson.

00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:49.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, David Wilcock,
and I thank you for watching.

00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:55.403 align:middle line:90%
