00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID WILCOCK:
Welcome to "Disclosure."

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, David Wilcock.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And in this episode,
I am continuing

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.840 align:middle line:84%
to interview the great hero
of exposing the Federal

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.520 align:middle line:90%
Reserve, G. Edward Griffin.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.430 align:middle line:10%
And specifically,
we're going to be

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.120 align:middle line:10%
talking about two different
subjects in this episode.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.260 align:middle line:10%
The first one may
really shock you.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.930 align:middle line:10%
We're going to see
photographs of what

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.180 align:middle line:10%
appears to be something that
is totally non-constitutional,

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.630 align:middle line:10%
extrajudicial.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.750 align:middle line:10%
We're going to see the
New York Police Department

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.350 align:middle line:10%
colluding with the
Federal Reserve banks

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.460 align:middle line:10%
and the intelligence agencies
for a single facility

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.570 align:middle line:10%
where they are literally
using the spy-cam footage

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.160 align:middle line:10%
from the cameras mounted on
the streets around Wall Street

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.790 align:middle line:10%
to put people
under surveillance.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And you've got desks
for the Federal Reserve,

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.780 align:middle line:90%
desks for Goldman Sachs.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.210 align:middle line:84%
Why the heck should
they have access

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.350 align:middle line:84%
to all the surveillance
footage of everybody

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.120 align:middle line:90%
that's in Wall Street?

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.040 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty crazy
in and of itself.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.110 align:middle line:84%
So that'll be an
interesting discussion.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.400 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, we're going to
talk about the McCarthy era.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.470 align:middle line:84%
Most people sort of blow
that off, if they even

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.370 align:middle line:84%
know about it all, the
idea of the Red Scare

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.420 align:middle line:84%
that the communists
are invading.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.010 align:middle line:84%
But in my work
"Financial Tyranny",

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.760 align:middle line:84%
I've described how the US
and the USSR at the highest,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.870 align:middle line:84%
highest levels were
actually working together.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.810 align:middle line:84%
Now certainly, even people in
high-level government positions

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.290 align:middle line:84%
didn't necessarily know
this, but the people

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.100 align:middle line:84%
that were pulling the
strings certainly did.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And so there were actually
agents of the Communist party

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.760 align:middle line:84%
that had gotten
implanted in America

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.590 align:middle line:84%
that were, in fact,
using both sides to play

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:00.910 align:middle line:90%
against the middle.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.501 align:middle line:84%
And this was something that
Senator Joe McCarthy found out

00:02:03.501 --> 00:02:04.000 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.250 align:middle line:84%
He was actually a whistleblower
who started this communist Red

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.500 align:middle line:84%
Scare investigation to try
to break the cabal apart.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.610 align:middle line:84%
It did not succeed, but
it's a very interesting part

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.770 align:middle line:84%
of history that most
people overlook.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And G. Edward Griffin wrote
a whole book about it.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.770 align:middle line:90%
So check it out.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.190 align:middle line:10%
Ed, we're going to
show everyone who

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.530 align:middle line:10%
watches this video a series
of astonishing photographs

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.870 align:middle line:10%
of a large, centralized
office for the New York Police

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.890 align:middle line:10%
Department in which they have
banks upon banks of monitors

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.600 align:middle line:10%
that are linked to
surveillance cameras

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.510 align:middle line:10%
in and around Wall Street.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.490 align:middle line:84%
The mayor of New
York is involved.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.410 align:middle line:84%
The New York Police
Department is involved.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.440 align:middle line:84%
But also very clearly in
this big surveillance center,

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.560 align:middle line:84%
they have a desk
for Goldman Sachs.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.870 align:middle line:84%
They have a desk
for Bank of America.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And they have a desk for
the Federal Reserve System.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.730 align:middle line:84%
This seems to be
treason of the highest

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.980 align:middle line:84%
order for the police
and the banking system

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.910 align:middle line:84%
to be colluding on
enacting surveillance

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.550 align:middle line:90%
against Wall Street.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.779 align:middle line:90%
What the hell is going on here?

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:19.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, yeah, I
understand what you're saying,

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.280 align:middle line:84%
David, and I agree with the
import of your question.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.635 align:middle line:84%
It looks very
suspicious, doesn't it?

00:03:26.635 --> 00:03:30.020 align:middle line:84%
Like taxpayer money is being
used for a private purpose,

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.640 align:middle line:90%
like as a private security firm.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.220 align:middle line:10%
The New York Police
Department's been

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.010 align:middle line:10%
turned into a private
security agency for the banks.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.010 align:middle line:10%
And we're paying for it,
or at least New Yorkers

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.851 align:middle line:10%
are paying for it.

00:03:39.851 --> 00:03:41.350 align:middle line:10%
That's one view,
and I think there's

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.140 align:middle line:10%
a lot of validity to it.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And it can be bolstered,
though, from the other side

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.360 align:middle line:84%
by saying, well, yeah, but
it's in the best interest

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.890 align:middle line:90%
of society.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.080 align:middle line:84%
Because the banks
are targets, and we

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:59.320 align:middle line:84%
can see all these angry
demonstrators petitioning.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing
you know, they'll

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.900 align:middle line:90%
be rioting against Wall Street.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.310 align:middle line:84%
They may be throwing fire
bombs into the buildings.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And the banks will
burn down, and people

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.320 align:middle line:84%
will lose their money, and the
banking system will collapse,

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.730 align:middle line:90%
and America will collapse.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's in the best interest
of America to protect the banks.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.529 align:middle line:90%
That's how the argument goes.

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people say,
oh, yeah, that makes sense.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.790 align:middle line:84%
We do want to protect our
financial infrastructure,

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:23.880 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.852 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, there's
an argument to it.

00:04:25.852 --> 00:04:27.060 align:middle line:90%
But we know better, don't we?

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.770 align:middle line:84%
We know that even
though that's true,

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.400 align:middle line:84%
that there is a national
interest in protecting

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.490 align:middle line:84%
the financial
infrastructure, making sure

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.040 align:middle line:84%
that it's not destroyed by acts
of violence, and that is true.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.220 align:middle line:84%
Even though in spite
of that, we also

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.000 align:middle line:84%
know that the banks have undue
influence with the cities

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.870 align:middle line:84%
and the states and the
national governments,

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.650 align:middle line:84%
and they are getting
very favorable treatment.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure that
once somebody decides

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.950 align:middle line:84%
to really look into that
and follow the money,

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.950 align:middle line:84%
they'll find out that
taxpayers are paying

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.560 align:middle line:84%
way more than they
think to protect

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.260 align:middle line:90%
the integrity of the banks.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Ed, how do you
see the relationship

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.540 align:middle line:84%
between secret societies
and this banking cartel

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.290 align:middle line:90%
that we've been discussing?

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.290 align:middle line:84%
What I'm specifically
thinking of now

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.670 align:middle line:84%
is something you read about
all the time from people

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.690 align:middle line:84%
who write about this--
the Freemasonry,

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.050 align:middle line:90%
or the Masonic Order.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, we know through various
investigative journalists

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.250 align:middle line:84%
that you go through
a series of degrees,

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.580 align:middle line:84%
and you swear upon pain of
death that you will ever

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.830 align:middle line:84%
conceal and never reveal
the secrets of the order.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And we also know
that when you get up

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.210 align:middle line:84%
to the seventh degree
of Freemasonry,

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:45.150 align:middle line:84%
called Royal Arch Mason, that
you swear that you will cover

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.620 align:middle line:84%
up anything that
your fellow Masons do

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:55.840 align:middle line:84%
that's illegal, including acts
of murder and acts of treason.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that Freemasonry
is being used as a cover

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.190 align:middle line:90%
so that secrecy is in place?

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And if so, is there some
central creed to this group?

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Is there some internal
collusion, some philosophy

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.650 align:middle line:84%
that binds them
together, that makes

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.460 align:middle line:84%
them feel different from
everyone else and perhaps

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.960 align:middle line:90%
also superior to everyone else?

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: It's not
my area of expertise.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.561 align:middle line:84%
And I know what
you're talking about.

00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:24.710 align:middle line:84%
I've seen documents supporting
exactly what you're saying,

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.586 align:middle line:84%
and they look like
they're authentic to me.

00:06:28.586 --> 00:06:29.960 align:middle line:84%
I have also talked
to people that

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.960 align:middle line:90%
say, well, that's not true.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.070 align:middle line:90%
It's not really that way at all.

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:40.740 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I was in school,
I joined a fraternity, OK?

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.590 align:middle line:84%
I was big fraternity
guy on campus.

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.940 align:middle line:90%
And we had secrets like that.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And as I recall, we had to
swear that we would do something

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.750 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.790 align:middle line:90%
Nobody took it seriously.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.202 align:middle line:84%
We'd have our drink of
beer and, oh, yeah, OK,

00:06:54.202 --> 00:06:55.660 align:middle line:84%
are we done with
that ceremony now?

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.170 align:middle line:84%
Let's go on, do something
more interesting.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:02.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to lighten
it, by sloughing if off

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.040 align:middle line:84%
with that kind of an
analogy, but I can at least

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.620 align:middle line:84%
imagine how a lot of
people in these orders

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.650 align:middle line:84%
may not take that
seriously and think,

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.060 align:middle line:84%
well, it's just a
story or it's symbolic

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.890 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:18.210 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, now, let
me get to the point

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.460 align:middle line:84%
that I've often
pondered on it, that I

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:27.860 align:middle line:84%
feel that there is something
at a much higher level that

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:31.940 align:middle line:84%
transcends all of these
cartels, all of these banking

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.860 align:middle line:84%
structures, all of
these political groups.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.210 align:middle line:84%
There seems to be something
that pulls them together

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:39.080 align:middle line:90%
that is unseen.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.520 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it is.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.380 align:middle line:84%
It could be exactly what
you're talking about.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.355 align:middle line:84%
I remember being
startled by the fact

00:07:46.355 --> 00:07:51.740 align:middle line:84%
that during the
Bolshevik Revolution,

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:56.030 align:middle line:84%
the Bolsheviks were on their
way to Russia on a boat,

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:58.872 align:middle line:84%
and they got stopped in-- I
mean the revolutionaries were

00:07:58.872 --> 00:07:59.830 align:middle line:90%
on their way to Russia.

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:06.530 align:middle line:84%
They got stopped in
Halifax up in Canada,

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:08.750 align:middle line:84%
and they were put in
prison because they

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:12.600 align:middle line:84%
were known to be going to
overthrow a government.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And the records are
very clear on that

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.650 align:middle line:84%
that they got calls
from high-ranking people

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:24.280 align:middle line:84%
in Washington, D.C., and I think
from France to the authorities

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:28.570 align:middle line:84%
there, demanding that these
men be put back on the boat

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:32.630 align:middle line:84%
and continued on their
way, which they did.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And there was no explanation as
to who these people were that

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:38.169 align:middle line:90%
called from New York or France.

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:39.990 align:middle line:90%
And who would they possibly be?

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:43.900 align:middle line:84%
What authority could come
internationally like that?

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:47.616 align:middle line:84%
And it had to be
something that is unseen.

00:08:47.616 --> 00:08:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And I run into that
over and over again

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.830 align:middle line:84%
in very dynamic
points in history,

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:57.910 align:middle line:84%
where there seems to be an
unseen force that ties people

00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:59.040 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And I don't really
know what it is,

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:06.200 align:middle line:84%
but I think it's worth
looking at and questioning

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.380 align:middle line:90%
and researching.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.550 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we'll find the answer.

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.260 align:middle line:90%
Maybe your answer is correct.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:15.650 align:middle line:84%
But I do know this, David, that
when it comes push to shove,

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:19.160 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't make too
much difference.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:23.710 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of who might be
this unseen force bringing it

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:28.160 align:middle line:84%
all together, what they are
doing has to be stopped,

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.620 align:middle line:90%
regardless of who it is.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.310 align:middle line:84%
Some people say,
well, it's the Masons.

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Some people say it's the Jews,
and we've got the Catholics.

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Or now the latest bugaboo,
of course, is the Muslims.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.350 align:middle line:90%
They're behind everything.

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And well, maybe there's some
truth to each of those points

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.220 align:middle line:84%
and some groupings at some point
in history and all of that.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.227 align:middle line:90%
But so what?

00:09:48.227 --> 00:09:48.810 align:middle line:90%
What do we do?

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Go out and shoot
all those people?

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:54.030 align:middle line:84%
Or do we get on with
the job of dismantling

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.210 align:middle line:84%
the system of collectivism
which they are building,

00:09:56.210 --> 00:10:00.050 align:middle line:84%
dismantling their central
banks, dismantling their tools

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.070 align:middle line:84%
that they're using to enslave
the rest of the world,

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:04.634 align:middle line:90%
regardless of who's behind it?

00:10:04.634 --> 00:10:06.300 align:middle line:84%
So that's where I
like to keep my focus,

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.750 align:middle line:84%
is let's get on with the
job of taking the power away

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.470 align:middle line:84%
from them, no
matter who they are.

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:13.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Ed, you wrote
about an interesting era

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:18.310 align:middle line:84%
in American history,
where possibly the vice

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:21.740 align:middle line:84%
grip that the cartel has
upon our political system

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.670 align:middle line:90%
was starting to break.

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:27.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm specifically talking
about the McCarthy era.

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:31.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of our people who
are going to be watching this,

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.170 align:middle line:84%
they might not even
know what a CD is.

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:35.140 align:middle line:84%
They've been raised
in the modern era.

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.490 align:middle line:90%
Communism is a distant memory.

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:40.090 align:middle line:90%
So who was Senator Joe McCarthy?

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And what was going on with
this Red Scare that was taking

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.740 align:middle line:90%
place in America at the time?

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Another thing I want
you to throw in there

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.250 align:middle line:84%
is that it says
in your biography

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:53.700 align:middle line:84%
that you were involved
in the George Wallace

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.740 align:middle line:90%
presidential campaign in 1968.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, George Wallace's vice
presidential candidate

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.530 align:middle line:90%
was General Curtis LeMay.

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And it says in your
biography that you actually

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:08.310 align:middle line:84%
worked as a speechwriter
for General LeMay.

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, LeMay was one of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff in the Kennedy

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.210 align:middle line:84%
administration who saw the
assassination of President John

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:18.450 align:middle line:90%
F. Kennedy.

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:22.800 align:middle line:84%
So I'm curious about how
this story of the McCarthy

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.420 align:middle line:84%
era and the communist
scare factors in?

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Is there something here
that we should know about?

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Or can it all just be dismissed
as right-wing paranoia?

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: The
McCarthy era, the era

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:40.580 align:middle line:84%
of when I became aware of what's
really going on in the world,

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.470 align:middle line:84%
was right in the middle
of that in the 1960s

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:47.220 align:middle line:84%
and moved into the
'70s and so forth.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:54.560 align:middle line:84%
But the viewpoint that I
had and those with whom

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.680 align:middle line:84%
I was working most closely
was that our primary threat

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:03.260 align:middle line:90%
at that time was communism.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's not a
popular view today

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:08.830 align:middle line:84%
to say, oh, well, that
was just a McCarthy scare.

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:11.500 align:middle line:90%
There was no real threat.

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:15.170 align:middle line:84%
They were looking for commies
under every bed and so forth.

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:17.210 align:middle line:84%
Innocent people were
having their reputations

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:22.240 align:middle line:84%
ruined by being accused of
being communists and so forth.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.880 align:middle line:84%
But that's not
the whole picture.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Some of that is true, but
there's more to it than that.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.970 align:middle line:84%
As I see it,
because I really was

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:30.940 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
that at the time,

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:35.900 align:middle line:84%
is that there was a problem
of communism at that time.

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And there was a great
deal of infiltration

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:42.450 align:middle line:84%
of communist agents, known
communist agents, members

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:44.860 align:middle line:84%
of the Communist
Party, U.S.A, who

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:47.070 align:middle line:84%
had infiltrated into
not only government

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:51.450 align:middle line:84%
positions but education
and the media, all

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:55.280 align:middle line:84%
the sensitive choke points
in American society.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.460 align:middle line:90%
They were there.

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.650 align:middle line:90%
McCarthy was right.

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:00.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's hard to
defend McCarthy today,

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.970 align:middle line:84%
because it's almost a catch
phrase, 'Oh, McCarthyite'.

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's synonymous with being
some kind of a crazy guy that

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:12.541 align:middle line:84%
had no respect for individual
disagreement or anything

00:13:12.541 --> 00:13:13.040 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.460 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is,
McCarthy was right.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And the documents have
come out since then proving

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:22.150 align:middle line:84%
that he was right, but they
don't get much publicity,

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:25.460 align:middle line:84%
because we don't want to tamper
with the image of McCarthyism

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:27.820 align:middle line:84%
meaning some kind
of a witch hunt.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.530 align:middle line:84%
The problem with
Joe McCarthy, who

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:33.800 align:middle line:84%
was the senator from Wisconsin,
is that he didn't really

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.140 align:middle line:84%
understand the media
very well, and he

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:38.110 align:middle line:90%
was a pushover for the media.

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And he would lose
his temper on camera.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And he would say some of the
most ridiculous, stupid things.

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And he really looked
bad on camera.

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:50.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, and the media just
egged him on and just drew him

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.330 align:middle line:90%
into those kinds of situations.

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And of course, those
are valuable tools

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:57.070 align:middle line:84%
if you want to
discredit somebody.

00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:00.950 align:middle line:84%
Just find them on
camera, like I am,

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:03.860 align:middle line:84%
saying something that
is really bad or stupid.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:07.735 align:middle line:84%
And McCarthy gave them plenty
of opportunities to do that.

00:14:07.735 --> 00:14:09.860 align:middle line:84%
But the truth of the matter
is, and I say it again,

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:11.330 align:middle line:90%
is that he was right.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.770 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of infiltration
of communist agents.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And most of them were
never really rooted out.

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:20.880 align:middle line:90%
They were still there.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, most of them
have died by now.

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know whether they
were replaced by others or not.

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:29.330 align:middle line:84%
But the real essence to that
question lies in the fact

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:31.850 align:middle line:84%
that, although it was
real that communism

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:34.510 align:middle line:84%
was on the move in those days,
not only in the United States

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:37.390 align:middle line:84%
but around the world,
those of us who

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:41.160 align:middle line:84%
were in the forefront of
that anti-communist movement

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:46.360 align:middle line:84%
were somewhat blinded by a very
important movement in history

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.630 align:middle line:84%
that was going on
right under our noses.

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:50.700 align:middle line:90%
And we didn't see it.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And that is that
communism is merely

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:58.030 align:middle line:84%
one of the manifestations
of this deeper thing called

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:59.910 align:middle line:90%
collectivism.

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And it has other manifestations
such as fascism, Nazism,

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:07.730 align:middle line:84%
socialism, communism,
liberalism,

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:10.180 align:middle line:84%
and all different variants
of the same thing,

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.360 align:middle line:90%
which is really collectivism.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.050 align:middle line:84%
The philosophy is the same
in all of these things.

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't realize that our
own government at that time,

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:20.140 align:middle line:84%
which we were
fiercely defending,

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:25.180 align:middle line:84%
was rapidly becoming more
and more collectivist itself.

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And under a different label
and under the American flag

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.040 align:middle line:84%
and under these
feelings of patriotism,

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:35.680 align:middle line:84%
it was rapidly evolving
into the very thing

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.680 align:middle line:84%
we were fighting under
a different name.

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.290 align:middle line:90%
We didn't see it.

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:44.460 align:middle line:84%
So we were totally over here
worried about communists,

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.580 align:middle line:84%
and we should have
been, but we weren't

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:51.020 align:middle line:84%
worried about the development
of the same ideology,

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:53.450 align:middle line:84%
not under the name of
communism, but under the name

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:56.780 align:middle line:84%
of Americanism,
or anti-communism,

00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:00.230 align:middle line:84%
was being developed
right in our own society.

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:03.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, fortunately, we were
able with the passage of time

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.110 align:middle line:90%
to correct that error.

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And now in retrospect, we
can see that we were blinded.

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And now our movement is a little
more, I think, well-rounded.

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:16.140 align:middle line:84%
We can spot collectivism no
matter what name it uses.

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:20.420 align:middle line:90%
And it's a handy talent to have.

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.970 align:middle line:90%
It's a handy experience to have.

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:25.330 align:middle line:84%
I urge that everybody get
used to the idea of quit

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:28.140 align:middle line:84%
saying communism, fascism,
Nazism, socialism,

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.390 align:middle line:84%
and all that stuff,
liberalism, republicanism,

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:31.459 align:middle line:90%
democrat-- all of that.

00:16:31.459 --> 00:16:32.500 align:middle line:90%
Those words mean nothing.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.680 align:middle line:84%
Get to the core of it,
which is collectivism

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.200 align:middle line:90%
versus individualism.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And I urge everybody
to get clear on that.

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:43.930 align:middle line:84%
Because once they do, then
all of these other phrases

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:44.710 align:middle line:90%
kind of fall away.

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:48.010 align:middle line:84%
They're just labels for
pretty much the same thing.

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:51.600 align:middle line:84%
So I look back on that
period of my own involvement,

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.880 align:middle line:84%
and it was quite a
learning experience.

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.530 align:middle line:84%
There were some
things I did that I

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:58.660 align:middle line:84%
wish I hadn't done because
of that blindness that I had.

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:02.530 align:middle line:84%
But I guess it was just part
of the learning experience.

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:03.860 align:middle line:90%
So it's all very welcome.

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And now you mention
Curtis LeMay.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:06.280 align:middle line:90%
General LeMay.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:10.119 align:middle line:84%
It's true that
when he was running

00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:14.569 align:middle line:84%
on the ticket, the political
ticket with George Wallace,

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:18.119 align:middle line:84%
I volunteered to be a
speechwriter for him.

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:19.270 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to pay me.

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:21.810 align:middle line:84%
There was a nice salary
that was being drawn up.

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:24.171 align:middle line:84%
All these people on
these campaign trips

00:17:24.171 --> 00:17:25.920 align:middle line:84%
make good money while
they're on the trip.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.566 align:middle line:84%
They figure make
it now, because it

00:17:27.566 --> 00:17:29.690 align:middle line:84%
will be a long time before
I get another assignment

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:30.980 align:middle line:90%
like this one.

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:33.750 align:middle line:84%
But I volunteered
to do it for $1.

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:35.360 align:middle line:90%
I said, I'll charge you $1.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And they looked at
me like I was crazy.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I did
it is not because I was

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.900 align:middle line:90%
a great fan of George Wallace.

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.550 align:middle line:84%
I knew nothing
about Curtis LeMay

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:47.220 align:middle line:84%
except he was a famous general,
a head of the Air Force,

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:50.210 align:middle line:90%
the strategic command.

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:53.110 align:middle line:84%
He was a very famous guy, and
he was running as the running

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.970 align:middle line:90%
mate with Wallace.

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And I was enthused because I
saw that as any alternative

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:01.140 align:middle line:84%
to the old trap of
the Republican Party

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:04.820 align:middle line:84%
and the Democratic Party, the
two branches of the same party.

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.760 align:middle line:84%
I could see even then that
that was the wrong way to go.

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:11.132 align:middle line:84%
So I thought that anything
other than that-- bad thinking,

00:18:11.132 --> 00:18:12.590 align:middle line:84%
but nevertheless,
that's what I was

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:15.800 align:middle line:84%
thinking-- anything other than
that would be worth my support.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:19.380 align:middle line:84%
So I volunteered to write
speeches for Curtis LeMay.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And so I traveled
around in the cavalcade

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:22.820 align:middle line:90%
and all the police escorts.

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:25.145 align:middle line:84%
And I went from city to
city, and I wrote a couple

00:18:25.145 --> 00:18:27.040 align:middle line:90%
of speeches for the general.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.860 align:middle line:90%
And he never read any of them.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.140 align:middle line:90%
I worked really hard on those.

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:34.700 align:middle line:84%
I worked out what I thought
was a good foreign policy

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.730 align:middle line:84%
statement for the United
States, and I'd say, now,

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:38.870 align:middle line:90%
this is my speech, General.

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:40.870 align:middle line:84%
Do you see anything in
there that you don't like

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:43.450 align:middle line:90%
or we could change or amplify?

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:45.900 align:middle line:84%
He'd be, oh, that's
good, that's good.

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.400 align:middle line:84%
But what would
happen, he would get

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:52.410 align:middle line:84%
before the Press Club
or the press conference,

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:55.120 align:middle line:84%
and these reporters
were so good.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:58.610 align:middle line:90%
They did the same thing to him.

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:01.650 align:middle line:84%
They would get him off base
simply by-- they'd start off

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:02.820 align:middle line:90%
with a question like this.

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:09.494 align:middle line:84%
Well, General LeMay, is it
true that you are a racist?

00:19:09.494 --> 00:19:11.350 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:14.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, he's got this speech
here about foreign policy,

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:16.865 align:middle line:84%
and he's, no, it's
not true I'm a racist.

00:19:16.865 --> 00:19:18.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, how come-- and
they start asking,

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:20.220 align:middle line:84%
well, So-and-so says
you're a racist,

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.130 align:middle line:84%
or you're supporting
George Wallace.

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And don't you think that
Negroes should have equality?

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And are you against
education for black people?

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.040 align:middle line:90%
And all these things.

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.430 align:middle line:90%
And his speech was gone.

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:33.920 align:middle line:84%
He was off in a defensive mode,
and he would lose his temper.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.160 align:middle line:90%
And he just blew it every time.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.775 align:middle line:84%
So after about,
oh, I don't know,

00:19:37.775 --> 00:19:40.200 align:middle line:84%
three or four weeks,
I just said, bye-bye.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm going back to
California and get back

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:45.740 align:middle line:90%
to whatever I have to do.

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:47.740 align:middle line:84%
So that was my big
experience with Curtis LeMay,

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:50.940 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't know anything
about him at the time except

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:53.420 align:middle line:90%
that he was a famous general.

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:55.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Ed, what do
you think about the idea

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:59.010 align:middle line:84%
that the cartel that
we've been speaking about

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:02.760 align:middle line:84%
owns both sides of
the conflicts that we

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:07.010 align:middle line:84%
see playing out on the
headlines and the nightly news?

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:10.900 align:middle line:84%
We spoke about the communist
Red Scare, the McCarthy era.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:14.180 align:middle line:84%
Were these communists
actually enemies?

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Or is it some form of
controlled opposition

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:21.300 align:middle line:84%
that the same cartel
is using to work

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:24.630 align:middle line:84%
both sides against the
middle to steer society

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:28.120 align:middle line:84%
towards their collective goal,
which as you've been saying

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:31.910 align:middle line:90%
is some form of collectivism?

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: David, I
think both are true.

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:37.020 align:middle line:84%
I think depending on what
circumstance or what event

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.040 align:middle line:84%
or what period of time
we're talking about,

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:43.230 align:middle line:84%
both of those tactics
are being used.

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:46.420 align:middle line:84%
The old-style
communist infiltration

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:50.450 align:middle line:84%
into the government, where they
have little cells-- actually,

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:52.580 align:middle line:84%
they called them
cells in Washington.

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And they would meet every
week in somebody's apartment,

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:58.610 align:middle line:84%
and they would drive up
separately and park the cars

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:01.610 align:middle line:84%
a block away so nobody could
take their license numbers.

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:02.810 align:middle line:90%
And it was all very secret.

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:03.940 align:middle line:90%
And it was real.

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:05.410 align:middle line:84%
But that is not
happening anymore.

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:06.860 align:middle line:90%
That's long gone.

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:08.720 align:middle line:84%
Most of these people,
if they are still

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:12.730 align:middle line:84%
members of the communist
cabal, they probably

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:15.350 align:middle line:84%
are not members of the
Communist party officially.

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:17.400 align:middle line:84%
They learned that
that's silly stuff.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:20.750 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to carry
a membership card around

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:23.030 align:middle line:90%
to do the job.

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:24.590 align:middle line:90%
So that has changed.

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:28.920 align:middle line:84%
But what I learned long after
those days, as I got deeper

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:32.730 align:middle line:84%
into the real involvement
of our government,

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:35.140 align:middle line:84%
is that this other
side of collectivism,

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:38.170 align:middle line:84%
the so-called right-wing
side, as opposed

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:41.900 align:middle line:84%
to the left-wing side,
was growing up around

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.220 align:middle line:84%
primarily another group
called the Council

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.280 align:middle line:90%
on Foreign Relations.

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:49.522 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
interesting group.

00:21:49.522 --> 00:21:50.980 align:middle line:84%
I know we don't
have time for that.

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:56.250 align:middle line:84%
But they believed pretty much
the same as the communists.

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:58.880 align:middle line:84%
But they were enemies
of the communists,

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.990 align:middle line:84%
primarily because
they wanted dominance.

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:04.510 align:middle line:84%
It's still a war around the
world between this left-wing

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:07.430 align:middle line:84%
and this right-wing
branch of collectivism,

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:11.730 align:middle line:84%
communism versus what we
would call the free world,

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:13.450 align:middle line:84%
or what was the free
world, has become

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:17.150 align:middle line:84%
a right-wing
philosophical movement,

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:19.100 align:middle line:84%
which is almost
indistinguishable

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:21.280 align:middle line:84%
from the left-wing
philosophical movement,

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.560 align:middle line:84%
except they're enemies and
they're fighting for dominance,

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:26.310 align:middle line:84%
not because they
disagree with each other

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:27.970 align:middle line:90%
on any major principle.

00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:30.430 align:middle line:84%
It's just a question of who's
going to be the big cheese.

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:32.794 align:middle line:84%
That's what it's really
all about at the UN.

00:22:32.794 --> 00:22:34.460 align:middle line:84%
That's what it's all
about in the United

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:36.970 align:middle line:84%
States between the
Republicans and the Democrats.

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:38.990 align:middle line:84%
They agree on all
the basic principles.

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:40.620 align:middle line:84%
It's just going
to be who is going

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:42.850 align:middle line:84%
to be the big change
in the White House

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:47.040 align:middle line:84%
and dominate the Congress
and the Senate and so forth.

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:50.010 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I don't know that
that answers your question,

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:53.570 align:middle line:84%
but I think that that
is the thing that people

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:57.100 align:middle line:84%
need to focus on,
is that there's

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:58.890 align:middle line:84%
no difference between
right and left.

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:02.210 align:middle line:84%
They're both variant
forms of collectivism.

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
that when I first

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.060 align:middle line:90%
started back in the 1960s.

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:11.290 align:middle line:84%
I thought we had communism
and we had fascism and Nazism,

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:14.400 align:middle line:84%
but they were dead, because they
were defeated in war, right?

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.040 align:middle line:84%
So we didn't worry
about them anymore.

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.140 align:middle line:84%
And as I said before,
I wasn't aware

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:21.210 align:middle line:84%
that it was growing
right under our noses

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:24.870 align:middle line:90%
under the name of Americanism.

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Why do you
think this cartel would

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:31.280 align:middle line:90%
want people to die?

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:35.140 align:middle line:84%
How could any sane
and loving person

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:41.520 align:middle line:84%
want to suppress cheap, workable
cures for cancer like Laetrile?

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:45.800 align:middle line:84%
Why would they want to send
people to their deaths in war?

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And why would they want to have
such an iron grip of control

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:52.250 align:middle line:90%
over our society?

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:56.780 align:middle line:84%
Is there some different
mentality in this cartel?

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:59.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: I do think there
is quite a different mentality

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:04.190 align:middle line:84%
between the dominant members
of these various cartels

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:06.580 align:middle line:90%
and the average citizen.

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:10.720 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean that
the cartel leaders really

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.300 align:middle line:84%
want people to die in
the sense that that

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:15.974 align:middle line:90%
is their primary motive.

00:24:15.974 --> 00:24:16.890 align:middle line:90%
I look at it this way.

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:22.250 align:middle line:84%
I think what they really
want is power and money.

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And if people have to die in
order to achieve that, well,

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.820 align:middle line:90%
then so be it.

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:27.720 align:middle line:90%
It's too bad.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.610 align:middle line:84%
It's not that they
want them to die,

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:32.640 align:middle line:84%
but they're perfectly willing
to accept that as collateral

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:36.130 align:middle line:84%
damage to achieve
their real goal, which

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:39.680 align:middle line:84%
is this ultimate control and
power, which they finally

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.880 align:middle line:90%
call the New World Order.

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.700 align:middle line:84%
So I think that it's
just the question of,

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.820 align:middle line:84%
yes, they're willing
to sacrifice lives,

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:48.594 align:middle line:84%
but that's not
their primary goal.

00:24:48.594 --> 00:24:50.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, you get into
the area-- well,

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:55.750 align:middle line:84%
some people are really dominated
by this idea population

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:56.250 align:middle line:90%
control.

00:24:56.250 --> 00:25:00.260 align:middle line:84%
We have to limit the population,
reduce the population.

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And even there, I don't
see them as saying,

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:04.060 align:middle line:90%
we want to kill people.

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:08.270 align:middle line:84%
But they're very adamant
about reducing fertility rates

00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:13.950 align:middle line:84%
and maybe reducing
longevity a little bit.

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:15.670 align:middle line:84%
They don't care
if the environment

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:17.290 align:middle line:90%
is loaded with toxins.

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:18.040 align:middle line:90%
They don't care.

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:21.930 align:middle line:90%


00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:23.840 align:middle line:84%
Putting toxins into
the environment,

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.490 align:middle line:84%
spraying things into
the environment,

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:28.570 align:middle line:84%
gives them control over
weather, for example.

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:32.210 align:middle line:84%
So they can use that
as a warfare weapon.

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's too bad if
people have to get sick,

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:37.450 align:middle line:84%
but this is national security
now we're talking about.

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:39.090 align:middle line:90%
This is America first, now.

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:41.430 align:middle line:10%
We've got to be
militarily strong,

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:44.520 align:middle line:10%
and that means we have
to control the weather so

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:48.030 align:middle line:10%
that we can have dominance
over other nations.

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:53.310 align:middle line:10%
If they want to
limit the population,

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:58.410 align:middle line:10%
the preferred way is to dump
fluorides into the water system

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:01.400 align:middle line:10%
and tell the people
it's to prevent cavities

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.930 align:middle line:10%
so they'll be happy about it.

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:06.690 align:middle line:84%
Knowing full well that the
fluoride that goes in there,

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:09.930 align:middle line:84%
the primary effect is to
reduce the fertility rate

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:12.660 align:middle line:84%
and reduce the
population's ability

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:15.510 align:middle line:90%
to reproduce itself and expand.

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:17.960 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, so all of
that means that they do

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.980 align:middle line:84%
have a different perspective
than the average person.

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.830 align:middle line:84%
But I still don't see it as,
for most of those people,

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:26.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't see that their
goal is to kill people

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:28.289 align:middle line:90%
and to make them suffer.

00:26:28.289 --> 00:26:29.830 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: When we
think about the idea

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:32.260 align:middle line:10%
that the cabal controls
the mainstream media,

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:34.804 align:middle line:10%
we have to relearn everything
we thought we knew.

00:26:34.804 --> 00:26:36.220 align:middle line:10%
The people who are
being presented

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:39.490 align:middle line:10%
as cranks and crackpots,
who are supposedly

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:44.490 align:middle line:10%
lunatics or hot heads, may not
actually be so crazy after all.

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And after what
you've heard here,

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:49.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you can start to see
that the same is undoubtedly

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:51.370 align:middle line:90%
true for Senator Joe McCarthy.

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:53.990 align:middle line:84%
So this is psychologically
overwhelming information.

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:56.060 align:middle line:10%
The idea that this
cartel really exists,

00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:58.840 align:middle line:10%
the idea that it's
spread this far and wide,

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.075 align:middle line:10%
is totally outrageous.

00:27:00.075 --> 00:27:02.200 align:middle line:10%
And in the next episode,
we're going to bring it up

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:05.740 align:middle line:10%
into the 20th century
with the Federal Reserve

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:08.790 align:middle line:10%
and all of the ways in which
the things that we've learned

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:11.250 align:middle line:10%
consolidate into
what we know now.

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:14.560 align:middle line:84%
That's coming up next
time here on "Disclosure."

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:18.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, David Wilcock,
speaking truth to power

00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:20.880 align:middle line:90%
and giving power to the truth.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:24.830 align:middle line:90%
