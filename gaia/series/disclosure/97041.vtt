>>DAVID WILCOCK:
I'm David Wilcock,

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.992 align:middle line:90%
and welcome to "Disclosure."

00:00:20.992 --> 00:00:22.980 align:middle line:10%
"Disclosure," of
course, is the concept

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.290 align:middle line:10%
that there are secrets that
have been hidden from us that we

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.790 align:middle line:10%
need to know in order to get
to the next level as a planet

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.150 align:middle line:10%
and as a civilization.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.060 align:middle line:84%
These hidden truths
are not doing

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.930 align:middle line:90%
us any good by being withheld.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.300 align:middle line:10%
We need to grow up as a planet.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.040 align:middle line:10%
We need to recognize
that there have

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.270 align:middle line:10%
been advanced civilizations
on Earth before the one

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.960 align:middle line:10%
that we built now.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.140 align:middle line:84%
That is the core of what Graham
Hancock has been telling us

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.620 align:middle line:84%
ever since his groundbreaking
book "Fingerprints of the Gods"

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.100 align:middle line:84%
in 1995 that summarized an
incredible amount of data

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.030 align:middle line:84%
from over 300 books that
I'd read before then.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And he took the very best
stuff and put it all together,

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.790 align:middle line:84%
and then had a whole
bunch of things

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.820 align:middle line:90%
that I hadn't seen before.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want you to
remember that I also

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.680 align:middle line:84%
have had the distinct honor
and privilege of being

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.720 align:middle line:84%
able to speak with many
different insiders who

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.580 align:middle line:84%
have access to highly
classified information.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking 35 levels above
the President of the United

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.330 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.610 align:middle line:84%
Cosmic Top Secret is where
you get to at that level.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And once you have
Cosmic clearance,

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.220 align:middle line:84%
you are brought into
a world in which there

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.180 align:middle line:84%
is an ongoing set of
extraterrestrial politics

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.260 align:middle line:90%
involved in life on Earth.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.360 align:middle line:84%
So this ancient
civilization that

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.290 align:middle line:84%
was destroyed some 12,980
years ago, or whenever it was,

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.280 align:middle line:84%
that civilization
is nothing new.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.580 align:middle line:84%
By the time it got to
Earth, they already

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.200 align:middle line:84%
had a history that
apparently goes back

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.410 align:middle line:84%
some five million years
in our solar system.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.010 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, they colonized
from the outside, in.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.190 align:middle line:84%
They had settled on a very large
planet that actually exploded

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.700 align:middle line:84%
in the course of the wars
they had with each other,

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.500 align:middle line:84%
becoming what we now
call the Asteroid Belt.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.930 align:middle line:84%
But before then it was,
in fact, a super Earth.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And these people then
eventually migrated to the Earth

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.480 align:middle line:84%
and colonized it
and settled here.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And when they did so they also
had very advanced technology.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.860 align:middle line:84%
So this ancient
civilization actually

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.970 align:middle line:84%
did have capabilities that
we do not now possess.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.200 align:middle line:84%
When I start talking to
Graham Hancock about this,

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.360 align:middle line:84%
you'll notice that his belief
is that these people may not

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.110 align:middle line:84%
have had the kind of
technology that we do,

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.310 align:middle line:84%
but they certainly had an
alternative technology.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And we talk a little about
Tibetan acoustic levitation.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.090 align:middle line:84%
The monks in Tibet were actually
seen by a Dutch explorer

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.900 align:middle line:84%
as having the ability to make
music using these weird metal

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.550 align:middle line:84%
drums and these long
trumpets, and they were

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.900 align:middle line:90%
able to get stones to levitate.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.020 align:middle line:84%
It was apparently photographed,
it was apparently filmed.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And then those
films were sent back

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.390 align:middle line:84%
to England after which time they
were confiscated and declared

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.960 align:middle line:90%
classified.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.870 align:middle line:84%
So is there the possibility
that these secrets

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.320 align:middle line:90%
have been kept from us?

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.900 align:middle line:90%
And what could we find out?

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.540 align:middle line:84%
We're also going to take
you on a trip to Peru

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.250 align:middle line:84%
to a very enigmatic set of
stone ruins called Saksaywaman.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.260 align:middle line:84%
When we go to
Saksaywaman, what we find

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.340 align:middle line:84%
is incredibly large
stones that have literally

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.800 align:middle line:84%
been mushed together, almost
like melted marshmallows.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And as you're going to hear
Graham Hancock explain,

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.540 align:middle line:84%
some of these stones
are 15 to 20 feet deep

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.670 align:middle line:84%
and they may have as many
as 12 to 15 facets on them.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.350 align:middle line:84%
But yet these cracks between
the stones are so fine that you

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.580 align:middle line:84%
literally cannot insert a razor
blade or even a human hair

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.429 align:middle line:90%
in the crack.

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And yet we're supposed
to believe that they

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.590 align:middle line:90%
were carved together this way.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.960 align:middle line:84%
All the evidence
clearly suggests

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.300 align:middle line:84%
that the stones were able
to be liquefied so that they

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.106 align:middle line:90%
were just like soft taffy.

00:04:16.106 --> 00:04:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And you're also
going to hear him

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.230 align:middle line:84%
talk about this
very enigmatic idea

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.250 align:middle line:84%
that there are underground
chambers beneath Saksaywaman

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.760 align:middle line:84%
in Peru that the Peruvian
government has a locked us out

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.280 align:middle line:90%
of.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.800 align:middle line:84%
We're not allowed to see
what's going on in there.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.020 align:middle line:84%
Many of my insiders
have said that there

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.910 align:middle line:84%
are a huge number of underground
tunnels in South America,

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.180 align:middle line:84%
and we have been completely
kept from this information.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.010 align:middle line:90%
Disclosure is about the truth.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.870 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes the truth hurts.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And when we find
out that there could

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.870 align:middle line:84%
have been such an
advanced civilization here

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.280 align:middle line:84%
that got completely wiped out
by a massive catastrophe, that's

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.220 align:middle line:90%
a very unsettling notion.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.420 align:middle line:84%
So I start out in our next
interview with Hancock

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.710 align:middle line:84%
by describing to him how,
even something like a school

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.020 align:middle line:84%
bus-- it's going to sit in
the junk yard for 50 years

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.440 align:middle line:90%
is going to rust away.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.730 align:middle line:84%
So how much of our
civilization would really

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.430 align:middle line:90%
survive an epic catastrophe?

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.840 align:middle line:90%
Not very much.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's something
to think about as we

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.180 align:middle line:84%
begin with part two of
my enigmatic interview

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.580 align:middle line:90%
with Graham Hancock.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.690 align:middle line:90%
Check it out.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.840 align:middle line:84%
When you go into a
junk yard and you

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.020 align:middle line:84%
see cars that have been
sitting there since the 1950s,

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.390 align:middle line:84%
the iron is already
turning to iron oxide,

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.320 align:middle line:84%
the oxygen is acting on the
iron, and they're rusting away.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.611 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM HANCOCK: That's right.

00:05:34.611 --> 00:05:36.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So people
might think, well,

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.330 align:middle line:84%
if these people
had anti-gravity,

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.780 align:middle line:84%
if they could levitate
large blocks of stone,

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.940 align:middle line:90%
where's all the iPhones?

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.260 align:middle line:90%
Where's all the tools?

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.372 align:middle line:84%
But what would really
happen in a case of what

00:05:47.372 --> 00:05:49.830 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about, this
flood that you're talking about?

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.010 align:middle line:10%
>>HANCOCK: Well, I think
first and foremost, we

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.160 align:middle line:10%
have to get to grips with
how massive this event is.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:04.660 align:middle line:10%
How earth-shaking it is
in every possible way.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.460 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking about
a small-scale cataclysm.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.550 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about a
gigantic event, which

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.492 align:middle line:84%
is responsible for large scale
extinctions of animal species

00:06:13.492 --> 00:06:14.950 align:middle line:84%
all around the
world, which changes

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.360 align:middle line:84%
the face of the
planet, which sets

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.580 align:middle line:84%
in motion a dramatic
episode of sea level rise.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.910 align:middle line:84%
It's natural for
civilized people

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:27.400 align:middle line:84%
to put their biggest
resources along coastlines,

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.420 align:middle line:84%
and it's exactly the
coastlines in the scenario

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:32.890 align:middle line:84%
where we're looking
at now for what

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.870 align:middle line:84%
happened between
12,980 years ago,

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.540 align:middle line:84%
and then 11,600 years
ago, and after that.

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.699 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly the coastlines
that get most severely hit.

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:45.490 align:middle line:84%
If there was anything
on the North American

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:50.580 align:middle line:84%
continent in the way
of those huge floods

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.100 align:middle line:84%
that were released
by the comet impact

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.750 align:middle line:84%
into the North
American Ice Cap, it

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.700 align:middle line:90%
would all have been swept away.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.160 align:middle line:84%
Nothing, nothing
would be left at all.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: If Antarctica moved
from essentially a tropical

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.314 align:middle line:90%
climate to the South Pole--

00:07:04.314 --> 00:07:06.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: As is envisaged in
the Earth Crust Displacement

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:09.880 align:middle line:84%
Theory, which Flavio
Barbiero finesses

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.510 align:middle line:84%
with the notion of a
comet impact setting

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:13.800 align:middle line:90%
the Earth in spin.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: The momentum that would
be caused by that, and the fact

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.720 align:middle line:84%
that water just sloshes
around, we would be looking

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.169 align:middle line:84%
at worldwide tsunamis,
like Fukushima,

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:24.210 align:middle line:90%
but worse than Fukushima.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:24.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: But worse.

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:25.440 align:middle line:90%
But worse.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: How tall do you
think those waves would be?

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Could go
hundreds of feet tall,

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.910 align:middle line:84%
and could push very
far inland, and really

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:37.042 align:middle line:84%
bring to an end everything that
would be called a civilization.

00:07:37.042 --> 00:07:38.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And wouldn't
it make sense

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.610 align:middle line:84%
that everything would
be first crushed,

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.764 align:middle line:84%
and then buried under at least
30 feet of mud everywhere.

00:07:44.764 --> 00:07:45.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Absolutely.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And nothing
that would stay above--

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: And then
would rapidly degrade.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing I think we
need to take into account is

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:56.030 align:middle line:84%
that we cannot know that
a former civilization had

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:58.190 align:middle line:84%
the same kind of
technology that we do.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:00.800 align:middle line:84%
They may have had very
different kind of technology.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.200 align:middle line:84%
See, I often think
that our civilization

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.000 align:middle line:84%
has gone down the root
of mechanical advantage.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.070 align:middle line:84%
We think in terms of
mechanisms and machines,

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:12.620 align:middle line:84%
and we do things
through machines.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.810 align:middle line:84%
We've been through a
massive machine age.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:16.950 align:middle line:84%
We're now, perhaps, coming
into the digital age.

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:22.260 align:middle line:84%
But we're still doing things,
we're using our clever minds

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260 align:middle line:84%
to create technologies that
can move things for us,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.000 align:middle line:90%
if you like.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.550 align:middle line:84%
What I think we
have to consider,

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:32.030 align:middle line:84%
and what many of the
ancient myths pay tribute to

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:34.990 align:middle line:84%
is the possibility that
a former civilization

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:39.720 align:middle line:84%
was able to move things
around without the hardware

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.510 align:middle line:84%
that we need in
order to do that.

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:44.860 align:middle line:84%
Because as we've
invested ourselves

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.872 align:middle line:84%
in the hardware and the
mechanical root for thousands

00:08:47.872 --> 00:08:49.330 align:middle line:84%
and thousands of
years, we may have

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:52.710 align:middle line:84%
let lapse faculties
of the human mind.

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:55.390 align:middle line:84%
Which an earlier
civilization might have

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:56.730 align:middle line:90%
elaborated to a higher degree.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.700 align:middle line:84%
So we shouldn't
necessarily-- first of all,

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.490 align:middle line:84%
the key point is
that the cataclysm

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:04.450 align:middle line:84%
is so large that it would leave
very little remnant anyway.

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:06.500 align:middle line:84%
But secondly, in
what remnant is left,

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.095 align:middle line:84%
we shouldn't be
looking for a mirror

00:09:08.095 --> 00:09:10.160 align:middle line:90%
image of our own civilization.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.070 align:middle line:84%
We shouldn't be looking
for our kind of tech.

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:14.403 align:middle line:84%
We shouldn't be looking for
our kind of material things.

00:09:14.403 --> 00:09:17.220 align:middle line:84%
What we're looking at we might
not even recognize it as tech.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.900 align:middle line:90%
We might not know what it is.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Just as 10,000 years from now,
whatever small remnants was

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.160 align:middle line:84%
left of our civilization
after a global cataclysm

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.550 align:middle line:84%
might not be recognized
for what they are.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:30.370 align:middle line:84%
Because they've been
part of our culture,

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:32.687 align:middle line:84%
but they might not be part
of that future culture.

00:09:32.687 --> 00:09:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Are you familiar with
the Tibetan acoustic levitation

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:35.770 align:middle line:90%
story?

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:38.228 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: I am familiar with
it, and it's well documented.

00:09:38.228 --> 00:09:40.356 align:middle line:90%


00:09:40.356 --> 00:09:41.230 align:middle line:90%
There's a photograph.

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:44.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean the Tibetan monks
were able to levitate

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.590 align:middle line:84%
substantial blocks of stone
of the order, certainly,

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:50.030 align:middle line:90%
of hundreds of pounds.

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:53.427 align:middle line:84%
Were able to levitate them to
a great height using sound.

00:09:53.427 --> 00:09:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Let's just
briefly go through that.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.830 align:middle line:84%
So there's a quarter
circle of monks.

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:58.860 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yup.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And they've
got trumpets and drums.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.230 align:middle line:84%
And Dan Davidson in
his book "Shape Power"

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:07.020 align:middle line:84%
analyzes the dimensions
because the trumpets and drums

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:07.622 align:middle line:90%
are measured.

00:10:07.622 --> 00:10:08.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Right.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And they're all
harmonic subdivisions

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:14.340 align:middle line:84%
of proportion to the
size of the stone.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.180 align:middle line:84%
So they start making
this terrible clanging

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:19.840 align:middle line:84%
noise-- it's not leather,
it's metal on the drums.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.680 align:middle line:84%
They clang the drums,
they blast the horns,

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:23.700 align:middle line:90%
and they're chanting.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:24.389 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah.

00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:26.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And they just
keep amping up the rhythm.

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:28.680 align:middle line:84%
So I think it starts, it's
like every three minutes

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.710 align:middle line:90%
and they build it up--

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:29.976 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah.

00:10:29.976 --> 00:10:30.885 align:middle line:90%
I forget the details--

00:10:30.885 --> 00:10:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: --till it's
faster and faster.

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: But the
bottom line is--

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:33.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And the
stone starts wobbling,

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:35.910 align:middle line:84%
and then it just starts
to slowly rise up

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:37.350 align:middle line:84%
into the air, on
a parabolic arc.

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:37.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Exactly.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Which totally
defies the laws of physics

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.210 align:middle line:90%
that we would understand.

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:42.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: It totally
defies our understanding

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:43.858 align:middle line:90%
of the laws of physics.

00:10:43.858 --> 00:10:44.600 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Although, we
have, ourselves, been able to

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.890 align:middle line:84%
use sound to levitate
very small objects.

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:52.010 align:middle line:90%
That is happening now.

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:56.740 align:middle line:84%
We haven't got to the stage of
levitating very large objects.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.280 align:middle line:84%
Again, I think
because our minds are

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.460 align:middle line:84%
locked in the mechanical
frame of reference,

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.940 align:middle line:84%
that we want levers
to move things.

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.946 align:middle line:84%
Whereas there might be a whole
other way of doing things.

00:11:05.946 --> 00:11:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think when we
look at the mystery

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:11.390 align:middle line:84%
of a former civilization, we
have to keep our minds open

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:13.760 align:middle line:84%
to the possibility that they
did things in a completely

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:14.676 align:middle line:90%
different way from us.

00:11:14.676 --> 00:11:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And a sound-based
technology would not

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:21.560 align:middle line:90%
leave behind mechanical objects.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And we would then be
mystified as to how

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.250 align:middle line:90%
they did what they did.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.950 align:middle line:84%
So we have to broaden our
perspective and our frame

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:31.500 align:middle line:84%
of reference and
look at traditions

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.390 align:middle line:84%
like the ancient Egyptian
tradition of priests

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:37.960 align:middle line:84%
singing the giant
blocks into place.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.730 align:middle line:84%
That some kind of chant
was involved in this.

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:44.169 align:middle line:84%
And instead of dismissing
that as just a fantasy

00:11:44.169 --> 00:11:45.710 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient
Egyptian storytellers,

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:47.940 align:middle line:84%
we have to say, well,
what could that mean?

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.730 align:middle line:84%
Could we be looking
at the traces

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:53.045 align:middle line:84%
of a much earlier technology
that we don't understand there?

00:11:53.045 --> 00:11:54.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, I'm
jumping ahead of it,

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.940 align:middle line:90%
but I want to do this right now.

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:57.980 align:middle line:90%
The Ark of the Covenant.

00:11:57.980 --> 00:11:58.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: The Walls of Jericho.

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:00.326 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah.

00:12:00.326 --> 00:12:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Could you
tell that story for us?

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Well, the
Ark of the Covenant

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:05.730 align:middle line:84%
was an important part of my life
for quite a long time because I

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:08.188 align:middle line:84%
wrote a book about it called
"The Sign and the Seal," which

00:12:08.188 --> 00:12:09.260 align:middle line:90%
was published in 1992.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And in writing that
book, I had to research

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:19.180 align:middle line:84%
the story of the Arc of the
Covenant in some depth, which

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:22.700 align:middle line:84%
is, of course, told extensively
in the Old Testament

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.140 align:middle line:90%
of the Bible.

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:26.800 align:middle line:84%
But is also related--
there's even more

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.351 align:middle line:84%
material in Jewish legends
and traditions concerning

00:12:29.351 --> 00:12:30.350 align:middle line:90%
the Ark of the Covenant.

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And what emerges from all
of this mass of material

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.887 align:middle line:84%
is an eerie feeling
that we're looking

00:12:37.887 --> 00:12:39.720 align:middle line:84%
at the description of
a technological object

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:44.040 align:middle line:84%
of some kind, that it's
some kind of machine.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And actually,
first and foremost,

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:50.350 align:middle line:84%
some kind of deadly
weapon associated

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:55.280 align:middle line:84%
with very nasty deity,
who we know as Jehovah,

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:59.290 align:middle line:84%
who is a real killer
deity, who is constantly

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:02.740 align:middle line:84%
inflicting the most awful
punishments on people.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And the Ark is his
monstrous instrument,

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:09.530 align:middle line:84%
which is the blueprint
is given to Moses,

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:11.570 align:middle line:84%
and Moses is to build
the Ark according

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:14.480 align:middle line:84%
to a blueprint given
by this entity who we

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.650 align:middle line:90%
are taught to believe is god.

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And this entity, if
you track his story

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:24.670 align:middle line:84%
through the Old Testament, he's
an incredibly cruel, vicious,

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:30.210 align:middle line:84%
mean-spirited,
punitive being who

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:32.720 align:middle line:84%
inflicts terrible
punishments upon mankind.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And the Ark is used to inflict
those terrible punishments.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:42.927 align:middle line:84%
So when the Philistines seized
the Ark from the Israelites--

00:13:42.927 --> 00:13:44.760 align:middle line:84%
when they seized the
Ark from the Israelites

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:48.750 align:middle line:84%
as they do during the
conquest of the promised land,

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:52.370 align:middle line:84%
and they open the Ark, we
are told that 50,000-- 50,000

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:55.140 align:middle line:90%
of the Philistines die in agony.

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And they die of
cancerous tumors,

00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:59.430 align:middle line:84%
and they're afflicted
with blindness.

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:03.110 align:middle line:84%
It really sounds like,
again, we should be careful

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:05.630 align:middle line:84%
projecting our technology
onto past accounts,

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:07.932 align:middle line:84%
but it does sound like
radiation sickness.

00:14:07.932 --> 00:14:08.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: 50,000 people.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:09.700 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: 50-- 50,000.

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Were they
all right around it?

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:11.406 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah.

00:14:11.406 --> 00:14:13.590 align:middle line:84%
They put it on
display like some kind

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:15.487 align:middle line:84%
of tourist object and
everybody filed past

00:14:15.487 --> 00:14:18.240 align:middle line:84%
and peered inside it,
which was definitely

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.104 align:middle line:84%
not something you did with
the Ark of the Covenant.

00:14:21.104 --> 00:14:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And then, as you said
a few moments ago,

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:25.330 align:middle line:90%
there's the story of Jericho.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, what sticks in
most people's mind

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:31.820 align:middle line:84%
from the story of the fall
of the walls of Jericho

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:34.550 align:middle line:84%
is the Israelites marching
round it blowing horns.

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:35.955 align:middle line:84%
Well, there is
sound right there.

00:14:35.955 --> 00:14:37.330 align:middle line:10%
But the other
thing they're doing

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:40.060 align:middle line:10%
is they're carrying
the Ark of the Covenant

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:45.530 align:middle line:10%
around the walls of Jericho, and
down come tumbling the walls.

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:47.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But also,
it specifically seems

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:51.344 align:middle line:84%
to suggest that the
clay became like liquid.

00:14:51.344 --> 00:14:52.010 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah.

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:52.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: It actually was--

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:53.320 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:53.970 align:middle line:90%
It liquefied it.

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:55.428 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: --it sort
of sloshed down.

00:14:55.428 --> 00:14:57.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: It changed
its state in some way.

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:01.779 align:middle line:84%
So I find it hard to resist
the possibility that we

00:15:01.779 --> 00:15:04.320 align:middle line:84%
are looking-- filtered through
the perspective of the writers

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.920 align:middle line:84%
of the biblical
text we are looking

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.710 align:middle line:84%
at a description of
a device of some kind

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:11.162 align:middle line:90%
that we don't fully understand.

00:15:11.162 --> 00:15:13.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You had some great
stuff about these diorite

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:14.024 align:middle line:90%
vases--

00:15:14.024 --> 00:15:14.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah.

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: That you can't
even fit your pinky into.

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:17.624 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: This
is the case again

00:15:17.624 --> 00:15:21.900 align:middle line:84%
that there are many stone
objects from ancient Egypt,

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.460 align:middle line:84%
and actually from all over
the world, particularly

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.750 align:middle line:84%
strongly clustered
in ancient Egypt,

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:31.830 align:middle line:84%
cut from a very hard stone,
which we don't really

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:34.820 align:middle line:90%
understand how they were made.

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:37.050 align:middle line:84%
At one level you can look
at them on a museum case

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:39.470 align:middle line:84%
and say well, there's a
very pretty stone vase.

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:41.910 align:middle line:84%
But if you get somebody who's
involved in the drilling

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:43.860 align:middle line:84%
and cutting of stone and
the making of machine

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:47.130 align:middle line:84%
tools, a guy like Chris Dunn,
and have him look at those,

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:50.300 align:middle line:84%
he stands back and
says, I actually

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:51.950 align:middle line:84%
can't figure out
how this was done.

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:55.650 align:middle line:84%
They must have had some
kind of machine tools.

00:15:55.650 --> 00:16:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Even Flinders Petrie,
the great Egyptologist,

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:03.360 align:middle line:84%
and a man who now is very much
associated with mainstream

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.800 align:middle line:84%
ideas, although he did come
into his quest in Egypt

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.900 align:middle line:84%
from, perhaps, an
alternative point of view,

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:10.942 align:middle line:84%
but he convinced
himself that there

00:16:10.942 --> 00:16:14.360 align:middle line:84%
were ordinary
explanations for things.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.620 align:middle line:84%
When he looked at what
are called drill cores.

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:21.640 align:middle line:84%
See, when a granite
object is hollowed out,

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.260 align:middle line:84%
it's apparent that some
kind of tubular drill

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:28.360 align:middle line:84%
was being used to drill
down into the granite.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And that leaves a core at the
heart of the tubular drilling

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.410 align:middle line:84%
operation, which is
then disposed of,

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.160 align:middle line:84%
and you then move on
and you drill around

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.217 align:middle line:84%
and you hollow out
your granite box

00:16:38.217 --> 00:16:40.300 align:middle line:84%
and you end up with something
like the sarcophagus

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.010 align:middle line:84%
in the King's Chamber
of the Great Pyramid.

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:45.110 align:middle line:90%
Drill cores have been found.

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:47.850 align:middle line:84%
They bear the marks of
the drill that cut them.

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And Flinders Petrie was stunned
to discover that those drills--

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:54.920 align:middle line:84%
you can tell this from
the angle of the marks--

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.490 align:middle line:84%
that the drills were
moving at a huge speed.

00:16:57.490 --> 00:16:59.630 align:middle line:84%
They were moving
incredibly fast,

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:02.240 align:middle line:84%
and they were cutting down
into this very hard rock

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.390 align:middle line:90%
granite at an amazing rate.

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And he thought,
well, perhaps they

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:09.480 align:middle line:84%
had diamond heads
on those drills.

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.130 align:middle line:84%
But then what is the
metal behind that?

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:14.990 align:middle line:90%
We're looking at 2500 BC.

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:18.680 align:middle line:84%
They're not supposed to
have had steel or iron even.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.589 align:middle line:84%
They are only supposed
to have had copper,

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:22.079 align:middle line:90%
and copper is pretty soft metal.

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:24.558 align:middle line:84%
And these drills were
being forced down

00:17:24.558 --> 00:17:26.099 align:middle line:84%
into the granite
with great pressure.

00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:28.900 align:middle line:84%
So even if they had diamond
heads on the drills, which

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:33.090 align:middle line:84%
is possible, the copper tube
itself would have buckled

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:34.750 align:middle line:90%
and would have failed.

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:36.370 align:middle line:84%
That not only is it
being pushed down,

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:39.260 align:middle line:84%
but it's rotating at
an incredible speed,

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:40.710 align:middle line:84%
the kind of speed
that can only be

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:43.460 align:middle line:90%
achieved with modern machines.

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:46.230 align:middle line:84%
So right there
staring us in the face

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:49.990 align:middle line:84%
is evidence of a technology
being used in ancient Egypt,

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:54.370 align:middle line:84%
which does not fit at all
with the picture of history

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:58.160 align:middle line:84%
and pre-history that we've been
given by our so-called experts.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It could be
that the technology,

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:03.870 align:middle line:84%
that the secret sauce
is not the drill.

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:06.589 align:middle line:84%
It's the ability
to make stone soft.

00:18:06.589 --> 00:18:07.380 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Exactly.

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:10.140 align:middle line:90%
That's a very interesting point.

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:12.980 align:middle line:84%
That could be what
we're looking at here.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:16.210 align:middle line:84%
That there was a
system, a technique

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:20.700 align:middle line:84%
of softening stone, and making
it manipulable and moldable.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And I've just
recently been in Peru,

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:28.080 align:middle line:84%
a place I've been to
many times, Saksaywaman,

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:32.080 align:middle line:84%
and I've gradually got to know
those gigantic zigzag stone

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:36.980 align:middle line:84%
walls of Saksaywaman very
well, and the surrounding stone

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:39.780 align:middle line:90%
edifices that we see there.

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:43.210 align:middle line:84%
And I had the
opportunity to go around

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:47.110 align:middle line:84%
some of these monuments, which
our historians all attribute

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:48.880 align:middle line:90%
automatically to the Incas.

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.307 align:middle line:84%
They say the Incas
made these walls.

00:18:51.307 --> 00:18:52.265 align:middle line:90%
I had the opportunity--

00:18:52.265 --> 00:18:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Let's just be clear.

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:56.740 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about these
absolutely massive stones--

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.473 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Massive blocks of
stone dwarf the human scale--

00:18:59.473 --> 00:19:00.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Dwarf a human being.

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:02.616 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: --hundreds
of tons in weight.

00:19:02.616 --> 00:19:05.234 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And they all look like
they're just mushed together.

00:19:05.234 --> 00:19:05.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah.

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:08.570 align:middle line:10%
They look like they've
been turned into putty

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:12.120 align:middle line:10%
and pushed together, as though
somebody had the capacity

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.970 align:middle line:10%
to literally soften that stone.

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:16.240 align:middle line:10%
Well, I had the
opportunity to go around

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:19.880 align:middle line:10%
those sites with Jesus Gamarra,
who is a local researcher.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:23.157 align:middle line:84%
He, himself, descends
from an Inca lineage.

00:19:23.157 --> 00:19:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And you would expect he
would be the first man who

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.070 align:middle line:90%
would say the Incas did this.

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:28.830 align:middle line:90%
But actually, Jesus says, no.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:30.450 align:middle line:90%
The Incas didn't do this.

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:32.490 align:middle line:90%
The Incas were very late comers.

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:34.970 align:middle line:84%
The Incas simply
built their stuff--

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:37.610 align:middle line:84%
rather poor quality
stone work-- on top

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:41.970 align:middle line:84%
of the much earlier, much
older, much better stone work.

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And he traces three different
layers of civilization.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And when you go back
to the oldest layer,

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:49.380 align:middle line:84%
he shows very
convincing evidence

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:50.850 align:middle line:90%
that they were melting stone.

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:54.170 align:middle line:84%
That they were not
cutting these stones

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:55.450 align:middle line:90%
with hammers and chisels.

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:57.330 align:middle line:90%
There are no cut marks on them.

00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:00.282 align:middle line:84%
They were softening the stone
and molding it and shaping it.

00:20:00.282 --> 00:20:01.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: How large
are some of the areas?

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:04.156 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: In some places
it's like a pat of butter,

00:20:04.156 --> 00:20:06.910 align:middle line:84%
that somebody has taken a
knife and just scraped down.

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:08.010 align:middle line:90%
You can see that.

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:12.010 align:middle line:84%
It looks exactly like a
scrape in a pat of butter,

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:14.120 align:middle line:84%
but it's in rock
solid stone today.

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:18.314 align:middle line:84%
So they're suggesting that
we're looking at technology

00:20:18.314 --> 00:20:19.980 align:middle line:84%
for softening stone,
and that that would

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:21.332 align:middle line:90%
explain many of the mysteries.

00:20:21.332 --> 00:20:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's much older
than the Incas.

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:24.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And the wall goes
below the ground, right?

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: The walls
go below the ground.

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:27.692 align:middle line:84%
Not only that,
but there are also

00:20:27.692 --> 00:20:30.150 align:middle line:84%
tunnel systems under the ground
which have been blocked off

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:31.320 align:middle line:90%
to the public.

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:32.510 align:middle line:90%
Nobody can get in there now.

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:36.070 align:middle line:84%
There's another
secret there, which is

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:39.050 align:middle line:90%
worthy of detailed exploration.

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:41.660 align:middle line:84%
For the moment, it seems
impossible to do that.

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:44.660 align:middle line:84%
But I've stood at the entrance
of one of those tunnels,

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:49.670 align:middle line:84%
now completely blocked by
the Peruvian government.

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:51.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: OK, so
Saksaywaman alone

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:54.039 align:middle line:84%
should be the kill shot against
conventional archaeology.

00:20:54.039 --> 00:20:55.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: I believe it should.

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think
conventional archaeology

00:20:56.830 --> 00:21:00.720 align:middle line:84%
has done us a huge
disservice by persuading us

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.050 align:middle line:90%
that the Incas did all of that.

00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:05.029 align:middle line:84%
I'm convinced the
Incas inherited that

00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:06.070 align:middle line:90%
from a much earlier time.

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:07.528 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I've
actually heard people

00:21:07.528 --> 00:21:11.182 align:middle line:84%
say that they think the Incas
were trying to conserve stone,

00:21:11.182 --> 00:21:12.890 align:middle line:84%
that they were
environmentalists and they

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:14.850 align:middle line:90%
didn't want to waste the stone.

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:17.827 align:middle line:84%
But some of these-- how many
facets do some of these rocks

00:21:17.827 --> 00:21:18.660 align:middle line:90%
have at Saksaywaman.

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:19.451 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: A dozen.

00:21:19.451 --> 00:21:20.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: A dozen?

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: A dozen
facets, sometimes more.

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:23.320 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: And how deep is it?

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:26.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Well, they go 15,
20 feet deep in some cases.

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:28.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is,
on a giant scale,

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:30.160 align:middle line:90%
this is Cyclopean masonry.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.500 align:middle line:84%
This is polygonal
Cyclopean masonry

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.740 align:middle line:84%
on an enormous
mind-boggling scale.

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And they're
perfectly straight lines

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:38.700 align:middle line:90%
when they're pushed together.

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:39.110 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Oh yeah.

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:40.651 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And it just
goes in 20 feet.

00:21:40.651 --> 00:21:43.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: If you imagined
a really complicated jigsaw

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:45.270 align:middle line:90%
puzzle, it's like that.

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:48.010 align:middle line:84%
But it's done on a scale
of blocks weighing hundreds

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:54.200 align:middle line:84%
of tons, and 12, 15, 18 feet
high, and 14 to 15 feet deep.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean just huge
blocks of stone.

00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:59.270 align:middle line:84%
I've been to Saksaywaman
so many times.

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:01.830 align:middle line:84%
I first went there
way back in 1992.

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:04.440 align:middle line:84%
I've probably made a dozen
visits to Saksaywaman.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Every time I go
there I am just more

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:11.050 align:middle line:84%
in awe of what I'm looking at,
and less able to explain it.

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:14.180 align:middle line:84%
It was a revelation to me to
go around with Jesus Gamarra

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:19.200 align:middle line:84%
and see what he was showing me,
which was- you know, normally,

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.910 align:middle line:84%
when archaeologists look
at archaeological sites

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:24.800 align:middle line:84%
and they see very different
styles of building,

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.500 align:middle line:84%
they're open to the idea
that very different cultures

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:28.680 align:middle line:90%
made them.

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:34.210 align:middle line:84%
But what we see in the Andes
is three distinctly different

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:37.890 align:middle line:84%
styles of building, all
of which have been given

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:40.520 align:middle line:90%
without thought to the Incas.

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus Gamarra's
suggestion is

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:46.020 align:middle line:84%
that actually the
Incas were overbuilding

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:47.730 align:middle line:90%
on pre-existing structures.

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:49.640 align:middle line:84%
That those structures
were sacred to them

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.550 align:middle line:84%
and they were important
to them, so they

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:53.810 align:middle line:84%
built around them
and on top of them

00:22:53.810 --> 00:23:01.550 align:middle line:84%
and created spaces that honored
that previous architecture.

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:03.747 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Have you looked
into the Olmec stone heads?

00:23:03.747 --> 00:23:04.830 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: I have, indeed.

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:07.960 align:middle line:84%
I've been to La
Venta several times,

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:11.390 align:middle line:84%
and traveled along the Gulf
of Mexico and the whole story.

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:14.830 align:middle line:84%
The Olmecs is another
gigantic mystery.

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Literally gigantic,
because those stone heads,

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:20.940 align:middle line:84%
again, you're looking at
weights approaching 80, 90, 100

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:22.380 align:middle line:90%
tons in some cases.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:25.280 align:middle line:84%
Really huge, huge
blocks of stone.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.820 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the
features of the faces

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:29.570 align:middle line:84%
that are carved into
those blocks of stone

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:34.280 align:middle line:84%
are not those of indigenous
Native Americans.

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:37.020 align:middle line:84%
Where exactly they
come from-- they

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:40.560 align:middle line:84%
do look a lot like Africans, but
they might also be Polynesians.

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:44.200 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult to be absolutely
sure what their origin is.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.720 align:middle line:84%
What you can say is that
they don't look like anybody

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.910 align:middle line:90%
who's in Central America today.

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:53.550 align:middle line:90%
They are mysterious strangers.

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And carved alongside
those gigantic, quote,

00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:01.830 align:middle line:84%
unquote Olmec heads are
images of individuals

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:03.820 align:middle line:90%
who like Caucasians.

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:05.920 align:middle line:84%
Again, they don't look
like Native Americans.

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.910 align:middle line:84%
They have classic
Caucasian features.

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:12.760 align:middle line:84%
They have the
heavy beards, which

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:17.570 align:middle line:84%
are not grown by the indigenous
inhabitants of Native America.

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And this ties in with
ancient traditions and myths.

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:26.010 align:middle line:84%
It's a politically correct
view now in archaeology

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:30.275 align:middle line:84%
to say that all of the myths of
so-called myths of Quetzalcoatl

00:24:30.275 --> 00:24:33.100 align:middle line:84%
of the feathered serpent
were kind of made up

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:36.580 align:middle line:84%
by the conquistadors
because they wanted

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:40.610 align:middle line:84%
to say that there had been a
former white-skinned bearded

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:42.630 align:middle line:84%
presence like them
in Latin America.

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:44.850 align:middle line:84%
But when you go to
La Venta and you

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:49.680 align:middle line:84%
see in the oldest archaeological
strata from Mexico, Images

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:53.410 align:middle line:84%
of clearly bearded
Caucasian-looking people,

00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:55.360 align:middle line:84%
you have to realize
that those myths,

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.540 align:middle line:84%
whether the archaeologists
like it or not,

00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:59.440 align:middle line:90%
are based on some kind of fact.

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.590 align:middle line:84%
What that fact is I
don't know for sure.

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:03.700 align:middle line:84%
But there were people
in the Americas

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:07.270 align:middle line:84%
who are not accounted for by the
present model of history, which

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:10.140 align:middle line:84%
has the whole population of
Americas, North and South

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:13.460 align:middle line:84%
Americas, crossing the
Bering Straits not much more

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.890 align:middle line:90%
than 13,000 years ago.

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And populating both North
and South America from there.

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:24.700 align:middle line:84%
Asiatic peoples who came
from Siberia and China,

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:26.411 align:middle line:84%
these are seen as
the population base

00:25:26.411 --> 00:25:27.660 align:middle line:90%
for the whole of the Americas.

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:31.590 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, we have these
carvings-- the Olmec heads,

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:34.290 align:middle line:84%
we have the bearded
Caucasian-looking individuals

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:35.920 align:middle line:84%
in Mexico, we have
individuals who

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:39.160 align:middle line:90%
look like Aborigines in Brazil.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Recent excavations
in Brazil have

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:44.610 align:middle line:84%
produced this physical
type which is, again,

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:47.270 align:middle line:84%
not the same as the
Asiatic physical type

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:49.870 align:middle line:84%
that we find throughout
most of the Americas.

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:52.850 align:middle line:84%
There's something going on
in the story of the Americas.

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And increasingly, the
so-called Clovis model,

00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:00.910 align:middle line:84%
that the Americas were not
peopled at all until 14,000

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:05.110 align:middle line:84%
years ago or less is being
challenged and overthrown

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:06.620 align:middle line:90%
by new evidence.

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:09.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, and Brian
Forster is finding more and more

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:12.020 align:middle line:84%
of these exotic
skulls in mummys--

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:13.270 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Indeed, and those--

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:14.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: --with red hair.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah.

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:16.900 align:middle line:10%
Those exotic skulls are
really interesting and really,

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:17.760 align:middle line:10%
really intriguing.

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean the conventional
answer to that

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:22.080 align:middle line:84%
is that there was head
binding of infants--

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.670 align:middle line:84%
that they bound the
heads to produce

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:26.840 align:middle line:90%
this very elongated skull type.

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:28.210 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:29.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: First of all,
you have to ask yourself

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.650 align:middle line:90%
why they would want to do that?

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:31.680 align:middle line:90%
What are they copying?

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:33.640 align:middle line:90%
What they modeling that on?

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, some of them
just absolutely defy belief

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:41.247 align:middle line:84%
as to this could have been
achieved by head binding.

00:26:41.247 --> 00:26:41.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Sure.

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:42.536 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: It's a good mystery.

00:26:42.536 --> 00:26:44.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It's like double
the brain capacity.

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah.

00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:45.625 align:middle line:90%
There's this huge brain.

00:26:45.625 --> 00:26:47.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And they've been
found all over the world.

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:49.040 align:middle line:84%
They've been found in
South Africa-- Boskop.

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:52.690 align:middle line:84%
They've been found in Siberia
in a town called Omsk.

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:54.740 align:middle line:84%
Even recently, as
you probably know,

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.390 align:middle line:84%
the French nobility
that they found--

00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:57.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: I didn't know that.

00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:58.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:00.790 align:middle line:84%
They've announced this
publicly that there

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:04.680 align:middle line:84%
was a grave of
nobility in France

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:09.100 align:middle line:84%
in which some of the corpses
had these elongated skulls--

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:10.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: I didn't know that.

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:11.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: --in the grave.

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.996 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: But it somehow
doesn't surprise me.

00:27:12.996 --> 00:27:16.622 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole hidden
story of our past.

00:27:16.622 --> 00:27:18.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What is
the relationship--

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.840 align:middle line:84%
we didn't talk about
this, but there's also

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:22.750 align:middle line:90%
giant spheres that were found.

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:24.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Costa Rica, yeah.

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:28.640 align:middle line:84%
They're pretty much Olmec
heads without the faces.

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:29.470 align:middle line:90%
An Olmec head is--

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:30.886 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It's like
a blank canvas.

00:27:30.886 --> 00:27:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah, it's
like a blank canvas.

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:34.689 align:middle line:84%
And again, on a
very large scale.

00:27:34.689 --> 00:27:35.980 align:middle line:90%
There are smaller ones as well.

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:37.354 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, I
seem to remember

00:27:37.354 --> 00:27:41.420 align:middle line:84%
that the sphericity of these
spheres is very perfect.

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:42.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yes.

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:43.240 align:middle line:90%
Very well done.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It would
be extraordinarily

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:47.051 align:middle line:84%
difficult to try to do
that with carving, right?

00:27:47.051 --> 00:27:48.050 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: It should be.

00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:49.840 align:middle line:84%
It should be very
difficult, unless we

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.350 align:middle line:84%
are willing to accept the
possibility that there

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:55.390 align:middle line:84%
was higher level of culture
and technology in the past

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:58.760 align:middle line:84%
than our historians want
us to believe there was.

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.230 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: We've
just gotten started

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:02.690 align:middle line:10%
talking about the Ark of
the Covenant-- this very

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:04.020 align:middle line:10%
bizarre super weapon.

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:06.030 align:middle line:10%
And you remember
that Graham Hancock

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:10.245 align:middle line:10%
said that when it was opened
up, 50,000 people saw it

00:28:10.245 --> 00:28:15.130 align:middle line:10%
and they all died a very
strange radiation-type sickness.

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:16.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're just
getting rolling.

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.400 align:middle line:90%
This is only the beginning.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And Graham Hancock's scholarship
is really second to none.

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:27.710 align:middle line:84%
So I am blown away by
having had the opportunity

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:29.750 align:middle line:84%
to interview him
and to get so much

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:32.700 align:middle line:84%
of this fascinating information
that is fundamentally

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:37.230 align:middle line:84%
rewriting what we think
we know about our origins

00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:40.480 align:middle line:84%
and about this advanced
mega civilization that

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:43.670 align:middle line:84%
may, at one time, have
truly been worldwide.

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:47.430 align:middle line:84%
But if they settle on the coasts
and then this epic catastrophe

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:51.730 align:middle line:84%
happens, very little of their
civilization could survive.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:55.270 align:middle line:84%
They may well have been
extraterrestrial immigrants who

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:58.680 align:middle line:84%
were not native to our
planet, and their civilization

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:03.060 align:middle line:84%
got almost completely wiped out,
except for the epic stone work

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:04.410 align:middle line:90%
that they had been doing.

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:06.660 align:middle line:90%
We find this stone work in Peru.

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:10.380 align:middle line:84%
We find these massive stone,
Saksaywaman, the Olmec stone

00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:14.120 align:middle line:84%
heads, we find Stonehenge,
pyramids all over the world.

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.800 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, a very
elaborate amount of work

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.440 align:middle line:84%
was done by somebody
who had the ability

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.780 align:middle line:84%
to toss these stones
around easily.

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:23.540 align:middle line:84%
If it was easy for
primitive cultures

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:25.710 align:middle line:84%
to make giant stone
monuments they would still

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:27.600 align:middle line:90%
be doing it now, but nobody is.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.730 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very difficult.

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Coming up next time, we're going
to be talking to John Anthony

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.430 align:middle line:84%
West for our second and
final interview with him

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:40.840 align:middle line:84%
in this little 14
episode miniseries.

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.970 align:middle line:84%
John Anthony West,
remember, is the guy

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:46.110 align:middle line:84%
who came up with the water
weathering on the Sphinx.

00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And in this next
section I'm going

00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:50.430 align:middle line:84%
to be engaging him
on his thoughts

00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:55.250 align:middle line:84%
about this antique civilization
worldwide that some have called

00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:58.570 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis, based on
the writings of Plato,

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:03.060 align:middle line:84%
and the speculations that have
been extrapolated from there.

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:06.120 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about
Gobekli Tepe in more detail.

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:11.200 align:middle line:84%
This weird series of 23 to
24 Stonehenge-like circles

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:14.560 align:middle line:84%
that was found in East
Anatolia, Turkey, that we know

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:18.466 align:middle line:84%
has to be at least
10,000 years old.

00:30:18.466 --> 00:30:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And we're also
going to start out

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:23.210 align:middle line:84%
talking about this epic
catastrophe that wiped it out.

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:26.110 align:middle line:84%
That's coming up next
time here on "Disclosure."

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:29.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, David Wilcock,
and I thank you for watching.
