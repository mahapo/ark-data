00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID WILCOCK: I'm
your host, David Wilcock.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And marijuana is legal in
Colorado, where we're filming.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And I want to be clear
that this smoke was

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.540 align:middle line:84%
generated in a 100%
[THROAT CLEARING] legal manner.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.590 align:middle line:10%
This is a safe place
where we can talk.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.090 align:middle line:10%
And I want to talk
to you about who

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.090 align:middle line:10%
is making a difference
in this world

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.000 align:middle line:10%
by blowing the whistle on
some of the greatest coverups

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.850 align:middle line:10%
and conspiracies of our time.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.830 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot more to this
subject than most of us

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.990 align:middle line:10%
would ever imagine.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.040 align:middle line:10%
And one of the keys
is the whistleblower

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.820 align:middle line:10%
named Dr. James Glattfelder.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.990 align:middle line:10%
>>JAMES GLATTFELDER:
When the crisis came,

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.240 align:middle line:10%
the serious
limitations of existing

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.490 align:middle line:10%
economic and financial models
immediately became apparent.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.930 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: He worked for the Swiss
Federal Institute of Technology

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.020 align:middle line:10%
and published a paper in 2011.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.340 align:middle line:84%
Now the Swiss Federal
Institute of Technology

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.850 align:middle line:84%
is actually where
Albert Einstein taught.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.390 align:middle line:84%
It is a very
prestigious institution.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.960 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it is one of the
most important universities

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.590 align:middle line:90%
in Europe.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Dr. James Glattfelder put
together an impressive body

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.330 align:middle line:84%
of research by
computer analyzing

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.320 align:middle line:84%
a database of over 40,000
transnational corporations.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.560 align:middle line:84%
All the biggest
companies in the world.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And what Dr. James Glattfelder
discovered through his research

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.650 align:middle line:84%
should be completely
shocking to you

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.730 align:middle line:84%
if you haven't already
heard this before.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.820 align:middle line:84%
He scientifically proved
that at the highest level

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.920 align:middle line:84%
the world is being controlled
by a very small group of 147

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.110 align:middle line:84%
corporations that he
called a super-entity.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.840 align:middle line:10%
The very highest level
corporations in this group

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.520 align:middle line:10%
are those financial
institutions and banks

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.630 align:middle line:10%
that are responsible for what
we call the Federal Reserve.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.750 align:middle line:10%
The American dollar
was privatized back

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.930 align:middle line:10%
all the way in 1913
by an act of Congress,

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.890 align:middle line:10%
where Congress signed over its
ability to print and generate

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.690 align:middle line:10%
its own money to a private
group of international bankers.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And what has happened
in the ensuing century

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.526 align:middle line:84%
is that the dollar has
depreciated in value by 96%.

00:02:37.526 --> 00:02:40.190 align:middle line:90%


00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.960 align:middle line:84%
So the brave whistleblowers
who are telling us

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.800 align:middle line:84%
that the Federal
Reserve is behind a lot

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.300 align:middle line:84%
of these problems in the world
should be taken seriously.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Glattfelder [THROAT CLEARING]
cleared the smoke

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.210 align:middle line:84%
on this whole mystery
of whether or not

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.920 align:middle line:84%
there is some man
behind the curtain.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that
there absolutely is.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.980 align:middle line:84%
The whistleblowers are giving
us valuable information

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.930 align:middle line:90%
that we really do need to have.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.050 align:middle line:84%
Edward Snowden is
only one example

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.520 align:middle line:84%
of a trend that is going to
get more and more popular.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.900 align:middle line:84%
After Edward Snowden told us
that the NSA had been listening

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.190 align:middle line:84%
to our calls, then we find out
that many whistleblowers had

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.710 align:middle line:90%
been telling us this all along.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's only now that
they're being taken seriously.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Edward Snowden is only
just the beginning.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.820 align:middle line:84%
I do believe, based on a very
comprehensive estimate of what

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.720 align:middle line:84%
we know, that the NSA
disclosures represent

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.520 align:middle line:84%
less than 1% of the
most important things

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.340 align:middle line:84%
that there are to know about
the real truth in our world.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.290 align:middle line:84%
And just like Snowden,
later on, once these things

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.360 align:middle line:84%
become public, once
we have the government

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.480 align:middle line:84%
finally be forced
to tell the truth,

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.410 align:middle line:84%
because they don't tell
the truth willingly.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.493 align:middle line:84%
They didn't tell the truth
willingly with Snowden.

00:04:05.493 --> 00:04:07.310 align:middle line:84%
They fought it every
step of the way.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.380 align:middle line:84%
But the information
just kept coming out

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.110 align:middle line:90%
and coming out and coming out.

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.400 align:middle line:84%
In much the same
way, we're going

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.370 align:middle line:84%
to have things emerge that will
become common knowledge that we

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.459 align:middle line:90%
didn't know before.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.510 align:middle line:90%
Project Camelot.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.130 align:middle line:10%
I did several interviews
with Project Camelot,

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.820 align:middle line:10%
and I owe a great
debt of gratitude

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.530 align:middle line:10%
to Kerry Cassidy and
Bill Ryan for being

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.260 align:middle line:10%
responsible for dramatically
increasing my exposure by doing

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.540 align:middle line:10%
those Camelot videos.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And we are in the process of
bringing in many of the Camelot

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.050 align:middle line:84%
videos so that they can also
be seen here on Gaiam TV.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.290 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to
get bogged down too

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.220 align:middle line:84%
much in the so-called conspiracy
theory, which usually ends up

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.310 align:middle line:90%
being conspiracy fact.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we know there's a cabal.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.720 align:middle line:84%
We know they're
controlling the media,

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.280 align:middle line:90%
the government, the military.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.250 align:middle line:90%
This is not news.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.750 align:middle line:84%
Not all the media is
being controlled, however.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.090 align:middle line:84%
I have worked for major
media on ancient aliens,

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.280 align:middle line:84%
and in that program I've
been able to get out

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.180 align:middle line:84%
many, many things that
are going out there.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.000 align:middle line:84%
So please don't fall
under the illusion

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.700 align:middle line:84%
that everybody is in on
it and that everybody

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.960 align:middle line:90%
is equally culpable.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.500 align:middle line:84%
But again, government
conspiracy, occult power

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.670 align:middle line:90%
groups, Freemasons, Illuminati.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.582 align:middle line:84%
All that kind of stuff
is not the big picture.

00:05:27.582 --> 00:05:29.790 align:middle line:84%
If you wait for the government
to tell you the truth,

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.380 align:middle line:90%
you're far off in the distance.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.140 align:middle line:84%
You've long since
lost the thread

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.570 align:middle line:84%
of what the big picture
really is about.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, the big
picture is a spiritual picture.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.690 align:middle line:84%
It is a picture that
has bits and pieces

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.080 align:middle line:84%
in many different religions
and spiritual cultures

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.160 align:middle line:84%
around the world, some
perhaps more than others.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.660 align:middle line:84%
Christianity has a big
part of the picture.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.550 align:middle line:84%
There are many, many things
in the Bible that it turns out

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.060 align:middle line:84%
are much more real
than we realize.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.730 align:middle line:84%
This whole concept that
you hear about in the Book

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.600 align:middle line:84%
of Revelation, that the beast
will be ruling over the Earth.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.660 align:middle line:84%
Well it's a metaphor, and
it's talking about the cabal.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.910 align:middle line:84%
It's talking about this
centralized control

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.380 align:middle line:90%
that's already there now.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.160 align:middle line:84%
But the Book of Revelation
doesn't end badly.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.900 align:middle line:84%
These tribulations--
some people are

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.520 align:middle line:84%
expecting these horrible
things are going to happen.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And what they don't realize
is that those things

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.020 align:middle line:90%
have been happening.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.360 align:middle line:84%
These symbols of the
breaking of the seals

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.100 align:middle line:84%
and all this stuff, those are
things that are happening now.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.560 align:middle line:90%
They're metaphorical.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.100 align:middle line:84%
The Book of
Revelation should not

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.560 align:middle line:84%
be taken as an
absolute literal thing.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.050 align:middle line:84%
But there are some people
who want to do that.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.600 align:middle line:84%
The big picture is
very, very fascinating.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.240 align:middle line:84%
Because the big picture tells
us that we are not alone,

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.260 align:middle line:84%
and it tells us that those
prophecies in the Book

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.412 align:middle line:84%
of Revelation are mirrored
in many ancient cultures

00:06:51.412 --> 00:06:52.120 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Over 30 ancient cultures were
given information, probably

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.750 align:middle line:84%
by extraterrestrials,
that are telling us

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.840 align:middle line:84%
that we will be evolving into
some greater level of what

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.160 align:middle line:90%
it means to be human.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.220 align:middle line:10%
And one of the people who
is of very high interest

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.540 align:middle line:10%
is Namkhai Norbu.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.980 align:middle line:10%
I found this book that
Namkhai Norbu wrote

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.590 align:middle line:10%
in approximately 1995 or '96.

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:20.340 align:middle line:90%
I don't exactly remember.

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And I read this before I had
any idea that any of this

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.290 align:middle line:84%
had anything to do
with me personally.

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.540 align:middle line:84%
The book is called "Dream
Yoga and the Practice

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.040 align:middle line:90%
of Natural Light."

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And what it
describes is a series

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:36.710 align:middle line:84%
of meditative practices followed
by the Tibetans in which

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:40.440 align:middle line:84%
their goal is to reach
that state between being

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.330 align:middle line:90%
awake and being asleep.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:47.340 align:middle line:84%
Before you have a dream, before
you go into that other place

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.900 align:middle line:84%
is also the state
between living and dying.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.410 align:middle line:84%
The death state is what
they call the "bardo."

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:56.470 align:middle line:84%
But in between is something
they call the "Dzogchen,"

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:57.600 align:middle line:90%
or the mother light.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.060 align:middle line:84%
That is the true primordial
essence of the universe.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.060 align:middle line:84%
It is without time,
and it is without form,

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.160 align:middle line:90%
and it is identity.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.570 align:middle line:84%
Not just an identity,
but the identity

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:12.290 align:middle line:84%
that the entire
universe is made from.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:16.510 align:middle line:84%
The great mystery is that
we are alive and conscious.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:20.790 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, consciousness
is a feature of the universe.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:22.900 align:middle line:84%
The latest, greatest
scientific models--

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.780 align:middle line:84%
I've been talking about this
extensively in my other show

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.290 align:middle line:84%
here on Gaiam TV,
"Wisdom Teachings"--

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:33.200 align:middle line:84%
tell us that the universe
is all-blossoming in space

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.370 align:middle line:84%
and time from a single
geometric unity.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:40.240 align:middle line:10%
That was first put forward by
Sir Roger Penrose in the 1970s.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.429 align:middle line:10%
And it was Nima Arkani-Hamed
and Jaroslav Trnka,

00:08:43.429 --> 00:08:49.960 align:middle line:10%
two scientists who only actually
proved this back in 2013.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.440 align:middle line:84%
In a long series of episodes
on "Wisdom Teachings,"

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.840 align:middle line:84%
I have gone into
the scientific proof

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.220 align:middle line:84%
that the universe is alive
and conscious, sentient

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:00.450 align:middle line:84%
and intelligent,
and all of us are

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.340 align:middle line:90%
in various stages of amnesia.

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:04.940 align:middle line:90%
We have forgotten who we are.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And we have forgotten
what we're here for.

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And there is a spiritual battle
playing out on Earth right now.

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:15.440 align:middle line:84%
The cabal, these negative
forces in the governments,

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.610 align:middle line:84%
is in fact a representation
of some greater

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:22.900 align:middle line:84%
group that is fundamentally
spiritual in nature,

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:24.700 align:middle line:90%
not physical.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.280 align:middle line:84%
There is a spiritual
group of what

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:30.380 align:middle line:84%
you could call extraterrestrial
life that is manipulating

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:35.559 align:middle line:84%
events here on Earth for their
benefit to create a fear farm.

00:09:35.559 --> 00:09:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BRET BAIER: I'm Bret
Baier in Washington,

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:38.730 align:middle line:90%
and this is a Fox News alert.

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:41.146 align:middle line:84%
A warning tonight about the
possibility of terror attacks.

00:09:41.146 --> 00:09:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Because
they need our fear.

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:46.270 align:middle line:84%
It's just like they need air
to breathe, water to drink,

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:48.780 align:middle line:84%
and food to eat,
and money to spend.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:50.560 align:middle line:84%
It's literally that
important that if they

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.040 align:middle line:84%
don't have that fear, they
would either die or have

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.240 align:middle line:90%
to go to the positive path.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.630 align:middle line:84%
There are two paths
in the universe known

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:01.130 align:middle line:84%
as the left-handed path,
or the negative path,

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.860 align:middle line:84%
and the right-handed path,
or the positive path.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Namkhai Norbu was exposing the
essence of the positive path

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:13.820 align:middle line:84%
and what happens when you follow
these teachings all the way.

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:19.140 align:middle line:84%
Namkhai Norbu literally is
saying that Tibetan practices

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:22.810 align:middle line:84%
lead to the activation
of a potential dormant

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:25.920 align:middle line:84%
in every human being
that we can become what

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.218 align:middle line:90%
they call the "rainbow body."

00:10:29.218 --> 00:10:33.370 align:middle line:84%
That we can actually transform
the matter and the material

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:37.280 align:middle line:84%
of our physical bodies
into pure white light

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.190 align:middle line:84%
and reunite ourselves
with the original essence

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:44.940 align:middle line:84%
of our identity that the
universe is made from.

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And there's a complex series of
meditations involved in this.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.320 align:middle line:84%
But most of them
deal with having

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.590 align:middle line:84%
every thought in your
mind be a loving thought.

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:58.410 align:middle line:84%
You view the events that happen
in your life in meditation

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:01.140 align:middle line:84%
with the goal of forgiving
those who hurt you

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.050 align:middle line:84%
and forgiving
yourself for the ways

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:05.810 align:middle line:84%
that you hurt yourself and
the ways that you hurt others.

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:09.270 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to be clear that this
is not just something that's

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:12.720 align:middle line:84%
happening for these Olympic
athletes in the Himalayan

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.850 align:middle line:90%
Mountains.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:17.490 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
the prophecies tell us.

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And by prophecies I mean
Christianity, Hinduism,

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:26.502 align:middle line:84%
Buddhism, Islam, Judaism, and
over 30 other ancient cultures

00:11:26.502 --> 00:11:27.210 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Virtually every ancient
culture around the world

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:33.770 align:middle line:84%
has essentially the same
gestalt of prophecy.

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And the prophecy says that we
move directly into a golden age

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:42.820 align:middle line:84%
after a certain period of
upheaval and transformation.

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.240 align:middle line:84%
That upheaval is
happening to us right now.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.390 align:middle line:84%
We are living the
transformation.

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:52.100 align:middle line:84%
We are experiencing in real
time the actual evolutionary

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:53.110 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:56.650 align:middle line:84%
There are pressures at work out
there in the world right now

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:59.970 align:middle line:84%
that are cracking the shell we
have built around our hearts

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:02.570 align:middle line:90%
to allow the love to come in.

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And what will happen is that
our world becomes far more

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:09.140 align:middle line:90%
sentient, far more conscious.

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.080 align:middle line:84%
We're no longer going
to need to argue

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.820 align:middle line:84%
with each other over my race
is better than your race,

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:17.230 align:middle line:84%
my country is better
than your country,

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:20.040 align:middle line:84%
my religion is better
than your religion.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.860 align:middle line:84%
I do ultimately
believe that we have

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.930 align:middle line:90%
got to set this stuff aside.

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:28.250 align:middle line:84%
The Tibetan Buddhists are very
big on transcending the ego,

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:29.850 align:middle line:90%
transcending attachment.

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:33.550 align:middle line:84%
In meditation, in compassion,
you cut the cords.

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:36.390 align:middle line:84%
You visualize either
a knife or a sword

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:39.130 align:middle line:84%
that you're cutting through
those cords that keep

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:41.300 align:middle line:90%
you tethered to this world.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most
fascinating secret teachings

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:49.300 align:middle line:84%
is that the only reason why
you or I see a visible universe

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:53.450 align:middle line:84%
at all and perceive that
a visible universe exists

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:56.630 align:middle line:90%
is because we have karma.

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:59.250 align:middle line:84%
Because, to use
a Hebrew term, we

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:03.340 align:middle line:84%
are the tikkun, the
shattered vessels of light.

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:06.840 align:middle line:84%
We have not rebuilt
our light body.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.550 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the great
secrets in the mystery school

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:10.440 align:middle line:90%
teachings.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:14.100 align:middle line:84%
They talk about the concept of
rebuilding Solomon's Temple.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.910 align:middle line:84%
They talk about the
quest for the Holy Grail.

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:20.580 align:middle line:84%
These concepts refer to
the idea that your energy

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:24.370 align:middle line:84%
body can be rebuilt. You
can seal the cracks off.

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And you can hold a much higher
concentration of energy, which

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:32.660 align:middle line:84%
ultimately they believe, leads
to the perfection of the flesh

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:34.890 align:middle line:90%
to transform into spirit.

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's very interesting that
the mystery schools believe

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.770 align:middle line:84%
this the same way that many of
the great spiritual traditions

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:43.790 align:middle line:90%
do.

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And that those
people in the cabal,

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:48.910 align:middle line:84%
those people who are ruling
the world financially,

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:51.000 align:middle line:90%
also believe in this very much.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.680 align:middle line:84%
The cabal, the Illuminati,
doesn't want you to know that.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.300 align:middle line:84%
But these spiritual
whistleblowers

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.930 align:middle line:84%
throughout history
are exposing the truth

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:00.540 align:middle line:90%
about our true nature.

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.400 align:middle line:84%
There is a great
thread of data that we

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.910 align:middle line:84%
can follow that shows that
this actually is true.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:09.750 align:middle line:84%
The big picture is that
extraterrestrials do exist

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:12.180 align:middle line:84%
and that most of the
people, if not almost all

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:15.250 align:middle line:84%
of the people, who are
visiting the Earth at this time

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:19.820 align:middle line:84%
have already been through this
rainbow body transfiguration.

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:23.580 align:middle line:84%
They have reached the next
level of human evolution.

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And at that level,
you know a lot more,

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:30.549 align:middle line:84%
and you experience a
greater galactic community

00:14:30.549 --> 00:14:31.590 align:middle line:90%
that we're all living in.

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:34.410 align:middle line:84%
You are no longer
stuck on one planet,

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:38.170 align:middle line:84%
trapped inside the sandbox,
locked up in the reservation.

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:41.430 align:middle line:84%
You get to go around
and see who's out there.

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:43.780 align:middle line:84%
The greatest single
source of information

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:47.920 align:middle line:84%
that I've ever found that has
woven a thread through all

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.560 align:middle line:84%
the different whistleblowers
that I'm aware of

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.670 align:middle line:90%
is the "Law of One" material.

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:56.760 align:middle line:10%
Or what was originally called
in Book One, "The Ra Material."

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.290 align:middle line:84%
Now some people really
bristle at the name Ra.

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:03.870 align:middle line:84%
They say, my goodness, is this
some sort of Illuminati thing?

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:05.150 align:middle line:90%
Ra, that sounds Egyptian.

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:06.080 align:middle line:90%
That sounds evil.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:06.940 align:middle line:90%
That sounds bad.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.040 align:middle line:90%
That sounds negative.

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:13.300 align:middle line:84%
What the source actually
says in this material

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:18.800 align:middle line:84%
is that they are speaking
from a place in which they

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:23.625 align:middle line:84%
are managing and transferring
planetary populations.

00:15:23.625 --> 00:15:26.370 align:middle line:90%
Pff, wow!

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:28.420 align:middle line:90%
Like that mind blown, right?

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.370 align:middle line:90%
[POW] My goodness.

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Management and transfer
of planetary populations?

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.480 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking about?

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:39.190 align:middle line:84%
They literally are
responsible for governing

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:40.700 align:middle line:90%
what happens on a given planet.

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And they make it very
clear that their goal is

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.090 align:middle line:90%
to uphold an illusion for us.

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
illusion that there

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:53.030 align:middle line:90%
is no actual higher power.

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:56.696 align:middle line:84%
If it became obvious to us,
it would break the illusion.

00:15:56.696 --> 00:15:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Why wouldn't they want us to
know there's a higher power?

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:00.444 align:middle line:84%
Why wouldn't they
want us to know

00:16:00.444 --> 00:16:02.460 align:middle line:90%
that everything is hunky-dory?

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:06.420 align:middle line:84%
Because in the darkness,
in the confusion,

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:10.150 align:middle line:84%
there is motivation to grow,
to change, to transform,

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:11.710 align:middle line:90%
and to evolve.

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:14.460 align:middle line:84%
What the "Law of One"
message ultimately says

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:18.660 align:middle line:84%
is that the universe originally
was only one identity

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:22.660 align:middle line:84%
and that it voluntarily
chose to divide itself

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:25.390 align:middle line:90%
to create a visible universe.

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:29.000 align:middle line:84%
In order to have the
experience of itself,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.430 align:middle line:84%
the universe, this
one mind, realized

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:35.920 align:middle line:84%
that it needed to
create separate parts

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:40.220 align:middle line:84%
and have those parts each
have their own free will.

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.720 align:middle line:84%
Because if the parts
didn't have free will,

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.680 align:middle line:84%
then literally the universe
is playing a puppet show,

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.100 align:middle line:84%
and it's just
toying with itself.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:50.330 align:middle line:84%
So this concept is
very fascinating

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:53.730 align:middle line:84%
because what it means
is that galaxies

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:58.290 align:middle line:84%
are sentient organisms, and
they represent the original seed

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:00.610 align:middle line:90%
life forms in our universe.

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:05.750 align:middle line:84%
Galaxies, then, inform
and design a curriculum

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:08.380 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual evolution
for all beings

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:11.230 align:middle line:90%
within that galaxy to follow.

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.000 align:middle line:90%
This includes stars.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.200 align:middle line:90%
This includes planets.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And then it includes
the sentient life forms

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.720 align:middle line:90%
who grow on those planets.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And that is really where
the greatest work is done

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:25.349 align:middle line:84%
is as a conscious,
sentient life form.

00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:28.390 align:middle line:84%
As we delve deeper into
the big picture of what

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:30.910 align:middle line:84%
the "Law of One" has
to say, we find out

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:36.500 align:middle line:84%
that the universe is absolutely
teeming with intelligent life.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:40.890 align:middle line:84%
Now this doesn't just mean
intelligent human life either.

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:44.560 align:middle line:84%
Life also can be
in energetic form.

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:47.150 align:middle line:84%
But one of the really
interesting things

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:50.260 align:middle line:84%
that the "Law of One" says
is that the human design

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:54.550 align:middle line:84%
for intelligent life is
remarkably widespread.

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:59.050 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we are told
that 40% of the entire

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:04.080 align:middle line:84%
cosmos-- all the galaxies,
all the stars, and the planets

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.120 align:middle line:84%
around those stars
that are inhabited,

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:09.040 align:middle line:84%
40% of them in the
entire universe

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:12.350 align:middle line:84%
are hosting human
or hominid life.

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And when I say hominid, I
mean a head, a face, two arms,

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:18.906 align:middle line:90%
two legs.

00:18:18.906 --> 00:18:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And again, we've had
remarkable validation

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:25.930 align:middle line:84%
of this from whistleblowers
because there

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:28.400 align:middle line:84%
is a level of our
secret government,

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:32.250 align:middle line:84%
the military-industrial complex,
in which these guys are having

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:34.780 align:middle line:84%
direct contact with
extraterrestrials

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.350 align:middle line:90%
who are visiting Earth.

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:38.510 align:middle line:84%
It's not like it's
a big mystery.

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:40.110 align:middle line:84%
It's not like the
government has just

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:42.280 align:middle line:84%
had a few ships
crash here and there

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:44.640 align:middle line:84%
and maybe some dead bodies
that they've stored away

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.690 align:middle line:84%
in a funky warehouse that looks
kind of like where we are right

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:48.190 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:49.630 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that funny?

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:51.430 align:middle line:90%
That's by design, of course.

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And what this show is about
is revealing the truth.

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:57.230 align:middle line:84%
So even though I'm talking
"Law of One" right now,

00:18:57.230 --> 00:19:00.570 align:middle line:84%
this is not going to be a long,
esoteric discourse on the "Law

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:02.402 align:middle line:90%
of One" and its philosophy.

00:19:02.402 --> 00:19:04.110 align:middle line:84%
I already have a show
like that, and it's

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:05.610 align:middle line:90%
called "Wisdom Teachings."

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:08.410 align:middle line:84%
This show is about
getting down to specifics.

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And again, the reason why
I'm giving you this overview

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:13.700 align:middle line:84%
now is so that we
have a framework

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:17.100 align:middle line:84%
for our philosophical and
our scientific, technical

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:17.760 align:middle line:90%
discussion.

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.720 align:middle line:84%
The "Law of One" series
gives us that framework,

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.510 align:middle line:84%
and it shows us how
it all fits together

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:27.840 align:middle line:84%
in this unified concept
of a spiritual reality.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.130 align:middle line:84%
The universe is alive
and intelligent.

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And 40% of the entire
cosmos has chosen

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:37.800 align:middle line:84%
to use the human form to
create an intelligent vehicle

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.260 align:middle line:84%
for the creator to
experience itself,

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:45.150 align:middle line:84%
to move through grades of
confusion, of not understanding

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:47.650 align:middle line:84%
that we are unified
with the cosmos.

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And that only comes as we
evolve through higher and higher

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:55.840 align:middle line:84%
grades, much like a baby has to
crawl before it learns to walk.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.450 align:middle line:84%
We are learning to walk
in much the same way.

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:01.660 align:middle line:84%
But it's in a spiritual sense
where we realize that there's

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:03.210 align:middle line:90%
only one of us here.

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you really
understood that,

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:07.230 align:middle line:84%
if you could really
experience that identity,

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:08.950 align:middle line:84%
how could you be
angry at someone?

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:10.760 align:middle line:90%
How could you hate someone?

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:14.050 align:middle line:84%
How could you feel badly about
anything that happens to you?

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:16.490 align:middle line:84%
Because every
experience that you have

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:18.320 align:middle line:90%
is part of your awakening.

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.800 align:middle line:84%
It either is bringing you
closer to the goal of awakening

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.120 align:middle line:90%
or farther away.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.120 align:middle line:84%
But regardless of
how that works,

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:27.380 align:middle line:84%
even if you have to repeat the
same lessons many, many times,

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:30.550 align:middle line:84%
it's all part of the
evolutionary process

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:33.410 align:middle line:84%
that this universe was
designed to give us.

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:35.760 align:middle line:84%
We are also told
by the "Law of One"

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:40.170 align:middle line:84%
that life begins as
a biological form,

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:44.220 align:middle line:84%
but it evolves into
increasingly energetic forms

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:45.730 align:middle line:90%
as time goes by.

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:48.130 align:middle line:84%
That is one of the most
important "Law of One"

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:49.170 align:middle line:90%
teachings.

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:52.830 align:middle line:84%
This flesh that we now have,
that we become so identified

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:54.790 align:middle line:84%
with, that we
think that anything

00:20:54.790 --> 00:21:00.010 align:middle line:84%
that happens to our body is
our identity, and that's me.

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:01.446 align:middle line:90%
That's not all there is.

00:21:01.446 --> 00:21:04.930 align:middle line:84%
There is something more
to you than a body.

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And as you evolve, you become
an energetic being more than a

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.810 align:middle line:90%
being of flesh and blood.

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:14.310 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the great
"Law of One" teachings.

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:18.190 align:middle line:84%
We are evolving into
an energetic life form.

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:21.160 align:middle line:84%
We are taking steps
in our evolution that

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:25.520 align:middle line:84%
leads to a much greater
level of attainment

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:29.640 align:middle line:84%
than what we can do with
our flesh right now.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.990 align:middle line:84%
The "Law of One" also teaches
us that negative forces

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:35.340 align:middle line:90%
are allowed to exist.

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:38.080 align:middle line:84%
The real reason why the
negative forces are here

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:40.590 align:middle line:84%
is that they provide
an incentive for us

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:45.200 align:middle line:84%
to grow into becoming more
loving and evolved people.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And that is the greatest
function that they provide.

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:51.370 align:middle line:84%
We are given
difficult experiences

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:54.940 align:middle line:84%
not for this random
nasty reason.

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:57.040 align:middle line:90%
Even if we die, we reincarnate.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.950 align:middle line:84%
That's a basic "Law
of One" teaching.

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:02.550 align:middle line:84%
We keep coming back, and we
keep learning the same lessons.

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And the "Law of
One" also tells us

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.680 align:middle line:84%
that there is a
great deal of work

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:11.360 align:middle line:84%
being done to maintain the
illusion that we are alone

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.090 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, that
nobody's looking out for us,

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:15.680 align:middle line:90%
that nobody's protecting us.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And this is important because
if a group like the group that

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:22.000 align:middle line:84%
formed the Law of
One teachings or many

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.430 align:middle line:84%
of these other positive
extraterrestrial groups

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:27.670 align:middle line:84%
openly showed up and
said, here we are.

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And demonstrated that they
could fly, and demonstrated

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:32.430 align:middle line:84%
that they could levitate
objects with their minds,

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:34.750 align:middle line:84%
and demonstrated
telepathic communication,

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:37.000 align:middle line:84%
and demonstrated
instantaneous healing,

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.720 align:middle line:84%
just like we heard in the Bible,
what are people going to say?

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.000 align:middle line:90%
Second coming.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.310 align:middle line:90%
The Messiah.

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:46.150 align:middle line:84%
They're going to worship
those people as gods.

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:48.820 align:middle line:90%
And that is not desired.

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:52.130 align:middle line:84%
What we do desire is to
learn through experience.

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And so there is a very carefully
manicured and tailored illusion

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:00.410 align:middle line:84%
in our world that keeps
us somewhat confused.

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:03.640 align:middle line:84%
But it's very important that
the seeds of our awakening

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:08.500 align:middle line:84%
are planted so that we have the
opportunity to pierce the veil,

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.650 align:middle line:84%
to remember who we really
are, and to directly

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:15.560 align:middle line:84%
enter into the next level
of our own human evolution.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:19.310 align:middle line:84%
So how do all these seemingly
different topics tie together?

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:21.890 align:middle line:84%
The common denominator
is the truth.

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:25.340 align:middle line:84%
These topics are all hidden
truth the Illuminati does not

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:26.100 align:middle line:90%
want you to know.

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And on this program
we'll shine a light

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:30.500 align:middle line:90%
on these great mysteries.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:33.290 align:middle line:84%
You have to remember too
that the "Law of One"

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:35.520 align:middle line:90%
didn't just pop out of nowhere.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:39.970 align:middle line:84%
The "Law of One" was the
result of a pedigree of work

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:42.300 align:middle line:84%
that had been built
up before that.

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And one of the real
pioneers, if you will,

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:49.120 align:middle line:84%
the fourth Beatle of the
Law of One is named George.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:52.200 align:middle line:84%
But instead of George Harrison,
it's George Hunt Williamson.

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:56.780 align:middle line:84%
George Hunt Williamson
wrote books in the 1950s.

00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And he really was the beginning
of this movement in the UFO

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.940 align:middle line:84%
field called the "Space
Brothers," the idea

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:06.350 align:middle line:84%
that extraterrestrials
are benevolent,

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:08.900 align:middle line:84%
that they look like
us, they look human,

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.780 align:middle line:84%
and that they are trying to
bring us into a golden age.

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:16.330 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't until the early 1960s
with the Betty and Barney Hill

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:20.480 align:middle line:10%
UFO events that UFOs started
to go in the negative direction

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.590 align:middle line:10%
and you start to
hear about grays

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:24.520 align:middle line:10%
with large eyes and big heads.

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:28.700 align:middle line:10%
And they do exist, but there
is so much more to the story.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.750 align:middle line:84%
There was almost a
solid decade where

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:35.150 align:middle line:84%
all the stuff having
to do with UFOs focused

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:38.590 align:middle line:84%
on the benevolent, positive
groups that were at work

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:39.500 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And George Hunt
Williamson was definitely

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:43.340 align:middle line:90%
the leader of that group.

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:48.300 align:middle line:84%
George Hunt Williamson was also
working with a scientist named

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:49.740 align:middle line:90%
WB Smith.

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.150 align:middle line:90%
I've talked about him.

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:55.400 align:middle line:84%
He's a Canadian defense engineer
who had a classified security

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.570 align:middle line:90%
clearance.

00:24:56.570 --> 00:25:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And he did achieve
direct contact

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:01.920 align:middle line:84%
with these benevolent
Space Brothers.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.950 align:middle line:84%
They literally came down and
landed and showed themselves

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:08.180 align:middle line:84%
to him, as they did to
George Hunt Williamson.

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:10.480 align:middle line:84%
So between these
two guys, we have

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.560 align:middle line:84%
a lot that we can talk
about because in their books

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:18.390 align:middle line:84%
from the 1950s, they described
experiencing a telegraph

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:22.160 align:middle line:84%
contact with
extraterrestrials and UFOs.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:26.980 align:middle line:10%
And that contact led to
telepathic thought transfer

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:28.780 align:middle line:10%
through a series of individuals.

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:33.170 align:middle line:10%
WB Smith interviewed many people
and brought all that knowledge

00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:33.760 align:middle line:10%
together.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:37.010 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to talk a
lot more about him later on.

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:39.020 align:middle line:84%
But I want to make
the point here

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:43.440 align:middle line:84%
that Hunt Williamson and
Smith together brought out

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:47.300 align:middle line:84%
so much information that
was of such high quality

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.210 align:middle line:84%
that when you read
the information,

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:52.050 align:middle line:84%
something happens
called "tuning."

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:53.650 align:middle line:90%
You hear this knowledge.

00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:56.190 align:middle line:84%
You're thinking about
it in your own mind.

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And what it actually does
is it raises your vibration,

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:01.980 align:middle line:84%
as these sources
call it, and this

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:06.080 align:middle line:84%
allows you ultimately to receive
your own telepathic contact.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.870 align:middle line:84%
