>>DAVID WILCOCK: All right,
welcome to another episode

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.360 align:middle line:10%
of "Disclosure."

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.260 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, David Wilcock.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.980 align:middle line:10%
And I am here with
Dr. Pete Peterson.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.670 align:middle line:10%
So Pete, welcome
back to the show.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.340 align:middle line:84%
>>PETE PETERSON:
Thanks a lot, David.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So I was living
in Virginia Beach from 1997

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.660 align:middle line:90%
to about 2002.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think it
was in 2000 that I

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.980 align:middle line:84%
saw a talk by Gregg Braden,
who has been interviewed

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.140 align:middle line:90%
for this network before.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And he was showing some
truly remarkable photographs

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.550 align:middle line:84%
from something that was
called the de la Warr camera.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And this was really interesting
because the idea was

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.800 align:middle line:84%
that you could take a sample
from a particular life form

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.570 align:middle line:90%
and then hit it with some kind--

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.420 align:middle line:90%
it was inside some kind of coil.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.940 align:middle line:84%
I believe X-rays may
have been involved.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And photographs were then
made that would apparently

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.230 align:middle line:84%
reveal health issues
inside the body,

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.360 align:middle line:90%
like photographs of organs.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And then I later went to the
US Psychotronics Association

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.760 align:middle line:90%
as an invited speaker.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And I saw a whole seminar
on this de la Warr camera.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And some of the photographs
were very bizarre,

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.930 align:middle line:84%
including, apparently, that they
were able to use the de la Warr

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.130 align:middle line:84%
camera to photograph an area
where a wedding had taken place

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.410 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.517 align:middle line:84%
And they were somehow
able to dial in the time

00:01:43.517 --> 00:01:44.600 align:middle line:90%
that the wedding happened.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And you actually saw the
wedding in the photograph.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.380 align:middle line:84%
So psychotronics and that
whole subject of radionics,

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.340 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, is a huge subject.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.577 align:middle line:84%
And I'm interested to hear
what you know about that.

00:01:55.577 --> 00:01:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, it
was one of those things

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.810 align:middle line:84%
that I was called
on to debunk it.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And so
I started looking

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.440 align:middle line:84%
at the luminaries in that field
and started studying with them

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.840 align:middle line:84%
and found out that I didn't
have anything to debunk,

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.700 align:middle line:90%
and I had a lot to learn.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.440 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And
as a result, there

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.190 align:middle line:90%
are several areas of that field.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.330 align:middle line:84%
The beginning of it
started with Albert Abrams,

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.130 align:middle line:84%
who was the head of medical
science at Stanford University.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.930 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:34.740 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: That's pretty heavy.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:35.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.288 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Well, very heavy.

00:02:36.288 --> 00:02:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And then these days
were the beginning days

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.620 align:middle line:90%
of what we call electronics.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And people were
trying various things.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, electricity
and electrons

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.720 align:middle line:84%
were the magic
words in those days.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.320 align:middle line:84%
So people didn't understand
it, so they tried everything

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.590 align:middle line:84%
to see what they
could come up with.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And he came up
with a machine that

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.055 align:middle line:84%
could take what they called
a witness from a person.

00:03:06.055 --> 00:03:09.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's what the de la Warr
camera and the Drown cameras

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.660 align:middle line:84%
have done is they took, like,
a fingernail, or an eyebrow,

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.850 align:middle line:90%
or a piece of hair.

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And then they found out even
a handwriting sample would do.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And they found out that
inherent in these things

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.770 align:middle line:90%
were information.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.660 align:middle line:84%
Some 35, 40 years
later, I did my thesis

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.439 align:middle line:84%
on what I called the
informational field.

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:37.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But what were they
doing with these witnesses?

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:38.590 align:middle line:90%
What was the--

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.131 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: What
the witness would do

00:03:40.131 --> 00:03:42.680 align:middle line:84%
is allow you to extract
from it virtually any

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.080 align:middle line:84%
and all information
from the person

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.880 align:middle line:90%
that the witness had come from.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Information.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.690 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Medical information,
physical information, disease,

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.330 align:middle line:84%
DNA things that they had
DNA positives and negatives

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.280 align:middle line:90%
that they had.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.290 align:middle line:90%
You could do medical diagnoses.

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.230 align:middle line:84%
You could do
psychological diagnoses.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.580 align:middle line:90%
The cameras came about.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And so you could do a
photograph of a person

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.910 align:middle line:90%
merely from their witness.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.250 align:middle line:84%
A person could be clear on
the other side of the world,

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.720 align:middle line:84%
and you could get a perfectly
good photograph of them.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You'd see their
face in the photograph.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.380 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Oh, yes, see
everything and by everything.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:30.020 align:middle line:84%
As they got into doing X-rays
and basically what today

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:36.230 align:middle line:84%
we'd call CAT scans or MRIs, you
could see the internal organs.

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:37.790 align:middle line:90%
You could see their condition.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.840 align:middle line:84%
You could set the camera
up so that it would see

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.790 align:middle line:90%
things that were hot or cold.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.500 align:middle line:84%
A lot of diseases, you're going
to find heat involved in them.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And so you could
photograph a person

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.220 align:middle line:84%
and photograph the
liver, for example,

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.000 align:middle line:84%
and see that there
was cancer there.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: If you showed one of
these photographs of a liver

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.030 align:middle line:84%
to a doctor who didn't know
how it had been obtained,

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.940 align:middle line:84%
what would he think
he was looking at?

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.672 align:middle line:84%
Did you have to
interpret it as a liver?

00:05:08.672 --> 00:05:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Or did it really
look like a liver?

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.980 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Oh, this is actual
photograph of the liver--

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:14.780 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.690 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: --and that
person's liver with the things

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.250 align:middle line:84%
that it had right
and wrong with it.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.410 align:middle line:84%
The de la Warrs were a
couple that lived in England

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:31.980 align:middle line:84%
and had gotten into radionics
by learning from Albert Abrams.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And then they started
making machines

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.610 align:middle line:84%
and started going beyond the
limitations that Abrams had.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And for years, that
company has made

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.482 align:middle line:90%
a whole series of instruments.

00:05:44.482 --> 00:05:47.790 align:middle line:90%


00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.720 align:middle line:84%
One of them, you can take
a hair, or a fingernail,

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.720 align:middle line:84%
or a blood spot, or a sputum
spot, a little drop of sputum

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.150 align:middle line:84%
on a blotter, put it
in the instrument.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And you can dial in
various just numbers.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that you
can just write the numbers,

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.420 align:middle line:84%
or you can actually
have an electronic dial,

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.360 align:middle line:84%
like the dial for your
volume on your radio

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.970 align:middle line:90%
or tuning your radio.

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And you could dial
in these numbers,

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:28.450 align:middle line:84%
which they called rates, for
lack of words to use for it.

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And from these rates,
then you could sense--

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.740 align:middle line:84%
you put a sensor in
line with the device.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And there were different
kinds of sensors.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.600 align:middle line:84%
Some people who were good
at dowsing with a pendulum

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.550 align:middle line:84%
would just use a pendulum
held over the device.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.350 align:middle line:90%
Some had a dial.

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:52.410 align:middle line:90%
It had a 0 to 100 scale.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:56.240 align:middle line:84%
It's like the electronic
dial on a radio,

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.040 align:middle line:90%
varies the amount of power.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:04.800 align:middle line:84%
But on this device, you could
draw a dial and turn it.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And it would act as if
you had the actual device.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.430 align:middle line:84%
So it was really
something that was dealing

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:15.270 align:middle line:84%
with an informational
aspect that we

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.140 align:middle line:90%
didn't know of in those ways.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, it seems like
there's a historical precedent

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.630 align:middle line:84%
for this kind of
stuff if you think

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:27.150 align:middle line:84%
about Celtic magic involving
where they draw runes.

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And those runes are related to
the focusing of consciousness,

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:32.460 align:middle line:90%
or sigils being another example.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.450 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Exactly.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:37.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you
could draw a sigil.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And the idea I've heard
about drawing sigils

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.870 align:middle line:84%
is that you're focusing
the intent of consciousness

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.950 align:middle line:90%
into that illustration.

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:47.707 align:middle line:84%
And that's what gives
it power in some sense.

00:07:47.707 --> 00:07:48.540 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Exactly.

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.765 align:middle line:90%
It takes a human.

00:07:51.765 --> 00:07:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And let's say, for
lack of words--

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:57.360 align:middle line:84%
the big problem in
this whole field

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.420 align:middle line:90%
is a lack of actual words.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:04.350 align:middle line:84%
So people picked up
words, like so many people

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:middle line:84%
today in what we'll
call new age medicine

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.010 align:middle line:90%
talk about frequencies.

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And when you ask them
what a frequency is,

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.350 align:middle line:84%
they wouldn't have the slightest
idea what "frequency" means.

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:17.820 align:middle line:90%
That's a word with a definition.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:18.750 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: But it
was used because it

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:24.280 align:middle line:84%
had a lot of the aspects of
what they were talking about.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Sure.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: We need
to clarify this,

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.040 align:middle line:90%
and we need to make a science.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.240 align:middle line:90%
It is a science.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.990 align:middle line:84%
We need to make a man-known
science out of it.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And I got involved
in that early on

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:41.370 align:middle line:84%
because I liked things
that appeared to be magic

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:44.220 align:middle line:84%
that there must be some
reason behind because you

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.830 align:middle line:84%
could get repeatable
results, one after another

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:48.720 align:middle line:90%
after another.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.370 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Could you--

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.350 align:middle line:84%
I guess there's really
no way to test this.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:57.420 align:middle line:84%
But if a pattern
of rocks in nature

00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.210 align:middle line:84%
happened to fall into
one of these shapes

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:02.850 align:middle line:84%
and no human was
involved, would that

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:05.550 align:middle line:90%
shape itself still have power?

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Not unless a
human had imbued that power.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:08.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.620 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: The power comes--

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:13.290 align:middle line:84%
and I hate to use the
word "spiritually,"

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.270 align:middle line:84%
but we don't have another
word in the English

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:16.110 align:middle line:90%
that comes close.

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:19.350 align:middle line:90%
But it's informationally.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:23.910 align:middle line:84%
The person develops information
and imbues that information

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:28.290 align:middle line:84%
to the witness or
to the instrument

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:32.050 align:middle line:90%
itself to represent something.

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:35.750 align:middle line:90%
And over a period of time--

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:39.370 align:middle line:84%
A modern day
researcher in this is

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:42.220 align:middle line:84%
a gentleman by name of Rupert
Sheldrake out of England--

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:43.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Sure.

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:46.020 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: --who
is quite well known

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.960 align:middle line:90%
for his morphogenetic fields.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And he basically
was a biologist.

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.220 align:middle line:84%
So he uses a lot of
biological terms.

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.850 align:middle line:90%


00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:02.310 align:middle line:84%
But described a lot of things
that happened prior to that

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:08.880 align:middle line:84%
in the area of radionics, which
then became psychotronics.

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.760 align:middle line:84%
There is a US
Psychotronics Association.

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And in all fields
where there really

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:22.500 align:middle line:84%
isn't a good science behind it,
developed science behind it,

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.400 align:middle line:84%
people tend to use words
that they're familiar with,

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.910 align:middle line:84%
that are words that they've
heard used by scientists

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:30.650 align:middle line:90%
to make it sound scientific.

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, let
me ask you this.

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:34.460 align:middle line:84%
When I went to the US
Psychotronics Association

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:37.610 align:middle line:84%
conference and heard about what
they were calling radionics--

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:40.760 align:middle line:84%
they were still using
that term as well--

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:44.330 align:middle line:84%
some of what I had
heard was that people

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.030 align:middle line:84%
would rub their
fingers on a plate

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:49.790 align:middle line:84%
and the perception of
it becoming more sticky

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:52.430 align:middle line:84%
would somehow be an
answer that came,

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.619 align:middle line:84%
I guess, from what you
could call their intuition.

00:10:54.619 --> 00:10:55.910 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: That's all correct.

00:10:55.910 --> 00:11:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And the stick plate is probably
my favorite device to use.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And I have many
scientific devices

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:07.010 align:middle line:84%
that I've designed and
built. And the stick plate

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:09.860 align:middle line:90%
works probably the best.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And Sheldrake found that
the universe had a memory.

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:18.470 align:middle line:90%
And it was lazy.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.910 align:middle line:84%
Once something got
started, it like

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:26.150 align:middle line:84%
to continue with that name,
or that color, or that shape.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And then radionics
in those days,

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:34.880 align:middle line:84%
the plastic that we had
was a phenolic material.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:39.290 align:middle line:84%
So traditional radionic
machines used phenolic plates.

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And you can polish it up
so that it's like plate

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:47.360 align:middle line:90%
glass, and very, very smooth.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And you rub your fingers,
usually more than one,

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:55.500 align:middle line:90%
on this material.

00:11:55.500 --> 00:12:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And you have a dial that can be
a dial that's just a drawing,

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:05.720 align:middle line:84%
or it can be a dial that's
actually what, in electronics,

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.440 align:middle line:90%
we call a potentiometer.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.240 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:09.965 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: A variable resistor?

00:12:09.965 --> 00:12:11.300 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: A variable resistor.

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:14.060 align:middle line:90%
It's a long piece of many cases.

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:17.240 align:middle line:84%
It's a long piece
of carbon material.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:21.740 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And as
you turn a wiper that

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:25.520 align:middle line:84%
wipes on this semi-circle
of carbon material,

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:30.920 align:middle line:84%
or a circle of carbon material,
the carbon has a resistance.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And you have more
and more and more

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:37.310 align:middle line:84%
resistance as the distance
from a terminal on the device

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:41.500 align:middle line:84%
to a wiper that's
connected to a dial.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:45.360 align:middle line:84%
So it becomes more, or the
resistance becomes more.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.340 align:middle line:84%
But just something
that increases

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:51.920 align:middle line:84%
in numbers, or distance, or
angle and all of these things

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.960 align:middle line:84%
that are part of the
informational field

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.680 align:middle line:90%
of the object--

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.090 align:middle line:84%
so you have
something that varies

00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:59.750 align:middle line:90%
that informational field.

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:00.630 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What were you
testing with these devices?

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:05.770 align:middle line:90%
What was the objective?

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:07.980 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: What the
objective was as you said,

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:12.750 align:middle line:84%
I want a piece of information
from this particular item.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:15.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, you could take a blood
spot of a person, which

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.660 align:middle line:90%
is typical in radionics.

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And you put the blood spot
in a little brass drawer

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.410 align:middle line:90%
or a little round brass cup.

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:26.060 align:middle line:90%
And it hooks to a wire.

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:30.960 align:middle line:84%
There's no electrical current
that is moving at all.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:38.690 align:middle line:84%
It's a optical
representation of something.

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:42.260 align:middle line:84%
You say, OK, I'm going
to use this set up,

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:46.170 align:middle line:84%
this drawing, this shape,
these type of connections

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:52.080 align:middle line:84%
as a representation of
how well is the person.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So if I had a blood
spot from someone, could I say,

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:58.220 align:middle line:84%
is this person at risk of
getting cancer or diabetes,

00:13:58.220 --> 00:13:59.180 align:middle line:90%
that kind of thing?

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:00.620 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: You could
ask if they're at risk.

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:02.360 align:middle line:84%
You could ask if
they have it, if they

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:06.380 align:middle line:84%
have cancer or diabetes,
what kind, how much.

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:08.630 align:middle line:90%
You can extract all information.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:10.740 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Somebody would say--

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.465 align:middle line:84%
who's not educated about this--
well, this is quack science.

00:14:13.465 --> 00:14:14.265 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:14:14.265 --> 00:14:16.431 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Oh, it's called
quack science every day.

00:14:16.431 --> 00:14:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And you can go on
the internet, read

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.000 align:middle line:90%
all about the quack science.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.380 align:middle line:84%
The problem is,
the quack science

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.360 align:middle line:90%
is 90% to 100% accurate.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:28.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: [LAUGHS] So there
were people over an established

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.390 align:middle line:90%
period of time.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:31.010 align:middle line:84%
You said this started
with the guy who

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:33.870 align:middle line:84%
was the head of medical science
at Stanford University, Abrams.

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Right.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:37.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So here we have
this figure, Pete, Abrams,

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:41.840 align:middle line:84%
who obviously is very
controversial in terms

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.780 align:middle line:84%
of making these discoveries
that fly completely

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:49.550 align:middle line:84%
in the face of accepted
scientific inquiry.

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, people are
going to call him a quack.

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.580 align:middle line:84%
They're going to say that
this is all nonsense.

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.070 align:middle line:84%
Yet, the guy does
have a medical degree.

00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:02.480 align:middle line:84%
He does have a legitimate
professional background.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.850 align:middle line:90%
What are some of the results--

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:06.500 align:middle line:90%
Let me just ask you this.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.800 align:middle line:84%
Were there people out
there, practitioners,

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:14.540 align:middle line:84%
who did get very reliable
results using this technique?

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: He taught many, many
people to practice his thing.

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:23.670 align:middle line:84%
In the very beginning,
Abrams used a method

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:28.990 align:middle line:84%
of diagnosis, where he did
what he called succussion

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:29.790 align:middle line:90%
to the body.

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:33.450 align:middle line:84%
He would put his fingers
on part of the body,

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:35.820 align:middle line:84%
and rap it, and
listen for the sound,

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:40.140 align:middle line:84%
either with a
stethoscope or by ear.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And he could pick up sounds
that came from the body

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:48.375 align:middle line:90%
based on structure underneath.

00:15:48.375 --> 00:15:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And he got to be very,
very good with that.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And that type of diagnosis
was being taught worldwide.

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:00.870 align:middle line:84%
After a period of time,
he taught in England,

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:02.560 align:middle line:84%
I know, and he
taught in Germany.

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.290 align:middle line:90%
And he schooled in Germany.

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:09.610 align:middle line:84%
He had a doctor's degree
from a school in Germany.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And then later on, because he
was using electronic parts,

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:23.040 align:middle line:84%
these resistors, and he
would put them in series.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:26.100 align:middle line:84%
And one would go
from 1 to 10, and one

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:31.030 align:middle line:84%
would go from 10 to 100, and
one would go from 100 to 1,000,

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:32.220 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, et cetera.

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And he ended up by
finding that there

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:39.640 align:middle line:84%
were certain numbers you could
dial in and succuss the body.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:44.847 align:middle line:84%
And the body would
change its audio sound.

00:16:44.847 --> 00:16:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: As if there
was a healing going on.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: As if there
was something happening.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.280 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And then from that,
he learned to do diagnosis.

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And then he learned
to take it backwards.

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:59.970 align:middle line:84%
He would put those numbers
in and invert the numbers.

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:05.369 align:middle line:84%
And by inverting the numbers,
he would then treat the person.

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:10.406 align:middle line:84%
And the disease would go away
or would lessen considerably.

00:17:10.406 --> 00:17:11.280 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Interesting.

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.696 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And
so he taught that.

00:17:12.696 --> 00:17:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And that was taught
all over the world.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.690 align:middle line:84%
It's still a favored way
of diagnosis in Britain,

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:20.489 align:middle line:90%
the British Radionics Society.

00:17:20.489 --> 00:17:23.069 align:middle line:90%


00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:32.560 align:middle line:84%
One time when I was teaching
some of my medicine in France,

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:37.950 align:middle line:84%
there was a little store,
like an American 7-Eleven

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:41.370 align:middle line:84%
in the back side of the
big hotel I stayed in.

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'd walk down to what
appeared to be an alley.

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:49.200 align:middle line:84%
It was a street, small
street, usually at night

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.580 align:middle line:84%
and pick up some
snacks or something.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.860 align:middle line:84%
I did that one
afternoon in the daytime

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.450 align:middle line:84%
and noticed across
the street, there

00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:02.310 align:middle line:84%
was a half of a building
called radiesthesia, which is

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:05.130 align:middle line:90%
the French word for radionics.

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:10.332 align:middle line:84%
So I went in and had an
unbelievable experience there

00:18:10.332 --> 00:18:11.790 align:middle line:84%
and found that this
had been taught

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:14.680 align:middle line:84%
in France for as long as it
had been taught in the United

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:17.970 align:middle line:84%
States, and then in
England, and then Germany,

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:20.472 align:middle line:90%
where Abrams had influence.

00:18:20.472 --> 00:18:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So how
does this translate

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:24.060 align:middle line:84%
into the use of a
camera technology,

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:25.380 align:middle line:90%
like we see with de la Warr?

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, up until
now, this sounds more

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:31.530 align:middle line:84%
like a human
consciousness phenomenon.

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And now, you're
saying that someone

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:38.210 align:middle line:84%
was able to actually capture
real photographs of this.

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:41.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, I haven't seen very many
de la Warr camera photos online.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.340 align:middle line:84%
But I saw a bunch of them at the
US Psychotronics Association,

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:45.760 align:middle line:90%
and they are amazing.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.670 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: They're
very amazing.

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Many books have
been written on it.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.320 align:middle line:84%
Machines have been
written up in books.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:56.290 align:middle line:84%
This technology, this science,
wasn't really a science.

00:18:56.290 --> 00:19:00.210 align:middle line:84%
It was something that it
was a phenomena that people

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:02.840 align:middle line:90%
could evoke, such as dowsing.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.340 align:middle line:90%
There have been dowsers.

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:08.580 align:middle line:84%
I have a little collection
of Egyptian dowsing equipment

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:12.240 align:middle line:84%
from the Middle
Kingdom of Egypt.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.730 align:middle line:90%
And they used it.

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:18.900 align:middle line:84%
It was used to find
most of the wells

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:24.210 align:middle line:84%
in the deserts of Africa,
the Sahara, and other deserts

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:26.760 align:middle line:90%
of Africa and Arab deserts.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:31.380 align:middle line:84%
There was a gentleman who was
a scientist, a trained engineer

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:36.300 align:middle line:84%
and scientist, and used dowsing
to locate these wells all

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.800 align:middle line:84%
over the deserts back
in the '20s and '30s.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.750 align:middle line:90%
His name was Stephan Riess.

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And there's a very plush valley
in California between San

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:52.740 align:middle line:90%
Fernando Valley and the ocean.

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's where Stephan Riess
lived on a mountain called

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:58.500 align:middle line:90%
Sulphur Mountain.

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And he said you can
always find artesian water

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:03.780 align:middle line:90%
at the top of a mountain.

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And at his ranch, which was
the top of the mountain,

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:11.850 align:middle line:84%
they dug a couple of
2-foot-diameter holes

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:14.910 align:middle line:84%
that shot water 20
feet out the top.

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:15.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:17.700 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And
they were artesian.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And then the people in the
valley there said, well,

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.250 align:middle line:90%
it's a very dry valley.

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:23.720 align:middle line:84%
Could you find
water in the valley?

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And he went towards San Fernando
Valley and got near the top.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And there are four
4-foot-diameter wells

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:33.740 align:middle line:90%
that pump water.

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Yeah, I remember
doing a show on dowsing.

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:39.410 align:middle line:84%
I believe we have it here
on "Wisdom Teachings,"

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:43.790 align:middle line:84%
and covering a guy named
Jacques Aymar-Vernay, who

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:47.660 align:middle line:84%
was such a good dowser that
he could dowse out murders

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:49.670 align:middle line:84%
and who had
committed the murder,

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:52.310 align:middle line:84%
and was so good that they
actually got convictions off

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:53.310 align:middle line:90%
of what he had done.

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: There
are many dowsers

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:59.300 align:middle line:90%
that do that through the years.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.210 align:middle line:84%
The lady that I trained
from was written up

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:06.500 align:middle line:84%
in "The Secret Life of
Plants" and other such books.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I went out, and
she gave three sets

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:14.270 align:middle line:90%
of classes, one-week classes.

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:22.490 align:middle line:84%
In the first class, a person
could go to a hospital,

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:27.280 align:middle line:84%
get a blood sample on a
little piece of-- they used

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:29.240 align:middle line:84%
like a blotter,
like you used to use

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.850 align:middle line:90%
and when you used liquid ink.

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:32.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:38.930 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And she'd
take a very dry piece

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:41.750 align:middle line:84%
of material, thick
cardboard, and they'd

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:43.040 align:middle line:90%
put a blood spot on it.

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And they'd put the person
down on the blood spot.

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And then they would seal
it in a little envelope.

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:51.350 align:middle line:84%
There are some
little tiny envelopes

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:53.330 align:middle line:84%
they had that are used
for sealing stamps

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:55.640 align:middle line:90%
in stamp collections.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And then they would put that in
a little manila envelope that

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.880 align:middle line:90%
was maybe an inch by two.

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And then they would put
that in a standard envelope.

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And they'd all be
sealed, and they

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:11.300 align:middle line:84%
would be given a name and a
number on each one of them.

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:14.030 align:middle line:84%
The person who took
the sample didn't

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:16.940 align:middle line:84%
know the person they were
getting the sample from.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.880 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know what
number the other person

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:23.990 align:middle line:84%
had assigned-- each envelope
would be assigned a number.

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And those would be kept
by various people, sealed,

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:30.230 align:middle line:90%
all sealed.

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
go to a laboratory.

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:36.470 align:middle line:84%
This lady's name was
Frances Farrelly.

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:41.000 align:middle line:84%
She ran a school for medical
lab technicians in Florida

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.380 align:middle line:90%
for many years.

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And then they would do an
analysis of this blood sample

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:50.360 align:middle line:84%
and find a number of
different things from that.

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:52.130 align:middle line:90%
And they would write that down.

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:57.680 align:middle line:84%
But they would just do it from
a stack of random envelopes.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:00.690 align:middle line:84%
The outer envelope would
have no number on it.

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And they used to take
random envelopes.

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:05.570 align:middle line:84%
Then after all
that was done, they

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:08.060 align:middle line:84%
would go back through,
open the envelopes,

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:14.900 align:middle line:84%
and see how the radionic
diagnosis matched

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:16.970 align:middle line:90%
the biochemical diagnosis.

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And after a period of
time, they developed

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:23.090 align:middle line:90%
a technique, which she taught.

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
in this class, we

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:30.920 align:middle line:84%
would have envelopes
that had been preceded

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:34.310 align:middle line:84%
by numerous different
people, some of them

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:38.390 align:middle line:84%
scientific organizations,
some of them colleges.

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And so we would never know
where the sample originally

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:43.830 align:middle line:90%
came from.

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:47.540 align:middle line:84%
After the third day, we
were running about 98%

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:49.200 align:middle line:90%
accuracy for everything.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, wow.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And how many people were
in the class roughly?

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:52.546 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: 12 people.

00:23:52.546 --> 00:23:54.960 align:middle line:84%
She always had 12
people in a class.

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, I
want to get back

00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:57.890 align:middle line:90%
to what I asked you before.

00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:59.180 align:middle line:90%
We kind of get off on dowsing.

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:03.036 align:middle line:84%
But what is the method by which
the photograph is captured

00:24:03.036 --> 00:24:05.660 align:middle line:84%
when we're getting to the point
of actually taking photographs.

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:06.734 align:middle line:90%
You say it's a phenomena.

00:24:06.734 --> 00:24:08.150 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: They
take you witness.

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:09.080 align:middle line:90%
They take a witness.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:14.300 align:middle line:84%
They can take a hair, a
blood spot, a piece of skin,

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:16.730 align:middle line:84%
some epithelial cells,
now that they're

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:20.610 align:middle line:84%
using that for
testing, DNA testing,

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:24.460 align:middle line:84%
from a little scrape from
the inside of the mouth.

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:26.030 align:middle line:90%
And they can take that witness.

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:28.700 align:middle line:90%
And they put in the machine--

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:32.420 align:middle line:84%
The machine is built
somewhat like a camera

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:34.160 align:middle line:90%
like a reflex camera.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:38.180 align:middle line:84%
So they put it in the
optical path of the camera.

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And then they put a film in
the camera, a plate film,

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:43.940 align:middle line:84%
like a old-style
plate film camera.

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:46.820 align:middle line:84%
Or some of the
new ones have used

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:50.970 align:middle line:84%
Polaroid film, which I don't
know if that's still available

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:51.770 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:54.530 align:middle line:84%
I think it still
is for some things.

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:57.530 align:middle line:84%
I use some in my
electronic equipment.

00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:59.240 align:middle line:90%
And you put that in.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And then you expose it
for a period of time.

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:04.190 align:middle line:84%
Then you take it
out and develop it.

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:06.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, in order for that
film to be developed,

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:10.250 align:middle line:84%
something had to strike the
film to cause it to expose.

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:11.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Sure.

00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: The thing
that was in focus

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:18.350 align:middle line:84%
was the witness, the
hair of the person,

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:20.720 align:middle line:90%
or a blood spot from the person.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And there were a couple of
mirrors in the device, one

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:27.800 align:middle line:90%
a magnifying mirror.

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And it would produce
a photograph.

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And you could look
at it and compare it

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.000 align:middle line:90%
with an X-ray in the beginning.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And it would be the same as the
X-ray, but far more accurate.

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:40.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:43.430 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: An X-ray has
to be exposed properly.

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:45.320 align:middle line:84%
How much tissue is
it going through?

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:50.960 align:middle line:84%
How much more voltage of
X-ray do we need in order

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.910 align:middle line:90%
to get a clear picture?

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:57.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I seem to remember
when I saw the USPA conference

00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:01.430 align:middle line:84%
description of de la Warr that
there was either one or two

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:06.020 align:middle line:84%
coils of round metallic
wires around the witness

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:08.270 align:middle line:84%
while it was in the optical
path, something like that.

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:09.811 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: In the
de la Warr camera,

00:26:09.811 --> 00:26:11.160 align:middle line:90%
they used that for a sensor.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.460 align:middle line:84%
In the Drown camera,
they just use optics.

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:14.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh.

00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:16.460 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Because
what happens is,

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:19.190 align:middle line:84%
you're dealing here
with information

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:23.000 align:middle line:84%
in a very different manner
than we've ever looked at it.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.520 align:middle line:84%
So anything that would
have the information

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.830 align:middle line:84%
could then convey
the information.

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And the person's mental
desire for the way the camera

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:36.380 align:middle line:84%
worked, that's the
way it would work.

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:39.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I do remember
that at this particular Us

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.290 align:middle line:84%
Psychotronics
Association Conference,

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:47.510 align:middle line:84%
there was this sort of ongoing
conspiratorial whispering

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:51.500 align:middle line:84%
about the idea that
the real agent at work

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:55.700 align:middle line:84%
was de la Warr's female
assistant in the lab

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:58.520 align:middle line:84%
and that the camera, without
her, didn't necessarily

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:00.830 align:middle line:84%
work, that she
needed to be there,

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:03.650 align:middle line:84%
that somehow she had
something to do with it.

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:05.900 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Belief had
a lot to do with it.

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:09.860 align:middle line:84%
Rupert Sheldrake found this
in his biology as well.

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's what you
believe the camera would

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:16.100 align:middle line:90%
do was what it would do.

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:18.090 align:middle line:90%
It was all information.

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:22.280 align:middle line:84%
That wasn't-- it wasn't
based on a chemical process.

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.404 align:middle line:84%
You could use
chemical processes,

00:27:24.404 --> 00:27:25.820 align:middle line:84%
and they would do
different things

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:27.080 align:middle line:90%
than they would normally do.

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:29.030 align:middle line:84%
Or they would do the
same things depending

00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:32.690 align:middle line:84%
on the particular
person's knowledge,

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:35.990 align:middle line:90%
training, desires, wishes.

00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And operators, some
operators weren't that good.

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:47.000 align:middle line:84%
You had to learn to hold your
mind pretty much as a blank,

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.160 align:middle line:90%
don't preconceive things.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And so you could say it
wasn't an exact science.

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:58.490 align:middle line:84%
But overall, like
in remote viewing,

00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:00.680 align:middle line:84%
they get three or
four people's views

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.550 align:middle line:90%
and then add those together.

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is that
the false parts of it

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:12.410 align:middle line:84%
tend to disappear
from the result,

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:15.140 align:middle line:84%
and the true things
tend to conglomerate.

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, I
have had the chance

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:20.384 align:middle line:84%
to speak at conferences
with Nancy Talbot, who's

00:28:20.384 --> 00:28:21.425 align:middle line:90%
a crop circle researcher.

00:28:21.425 --> 00:28:26.120 align:middle line:10%
Now, she showed me some really,
really amazing stuff, Pete.

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:28.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've
ever seen this before.

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:34.490 align:middle line:10%
But there is a
young man in Holland

00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:39.159 align:middle line:10%
who seems to know when a crop
circle is going to be made.

00:28:39.159 --> 00:28:40.700 align:middle line:84%
He can tell you when
it's going to be

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:43.130 align:middle line:90%
made, where it will be made.

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:46.630 align:middle line:90%
And not only that, but you can--

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:47.930 align:middle line:90%
and Nancy told me this story.

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:50.360 align:middle line:84%
You can take a
camera around the guy

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:53.420 align:middle line:84%
and just start hitting the
exposure button over and over

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:55.080 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And he will throw
images onto the film.

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And Nancy Talbot's
website has some examples

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:04.280 align:middle line:84%
of ghosts that this
guy would throw

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:08.690 align:middle line:84%
into the film that were very,
very shocking, in some cases,

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:09.930 align:middle line:90%
quite scary.

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: There's
much, much work,

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:16.520 align:middle line:84%
especially in England with
the British Radionics Society,

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:17.620 align:middle line:90%
much work there.

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:22.160 align:middle line:84%
There was a lady here who was
very, very famous for giving

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:25.700 align:middle line:84%
diagnoses that were contrary
to the medical diagnoses

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:30.540 align:middle line:84%
of the day and found to
be absolutely accurate.

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:31.790 align:middle line:90%
Her name was Ruth Drown.

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:35.530 align:middle line:84%
She was jailed for
doing this in LA.

00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And while she was jailed,
she was assassinated,

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:44.240 align:middle line:84%
but the assassin
was never found.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And she was throwing havoc
in the medical community.

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And there are
thousands of pictures

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:56.060 align:middle line:84%
that are published that you
can get from various places.

00:29:56.060 --> 00:30:00.050 align:middle line:84%
Probably the US Psychotronic
Association Library has, you

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:02.180 align:middle line:90%
know, much of that information.

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:04.100 align:middle line:10%
Later on, there was
a man who obtained

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:08.480 align:middle line:10%
one of her cameras, which were
made illegal, illegal devices,

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:11.264 align:middle line:10%
because they would do things
that couldn't be explained.

00:30:11.264 --> 00:30:13.180 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: And the government
doesn't like that.

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:15.305 align:middle line:10%
>>PETERSON: Well, the
government doesn't like that.

00:30:15.305 --> 00:30:19.560 align:middle line:10%
And various trade agencies
don't like that to have happen.

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:23.640 align:middle line:84%
The medical people, they
want to own medicine,

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.380 align:middle line:84%
and they don't want
new things really

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:29.180 align:middle line:84%
to happen in it that
they don't understand.

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:32.590 align:middle line:90%
And this is a science.

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:36.840 align:middle line:84%
You can make it
exceedingly accurate.

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:40.590 align:middle line:84%
The inaccuracies are
made by the operator.

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:44.660 align:middle line:90%


00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:47.310 align:middle line:84%
I make devices that don't
require an operator,

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:49.530 align:middle line:90%
but use the principals.

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:53.250 align:middle line:10%
There was a man in Britain
by name a Darrell Butcher,

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:58.050 align:middle line:10%
who made instruments that were
very, very similar to this.

00:30:58.050 --> 00:31:03.860 align:middle line:84%
He took a cribbage machine and
drew a picture of a backbone

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:07.770 align:middle line:90%
and tailbone on the machine.

00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And he was a chiropractor
in the beginning.

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:17.020 align:middle line:10%
And he used a stick
plate as a sensor,

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:19.270 align:middle line:10%
as did many of the
radionic machines

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:23.530 align:middle line:10%
that I've found that are very
accurate and can be trained.

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Frances Farrelly
would do 12 people

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:29.330 align:middle line:84%
in three different
classes every year.

00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And those people
would get 98 to 99%

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:37.090 align:middle line:84%
accurate to being able to do
a diagnoses from a person.

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:39.340 align:middle line:84%
In several instances,
they did a diagnosis

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:41.410 align:middle line:84%
of an astronaut
that was in space

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:43.330 align:middle line:84%
and found that it
was exactly right.

00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And they found where modern
science had made errors.

00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:49.990 align:middle line:84%
Most of the work that
was done this way

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:51.590 align:middle line:90%
was absolutely accurate.

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:54.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So what do
you think is actually

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:58.270 align:middle line:84%
happening when they take a
piece of a woman's wedding dress

00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:00.760 align:middle line:84%
as a witness and
then can actually

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:03.580 align:middle line:84%
get a photo from her wedding,
back when it happened?

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:05.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that would
involve, I guess,

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.400 align:middle line:90%
time travel or something?

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:10.510 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: OK, I'm
basically a physicist.

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:19.120 align:middle line:84%
If anything exists, somewhere,
there are some amount--

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:23.680 align:middle line:84%
today, we use the
stem cell analysis.

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.720 align:middle line:90%
We use DNA analysis now.

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's perfectly
usable in court.

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:33.250 align:middle line:10%
It's because there exists a
pattern, or something that

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:35.560 align:middle line:10%
contains information,
from which you

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:38.030 align:middle line:10%
can extract that information.

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:42.250 align:middle line:10%
And it's so good that it can
be used as evidence in court.

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:43.900 align:middle line:90%
There are many ways to do that.

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:45.970 align:middle line:10%
There is the standard
scientific method,

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:51.550 align:middle line:10%
using spectrum analyzers,
and using microscopes,

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:55.510 align:middle line:10%
and using chemical
stains and staining,

00:32:55.510 --> 00:33:01.330 align:middle line:10%
electrophoresis, which is a
chemical electronic process,

00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:03.220 align:middle line:10%
very accurate.

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:07.210 align:middle line:10%
But there are other things
that exist in nature

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:09.430 align:middle line:10%
that we haven't
really studied yet,

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:12.340 align:middle line:10%
but have been used off
and on through centuries

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:13.510 align:middle line:10%
and centuries.

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:18.100 align:middle line:84%
And there are other ways of
extracting this information.

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:20.440 align:middle line:90%
An example is dowsing.

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:25.630 align:middle line:10%
There are dowsers that are used,
consistently hired, full-time,

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:30.310 align:middle line:10%
paid salaries by the year,
that are used by auto companies

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:32.830 align:middle line:10%
to determine the color
that their cars should

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:33.910 align:middle line:10%
be to get more sales.

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:36.130 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: [LAUGHS]

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:38.030 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: And they work.

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:42.380 align:middle line:84%
There are people that dowse
for police departments, that

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:45.780 align:middle line:84%
dowse where a kidnapped
person is being held.

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:51.130 align:middle line:84%
There as a way of determining
what the accuracy for random,

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:53.970 align:middle line:84%
you know, just random
selection should be.

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And these people
are always many,

00:33:56.690 --> 00:34:01.820 align:middle line:84%
many times more than that
random selection, the good ones,

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:04.960 align:middle line:84%
the ones that are vetted
out by actually coming up

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.260 align:middle line:90%
with evidence.

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:07.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So if this
technology could

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:12.159 align:middle line:84%
be removed from
suppression, then we

00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:15.870 align:middle line:84%
have a truly marvelous
diagnostic tool.

00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:18.670 align:middle line:84%
I've studied this
myself extensively.

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:20.650 align:middle line:90%
It is an amazing science.

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that by educating
us and bringing out an expert

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:28.420 align:middle line:84%
like Dr. Peterson that we can
help to ease that suppression

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:30.520 align:middle line:84%
and bring this technology
out to a world that

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:33.429 align:middle line:90%
needs this type of ability.

00:34:33.429 --> 00:34:35.409 align:middle line:84%
And we are actually
still just getting

00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:37.389 align:middle line:84%
started with some of
the amazing discoveries

00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:40.489 align:middle line:84%
that Dr. Peterson made
based on this technology.

00:34:40.489 --> 00:34:42.250 align:middle line:84%
But that's coming up
in another episode.

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:45.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, David Wilcock,
here with Dr. Pete Peterson.

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:46.870 align:middle line:90%
And we thank you for watching.
