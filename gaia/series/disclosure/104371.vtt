00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.270 align:middle line:84%
Hello, and welcome
to "Disclosure."

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, David Wilcock.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.170 align:middle line:10%
And in this episode, I
do a lot of the talking,

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.930 align:middle line:10%
and I'm having a very
interesting conversation

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.480 align:middle line:10%
with Dean Garner, a man who
has a background working

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.230 align:middle line:10%
in special operations
for the Army Rangers,

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.610 align:middle line:10%
in an elite task force
similar to the Navy SEALs,

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.620 align:middle line:10%
doing all sorts of
classified things.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And he doesn't want to talk
about that stuff on camera,

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.000 align:middle line:84%
but believe me, he's
got the background.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.700 align:middle line:10%
And what he has done
is taken his knowledge

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.630 align:middle line:10%
and made himself
into a ghost writer

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.790 align:middle line:10%
for very high-level New York
Times best selling authors.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.540 align:middle line:84%
So there's lots of things
where they don't really

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.700 align:middle line:84%
know how spy
operations would work,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.040 align:middle line:90%
and he's given them a device.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.200 align:middle line:84%
This included doing an
unsolicited-- he just offered

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.580 align:middle line:84%
it to Dan Brown-- an
editing of the original Da

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.660 align:middle line:90%
Vinci Code manuscript.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.160 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't hired to do it.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.850 align:middle line:84%
He just did on his
own, sent it in,

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.440 align:middle line:84%
and Dan Brown may
or may not have

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.640 align:middle line:90%
used some of that information.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.180 align:middle line:84%
We don't really know,
or Dean won't say.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.600 align:middle line:90%
Let's put it that way.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, I wanted to get into some
of the real interesting stuff

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.900 align:middle line:84%
that links all of
this stuff together,

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.320 align:middle line:84%
and that's what this
episode is about.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.790 align:middle line:84%
So you'll see me kind of take
the helm for a while here,

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.800 align:middle line:90%
and Dean wanted that.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.580 align:middle line:84%
We'd had some fascinating
conversation off camera,

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.890 align:middle line:90%
and we looked at each other.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And we said, man we really got
to capture this for the camera,

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.620 align:middle line:84%
and I said, better yet,
let's save it for the camera.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.180 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't tell him
all of the things

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.400 align:middle line:84%
that I knew, but in my mind,
I'm constructing an arc for you

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.510 align:middle line:84%
so that we see how this
whole show links together.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.700 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, you probably
wouldn't be here

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.290 align:middle line:84%
if you didn't see
that I have put

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.520 align:middle line:84%
together an incredible
amount of information.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.740 align:middle line:84%
I seem to have my fingers
in so many different things

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.510 align:middle line:84%
that are interesting and cool
that all need to be disclosed.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.760 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm trying to do
here is create a bridge

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.639 align:middle line:84%
between ancient Atlantis
and civilizations

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.840 align:middle line:84%
like that, the idea of
giants and the skulls

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.920 align:middle line:84%
and the skeletons
that have been found,

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.670 align:middle line:84%
and then linking
it right straight

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.700 align:middle line:90%
up through to the Kabal.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.970 align:middle line:84%
So this is a fascinating
whirlwind of information.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.020 align:middle line:90%
Strap in.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.120 align:middle line:84%
Buckle your seat
belt. The coaster

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.550 align:middle line:84%
is ratcheting up that hill,
and it's about to start going.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.660 align:middle line:90%
So let's check it out.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.250 align:middle line:84%
I want to open up this
discussion first of all

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.220 align:middle line:84%
by asking you nobody
gets into this stuff,

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.691 align:middle line:84%
because they're happy
about life on Earth.

00:02:39.691 --> 00:02:40.390 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.110 align:middle line:84%
There's a dagger in your
heart that happened somewhere.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.590 align:middle line:84%
What was the
dagger in your heart

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.940 align:middle line:84%
that made you see
that the world might

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.050 align:middle line:90%
not be all wine and roses?

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.260 align:middle line:10%
When I was seven, I
was in third grade.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.000 align:middle line:10%
I was at Mount
Sacred Heart Military

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.470 align:middle line:10%
Academy in San Antonio, Texas.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.450 align:middle line:10%
I was living with my mother.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.540 align:middle line:10%
So that's Catholic?

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.260 align:middle line:84%
-Yes, and I was Jesuit.
-Here we go.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.090 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it was a Jesuit.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.370 align:middle line:84%
I witnessed a certain
scene which I won't go

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.180 align:middle line:84%
into, because it was so horrific
involving a Jesuit priest.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.730 align:middle line:84%
-A certain scene?
-A scene.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:14.760 align:middle line:90%
A horrific scene.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.880 align:middle line:90%
An event, an event I saw.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.580 align:middle line:90%
I was an eyewitness to that.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.540 align:middle line:90%
Involving violence?

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.101 align:middle line:84%
-I wouldn't say it.
-OK.

00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:22.800 align:middle line:90%
I'd rather not--

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.650 align:middle line:84%
But something that really,
really disturbed you greatly.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.120 align:middle line:84%
It stuck in my mind,
and then I wondered.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And I questioned,
because I remember

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.110 align:middle line:90%
talking with my mom about this.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.540 align:middle line:84%
Because my mom would have
me do these the prayers

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.661 align:middle line:84%
both in Spanish and
in English at night.

00:03:36.661 --> 00:03:37.360 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.810 align:middle line:84%
So you were in a
seminary school?

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:39.580 align:middle line:90%
Like a Catholic--

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.810 align:middle line:84%
-No, it was a military school.
-A military school.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Yes, so it was a
military school for boys.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And my father was an air force
fighter pilot at the time,

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.550 align:middle line:84%
and he was in Vietnam in--
[HISSES]

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:50.450 align:middle line:90%
 --at that time.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.320 align:middle line:84%
But this, whatever
you witnessed,

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.950 align:middle line:84%
clearly it was illegal--
-Yes, it was.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.050 align:middle line:90%
 --in the eyes of the law?

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.010 align:middle line:90%
Oh, absolutely.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of any
Godly understanding,

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.120 align:middle line:84%
this is way outside
what would be considered

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.570 align:middle line:90%
acceptable behavior I assume?

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's acceptable
behavior for the Jesuits.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.861 align:middle line:84%
Not in the eyes of the
average person, maybe?

00:04:10.861 --> 00:04:11.560 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.790 align:middle line:84%
Of course, no, I'm just
saying for the Jesuits,

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.410 align:middle line:84%
for everything that I know about
them, that's perfectly accept--

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.630 align:middle line:84%
what I witnessed was not
only acceptable behavior,

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:20.464 align:middle line:90%
it was encouraged.

00:04:20.464 --> 00:04:22.771 align:middle line:84%
And it was even
ordered sometimes.

00:04:22.771 --> 00:04:26.210 align:middle line:84%
-Good Lord.
-Absolutely, no pun intended.

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.729 align:middle line:84%
So were you able to remain
conscious as you saw this?

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.720 align:middle line:84%
-I that I--
-Did you start to black out?

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.250 align:middle line:84%
No, I think that I repressed
a lot of those memories,

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.795 align:middle line:90%
that action, that very action.

00:04:37.795 --> 00:04:39.960 align:middle line:84%
You must've been
absolutely terrified.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.820 align:middle line:90%
Did he see you?

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:42.620 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.410 align:middle line:84%
Good, well because you probably
wouldn't have made it, right?

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.430 align:middle line:84%
They beat the heck out of
me several different times,

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.270 align:middle line:84%
the sisters there, the
Jesuit sisters, the nuns

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.890 align:middle line:90%
with rulers and things.

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, let me answer your
question a little more fully.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.110 align:middle line:84%
When I told my mom,
I asked my mom,

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing these
prayers all the time.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, why-- this is
long after the fact,

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:09.960 align:middle line:84%
this is with
hindsight, of course.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how exactly
I couched it to her.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.760 align:middle line:84%
I said, if it's so good,
this religion, then why does

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:16.970 align:middle line:90%
it have to be beaten into me?

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.060 align:middle line:90%
Why am I being hurt like this?

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And why are you hitting me and
then telling me you love me?

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:26.850 align:middle line:90%
And this was all in--

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.240 align:middle line:90%
Your mom was beating you?

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.290 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, all in the
name of religion.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And so that, I think,
was the genesis.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.130 align:middle line:84%
Because before the age
of about eight, nine,

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.900 align:middle line:90%
I was a really happy kid.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's not to say
that I became unhappy,

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.720 align:middle line:84%
I just started asking lots
of very hard questions.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.560 align:middle line:84%
A lady I know who still goes
to Burning Man at her age

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.770 align:middle line:84%
and has been through a
lot of trauma in her life,

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.970 align:middle line:84%
her mother was
violently abusing her.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And she would say things
while she was doing it like,

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.070 align:middle line:90%
"Spare the rod!"

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.770 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:01.470 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.835 align:middle line:84%
So it was a
Christian-based abuse.

00:06:03.835 --> 00:06:05.740 align:middle line:90%
It was ceremonial.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.485 align:middle line:84%
Wow, and this is
what's happening to you.

00:06:07.485 --> 00:06:08.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, well, it did then.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.770 align:middle line:90%
For how long?

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.520 align:middle line:84%
For about three
years, because--

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.650 align:middle line:90%
Starting at what age?

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.210 align:middle line:84%
About seven, eight
years old, seven.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.600 align:middle line:90%
So you can't defend yourself.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're depending on
your mother for food and for--

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.160 align:middle line:90%
And love.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.604 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so that's
a total betrayal.

00:06:22.604 --> 00:06:23.370 align:middle line:90%
Here's the worst part.

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.650 align:middle line:84%
My father was in Vietnam at that
time flying missions in the F4.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.460 align:middle line:84%
He flew as an air
force fighter pilot.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.370 align:middle line:84%
My sister-- talk about a broken
family-- my sister was living

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.750 align:middle line:90%
in Florida with grandparents.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:34.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm still not--

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:35.690 align:middle line:90%
How old was your sister?

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.240 align:middle line:84%
She was about two years
younger at the time.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.390 align:middle line:90%
So she was like five or so.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.731 align:middle line:84%
She was living in another
state with your grandparents?

00:06:40.731 --> 00:06:41.800 align:middle line:84%
-Exactly.
-Why?

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I don't know.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.480 align:middle line:90%
But I can tell you this.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.300 align:middle line:84%
The results show
strongly that it was just

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.930 align:middle line:90%
such a dysfunctional family.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:48.990 align:middle line:90%
No one wanted to be together.

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:50.800 align:middle line:84%
It was like a bunch
of negative charges

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:51.690 align:middle line:90%
that repelled each other.

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.610 align:middle line:84%
Was your father
stationed in Florida?

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.280 align:middle line:84%
Was she closer to
your dad or something?

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:56.979 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:06:56.979 --> 00:06:59.690 align:middle line:84%
No, my father was in Vietnam at
the time stationed in Thailand.

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and so my mom and I
were in San Antonio, Texas,

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.080 align:middle line:84%
because she had two
aunts and another son

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.660 align:middle line:90%
from another father.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:07.360 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wow.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.365 align:middle line:90%
And so that was her support--

00:07:09.365 --> 00:07:12.810 align:middle line:84%
So her flesh and blood
daughter, she just said momma,

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.200 align:middle line:90%
dada, take the baby away.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.537 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to raise this kid.

00:07:16.537 --> 00:07:17.770 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, well, she
did the same thing

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.710 align:middle line:90%
to my brother, my half-brother.

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:21.060 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:21.820 align:middle line:90%
She left him.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.710 align:middle line:84%
She left my half-brother
with the two aunts and just

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:27.770 align:middle line:90%
a really strange upbringing.

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:30.300 align:middle line:84%
But it was good for
me, because the lessons

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:35.520 align:middle line:84%
learned are absolutely
incalculable and unaccountable.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.200 align:middle line:84%
So you told her that you see
this very dark horrific thing.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.160 align:middle line:84%
-To the effect, yes.
-More or less.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.880 align:middle line:90%
And what's her response?

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember.
I can't remember.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.840 align:middle line:84%
I repressed so many things.
-But she kind of--

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.770 align:middle line:90%
The beatings continued.

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:53.600 align:middle line:84%
The beating shall continue
until morale improves.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.099 align:middle line:84%
-She said that?
-No.

00:07:55.099 --> 00:07:57.180 align:middle line:84%
It's just taken from a
bumper sticker, I think.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.010 align:middle line:90%
But it seems that way.

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:00.300 align:middle line:90%
That was her MO.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, until I'd-- who knows?

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.210 align:middle line:90%
I just don't know.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:08.280 align:middle line:84%
But it left an indelible
imprint in my little mind.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.240 align:middle line:84%
We'll let's just
be honest, right?

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.620 align:middle line:84%
If, first of all, if
you've seen that--

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:17.180 align:middle line:84%
in the guise of religion--
and then your own mother

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:20.690 align:middle line:84%
is doing this to
you, you can't look

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:25.730 align:middle line:84%
at television commercials,
political campaigns,

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:28.460 align:middle line:84%
any of this, the
movies that we see.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Everything is going to be
redefined for you in a way

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:34.980 align:middle line:84%
that, for a lot of people
now, that kind of dagger

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:36.549 align:middle line:84%
in the heart is only
happening recently

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:39.159 align:middle line:84%
with things like the NSA
and the Snowden documents.

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:41.039 align:middle line:90%
But you got a head start.

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:42.299 align:middle line:90%
Oh, absolutely.

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:44.059 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, let me go back to
your original question.

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:45.170 align:middle line:90%
Let me address that further.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:46.960 align:middle line:90%
How did I really get started.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.580 align:middle line:84%
The genesis was at
about seven years

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.620 align:middle line:84%
old when I saw that
horrific incident.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:51.900 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that
guy was a Jesuit.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:55.770 align:middle line:90%
I know in with hindsight.

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:58.160 align:middle line:84%
So I just took the
information, and I probably

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.690 align:middle line:84%
put it in my subconscious,
my inner child,

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:01.700 align:middle line:90%
and just kept it there.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.660 align:middle line:84%
But It wasn't until I was
in college at American

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.350 align:middle line:90%
University in Washington DC.

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:08.670 align:middle line:84%
It was around 1981, and I use
to go to these embassy parties.

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:10.440 align:middle line:84%
I had the time on my life,
because my parents were--

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.320 align:middle line:90%
American embassy?

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.700 align:middle line:84%
No, various foreign embassy
parties in Washington DC.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:19.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, I was a student for a
few years where I graduated

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.960 align:middle line:84%
at American University
in DC and took

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.560 align:middle line:90%
a couple classes at Georgetown.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And no, they weren't
from Jesuit priests.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.820 align:middle line:84%
I took electrophysiology
laboratory from a great--

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.140 align:middle line:84%
You probably wanted to stay the
heck away from Jesuits after--

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.220 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know that
they were part of Georgetown

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:37.840 align:middle line:90%
University at that time.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.720 align:middle line:84%
So I went to one of
these embassy parties,

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.300 align:middle line:84%
and at this guy comes
running up to me.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.260 align:middle line:90%
So he grabs me.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.170 align:middle line:84%
He accosts me, and he says,
"he'll be the death of us all."

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:46.000 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "Who?"

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.320 align:middle line:90%
And he said, "Brzezinski."

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.620 align:middle line:10%
And so that is when I started
studying Zbigniew Brzezinski,

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:53.060 align:middle line:10%
reading everything about him.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:55.440 align:middle line:10%
And then, of course, that
led to the Rothschild family

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.950 align:middle line:10%
and to many secret societies.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:09:59.650 align:middle line:90%
And so I just--

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:00.450 align:middle line:90%
What were you reading?

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:03.510 align:middle line:84%
Everything I could
get I get my hands on.

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:05.720 align:middle line:90%
Everything and everything.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.030 align:middle line:84%
How many books do you
think you read on this?

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:10.960 align:middle line:90%
1,000 easily, easily.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.160 align:middle line:84%
Of course, some of them are not
physical books, because they're

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.470 align:middle line:90%
not available anymore.

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:19.220 align:middle line:84%
I've had some wonderful people
just send me the PDF files

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.460 align:middle line:84%
that they scan,
because they're not

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.827 align:middle line:90%
about to part with those books.

00:10:21.827 --> 00:10:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Because the curious
thing-- just to get off

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.390 align:middle line:84%
on a tangent for a
minute-- back around 1880

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:29.530 align:middle line:84%
when the Jesuits had directed
the house of Rothschild to buy,

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:31.440 align:middle line:84%
I think it was,
Associated Press.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.010 align:middle line:90%
Or they bought Reuters.

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And they started consolidating
all the big publishing

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.180 align:middle line:90%
companies into just a few.

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:39.160 align:middle line:84%
So that's when they started
controlling big media

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.221 align:middle line:84%
and establishing big
media as a controlling--

00:10:42.221 --> 00:10:44.040 align:middle line:84%
-1880s?
-In the 1880s.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.251 align:middle line:84%
You said the Jesuits instructed
the Rothschilds to buy Reuters.

00:10:47.251 --> 00:10:48.650 align:middle line:84%
Exactly.
Yeah, so they--

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:50.200 align:middle line:84%
Which I guess they
have so much money

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.270 align:middle line:90%
they easily could do that.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.310 align:middle line:90%
Oh, sure.

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.455 align:middle line:84%
I saw an article
recently about how

00:10:55.455 --> 00:10:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Evelyn de Rothschild may have--
he's probably a trillionaire.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.900 align:middle line:84%
He's a quadrillionaire.
-I know that, yeah.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:00.760 align:middle line:90%
And so are the Jesuits.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.860 align:middle line:84%
So you said that
the Jesuits bought

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:07.830 align:middle line:84%
Reuters through the
Rothschilds in 1880

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:09.060 align:middle line:90%
to consolidate the media.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:10.820 align:middle line:84%
So this whole thing
that we see now that's

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.500 align:middle line:84%
been well documented
that I talked about

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.600 align:middle line:84%
in previous episodes,
like Ben Bagdikian who's

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.640 align:middle line:84%
talked about that
there's basically

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:22.330 align:middle line:84%
five multinational corporations
controlling the whole media.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:25.730 align:middle line:84%
Some people think, "oh, well
that's Operation Mockingbird.

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:29.340 align:middle line:84%
The CIA started to do that
in the 1940s and 1950s."

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:32.870 align:middle line:84%
You're saying no, this goes
all the way back to 1880.

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, how did you find out
that the Jesuits set this up?

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:37.910 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't that be
highly sensitive

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:39.100 align:middle line:90%
classified information?

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:40.010 align:middle line:90%
Not necessarily.

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:44.355 align:middle line:84%
Again, it goes back to studying
circumstantial evidence.

00:11:44.355 --> 00:11:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And so I was just doing a lot
of reading, and connecting

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.670 align:middle line:84%
those dots of
circumstantial evidence,

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:53.650 align:middle line:84%
and looking at the number of
publishing companies in America

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:55.740 align:middle line:90%
before the 1880s.

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:56.880 align:middle line:90%
There were hundreds.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.810 align:middle line:90%
Who knows, maybe a few thousand.

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And then curiously, after
1880, around 1885 or so,

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:05.820 align:middle line:84%
or toward the end of the
1880s, most of those are gone.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And then at the same time, the
Rothschilds buying up Reuters

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.650 align:middle line:84%
and they start consolidating
or buying up news agencies

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:15.940 align:middle line:84%
and newspapers, especially
newspapers, broadsheets,

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:19.300 align:middle line:90%
magazines to control them.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:20.820 align:middle line:10%
Well let me just
add something here

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:24.630 align:middle line:10%
which is one of the things
that really opened my eyes was

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:26.830 align:middle line:10%
a book called The Character
Claims and Practical

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:30.396 align:middle line:10%
Workings of Freemasonry by
Reverend C.G. Finney written

00:12:30.396 --> 00:12:31.610 align:middle line:10%
in the late 1800s.

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:34.740 align:middle line:10%
And he's quoting from
earlier documents,

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:38.860 align:middle line:10%
including the classic by David
Bernard called Light on Masonry

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:44.390 align:middle line:10%
that actually publishes all the
rights of the first 32 degrees.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't give me a 33,
maybe just a little bit.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.740 align:middle line:84%
You get up to like,
29th degree, and they

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:53.650 align:middle line:84%
say, "We want to crush the head
of the serpent of religion."

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And these same sources
that came forward

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:00.900 align:middle line:84%
in anti-Masonic
hearings in New York

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:03.250 align:middle line:84%
state-- they
actually had hearings

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:04.720 align:middle line:90%
at the state government level.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.050 align:middle line:84%
There was a whole
anti-Masonic party

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:08.450 align:middle line:84%
that was formed in
America that became

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:10.190 align:middle line:90%
known as the "Whig Party."

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And multiple whistle
blowers came forward

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:19.460 align:middle line:84%
and said that the masons openly
boasted in the early 1800s

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.870 align:middle line:84%
about having control
of the police,

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:25.440 align:middle line:84%
the media, the judiciary, the
military, and the government.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.360 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And people have a hard
time believing this,

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:31.920 align:middle line:84%
because they say,
"Well, we vote.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.850 align:middle line:90%
We have a democratic election."

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:35.915 align:middle line:84%
We have to remember too
like in the early 1800s,

00:13:35.915 --> 00:13:38.200 align:middle line:84%
there were a lot of
ignorant people out there.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.420 align:middle line:90%
Most Americans didn't even read.

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:42.770 align:middle line:90%
Wow, that's true, yeah.

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:45.050 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have an education.

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And there was no American
education system except maybe

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:51.980 align:middle line:84%
at Harvard, and Yale, and some
of the original four Ivy League

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:53.110 align:middle line:90%
colleges.

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:56.551 align:middle line:84%
And those were for the
elite, the so-called "elite,"

00:13:56.551 --> 00:13:57.250 align:middle line:90%
the point.

00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:02.240 align:middle line:84%
0.0001%'s Yeah, so Americans
where an ignorant lot,

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.630 align:middle line:84%
and they were designed
to be that way.

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:07.030 align:middle line:84%
You're saying that
you actually found data

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:10.760 align:middle line:84%
that the Jesuits had the
Rothschilds by Reuters

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:12.020 align:middle line:90%
and consolidate the media?

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
talked about it openly,

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.120 align:middle line:84%
and you were able to find
this in documentation?

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.100 align:middle line:84%
Using various forms of
circumstantial evidence,

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:22.617 align:middle line:84%
I developed the
hypothesis of that, yes.

00:14:22.617 --> 00:14:23.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I'm not going to call it--

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:26.070 align:middle line:84%
Because you said that there
were many like-- obviously,

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:28.230 align:middle line:84%
Gutenberg invents
the printing press.

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And you get this
crazy, wonderful binge

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.750 align:middle line:84%
of people that now can take
words and put them into things

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:38.480 align:middle line:84%
they can hand out to people.
-Exactly.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.990 align:middle line:84%
That's what we
had-- I'm sure there

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:42.830 align:middle line:84%
were thousands of
American publishers

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:44.940 align:middle line:90%
at the time before the 1880s.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.361 align:middle line:84%
So it would be like
the way blogging is now.

00:14:47.361 --> 00:14:48.820 align:middle line:84%
-Exactly.
-You get the internet.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:49.760 align:middle line:90%
You can make a book.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.190 align:middle line:90%
You can print a book.

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Everybody wants to do it.
-Exactly.

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:55.020 align:middle line:84%
But here's my point
about that David.

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Those folks were writing openly
about the malevolent behavior

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:01.460 align:middle line:84%
of the Society of
Jesus, the Jesuits.

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
those books come from.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.420 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
facts-- and I wouldn't

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:10.370 align:middle line:84%
simply take information from one
book and call it absolute fact.

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:12.590 align:middle line:84%
I try to be very careful
as a former scientist--

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.050 align:middle line:84%
well, once a scientist,
always a scientist I suppose--

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:17.060 align:middle line:84%
try to be very, very
careful in my approach.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:18.990 align:middle line:84%
I still use the
scientific method,

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:21.900 align:middle line:90%
and I use I use my own logic.

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.710 align:middle line:84%
But I have to be able to
corroborate information

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:26.310 align:middle line:90%
over different sources.

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:29.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't simply want to
take one thing on faith

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:30.840 align:middle line:84%
and say that, that's
absolute fact.

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And I can confirm from
reading New World Order:

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:37.260 align:middle line:84%
The Ancient Plane of Secret
Societies by William T.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.050 align:middle line:84%
Still-- a really
amazing classic--

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:43.570 align:middle line:84%
that there are many, many
books like you described.

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:44.770 align:middle line:10%
Yes, suppressed.

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:46.030 align:middle line:10%
People all the
way up to the level

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:48.910 align:middle line:10%
of Thomas Jefferson
and Abraham Lincoln

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:50.640 align:middle line:10%
openly talking about this stuff.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:51.340 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:53.660 align:middle line:84%
Abraham Lincoln talked
about the Jesuits.

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.630 align:middle line:84%
He said, and I
quote, "The Jesuits

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:58.070 align:middle line:90%
have not yet killed me."

00:15:58.070 --> 00:15:59.950 align:middle line:90%
And that was in Baltimore.

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:02.390 align:middle line:84%
The Jesuits tried to
kill him in Baltimore,

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:05.170 align:middle line:84%
and it's a whole
beautiful conspiracy.

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:07.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be publishing
through my publishing company,

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:13.000 align:middle line:84%
Adagio Press, the
suppressed information

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.860 align:middle line:84%
about the assassination
of Abraham Lincoln.

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And Lincoln knew all
about the Jesuits.

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:22.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, and I've encountered
both from insiders

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:29.400 align:middle line:84%
and from documentation that the
Civil War was an effort to-- it

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:33.830 align:middle line:84%
was actually a war between
factions of the Illuminati

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:36.030 align:middle line:84%
for lack of a better term.
And that--

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:38.030 align:middle line:84%
I want to be careful
about that, respectfully.

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Because people ask me, "OK,
who were the Freemasons?

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:42.930 align:middle line:90%
Who are the Illuminati?

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:44.470 align:middle line:84%
What are these
secret societies?"

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:48.100 align:middle line:84%
The fact is, there are thousands
of secret societies out there.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:52.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not an expert in
secret societies, per se.

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:55.360 align:middle line:84%
I have some anecdotal
information about when they

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.490 align:middle line:84%
were started and who
did it, but the Jesuits,

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:05.230 align:middle line:84%
since around the year 1540,
have been actively controlling--

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:10.190 align:middle line:84%
at least the human element--
actively controlling the world.

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:11.319 align:middle line:90%
Since 1540?

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:12.410 align:middle line:90%
About 1540.

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, they took
the reins from somebody else.

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Who took the reins from
the Knights Templar

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:20.190 align:middle line:84%
and who took the reins
from the Egyptians.

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:23.599 align:middle line:84%
Exactly who they were, I'm
not sure-- the brotherhood,

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:25.819 align:middle line:90%
some brotherhood or nobility.

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:29.900 align:middle line:84%
So let's sketch that
out a little bit.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And you and I have talked about
this off camera to some degree.

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:36.920 align:middle line:84%
But if we go back
through the history,

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:40.110 align:middle line:84%
it appears first of all
you have Babylon and Sumer.

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:43.060 align:middle line:84%
You have a Babylonian
dictatorship.

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:45.070 align:middle line:84%
You have the Code of
Hammurabi-- an eye for an eye,

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:46.710 align:middle line:90%
tooth for a tooth.

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:52.090 align:middle line:84%
You have some pretty dark and
crazy stuff going back then

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:55.870 align:middle line:84%
and the concept of the
pyramid, the ziggurat.

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:57.620 align:middle line:90%
Then we go to Egypt.

00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:00.730 align:middle line:84%
We have Pharonic
dynasties, and we

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:03.560 align:middle line:90%
have the Library of Alexandria.

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.440 align:middle line:90%
Which appears--

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.600 align:middle line:90%
First false flag attack.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.430 align:middle line:84%
Right, that the
Library of Alexandria

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:11.650 align:middle line:90%
was apparently burned down.

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:14.820 align:middle line:84%
But I've had now three
different insiders tell me

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:17.740 align:middle line:84%
that all the good stuff
was taken out first,

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:20.290 align:middle line:84%
and what they left behind was
things like the tax documents

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:21.470 align:middle line:90%
that they wanted to lose anyway.

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:22.420 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And then they move all the
good stuff to the Vatican.

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:33.510 align:middle line:84%
So the Romans invaded Egypt
when Egypt had become weak

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:37.400 align:middle line:84%
and had all this great
ancient technology and books--

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.610 align:middle line:84%
technology that we still
don't know about, possibly

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:42.840 align:middle line:84%
including the Ark of the
Covenant, the super weapon,

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.800 align:middle line:90%
made by Moses.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.360 align:middle line:90%
They invade.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.480 align:middle line:84%
They bring that
stuff to the Vatican.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And then another
interesting thing

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:53.370 align:middle line:84%
is that Rome was around
the Mediterranean Sea,

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:56.600 align:middle line:84%
and they needed a great staging
area, a base of operations,

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.290 align:middle line:90%
to be able to conquer Europe.

00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:00.870 align:middle line:84%
What's the only really
good island completely

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:02.690 align:middle line:90%
surrounded by water in Europe?

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:04.220 align:middle line:90%
It's Great Britain.

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:05.920 align:middle line:90%
It's this nice little spot.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:09.420 align:middle line:84%
So starting around 100 AD,
they started to move in there,

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:12.030 align:middle line:90%
took about 100 to 150 years.

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:14.434 align:middle line:84%
And you can still
see the Roman baths.

00:19:14.434 --> 00:19:16.400 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when I went to meet
Graham Hancock the first time,

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.600 align:middle line:90%
it's in Bath, England.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.690 align:middle line:84%
They have the original
Roman bath there.

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:20.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, isn't that fascinating?

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And nobody talks about this,
that there's this relationship

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.950 align:middle line:84%
between Great Britain,
the city of London,

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:30.290 align:middle line:84%
all these bankers, the
Rothschilds, and the Vatican.

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:34.700 align:middle line:84%
Because all that happened is
they transplanted up here.

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:38.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, to move forward, you
when I spoke about, obviously,

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:41.170 align:middle line:90%
the knight Templars-- big story.

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:43.270 align:middle line:84%
So tell us what you
know about the Templars.

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:46.030 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely zero.

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:48.320 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know what
the Templars are anymore.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.560 align:middle line:84%
Like one of the guys who
found me out in cyberspace

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:55.245 align:middle line:84%
on LinkedIn-- he wanted
to be a connection,

00:19:55.245 --> 00:19:56.980 align:middle line:90%
wanted me to be a connection.

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:58.460 align:middle line:90%
And I looked on his profile.

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:00.740 align:middle line:84%
He said he was a
Knights Templar.

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:02.590 align:middle line:84%
So I said, "what's
up with that?"

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And I got some canned
response and, politely, I just

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:06.910 align:middle line:90%
let that go.

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:08.430 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know who
they are anymore.

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:10.650 align:middle line:84%
I know that they occurred
or maybe died out,

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:14.410 align:middle line:84%
so-called died out,
around 1200 or so, 1100.

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:17.460 align:middle line:84%
But my research, I
chose to stop at about

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:21.240 align:middle line:84%
the time of inception or
conception of the Jesuits

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.835 align:middle line:90%
around 1540 or so.

00:20:22.835 --> 00:20:29.410 align:middle line:10%
And, of course, we're really
talking about a continuous line

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:30.860 align:middle line:10%
of power.

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:34.780 align:middle line:84%
It started a couple
of-- even further

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:37.890 align:middle line:90%
back than 2000 years ago.

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:40.640 align:middle line:90%
It might be a different mask.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.760 align:middle line:84%
It might be a different
robe, a different sash.

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:48.800 align:middle line:84%
However, the actions,
behaviors, the machinations--

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.320 align:middle line:84%
they're all done according
to the same plan,

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:53.830 align:middle line:90%
by the same design.

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:56.590 align:middle line:90%
And it's all very continuous.

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, in some of my
talks I show Roman coins

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:01.660 align:middle line:84%
that have the eagles
head on one side

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.770 align:middle line:84%
and a pyramid on
the other side, just

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:04.870 align:middle line:84%
like the great
seal of the United

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:06.510 align:middle line:90%
States on the dollar bill.

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:10.300 align:middle line:84%
So what are these people
doing using Egyptian symbols?

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:13.801 align:middle line:84%
Why are there Sphinxes at the
Vatican and the hieroglyphics

00:21:13.801 --> 00:21:14.500 align:middle line:90%
at the Vatican?

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.180 align:middle line:84%
That answer, I'll
bet you, includes

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:19.220 align:middle line:90%
ET, the extraterrestrial.

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.900 align:middle line:90%
And there's the ET component.

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:24.310 align:middle line:90%
And I don't even touch that one.

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:25.010 align:middle line:90%
I have enough.

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:27.400 align:middle line:84%
I have my hands
full studying what

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.500 align:middle line:84%
I would term the
behavioral ecology

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.770 align:middle line:90%
of the Society of Jesus.

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:38.150 align:middle line:84%
So you've got an intense
dedicated research focus.

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:41.840 align:middle line:84%
My understanding is the
Templars were Jacques

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:43.530 align:middle line:90%
de Molay and all that stuff.

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:47.220 align:middle line:84%
The Friday the 13th
was, I believe, 1311.

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:48.940 align:middle line:84%
So there's like a
200 year gap where

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:50.600 align:middle line:90%
they kind of got scattered.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And see I'm not familiar
with that history.

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.720 align:middle line:84%
But then you're
saying that the next

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:58.701 align:middle line:84%
consolidation of this initiative
starts to show up around--

00:21:58.701 --> 00:21:59.400 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And that is where I
think the world was

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:07.520 align:middle line:90%
brought under super control.

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:11.520 align:middle line:84%
That's when the world really,
really came under the aegis,

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:15.740 align:middle line:84%
under the very hardcore control
of that one group, the Jesuits.

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:17.720 align:middle line:84%
OK, but let's talk
about that for minute.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of people
may not be aware

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:24.530 align:middle line:84%
that during the time of the
1500s that you described,

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:26.290 align:middle line:84%
most of Europe was
part of what they call

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:28.650 align:middle line:90%
the Holy Roman Empire, right?

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:34.990 align:middle line:84%
So the Romans were, essentially,
a de facto global government

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:36.210 align:middle line:90%
for Europe already.

00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:39.450 align:middle line:90%
All roads lead to Rome.

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and they have
for 2000 years.

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:43.940 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, go look up
Holy Roman Empire,

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:47.130 align:middle line:84%
and you find out that you could
call it Byzantine culture.

00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:48.910 align:middle line:84%
People have different
names for it.

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:53.250 align:middle line:84%
But in the 1400s, Columbus
starts doing his thing.

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And you start to have
this global navigation,

00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:59.090 align:middle line:84%
and the trade routes
start to develop.

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And very large profits start
to be made by the Dutch,

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:08.480 align:middle line:84%
by the Spanish, the Portuguese
through bringing in things

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.850 align:middle line:84%
that people never
had before-- spices

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:14.040 align:middle line:84%
that made their food taste
good, oriental rugs, china,

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.940 align:middle line:90%
all these types of things.

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:18.860 align:middle line:84%
So there's all this new
money being generated,

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:21.530 align:middle line:84%
and this time in
history is also fairly

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:24.130 align:middle line:84%
soon after the Renaissance
and the Reformation, right?

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:26.810 align:middle line:90%


00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:29.380 align:middle line:84%
So let's drop in on
this "Jesuit" thing.

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Why do you target that
particular time frame?

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:35.610 align:middle line:90%
I didn't.

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:38.490 align:middle line:84%
I went down different rabbit
holes, David, as we've

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:39.900 align:middle line:90%
talked about in the past.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:44.320 align:middle line:84%
I didn't search
out to bash anyone.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:49.040 align:middle line:84%
I didn't search out to find
a Jesuit, or a Catholic,

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:54.990 align:middle line:90%
or a Jewish controller at all.

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:59.580 align:middle line:84%
I just started with when I first
heard Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski's

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:02.520 align:middle line:84%
name and then going and
studying him, reading his books,

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.570 align:middle line:84%
and studying the
House of Rothschild,

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:09.470 align:middle line:84%
and I don't even recall which
rabbit hole took me down

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:11.180 align:middle line:90%
and said, "oh, guess what?

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:13.490 align:middle line:84%
This door, beyond that
door, is information

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:15.430 align:middle line:90%
about the Society of Jesus."

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:17.390 align:middle line:84%
All right, but what
are the Jesuits?

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:20.040 align:middle line:90%
Society of Jesus.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.530 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's really a
continuation of that power

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:23.700 align:middle line:90%
from 2000 years ago.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.290 align:middle line:84%
But it's associated
with the Vatican?

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:26.800 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the
Vatican or something?

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.900 align:middle line:84%
No, they control
the Vatican now.

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.760 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they infiltrated
the Vatican

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.850 align:middle line:84%
and they came under the
Vatican's good graces, the Pope

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:36.760 align:middle line:90%
in around 1540 or so.

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.370 align:middle line:84%
They infiltrated the
Vatican from where?

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:40.720 align:middle line:90%
From Spain?

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, Spain, Italy, yes--
probably all of Europe.

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Because there were several
initial founders who--

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:49.380 align:middle line:90%
Like the Medici family?

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:52.950 align:middle line:84%
They may have come
into it later on.

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:54.310 align:middle line:90%
That, I'm not sure.

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:55.790 align:middle line:84%
I want to state
very clearly that--

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:57.650 align:middle line:90%
Spanish and Italian nobility.

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:00.110 align:middle line:84%
But I want to state
this clearly that I don't

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:02.490 align:middle line:90%
know everything about this.

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:04.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if any lay
person or researcher,

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.850 align:middle line:84%
even a serious
researcher like me,

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:08.270 align:middle line:90%
could possibly know everything.

00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:10.570 align:middle line:84%
Because much of the
information, as I said before,

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:11.270 align:middle line:90%
had been repressed.

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:14.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've been privy to
some information, insider

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.570 align:middle line:84%
information, from people
who sent me PDF files,

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:20.220 align:middle line:84%
scans of some books
that were suppressed

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:21.540 align:middle line:90%
even a couple years ago.

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:23.280 align:middle line:90%
And I found a few others.

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:25.930 align:middle line:90%
I don't know a lot.

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And I have no
problem saying I have

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:31.660 align:middle line:84%
no compunction whatsoever when
I tell people that I don't know.

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:34.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't know even where
the information is.

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:36.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, wouldn't it be a great
cover if you have a group

00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:38.610 align:middle line:90%
that wants to do a lot of harm?

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:41.680 align:middle line:84%
To take an Orwellian name
like the Society of Jesus?

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Everybody says, "oh,
yeah that sounds good."

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:44.290 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's benevolent.

00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:44.990 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:47.490 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but they
are the opposite.

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:48.850 align:middle line:90%
They are malevolent.

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:50.400 align:middle line:90%
OK, but how do you prove that?

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what is some
tangible evidence?

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:53.750 align:middle line:90%
Look at their behaviors.

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:56.800 align:middle line:84%
Just read, say,
pick any 10 books

00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:01.700 align:middle line:84%
that were published say, after
1550 on the Jesuit behavior.

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, back then
we didn't have the internet.

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:06.250 align:middle line:84%
So it really took about
50 or so years for people

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:10.530 align:middle line:84%
to wake up around the world
and look at these behaviors.

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:13.360 align:middle line:84%
They can see the results
of the Jesuit's behaviors

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:17.380 align:middle line:84%
in China, in Japan,
in Europe, UK,

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:21.810 align:middle line:84%
in Africa, in the United
States after 1700s.

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:24.950 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, initially
in China and Japan,

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:26.680 align:middle line:90%
in parts of Asia.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Jesuits sent out missionaries
quote, "missionaries" end quote

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.686 align:middle line:84%
to every part of the world.
And then they--

00:26:35.686 --> 00:26:37.400 align:middle line:84%
But these were
the militarized--

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, the Jesuits
are a marshall organization.

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:45.390 align:middle line:84%
But they are set up like
the 82nd Airborne Division,

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:48.150 align:middle line:84%
or like the 75th
Ranger Regiment.

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:49.460 align:middle line:90%
They had a trained soldiers.

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.243 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't start
as part of the Vatican.

00:26:51.243 --> 00:26:52.642 align:middle line:84%
They just started--
-Absolutely not.

00:26:52.642 --> 00:26:53.341 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:26:53.341 --> 00:26:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And they came from royal
families you're saying.

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Yes, well, I think the
original four, five, six members

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:00.120 align:middle line:90%
come from royal bloodlines.

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And, to me, that's an
extraterrestrial line.

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:04.701 align:middle line:90%
OK, I agree with you.

00:27:04.701 --> 00:27:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
we're going to get

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.330 align:middle line:90%
a lot more into in later shows.

00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:13.575 align:middle line:84%
OK, so there's got to be a
lot of wealth behind them

00:27:13.575 --> 00:27:14.940 align:middle line:90%
if these royal families--

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:17.560 align:middle line:90%
It's more than you can imagine.

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.930 align:middle line:84%
Did the term "Jesuit"
show up in the 1500s?

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:21.720 align:middle line:84%
Is that the first
time anybody heard it?

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:25.360 align:middle line:84%
Someone actually ascribed
or prescribed the name

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.230 align:middle line:90%
"The Society of Jesus."

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:28.210 align:middle line:90%
I think someone else.

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:32.280 align:middle line:84%
It was one of their
followers or an academician.

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:35.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember, exactly,
where I saw that, historically.

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:37.590 align:middle line:84%
But someone said
we're going to call

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:38.920 align:middle line:84%
you-- I think they
were initially

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:40.797 align:middle line:84%
called the "Black Robes."
-The Black Robes.

00:27:40.797 --> 00:27:41.530 align:middle line:90%
Yes, the Black Robes.

00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:42.610 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't sound as good.

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:45.150 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not as cool.

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:48.030 align:middle line:84%
Just like all those
dudes who wrote

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:51.970 align:middle line:84%
all the Shakespeare histories,
tragedies, and plays.

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:55.650 align:middle line:84%
Someone with a very clever
advertising, marketing, and PR

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:59.050 align:middle line:90%
plan came up with these names.

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And Jesuits-- man
what a cool name.

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:02.950 align:middle line:84%
But let me finish
answering your question

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:06.616 align:middle line:84%
about the Jesuits in general.
They--

00:28:06.616 --> 00:28:08.140 align:middle line:90%
And then we'll have to wrap up.

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:09.880 align:middle line:84%
We'll come back to this
in this next episode.

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:11.400 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode,
I definitely

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:14.910 align:middle line:84%
want to get into more about what
did they do all over the world

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:16.920 align:middle line:84%
that these books revealed
over the course of 50 years?

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:18.700 align:middle line:84%
But first of all,
let's just finish

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:20.000 align:middle line:90%
setting up the Jesuits here.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.890 align:middle line:84%
Sure, the folks who had
witnessed the results

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:26.470 align:middle line:84%
of their behaviors,
their actions,

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:31.820 align:middle line:84%
their so-called "missions" all
over the world were kind enough

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:34.570 align:middle line:84%
and they felt the same kind
of duty and responsibility

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:37.210 align:middle line:84%
that I do that they
were obligated to share

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:38.810 align:middle line:90%
the information they had.

00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And so that's in
the form of a book.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Of course, back then there
were small printing presses,

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.570 align:middle line:84%
or there was writing
on parchment,

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:48.690 align:middle line:84%
or writing on animal
skin, something

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:51.310 align:middle line:84%
and then preserved,
and saved, and then

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:54.050 align:middle line:90%
passed down to posterity.

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And its by the good graces
of those brave people

00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:01.170 align:middle line:84%
that I have been able to
learn a lot about them

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:05.590 align:middle line:84%
in their early history, in
the 1500s, mid to late 1500s.

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And all those people,
without any exception,

00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:12.440 align:middle line:84%
wrote about their
malevolent behavior.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:15.150 align:middle line:90%
And they did it so explicitly.

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:16.990 align:middle line:84%
What's fascinating--
and I corroborated

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:19.780 align:middle line:84%
this in many in probably a
couple of hundred books--

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:23.350 align:middle line:84%
is that you see the same
pattern of destruction

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:24.820 align:middle line:90%
in every single country.

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:27.000 align:middle line:84%
It's like they have
to have one playbook,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.030 align:middle line:84%
and they just Xeroxed it and
gave it to their missionaries.

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And they go to China and
follow the playbook baby.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm really glad that we
got into this discussion

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.920 align:middle line:84%
about negative
entities and the idea

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:42.560 align:middle line:84%
that there could be beings
in the spiritual realms who

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:45.430 align:middle line:90%
live off of negative energy.

00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:48.030 align:middle line:84%
That is exactly what it says
in the Law of One series.

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe it's the only
thing that really makes sense.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Why have these beings held such
a grudge against Jesus Christ,

00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:57.340 align:middle line:90%
for example?

00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:01.250 align:middle line:10%
Why is there such
a violent hatred

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:04.890 align:middle line:10%
of Christianity so that
this group wants to pattern

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:08.010 align:middle line:10%
itself as Luciferian?

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:10.370 align:middle line:90%
Well, here's the deal.

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:13.630 align:middle line:84%
I think that what we're seeing
is a group that is actually

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:17.150 align:middle line:84%
being manipulated by
extraterrestrial beings

00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:22.110 align:middle line:84%
at some kind of a higher level
where, at their level, they are

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:24.970 align:middle line:84%
is dependent upon
energy as we are

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:28.350 align:middle line:84%
on water, and food,
and the basic money

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:30.000 align:middle line:90%
that we need to survive.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.480 align:middle line:84%
If they're not getting enough
fear, if they're not getting

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:33.820 align:middle line:84%
enough stress, if
they're not getting

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:35.830 align:middle line:84%
enough anger, and
sadness, and pain,

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:38.230 align:middle line:84%
and depression, and
low self-esteem,

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:40.690 align:middle line:90%
then they are not being paid.

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:43.070 align:middle line:84%
That is exactly the
model that the Law of One

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:46.070 align:middle line:84%
says explains the so-called
"negative elite" as it's

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:48.015 align:middle line:90%
called in that material.

00:30:48.015 --> 00:30:51.540 align:middle line:84%
That these entities,
ultimately, are controlling it,

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:54.580 align:middle line:84%
that even the Kabal people,
the Jesuits, the Illuminati,

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:57.800 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want to call them--
they're not running the show.

00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.060 align:middle line:90%
They are being abused.

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:02.060 align:middle line:84%
They are being run like
puppets and marionettes.

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:03.940 align:middle line:84%
So when we come back
in the next episode,

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:07.760 align:middle line:84%
we're going to get into some of
the interesting 1950s history

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.670 align:middle line:90%
that you may not be aware of.

00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:11.530 align:middle line:90%
That's coming up on Disclosure.

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Speaking truth to power, and
giving power to the truth.

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:18.940 align:middle line:90%

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:25.867 align:middle line:90%
