>>DAVID WILCOCK: All right.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.310 align:middle line:10%
Welcome back to our show.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.060 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, David
Wilcock, and I'm here

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.360 align:middle line:10%
with Pete Peterson, who has
done a truly incredible amount

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.360 align:middle line:10%
of things in
classified programs.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And in this episode, we're going
to get into some of the unusual

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.770 align:middle line:84%
laws of physics that are
laws-- and they do work--

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.720 align:middle line:84%
that allow for some truly
extraordinary human functions

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.412 align:middle line:90%
to be made possible.

00:00:44.412 --> 00:00:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And specifically,
we're going to be

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.120 align:middle line:84%
talking about
telekinesis, the ability

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.270 align:middle line:90%
to move objects with the mind.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.489 align:middle line:90%
It's a very exciting subject.

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And some of the things that
Pete has told me about this

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.970 align:middle line:84%
are unlike anything
I've ever heard before.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.395 align:middle line:90%
They're truly incredible.

00:00:58.395 --> 00:01:00.310 align:middle line:84%
So Pete, welcome
back to the show.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.660 align:middle line:90%
>>PETE PETERSON: Thank you.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So I remember, Pete,
reading some books years

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.360 align:middle line:84%
ago about a man called
Daniel Dunglas Home.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And it was spelled
H-O-M-E, his name.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And he lived near the Great
Lakes in New York state.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And they had-- this
is in the 1800s-- they

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.120 align:middle line:84%
had European dignitaries
coming over, seeing this guy.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.980 align:middle line:84%
He's able to put his hands into
flames, and he didn't burn.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.540 align:middle line:90%
He was able to levitate.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.480 align:middle line:84%
He could levitate out one
window and fly into another.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.500 align:middle line:84%
He could levitate an accordion
inside a cage and play it.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And all this stuff
was very heavily

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.750 align:middle line:90%
eyewitnessed at the time.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.630 align:middle line:84%
So we've heard all
stories like this.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.280 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there's stories of
Jesus and what he could do.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.240 align:middle line:84%
There's stories of Indian
yogis, Tibetan yogis, that

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.110 align:middle line:90%
can do really amazing things.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.500 align:middle line:84%
So I'm wondering what your
personal experience has

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.320 align:middle line:84%
been with telekinesis
and if there's ever

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.720 align:middle line:84%
been a scientific study
of it that was done.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.000 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: That all
sounds very, very exciting.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.220 align:middle line:84%
I have not heard of any of
that, and that's amazing.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.500 align:middle line:84%
Because I tried for a long
time to study everything

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.300 align:middle line:90%
in that area.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.870 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't heard of this fellow.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.750 align:middle line:84%
I heard a lot about Anton
Mesmer and mesmerizing.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.510 align:middle line:84%
But it had nothing
to do with hypnosis.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.150 align:middle line:84%
Because Mesmer would
hypnotize them at a distance,

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.370 align:middle line:90%
not eyeball to eyeball.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.550 align:middle line:84%
He'd be in a building six blocks
down the street and hypnotize

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.305 align:middle line:84%
someone and get them to do
all different kinds of things.

00:02:33.305 --> 00:02:35.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: He didn't need to
be there to get somebody

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.880 align:middle line:90%
in trance?

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.880 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: No, he
was not there at all.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.250 align:middle line:84%
You read about it, and it
was like a hypnotism show,

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.750 align:middle line:84%
except the fact that he was six
or 10 or 12 or 20 blocks away.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.490 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: What was he doing?

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.100 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: He would
take basic control

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.450 align:middle line:84%
of their conscious mind,
if you would, and then have

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.960 align:middle line:84%
them do things, or he would
tell them to do things.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And they could do
things that they

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.070 align:middle line:84%
couldn't do when they
were in their normal state

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.950 align:middle line:90%
of mental being.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Give me an example.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.670 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, he could have
them rest their heels on a--

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.940 align:middle line:84%
they'd take a pair of
chairs and put them

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.700 align:middle line:84%
five or six feet apart, and
have them put their heels

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.730 align:middle line:84%
on one chair and their
head on one chair,

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.490 align:middle line:84%
and lay just as
stiff as an iron rod.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.510 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: He could get them
to levitate a little bit.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.480 align:middle line:84%
He could get them to
levitate things a little bit.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.820 align:middle line:84%
He could get them to act out
various things, such as act out

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:40.825 align:middle line:90%
as if you're a--

00:03:40.825 --> 00:03:42.960 align:middle line:90%
if it's a woman, act like a man.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.560 align:middle line:90%
If it's man, act like a woman.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And he would have them do
things like drink a cup of tea.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, women have a way
that they drink tea,

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.940 align:middle line:84%
and men have a different
way that they drink tea.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And so they would take
on these other things,

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.245 align:middle line:84%
probably something they
had never practiced.

00:04:02.245 --> 00:04:03.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I'm still
kind of having

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.610 align:middle line:84%
trouble understanding how
Mesmer could make somebody

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.070 align:middle line:84%
do this stuff if
he's six blocks away.

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.895 align:middle line:84%
What was the technique
that he was using?

00:04:11.895 --> 00:04:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, we
call it, nowadays,

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.970 align:middle line:90%
things like remote influencing.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.350 align:middle line:90%
So it was very, very different.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.100 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't what we read about.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.620 align:middle line:84%
When you dig into the things
that were read about him there,

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.220 align:middle line:84%
locally, it was a
whole different story.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Because the people that
would come from New York

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.130 align:middle line:84%
to write up about it, or
from the United States--

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.960 align:middle line:84%
and there was a lot
of interest from Japan

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.500 align:middle line:84%
at the time because of
the ninja influence there,

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.360 align:middle line:84%
and the things that
they'd seen ninjas do.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.370 align:middle line:90%


00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.365 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of
interest in that area.

00:04:46.365 --> 00:04:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And they had a lot of
reporters from Tokyo that

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.180 align:middle line:90%
would come and write about it.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.010 align:middle line:84%
But then we couldn't
read Japanese,

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.810 align:middle line:84%
and they would get
the result of that.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.170 align:middle line:84%
I've gone back and looked at
some of the transliterations

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:06.830 align:middle line:84%
and translations of Japanese and
find that a lot more took place

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.780 align:middle line:84%
than I ever read about in
the English literature.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And then I spent some time
teaching my form of acupuncture

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.360 align:middle line:84%
and oriental medicine in
Paris at various places.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.070 align:middle line:84%
So I had access to a lot
more data from there.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And one of them was
a group called SMB.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And they were a
biotherapy group that

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:46.610 align:middle line:84%
studied the seemingly psychic
aspects of oriental medicine.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, just to get back
to the question for a second,

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.320 align:middle line:84%
could you explain to me what
at least one of the techniques

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.540 align:middle line:84%
was that he was using
to actually get people

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.670 align:middle line:90%
to do things six blocks away?

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm still having a hard
time understanding that.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.990 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, when
you get into what's

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:08.750 align:middle line:84%
called psychotronics,
which is indeed a science,

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.900 align:middle line:84%
you find out that in the
realm that that exists,

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.930 align:middle line:84%
there is no such
thing as distance.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.440 align:middle line:84%
Things happen everywhere
and everywhen.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But how do you get it
to work across that distance?

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.560 align:middle line:84%
If there is no distance,
what's the technique?

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.560 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: You
don't get it to work.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.540 align:middle line:90%
There is no technique.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.400 align:middle line:84%
It does work across
that distance.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What was
he actually doing?

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.149 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: So you just
practice the technique the way

00:06:29.149 --> 00:06:31.730 align:middle line:84%
it's done, and the distance
thing takes care of itself.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: What's the technique?

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: It's not
a physical technique.

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.680 align:middle line:90%
It's a mental technique.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And you allow yourself
to be connected.

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And you're connected
throughout the whole universe,

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.370 align:middle line:90%
as best I can tell.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.504 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So there's a
telepathic component to this.

00:06:48.504 --> 00:06:50.920 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: We could call it
a telepathic component to it.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:51.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.410 align:middle line:84%
So this would not be
something anybody could do.

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.184 align:middle line:84%
There has to be a
projection of the force

00:06:56.184 --> 00:06:58.100 align:middle line:84%
of the will of the
individual, I would assume.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.750 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well,
it's a science.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.630 align:middle line:84%
It is a science, so
you can train to do it.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.530 align:middle line:90%
You learn how to hold your mind.

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:12.620 align:middle line:84%
You go in and watch any
craftsman-- watch manufacturing

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:18.950 align:middle line:84%
jeweler, someone who
repairs expensive watches.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:21.830 align:middle line:90%
And you watch them--

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: The tongue.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.210 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And you
watch their tongue.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.251 align:middle line:84%
They have to hold their
tongue in a certain place

00:07:26.251 --> 00:07:27.265 align:middle line:90%
to get it to work.

00:07:27.265 --> 00:07:29.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, aren't there
certain Indian mudras--

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:30.490 align:middle line:90%
ways you hold your hands--

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:33.077 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Mudras and
Indian things-- absolutely.

00:07:33.077 --> 00:07:35.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you're saying this
is related to the flow of prana

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.490 align:middle line:90%
or chi, somehow?

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.140 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I don't
know that at all.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:43.560 align:middle line:84%
I just know that there
is an information flow.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.770 align:middle line:84%
You hook into that
informational field.

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.350 align:middle line:84%
And you can cause things
to happen that you

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:50.086 align:middle line:90%
can't cause another way.

00:07:50.086 --> 00:07:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So are you
saying that in some

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:53.690 align:middle line:84%
of these Japanese
records that you

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:57.740 align:middle line:84%
saw that people were able
to levitate or levitate

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.120 align:middle line:90%
other objects?

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: There were
Japanese, especially--

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:09.010 align:middle line:84%
this was trained at certain
secret schools, if you would.

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:12.065 align:middle line:84%
So everybody's heard about
Shaolin and the Shaolin temple

00:08:12.065 --> 00:08:14.290 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:18.010 align:middle line:84%
There are things that
you do repeatedly,

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:19.930 align:middle line:84%
and your thoughts
of the world are

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:23.500 align:middle line:84%
very different because you get
to see the world differently.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:27.490 align:middle line:84%
Then you get to operate
in the world differently.

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:29.800 align:middle line:84%
Once you do that, your
belief system-- these

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.080 align:middle line:90%
are all based on belief.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.390 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole physical set of
things that go on in the world.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:39.679 align:middle line:84%
There's also a whole set of
belief things that go on,

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:41.900 align:middle line:90%
and it's part of your universe.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.150 align:middle line:84%
Very few people
use those things.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And probably one of
the better examples

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:50.820 align:middle line:84%
is someone playing tennis,
someone playing ping-pong,

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.669 align:middle line:90%
someone playing basketball.

00:08:52.669 --> 00:08:54.335 align:middle line:84%
You see them do
something extraordinary,

00:08:54.335 --> 00:08:57.366 align:middle line:84%
and you say, how in the
world did you do that?

00:08:57.366 --> 00:08:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of
the game, they're

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.380 align:middle line:84%
completely off because
they sit there thinking,

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.240 align:middle line:90%
how did I do that?

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.500 align:middle line:90%
And I want to do that again.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.950 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't work that way.

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:08.520 align:middle line:84%
It works from a whole
different standpoint.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.910 align:middle line:84%
So you can throw it off
just by being called on it.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:14.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Do you remember
any specific examples

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:17.190 align:middle line:84%
that jumped out at you
from these Mesmer records

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:19.800 align:middle line:90%
of something extraordinary?

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.410 align:middle line:84%
Is there a specific case of
somebody levitating an object

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:23.010 align:middle line:90%
or something like that?

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:24.426 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well,
there are people

00:09:24.426 --> 00:09:26.357 align:middle line:84%
that levitate or levitate
or are levitated.

00:09:26.357 --> 00:09:27.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: But what are we seeing?

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:28.773 align:middle line:90%
How much do they levitate?

00:09:28.773 --> 00:09:31.170 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, like the
person with their heels

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:34.120 align:middle line:90%
and the back of their head.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:38.920 align:middle line:84%
You can't lift yourself
straight there because there's

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.760 align:middle line:84%
too much leverage the
other direction, just

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.090 align:middle line:90%
from a physical standpoint.

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:46.180 align:middle line:90%
You'll bend in the middle.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.550 align:middle line:84%
Yet they will lay
down and do that.

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:50.660 align:middle line:90%
And you can sit on them.

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:52.830 align:middle line:84%
You put two, three
people sitting on them.

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:54.940 align:middle line:84%
There's nobody in the
world that's that strong.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:55.390 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Then you can
get up, and then the person

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.770 align:middle line:84%
can raise up three
feet in the air

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:03.730 align:middle line:84%
and still be laying
there, straight as can be.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:06.130 align:middle line:84%
So it's not the chair
that they're lying on.

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:09.000 align:middle line:90%


00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Do you think the
popularity of this being done

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.340 align:middle line:84%
in public demonstrations
is part of what

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.530 align:middle line:84%
led stage magicians
to do these levitation

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:18.570 align:middle line:84%
tricks with the
hoop, and there's

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:20.995 align:middle line:84%
like a hidden thing in the
back that's lifting somebody

00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:21.795 align:middle line:90%
off the ground?

00:10:21.795 --> 00:10:22.504 align:middle line:84%
Do you think they
were copying that?

00:10:22.504 --> 00:10:24.337 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: In some,
there's a hidden thing,

00:10:24.337 --> 00:10:25.772 align:middle line:90%
and in some there isn't.

00:10:25.772 --> 00:10:29.040 align:middle line:84%
There's some that actually
either discover it-- most

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.730 align:middle line:84%
of them, I think,
discover it on their own.

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:34.140 align:middle line:90%
And they look at it.

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:35.100 align:middle line:90%
They see it happen.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.540 align:middle line:84%
They can't think
of how it's done,

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.960 align:middle line:84%
so they try something
else, and it works.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And they are manufacturing that
particular type of universe

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.700 align:middle line:84%
for their own use
that makes it happen.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And when there are
not 10,000 people that

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:54.180 align:middle line:84%
believe it can't happen
and there are people there

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:57.640 align:middle line:84%
that think that it could
happen, then it happens.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:00.900 align:middle line:84%
It's a consensus that
it's a part of the reality

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.019 align:middle line:90%
that we live in.

00:11:02.019 --> 00:11:03.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Why would
anyone in the government

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:07.100 align:middle line:84%
think that this was
other than nonsense?

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.990 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I don't
know why they would.

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:11.620 align:middle line:84%
Most of them think
it's nonsense.

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:14.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we could be light
years beyond where we are today

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:16.150 align:middle line:90%
if it weren't for that.

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:18.465 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But it would appear
that, at some point, based

00:11:18.465 --> 00:11:19.840 align:middle line:84%
on some of the
things we're going

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.470 align:middle line:84%
to get into, that there was some
research done into this stuff.

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:25.420 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: There's a
lot of research done.

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:27.589 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What was the
idea behind that research?

00:11:27.589 --> 00:11:29.130 align:middle line:84%
What were they hoping
to get from it?

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:29.800 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well,
they were hoping

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.170 align:middle line:84%
to get what they saw they
could get if they did,

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:35.760 align:middle line:90%
quote unquote, "something."

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And so they tried a number
of different things.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And what they didn't
understand was

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:42.250 align:middle line:84%
what was needed to set it
up so that it could happen,

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:45.750 align:middle line:90%
the mindset that they needed.

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:47.910 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of
remote viewing went on.

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:54.850 align:middle line:84%
There was a device that was
built called a brain trainer.

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:58.960 align:middle line:84%
They took people that
had these abilities

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.555 align:middle line:90%
and recorded their brainwave.

00:12:01.555 --> 00:12:05.740 align:middle line:84%
Then they played
those brainwaves back

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.290 align:middle line:84%
in such a manner that
the person could listen,

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:10.590 align:middle line:90%
could hear the brainwave.

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:12.630 align:middle line:84%
So they could hear
their brainwaves now,

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:18.600 align:middle line:84%
and they listened and tried
to make their brainwave

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:22.690 align:middle line:84%
replicate the brainwave of
the person that could do it.

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And so we taught people to
generate certain brainwaves.

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:28.740 align:middle line:84%
I can go in and
do a brainwave lab

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:33.920 align:middle line:84%
and put a brainwave
recorder on and startle

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.930 align:middle line:84%
the hell out of them by
playing "Yankee Doodle."

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:37.554 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll play
it in a round, where

00:12:37.554 --> 00:12:40.430 align:middle line:84%
you play "Yankee Doodle,"
then you start again

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:42.320 align:middle line:84%
with the other
side of your brain.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So are
you saying that you

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:47.845 align:middle line:84%
could use a sort of
biofeedback to generate

00:12:47.845 --> 00:12:48.720 align:middle line:90%
these musical sounds?

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.178 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Use
biofeedback, right,

00:12:50.178 --> 00:12:52.054 align:middle line:90%
to generate the musical sounds.

00:12:52.054 --> 00:12:53.720 align:middle line:84%
You could learn to
play "Yankee Doodle,"

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.428 align:middle line:84%
and you can learn to
do it with one side,

00:12:55.428 --> 00:12:57.600 align:middle line:84%
then you can learn to do
it with the other side.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.387 align:middle line:84%
Then you can learn real
well to do it with one side.

00:13:00.387 --> 00:13:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And then you're going
learn to play it

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:05.990 align:middle line:84%
in what we call in a round
and do it on the other side

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:09.279 align:middle line:84%
but one phrase back from the
other or ahead of the other.

00:13:09.279 --> 00:13:10.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And this
is not a technology

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.810 align:middle line:84%
that somebody could
just order online today.

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:14.964 align:middle line:90%
It's still classified.

00:13:14.964 --> 00:13:16.880 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I don't know
that it's classified.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
classified anymore.

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:20.900 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know anywhere
you could order it.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.190 align:middle line:84%
I thought I'd put it on the
market just for the heck of it.

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:24.990 align:middle line:90%
But I think--

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:25.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Oh, we've
talked about that.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:28.236 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I'd probably have
my finger spanked if I did--

00:13:28.236 --> 00:13:29.615 align:middle line:90%
or more.

00:13:29.615 --> 00:13:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So let's talk
about spoon bending parties.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.320 align:middle line:84%
Because this is a clear
example of something

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:38.070 align:middle line:84%
you've told me about before
in which you were directly

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:40.820 align:middle line:84%
involved in
psychokinesis research.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:44.070 align:middle line:84%
So could you start
that discussion for us,

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:47.390 align:middle line:84%
open up who was
responsible for putting you

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:49.770 align:middle line:84%
into these spoon
bending parties and why?

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:50.570 align:middle line:90%
What did you do?

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:52.903 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, that's
probably something I can't say.

00:13:52.903 --> 00:13:57.840 align:middle line:84%
But there was a gentleman by
the name of Jack Houck, who

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:58.760 align:middle line:90%
was an engineer--

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:03.750 align:middle line:90%


00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:06.360 align:middle line:84%
rumored that he was an engineer
for several companies, one

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.140 align:middle line:90%
of them being Lockheed.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And Lockheed was known for its
prowess in machining scandium

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:21.030 align:middle line:84%
aluminum or a lot of alloy
parts that were very, very, very

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:22.960 align:middle line:90%
lightweight.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And the metals involved
didn't allow themselves

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:31.830 align:middle line:84%
the typical warm forming
thing, like injection molding

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:36.600 align:middle line:84%
and the high temperature
thing or molding them

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.750 align:middle line:90%
as a molten metal.

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:42.180 align:middle line:84%
They'd heat them up, and
then they'd stamp them.

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And they'd stamp into
various positions

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:50.960 align:middle line:90%
rather than have to be machined.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.120 align:middle line:84%
They'd cast an ingot,
nearly what they needed,

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:57.750 align:middle line:84%
and then they'd have to machine
it into the shape they wanted.

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And then later, they found
out how to just manufacture it

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.450 align:middle line:90%
by a normal process.

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:07.110 align:middle line:84%
Then you could hammer it
and press it and mold it

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:09.750 align:middle line:90%
into a shape that you wanted.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And it cut off a lot of money,
a lot of time, a lot of effort,

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:14.989 align:middle line:84%
and they found out that
it worked real well.

00:15:14.989 --> 00:15:16.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you
mentioned Jack Houck.

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:18.435 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
seeing him online--

00:15:18.435 --> 00:15:21.570 align:middle line:90%
H-O-U-C-K is the last name--

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:24.570 align:middle line:84%
as a guy who did
spoon bending parties.

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And I specifically
remember, I was

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.970 align:middle line:90%
a guest on Laura Lee Radio--

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:31.910 align:middle line:84%
lauralee.com was the website
way back in the day--

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:32.950 align:middle line:90%
late '90s.

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:35.290 align:middle line:84%
It was the first
radio show I ever did.

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And I was totally amazed
when she described--

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:40.260 align:middle line:84%
she'd had Jack Houck
on as a radio guest--

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.780 align:middle line:84%
and she described being
at a spoon bending party

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:44.840 align:middle line:84%
that Jack Houck, who
you just mentioned,

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:49.680 align:middle line:84%
had led in which a person,
she said, was holding a fork.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And she watched the tines
of the fork, one by one,

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:55.590 align:middle line:90%
just melt down.

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:57.394 align:middle line:84%
The person never
touched the fork at all.

00:15:57.394 --> 00:15:59.310 align:middle line:84%
They're just looking at
it, and the tines just

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:01.990 align:middle line:90%
melted like they were in heat.

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:02.790 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Right.

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:06.510 align:middle line:84%
You could take a
spoon or a knife

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:08.800 align:middle line:84%
and roll it up like
a tape measure.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So how did
this get started?

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:13.050 align:middle line:90%
Who was doing it first?

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:15.345 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Jack got involved
with a group of people.

00:16:15.345 --> 00:16:17.920 align:middle line:90%


00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.950 align:middle line:90%
Some of them I knew.

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And we all had our ideas
of how it was happening

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:23.714 align:middle line:90%
and what was going on.

00:16:23.714 --> 00:16:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You had
people that could do it

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.150 align:middle line:84%
and you were able
to observe this?

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:28.170 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Oh, yeah.

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:33.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, thousands of
people, not just a few.

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:38.200 align:middle line:84%
Lockheed made a lot of money for
making things out of titanium

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:41.380 align:middle line:84%
because they could do it really,
really good at a very, very

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.900 align:middle line:84%
low price because they could
just have five or six people

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:50.527 align:middle line:84%
get around this plate of
titanium or titanium alloy.

00:16:50.527 --> 00:16:53.110 align:middle line:84%
They'd get around the plate, and
they could make that titanium

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:56.710 align:middle line:84%
alloy immediately,
without getting very hot,

00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:00.520 align:middle line:84%
go exactly like bread
dough or pizza dough.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And then a big stamp press
could come down and mold it

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:04.569 align:middle line:90%
into a part.

00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And then they could release
it and let it be that way.

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And it'd cool off
just a little bit.

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:14.045 align:middle line:84%
And they had a molded
magnesium part.

00:17:14.045 --> 00:17:14.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Or titanium.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:15.795 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Titanium.

00:17:15.795 --> 00:17:17.849 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, whatever.

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So are you saying
that people using telekinesis,

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:24.569 align:middle line:84%
similar to a spoon bending,
could actually make that

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:25.802 align:middle line:90%
titanium or magnesium alloy--

00:17:25.802 --> 00:17:26.760 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Absolutely.

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:29.300 align:middle line:84%
We did spoon bending
parties all over the world.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:31.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: "We" meaning you
were involved in this?

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.575 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I was
involved in it at times.

00:17:33.575 --> 00:17:35.659 align:middle line:84%
There was a group of us
that did these things.

00:17:35.659 --> 00:17:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But there's
a big difference

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.680 align:middle line:84%
between what you just
described and spoon bending.

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:40.480 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: No.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.370 align:middle line:84%
No difference at all between
that and spoon bending.

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:44.620 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing as spoons.

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:45.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Size is
a big difference.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:46.926 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Size is
a little difference,

00:17:46.926 --> 00:17:48.030 align:middle line:90%
a little tiny difference.

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:49.738 align:middle line:84%
When you can do it to
that, you can do it

00:17:49.738 --> 00:17:51.360 align:middle line:84%
to a chunk the
size of this table.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:51.660 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: All right.

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's break
this down because this

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:56.580 align:middle line:84%
is a really, really
important thing that you did.

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Take us through a
spoon bending party.

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Just walk us through
what happens.

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:03.470 align:middle line:84%
Because again,
Laura Lee witnessed

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:05.430 align:middle line:84%
one of Jack Houck's
parties, saw this person

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:08.062 align:middle line:84%
melting down the
tines of a fork.

00:18:08.062 --> 00:18:09.270 align:middle line:90%
Walk us through what happens.

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:12.000 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: We developed
the technology very much

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.190 align:middle line:90%
over a period of maybe 15 years.

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:17.970 align:middle line:84%
So in the beginning,
it was very crude.

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:20.250 align:middle line:84%
Later on, it's
very sophisticated.

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:21.960 align:middle line:84%
But there are things
that we learned.

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You said you
developed a technology.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:24.090 align:middle line:90%
What was the technology?

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:25.560 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: No, I didn't
develop a technology.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:25.920 align:middle line:90%
Everybody--

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You said "we
developed a technology."

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:28.668 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Everybody
developed it.

00:18:28.668 --> 00:18:30.240 align:middle line:84%
Everybody threw in
what-- they said,

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.410 align:middle line:84%
oh, well, I tried a couple
parties, and we did this,

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:33.210 align:middle line:90%
and this happened.

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:34.126 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK, but wait.

00:18:34.126 --> 00:18:36.180 align:middle line:84%
So when you say
technology, you're

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:37.410 align:middle line:90%
not talking about a machine.

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:39.210 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about,
maybe, a technique--

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:40.210 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: A technique.

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:41.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: --of how these spoon
bending parties could do that.

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:44.610 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Because there's
no machine required.

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:45.910 align:middle line:90%
It's all done in the mind.

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:46.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:47.140 align:middle line:90%
Just wanted to clarify that.

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yeah.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And so now when we do
a spoon bending party,

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:55.620 align:middle line:84%
we found out that
a lot of people

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.990 align:middle line:84%
weren't getting spoon
bending done that could

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:00.750 align:middle line:90%
have gotten spoon bending done.

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And we started out with
silverware for two reasons.

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.680 align:middle line:84%
One of the big reasons
was because we said, hey,

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:11.540 align:middle line:84%
how would you like to learn how
to bend a spoon with your mind?

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, this person would
come, and they'd do it

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.764 align:middle line:90%
or they wouldn't do it.

00:19:14.764 --> 00:19:16.680 align:middle line:84%
But they wouldn't know
why they were doing it.

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.304 align:middle line:84%
They just thought, here's a fun
little party thing we're doing.

00:19:19.304 --> 00:19:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And we always made it a
fun little party thing.

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.625 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I will say I remember
reading about Jack Houck's

00:19:25.625 --> 00:19:28.190 align:middle line:84%
spoon bending parties and
that one of the defining

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:30.290 align:middle line:84%
characteristics
of all of them is

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:33.890 align:middle line:84%
that it's a very
uplifting, positive, party

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:37.220 align:middle line:84%
environment-- not anything
spooky or mystical,

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:39.449 align:middle line:84%
but this big celebration,
lots of energy.

00:19:39.449 --> 00:19:40.740 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: No, nothing at all.

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:42.770 align:middle line:90%
And we make no pre-promises.

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:45.710 align:middle line:84%
They don't know what
they're going to get into.

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:49.440 align:middle line:90%
So we make no pre-promises.

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:54.680 align:middle line:84%
For example, people like
Art Bell, who people know,

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:58.010 align:middle line:84%
he was just completely
spooked by it

00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:01.040 align:middle line:84%
because he was very
Catholic in nature.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And he had no way
of thinking about it

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.060 align:middle line:90%
from his Catholic mind.

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:07.490 align:middle line:84%
So he didn't know if it
was spooky or good or bad

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:10.010 align:middle line:84%
or going to put a curse
on him or whatever.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:12.560 align:middle line:84%
So he never really
got involved in it.

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.440 align:middle line:84%
But he had people that
got involved in it.

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And that scared him even
more because they all did it.

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:19.730 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know if he was
participating in something evil

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:20.930 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:22.007 align:middle line:90%
That's my take on it.

00:20:22.007 --> 00:20:23.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So what were
some of the techniques

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.730 align:middle line:84%
that you guys
would use to create

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:27.020 align:middle line:90%
this positive environment?

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:27.950 align:middle line:90%
How did it get going?

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:29.366 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: First
off, we'd start,

00:20:29.366 --> 00:20:32.750 align:middle line:84%
and we'd make it just
a fun thing to do--

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:36.050 align:middle line:90%
no big deal.

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And let's just see
if we can do it.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:38.840 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people have.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.400 align:middle line:90%
Some people haven't.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.530 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what we can do.

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:44.630 align:middle line:84%
Then we'd go through
what was going to happen

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:46.430 align:middle line:90%
and what the history was.

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:50.907 align:middle line:84%
Then we'd show people silverware
and things that had done that.

00:20:50.907 --> 00:20:52.490 align:middle line:84%
If I'd known we were
going to do this,

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:55.100 align:middle line:84%
I'd have brought a big
box full of silverware.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And you dump it
out on the table,

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:58.220 align:middle line:84%
and it's in positions
and shapes that

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:02.750 align:middle line:84%
are absolutely unreal that
people did just by holding it--

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:06.410 align:middle line:84%
like a spoon or a fork
or a knife up like this--

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:08.060 align:middle line:84%
just holding it there
and then causing

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:09.750 align:middle line:90%
it to do all kinds of things.

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And when it was done,
it looked like a piece

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:14.840 align:middle line:84%
of overcooked spaghetti
that had dried.

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And you're saying
they never touched it

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:17.420 align:middle line:90%
in some of those cases?

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:18.320 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well,
they'd hold onto it

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.740 align:middle line:84%
so it doesn't fall
on the ground.

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:21.086 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But I mean,
they're not manipulating it

00:21:21.086 --> 00:21:21.670 align:middle line:90%
with their other hand.

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:22.740 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Oh, no,
they're not manipulating it

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:23.900 align:middle line:90%
with their hand.

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And you can do it where
you manipulate it.

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:28.670 align:middle line:84%
It depends on what
you're thinking.

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:30.530 align:middle line:84%
If you think it
needs to be pushed,

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:33.650 align:middle line:90%
then push the damn thing.

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
best people doing it

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.850 align:middle line:84%
were old grannies and little
kids because none of them

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:40.490 align:middle line:90%
knew any different.

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly why
it happened for them.

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:46.250 align:middle line:84%
They said, well, you can bend
it with your mind as easy

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:48.620 align:middle line:84%
as doing it with your hands,
so why use your other hand?

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.270 align:middle line:90%
Put it in your pocket.

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:51.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So if you
have, let's say,

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:54.890 align:middle line:84%
a knife or a spoon in
somebody's hand, what

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:56.840 align:middle line:84%
is some of the most
outrageous stuff

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:59.730 align:middle line:84%
that you personally saw
happen at these parties?

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, OK,
imagine a spoon there.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And then imagine the
bowl of the spoon

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:08.540 align:middle line:84%
starts rotating like a
light on a police car,

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:10.520 align:middle line:90%
and it just screws up.

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:13.440 align:middle line:84%
Now you've got a handle
that's made out of metal,

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.770 align:middle line:90%
and it's in the form of a screw.

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:17.300 align:middle line:90%
And it's shorter.

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And the spoon started
facing toward you.

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:22.010 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's facing away from you.

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:24.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:27.750 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Sometimes
it gets slightly warmer.

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:29.490 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's
called warm forming.

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:32.030 align:middle line:90%


00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:34.640 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the people
have to stroke the spoon

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.000 align:middle line:90%
and tell it what to do.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.130 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes some people
can just hold it.

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:43.954 align:middle line:84%
And the ones that have to tell
it what to do after a while

00:22:43.954 --> 00:22:45.620 align:middle line:84%
can get where they
don't have to tell it

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:50.210 align:middle line:84%
what to do because they realize
that that's inconsequential.

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And so is it a different
way of doing it?

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Is it a different
thought process?

00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:58.880 align:middle line:90%
All that's now been studied.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.830 align:middle line:84%
So you can teach people to do
these things pretty easily.

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So could you give me
an example of one of the things

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.430 align:middle line:90%
that you would tell people?

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:09.639 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the
actual instructions

00:23:09.639 --> 00:23:11.180 align:middle line:84%
that you would tell
people that would

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:12.590 align:middle line:90%
get them to be able to do this?

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:14.715 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Before we'd
give them any instructions,

00:23:14.715 --> 00:23:19.650 align:middle line:84%
we run them through these
little pre-tested things, which

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:22.190 align:middle line:84%
is a way of giving
them instructions

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:24.997 align:middle line:84%
not to the thinking
part of the mind.

00:23:24.997 --> 00:23:27.080 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to do the
thinking part of the mind

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:30.750 align:middle line:84%
because they're very dead
set on, I can't do this.

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:31.750 align:middle line:90%
It's sinful.

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:33.644 align:middle line:90%
I'll go to hell if I do it.

00:23:33.644 --> 00:23:35.143 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Which is
like conditioning.

00:23:35.143 --> 00:23:35.943 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yeah.

00:23:35.943 --> 00:23:39.252 align:middle line:84%
And so instead of saying,
no, you won't do this--

00:23:39.252 --> 00:23:40.460 align:middle line:90%
they're not going to believe.

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:41.720 align:middle line:84%
If they didn't believe
you, it wasn't going

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:42.928 align:middle line:90%
to happen in the first place.

00:23:42.928 --> 00:23:44.300 align:middle line:90%
It won't in the second place.

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.100 align:middle line:90%
So you just go through it.

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.600 align:middle line:90%
OK, here's what we do.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.780 align:middle line:84%
First thing we do is we
get them familiar with it.

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:53.870 align:middle line:84%
We show them some things
that have been done.

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:56.030 align:middle line:90%
We throw some tableware out.

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:59.510 align:middle line:84%
Then we tell them that we found
that a lot more people could

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:02.120 align:middle line:84%
do it when they
understood the background

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:06.230 align:middle line:84%
of the knives, forks, and
spoons that we started with.

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:08.480 align:middle line:84%
People, oh, well, that's
like one of my grandmother's.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And that was her
favorite thing, and I

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:12.038 align:middle line:84%
don't want to bend one of
those up because maybe it's

00:24:12.038 --> 00:24:14.014 align:middle line:90%
somebody's grandmother's thing.

00:24:14.014 --> 00:24:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And they're all trying
to look for a way

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.410 align:middle line:84%
out because they think
it might be evil.

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:22.610 align:middle line:84%
So we go through how we've
chosen the silverware is--

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:23.510 align:middle line:90%
and we do this.

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:24.630 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we actually do it.

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:27.020 align:middle line:90%
We're not telling them stories.

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.210 align:middle line:84%
We go to a swap
meet, and we find

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:31.820 align:middle line:84%
that people that don't
sell their old crappy

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:35.300 align:middle line:90%
silverware just leave it there.

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:38.180 align:middle line:84%
So this stuff wasn't
thought enough about

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:39.172 align:middle line:90%
to even be taking home.

00:24:39.172 --> 00:24:41.130 align:middle line:84%
They'd abandoned it
because they didn't sell it

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:44.000 align:middle line:90%
at the swap meet.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And then, we try
to pick stuff that

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:49.130 align:middle line:84%
looks like it might be Grandma's
favorite teaspoon and stuff.

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:50.280 align:middle line:90%
We throw it out.

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:51.220 align:middle line:90%
We don't take that.

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Because somebody else
may think the same thing.

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And so this is just junk
knives, forks, and spoons.

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So I think I
get what you're saying,

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.540 align:middle line:90%
but I want to specify this.

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Are you saying
that if people feel

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:10.460 align:middle line:84%
that a spoon was treasured,
such as Grandma's favorite,

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.080 align:middle line:84%
that they don't
want to disturb it,

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:14.000 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, it won't
bend, even if they normally

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:14.800 align:middle line:90%
could bend a spoon?

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:15.830 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Right.

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:17.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:19.325 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: It's not
that it won't bend.

00:25:19.325 --> 00:25:21.850 align:middle line:84%
Because I can pick them
up and do them any way.

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:25.040 align:middle line:84%
But it's that they
think there may

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:30.200 align:middle line:84%
be some emotional
attachment somewhere.

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.040 align:middle line:90%
And you ask them.

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:34.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's like this
was a research project.

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:37.490 align:middle line:84%
You ask them, well, why don't
you want to bend this one?

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:41.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think of this favorite
pickle spoon or pickle knife

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:44.150 align:middle line:90%
that my grandmother had.

00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And it looked very much like
it, and I thought, well, maybe

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:50.760 align:middle line:84%
there's somebody out there that
really would treasure this, et

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.020 align:middle line:90%
cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:53.240 align:middle line:90%
So we don't do those things.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.370 align:middle line:90%
We just make them generic.

00:25:55.370 --> 00:26:00.380 align:middle line:84%
We try to get silverware
that's stamped stainless steel

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:05.380 align:middle line:84%
or just stamped tableware,
non-generic, nothing exciting

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:06.180 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So it doesn't need
to have any special metal.

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:09.770 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't need
silver, for example.

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:10.400 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Right.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.220 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:12.770 align:middle line:90%
And it can be any kind of metal.

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:14.240 align:middle line:90%
It can be.

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.980 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't have to be.

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:18.460 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that
somebody's heirloom,

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:22.730 align:middle line:84%
somebody's favorite
grandmother's butter knife

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:24.230 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:27.020 align:middle line:90%
We try to make it non-generic.

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:31.730 align:middle line:84%
That's increased our
hits tremendously

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:34.190 align:middle line:84%
and is something
we learned slowly.

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:36.540 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we didn't think that.

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:39.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Once you've established
that part of the protocol,

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:42.110 align:middle line:84%
and somebody has a spoon that
they're comfortable with--

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:44.700 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, no, we have
a way of selecting spoons

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:46.500 align:middle line:90%
that they're comfortable with.

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.287 align:middle line:84%
We teach them a little
bit about dowsing.

00:26:48.287 --> 00:26:49.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, really?

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:49.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.440 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Then we give
them a big nut or a bolt off

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:55.410 align:middle line:84%
of something on an
end of a fish line.

00:26:55.410 --> 00:27:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And we say, OK, now, take this
knife and swing and ask it--

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:05.680 align:middle line:84%
we have a big pile we
dump out on the floor

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:09.210 align:middle line:90%
of generic tableware.

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:11.700 align:middle line:84%
We say pick four or five that
look like good candidates

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:13.296 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:27:13.296 --> 00:27:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And they're, well,
that's too much like

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:16.810 align:middle line:90%
Grandmother's-- whatever.

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:18.550 align:middle line:90%
So they don't pick that one.

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:22.130 align:middle line:84%
So they pick some
non-generic things.

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:22.930 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:23.900 align:middle line:90%
Set those over here.

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:25.130 align:middle line:90%
Pick one.

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:28.470 align:middle line:84%
Ask this fork if it
will bend for you.

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:29.610 align:middle line:90%
And here's how you do it.

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:33.760 align:middle line:84%
Put the nut and bolt as a
plumb bob, or as a pendulum,

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:39.610 align:middle line:84%
over the fork or
spoon, and then see--

00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:41.780 align:middle line:84%
oh, the first half, we
start off and say, OK,

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:44.000 align:middle line:90%
indicate what's good.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.830 align:middle line:84%
How will you indicate to
me what is good and OK?

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:49.080 align:middle line:90%
And you just hold it there.

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon, it
will start going left,

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:53.810 align:middle line:84%
it'll go clockwise,
counterclockwise, back

00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:55.850 align:middle line:90%
and forth, right and left.

00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:57.700 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:01.600 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, break that
train of thought.

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.100 align:middle line:90%
Now show us what's bad.

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:04.760 align:middle line:90%
Oh, bad will go back and forth.

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:05.980 align:middle line:90%
Good goes this way.

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:06.940 align:middle line:90%
Bad goes this way.

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:07.780 align:middle line:90%
Good goes this way.

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:10.870 align:middle line:84%
You'll find two things that
happen, one for bad, one

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:12.010 align:middle line:90%
for good.

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:14.480 align:middle line:90%
OK, remember those.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.860 align:middle line:90%
Now take this fork.

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:19.170 align:middle line:84%
Say, will you bend
for me tonight?

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:21.030 align:middle line:84%
Will you warm form
or bend for me?

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, wham,
they're not moving their hand,

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:26.340 align:middle line:84%
but the thing is swinging
around on a big loop,

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:27.930 align:middle line:90%
pulling their hand.

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:30.110 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's a good one.

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:31.610 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's see you
take the next one.

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:35.100 align:middle line:84%
It's a fork out of the
same bunch or whatever.

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:39.570 align:middle line:84%
You do it, and it goes back and
forth, back and forth, slowly.

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:44.225 align:middle line:84%
So ask it, is there a good
reason you won't bend?

00:28:44.225 --> 00:28:45.970 align:middle line:90%
And we get yes and no.

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:46.770 align:middle line:90%
Which is yes?

00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:48.305 align:middle line:90%
Which is no?

00:28:48.305 --> 00:28:49.300 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no.

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:50.230 align:middle line:90%
That's got a bad one.

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And so they'll pick
out five good ones.

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:56.460 align:middle line:84%
We have them put all the
rest back in the pile.

00:28:56.460 --> 00:29:01.080 align:middle line:84%
Somebody may pick one of
the others, who knows why.

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:05.090 align:middle line:84%
But we know that these
have said, I will do it.

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:07.450 align:middle line:90%
So now we have that little pile.

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:08.720 align:middle line:90%
I say, OK, take one of them.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.700 align:middle line:90%
Hold it like this.

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:13.950 align:middle line:84%
Usually, it's a fork,
because that starts off

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:17.280 align:middle line:90%
and it's just easy one to do.

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:20.090 align:middle line:90%
And you say, OK.

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:24.690 align:middle line:84%
What I'd like you to do is I
would like you to bend for me.

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:27.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to consciously
require and ask

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:32.200 align:middle line:84%
that you bend in
some unique way.

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:35.170 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't limit them
into how it could do it.

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And we get every kind
of combination the thing

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:38.560 align:middle line:90%
could bend.

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:42.100 align:middle line:84%
Some of them, this tine
will bend backwards.

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:43.470 align:middle line:90%
This tine will bend forward.

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:46.510 align:middle line:84%
This tine'll bend to
the right or the left,

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:50.130 align:middle line:84%
or two will bend one way
and two the other way--

00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:52.490 align:middle line:90%
just however it happens.

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:54.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Sometimes without
people touching them,

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:55.840 align:middle line:90%
you're saying?

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:59.140 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: You can do it
with your hand over the top.

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:01.330 align:middle line:84%
You can push on
them a little bit.

00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:04.510 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, sometimes
they need a little push.

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:06.510 align:middle line:84%
I've seen many people
sit there and sit there.

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:07.980 align:middle line:90%
And they're trying to do it.

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:08.810 align:middle line:90%
No, it won't bend.

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:09.370 align:middle line:90%
It won't bend.

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:10.480 align:middle line:90%
I said, give it a little push.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.771 align:middle line:90%
And they give it a little push.

00:30:11.771 --> 00:30:14.520 align:middle line:84%
They go flop, like it
was an overcooked noodle,

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:16.470 align:middle line:84%
and it flops clear down
the back of their hand

00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:22.300 align:middle line:84%
and makes wrinkles
for their knuckles.

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:24.642 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that worked.

00:30:24.642 --> 00:30:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And then that happened so then
they're a little bit scared.

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And then it's a hard time
to do it another time.

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they'll do three
or four and then they'll say,

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:34.300 align:middle line:90%
look over here.

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:35.150 align:middle line:90%
Look what happened to me.

00:30:35.150 --> 00:30:37.108 align:middle line:84%
And one will be this way,
one will be this way,

00:30:37.108 --> 00:30:39.670 align:middle line:84%
one will be this way,
one will be this way.

00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And we found these typical
reactions that we get.

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:45.740 align:middle line:84%
The reaction's
coming from the fork.

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:48.490 align:middle line:90%
It's being made by the person.

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:52.022 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Are there any people
who just are not properly made

00:30:52.022 --> 00:30:53.230 align:middle line:90%
to be able to do this at all?

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:55.040 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: About 15%.

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.440 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: They can't ever do it?

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I've
never seen them do it.

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:00.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Only 15%?

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:02.944 align:middle line:90%
And the other 85% can?

00:31:02.944 --> 00:31:04.360 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Then
you ask them why.

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:10.450 align:middle line:84%
On average, over 30 years
of doing this, about 15%.

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:11.440 align:middle line:90%
And you ask them why.

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:15.900 align:middle line:84%
We're always discovering
new things that help out.

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:20.100 align:middle line:84%
So you'll get parties today that
go as little as 10% can't do it

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:22.590 align:middle line:90%
and as much as 50% can't do it.

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:29.070 align:middle line:84%
You get a couple of, for
example, Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:31.140 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen a Jehovah's
Witness ever do it.

00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:34.020 align:middle line:90%


00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: That makes sense.

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:38.530 align:middle line:84%
Are you saying that the 15%
average that you noticed

00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:41.814 align:middle line:84%
who couldn't do it have
some very strong blockage

00:31:41.814 --> 00:31:44.230 align:middle line:84%
in their mind or their belief
system that would stop them?

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:46.690 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, we've
tried to come up with that.

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:49.900 align:middle line:84%
There's always some little thing
that we discover, usually--

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:51.920 align:middle line:90%
usually.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And there's some that we
don't discover anything,

00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:57.050 align:middle line:90%
but they just can't do it.

00:31:57.050 --> 00:31:58.510 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
people that think

00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:01.314 align:middle line:90%
it's against their religion.

00:32:01.314 --> 00:32:02.230 align:middle line:90%
That's the main thing.

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:03.896 align:middle line:84%
When you have someone
that will tell you

00:32:03.896 --> 00:32:06.310 align:middle line:84%
why they feel they
can't do it, it's

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:10.360 align:middle line:84%
because they're not sure if
it's religiously correct.

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So Pete, if somebody
could push a fork over

00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:16.600 align:middle line:84%
and it just flops like
a wet noodle, that

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:20.650 align:middle line:84%
would imply that, eventually,
some of these people

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:23.800 align:middle line:84%
might be able to do something
more than just spoons,

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:24.650 align:middle line:90%
forks, and knives.

00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:27.066 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, this is why
we went around and did this.

00:32:27.066 --> 00:32:29.840 align:middle line:84%
We identified people
who were warm formers.

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And then, those who
were identified were,

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:35.875 align:middle line:84%
after a certain period of
time-- three or four months--

00:32:35.875 --> 00:32:37.250 align:middle line:84%
we'd call up and
said, hey, we're

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:38.791 align:middle line:84%
going to have another
party and learn

00:32:38.791 --> 00:32:44.560 align:middle line:84%
how to do larger things like
axle shafts and railroad spikes

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:46.610 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:48.950 align:middle line:84%
So then we'd find out that
those people pretty much--

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:51.780 align:middle line:84%
about the same percentage
that could do the initial--

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:52.940 align:middle line:90%
could do the secondary.

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:54.680 align:middle line:84%
They'd take a
Volkswagen torsion bar

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:58.134 align:middle line:84%
and make a little pair of them
that had a half loop in them

00:32:58.134 --> 00:32:59.550 align:middle line:84%
and make one of
those puzzle games

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:02.105 align:middle line:90%
where you can put them together.

00:33:02.105 --> 00:33:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And you go to
Volkswagen in Wolfsburg,

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:07.550 align:middle line:84%
and you'll find two Volkswagen
torsion bars linked together

00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:10.999 align:middle line:84%
like that loop puzzle that you
can buy in the puzzle stores.

00:33:10.999 --> 00:33:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Wolfsburg,
Germany, you say?

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:14.480 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yeah.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And you can find that they
can link them together,

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:19.670 align:middle line:84%
and there's a couple
hanging on the wall.

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:21.170 align:middle line:84%
The reason is that
engineers know

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:22.700 align:middle line:90%
you can't bend that material.

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.890 align:middle line:84%
It's a special
tempered material.

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:26.640 align:middle line:84%
If you bend it past
a certain point,

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:29.570 align:middle line:84%
it just goes bam and explodes
into little shrapnel.

00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:32.239 align:middle line:84%
But these things are
obviously bent right around.

00:33:32.239 --> 00:33:33.530 align:middle line:90%
Oh, well, you didn't temper it.

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:36.140 align:middle line:90%
No, it was tempered.

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:38.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So when people start
to be able to do the larger

00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:42.200 align:middle line:84%
things, what do you ask them, or
what do you do with them next?

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.020 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Then
we teach them more.

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:47.750 align:middle line:84%
That's a person we
can teach, actually,

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:52.240 align:middle line:84%
because their will
allows them to do it.

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:56.790 align:middle line:84%
It's a matter of testing them
to see if they'll be useful.

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Now you get a bunch
of people, and they

00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:07.350 align:middle line:84%
work for a company that does
a lot of testing of titanium

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:09.974 align:middle line:90%
or other such things.

00:34:09.974 --> 00:34:13.215 align:middle line:90%


00:34:13.215 --> 00:34:15.090 align:middle line:90%
They don't form easily.

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:18.000 align:middle line:84%
You have to cast them
and then carve the part

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.320 align:middle line:90%
you want out of the metal.

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:22.889 align:middle line:90%


00:34:22.889 --> 00:34:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And so those people
get five or six of them

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:29.429 align:middle line:90%
around a big chunk of metal.

00:34:29.429 --> 00:34:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And the metal is in a big punch
press or some type of press.

00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And you say, OK, and we go
through the same exact thing.

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:43.540 align:middle line:90%
This thing is OK to work with.

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:45.440 align:middle line:90%
It's OK within the universe.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.310 align:middle line:90%
It's OK within people's minds.

00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:49.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they want it to happen.

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:50.820 align:middle line:90%
And the metal doesn't mind.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And we go through a whole bunch
of classifying technology.

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:59.393 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of a sudden,
they say, OK, everybody

00:34:59.393 --> 00:35:03.535 align:middle line:90%
hold and let it process.

00:35:03.535 --> 00:35:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And a punch press
will come down,

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:08.760 align:middle line:84%
and it'll punch press
like it was pizza dough.

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.750 align:middle line:84%
Now they've got a
manufactured metal part.

00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:14.337 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to cast it and
then machine it into a part.

00:35:14.337 --> 00:35:16.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What's the experience
of the punch press coming down?

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:18.480 align:middle line:90%
Does it make noise?

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:21.660 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, no more noise
or no less noise than the punch

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:23.040 align:middle line:90%
press would make.

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.270 align:middle line:90%
There's no extra noise.

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:25.400 align:middle line:90%
There's no different noise.

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Does it startle
everybody when it comes down?

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:29.063 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well,
the first few times.

00:35:29.063 --> 00:35:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And then after that,
it becomes routine.

00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Then they're good at it
for about four years,

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:34.455 align:middle line:84%
and then they can't
do it anymore.

00:35:34.455 --> 00:35:35.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:38.360 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever figure
out why that was?

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.110 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Yeah, it's
because now they're

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:42.780 align:middle line:90%
back thinking about it.

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:45.750 align:middle line:84%
When they're not thinking
about it, it's easy to do.

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:49.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, I remember
seeing the '80s television show,

00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:54.720 align:middle line:84%
"That's Incredible," in which
they were describing mothers

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:58.440 align:middle line:84%
whose child is trapped under a
Volkswagen Beetle, let's say.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And she lifts up the
whole Volkswagen Beetle.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.750 align:middle line:84%
Is it the same type
of principle involved?

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:04.410 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Different
principle entirely.

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:05.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Different principle?

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:06.150 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yeah.

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:07.566 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So what's
going on there,

00:36:07.566 --> 00:36:09.150 align:middle line:90%
when people can lift up a car?

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:10.691 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: They
want to do something

00:36:10.691 --> 00:36:15.750 align:middle line:84%
for their mother, father,
child, neighbor, somebody else.

00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:18.860 align:middle line:84%
They want to do
something altruistic.

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:20.370 align:middle line:90%
And they've heard about it.

00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:24.390 align:middle line:84%
All those people have
heard about it happening.

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:26.580 align:middle line:84%
So it's in their
mind it can be done

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:29.580 align:middle line:90%
if circumstances are right.

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:31.540 align:middle line:90%
So they ask God for help--

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:34.320 align:middle line:90%
many of them, a lot of them.

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:37.680 align:middle line:84%
They call on some
other thing that

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:43.200 align:middle line:84%
forms their mind, like
religion or reading

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:47.490 align:middle line:84%
texts about things that say it's
happened and so it can be done.

00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:48.290 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:52.340 align:middle line:84%
You need to have permission
to do it, anyway.

00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:54.790 align:middle line:90%
And so you ask those things.

00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:57.190 align:middle line:90%
And then they just do it.

00:36:57.190 --> 00:37:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And to them, lifting a car is
like lifting a marshmallow.

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:04.730 align:middle line:84%
You just reach down,
take it, and pick it up.

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And they know at some point,
it's going to come down,

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:11.205 align:middle line:84%
so they don't mind how
long they have to hold it.

00:37:11.205 --> 00:37:13.860 align:middle line:84%
They'll hold it for a
couple hours at times,

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:16.260 align:middle line:84%
wait till somebody gets
there and helps them.

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:21.300 align:middle line:84%
Or they'll think,
oh, I can't do--

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:23.400 align:middle line:84%
instead of thinking
about it, they

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:24.990 align:middle line:84%
start thinking
about other things.

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I know I couldn't
hold this for an hour.

00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And so eventually,
they let it down.

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:33.690 align:middle line:90%
But it's open.

00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:34.740 align:middle line:90%
It's available to you.

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:39.744 align:middle line:84%
And when you practice enough
and understand it, it's nothing.

00:37:39.744 --> 00:37:41.880 align:middle line:90%
It's easy to do.

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Another insider,
who I call Jacob,

00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:47.460 align:middle line:84%
and I was sitting there with you
guys, and we were all talking,

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:49.360 align:middle line:90%
and I hear this tink.

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:50.810 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, did you hear that?

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:53.500 align:middle line:84%
You didn't hear it, and
Jacob didn't hear it.

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And the woman that was
hosting us didn't hear it.

00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:57.480 align:middle line:90%
And y'all kept on talking.

00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And then the next thing
I know, I take my fork,

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:03.370 align:middle line:84%
and I push on my plate,
and the plate just

00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:04.516 align:middle line:90%
falls into two pieces.

00:38:04.516 --> 00:38:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I
remember that well.

00:38:05.890 --> 00:38:10.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now, in a case like
this, it would appear that--

00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:14.380 align:middle line:90%


00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:17.270 align:middle line:84%
I guess I'm just going
to ask you directly.

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:20.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that I did
that as a telekinesis thing.

00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:22.150 align:middle line:84%
It seems like that
might have been

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:25.102 align:middle line:84%
some sort of a directed
energy weapon that

00:38:25.102 --> 00:38:26.560 align:middle line:84%
was intended to
threaten us because

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:27.910 align:middle line:90%
of what we were talking about.

00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:29.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm just curious as to what
you think that might have been.

00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:31.700 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I don't
think that's the case.

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:34.352 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very typical
of many phenomena.

00:38:34.352 --> 00:38:35.185 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, really?

00:38:35.185 --> 00:38:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And I think it
just happened naturally.

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:39.540 align:middle line:84%
What happened was--
and I mean, when

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:41.380 align:middle line:84%
you look at the sequence
of it and things

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:44.830 align:middle line:84%
that I've seen and
experimented on,

00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:47.090 align:middle line:84%
it just seems to me
to be a natural thing.

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:52.120 align:middle line:84%
What happened was that there
was a little psychic glitch,

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:58.120 align:middle line:84%
or flip, and I think the
plate cracked at that time.

00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And then, when you put your fork
down on it, what happened was

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:04.180 align:middle line:84%
it parted it the
rest of the way.

00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And it was kind of
a response based

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:09.620 align:middle line:90%
on what was happening there.

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And then, as you know, that
person was a unique person.

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:17.110 align:middle line:84%
He was going against what you
would think the universe would

00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:23.440 align:middle line:84%
like, and he was not
telling the total truth,

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:28.500 align:middle line:84%
and he was a con artist,
and on and on and on.

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was that
the universe went against him.

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:35.730 align:middle line:90%
And that's my take on it.

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:37.870 align:middle line:90%
I could be wrong.

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:42.174 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it a lot, and
that's my take on it.

00:39:42.174 --> 00:39:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: One of the things
that I remember reading about--

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:46.655 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was in a
Charles Berlitz book,

00:39:46.655 --> 00:39:49.030 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not entirely sure
because it was a long time ago,

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:50.860 align:middle line:84%
and I've read hundreds
and hundreds of books.

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:52.235 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well,
Charles Berlitz

00:39:52.235 --> 00:39:54.760 align:middle line:84%
was a very special
person when it

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.417 align:middle line:90%
comes to psychic investigation.

00:39:56.417 --> 00:39:57.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, really?

00:39:57.250 --> 00:40:00.400 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Oh, he was a
well-known psychic investigator

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.550 align:middle line:90%
from forever.

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:04.030 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah, sure.

00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:07.570 align:middle line:84%
I remember reading
about Uri Geller doing

00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:10.480 align:middle line:90%
spoon bending on the radio.

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't even
a television show.

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:17.590 align:middle line:84%
It was just people hearing
the excitement of people

00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:20.240 align:middle line:84%
as spoons and
things were bending

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:23.890 align:middle line:84%
and that all these
kids around the country

00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:25.570 align:middle line:84%
were able to get
watches that had

00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:27.950 align:middle line:90%
stopped to start running again.

00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:31.985 align:middle line:84%
And I remember even hearing
about all these little kids

00:40:31.985 --> 00:40:32.860 align:middle line:90%
could start doing it.

00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And in one case, I remember
hearing about an entire drawer

00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:40.090 align:middle line:84%
of silverware where
every spoon and knife

00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:42.324 align:middle line:84%
and fork in the entire
drawer just bent all at once.

00:40:42.324 --> 00:40:44.740 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: This is a problem
that we had with Jack Houck,

00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:48.340 align:middle line:84%
who ran a lot of the Lockheed
spoon bending parties.

00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:50.950 align:middle line:90%
We'd do it in neighborhoods.

00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And the neighbors' forks
and spoons the next day

00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:55.700 align:middle line:84%
would all be rolled
up and curled up.

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:56.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:59.740 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Yeah, that
happened very often.

00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And so we had to
learn to be specific.

00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:07.247 align:middle line:84%
These forks and these spoons
and not the neighbors'.

00:41:07.247 --> 00:41:08.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: No kidding.

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And then
we'd straighten them out,

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:12.640 align:middle line:84%
and the neighbors would have
some that for some reason

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:13.677 align:middle line:90%
had been bent.

00:41:13.677 --> 00:41:16.010 align:middle line:84%
They'd come over, all my
spoons and forks that were bent

00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:19.210 align:middle line:90%
are all straight now.

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And we had a lot
of that kind of--

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:23.090 align:middle line:90%
I mean, a percentage.

00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:25.340 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't expect to have
that happen to start with.

00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, you have
10% of the neighbors' forks

00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:30.280 align:middle line:90%
are all straight.

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:33.370 align:middle line:84%
So then we were very interested
in investigating, well, what's

00:41:33.370 --> 00:41:35.920 align:middle line:90%
the distance effect here?

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:38.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, then, when we looked
at the distance effect,

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:41.270 align:middle line:84%
we found out that they
happened all over the country.

00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:44.200 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot more happening
than we thought of, that there

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:46.480 align:middle line:90%
was no distance effect.

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:53.060 align:middle line:84%
It was not here and
now but where and when.

00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And so we found out that a
lot of the communication-- we

00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:00.060 align:middle line:84%
did a lot of things
toward communication.

00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:03.510 align:middle line:84%
One of the big
things in the day was

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:06.780 align:middle line:84%
how do you tell a
submerged submarine

00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:09.860 align:middle line:90%
to launch its cruise missiles?

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:15.890 align:middle line:84%
So there was a lot of
interest taken in that.

00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And so it turns out
that the best way

00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:24.020 align:middle line:84%
to communicate that way was
with some plant life that

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:29.700 align:middle line:90%
would react to human control.

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And so you'd find a
plant that would clone--

00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:37.910 align:middle line:90%
some worked and some didn't.

00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:42.920 align:middle line:84%
But some were evidently put here
for that, they were so good.

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:46.776 align:middle line:84%
So you'd take the plants, and
you'd breed one off of another.

00:42:46.776 --> 00:42:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And all the plants that
are sensitive to that

00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:50.690 align:middle line:90%
tend to breed from--

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:54.480 align:middle line:84%
like there's a plant called the
paulownia that grows in China.

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And they made it a chop
your hands off kind of thing

00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:01.940 align:middle line:84%
if you try to take some
paulownia seed out.

00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:04.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, you don't need paulownia
seed, just a couple cells,

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:06.830 align:middle line:90%
and they'll reproduce.

00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
take one of those

00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:10.490 align:middle line:90%
and reproduce cells from it.

00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:12.590 align:middle line:84%
You can stimulate this
end, and no matter where

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:15.310 align:middle line:84%
the other end is-- clear
across the universe,

00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:20.540 align:middle line:84%
the next star down the road, or
the next planet down the road--

00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:23.450 align:middle line:84%
and you can do something here,
and the other end will react.

00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:26.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Yeah, that sounds a
lot like the Dr. Cleve Backster

00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:26.890 align:middle line:90%
research.

00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:28.040 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Exactly.

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:31.010 align:middle line:90%
Cleve is a really brilliant guy.

00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:35.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you're saying that
the same type of communication

00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:38.245 align:middle line:84%
could be used to actually
communicate to submarines.

00:43:38.245 --> 00:43:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: That's
how it's done.

00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:41.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And that,
somehow, when people

00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:44.750 align:middle line:84%
are doing this telekinesis,
the spoon bending stuff,

00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:48.230 align:middle line:84%
that there is some sort
of non-local spoon bending

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:49.355 align:middle line:90%
signal that they generate.

00:43:49.355 --> 00:43:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, the best
we can tell, it's non-local.

00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:59.060 align:middle line:90%
For some reason, I still think--

00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:03.770 align:middle line:84%
not in my experiments
but it seems to me

00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:06.530 align:middle line:84%
that it would work good
clear all the way out

00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:09.125 align:middle line:84%
to Pluto, but after that,
it might not work so well.

00:44:09.125 --> 00:44:10.590 align:middle line:90%
Well, that isn't the case.

00:44:10.590 --> 00:44:12.320 align:middle line:90%
It works everywhere.

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:14.739 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: We also mentioned
Dr. Rupert Sheldrake.

00:44:14.739 --> 00:44:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I asked
him about in my interview

00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:20.960 align:middle line:84%
with him was research
into certain crystals,

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:23.841 align:middle line:84%
where they have a very
hard time crystallizing.

00:44:23.841 --> 00:44:25.340 align:middle line:84%
But then, all of a
sudden, something

00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:28.617 align:middle line:84%
changes in the universe, and
then they all can crystallize.

00:44:28.617 --> 00:44:30.200 align:middle line:84%
No matter where they
are in the world,

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:33.140 align:middle line:90%
they all crystallize right away.

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:35.120 align:middle line:84%
There's some change
in the basic physics

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:38.060 align:middle line:84%
of how those crystals,
those chemicals combine.

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:41.099 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Yeah, they
are there to obey you.

00:44:41.099 --> 00:44:42.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And that's
one of the big secrets.

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: So we
make it so that, oh,

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:47.090 align:middle line:90%
if they do that, it's sinful.

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:48.500 align:middle line:90%
You're going to go to hell--

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:49.370 align:middle line:90%
on and on and on.

00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And so then they don't do
it because we don't wish it,

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:53.990 align:middle line:90%
or we don't allow it.

00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:56.300 align:middle line:84%
But you can learn to allow
it, and it works just fine,

00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:57.469 align:middle line:90%
thank you.

00:44:57.469 --> 00:44:58.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Well, this is awesome.

00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:01.370 align:middle line:84%
We're overdue in terms
of time for this episode,

00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:02.910 align:middle line:90%
but fascinating stuff.

00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:04.700 align:middle line:90%
So thank you very much, Pete.

00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:07.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, David Wilcock,
and I thank you for watching.
