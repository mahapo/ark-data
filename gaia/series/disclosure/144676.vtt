00:00:15.954 --> 00:00:17.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID WILCOCK: I'm
your host, David Wilcock.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.760 align:middle line:90%
And welcome back to Disclosure.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.110 align:middle line:84%
Rupert Sheldrake
is blowing my mind.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.867 align:middle line:90%
And it's not over yet.

00:00:25.867 --> 00:00:28.450 align:middle line:84%
One of the things we're going
to be discussing in this episode

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.310 align:middle line:84%
is totally amazing, the
work of Dr. John Lorber, who

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.640 align:middle line:84%
has shown many, many
instances of people

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.310 align:middle line:84%
who have a condition
called hydroencephaly,

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.670 align:middle line:84%
or water on the brain, where
cerebrospinal fluid gets

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.890 align:middle line:84%
backed up into the skull and the
brain is literally destroyed.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And what's left
of it is squashed

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.680 align:middle line:84%
down into something that's only
as thick as a slice of baloney

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.680 align:middle line:84%
along the interior of the
skull within a little spot

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.410 align:middle line:90%
at the bottom of the brainstem.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.860 align:middle line:84%
The whole rest of the
brain inside is all water.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, you say to yourself,
well, OK, if that's the case,

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.420 align:middle line:84%
then this person shouldn't
even be able to be alive.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.360 align:middle line:84%
They should at least be
in a coma, if not dead.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.340 align:middle line:90%
But that's not what happens.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.200 align:middle line:84%
As you're going to
hear Sheldrake discuss,

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.720 align:middle line:84%
one of these guys
actually graduated

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.650 align:middle line:84%
from Sheffield University
with a degree in mathematics

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.900 align:middle line:90%
and had above average IQ.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.460 align:middle line:90%
He could remember things.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And there's actually
multiple cases of this.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.960 align:middle line:84%
I actually stumped the
wizard on this one.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.590 align:middle line:84%
I brought up something that
Rupert Sheldrake didn't already

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.920 align:middle line:84%
know, which is in my book, "The
Source Field Investigations,"

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.010 align:middle line:84%
about studies done in Johns
Hopkins University, where you

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.140 align:middle line:84%
have children who are
dying from seizures

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.510 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to die
if you don't do something.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And the side of the
brain that's damaged,

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.850 align:middle line:84%
that's causing the seizures,
that entire hemisphere is

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.880 align:middle line:84%
completely removed in what's
called a hemispherectomy.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.240 align:middle line:90%
And the kids are fine.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.220 align:middle line:90%
Half their brain is gone.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And yet they can learn,
and they can remember.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.640 align:middle line:90%
And in fact, they improve.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.440 align:middle line:90%
They stop having seizures.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.680 align:middle line:90%
So this is amazing stuff.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's only a
part of what we're

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.650 align:middle line:90%
going to be discussing here.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.700 align:middle line:84%
We're also going to get
into the politics, where

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.502 align:middle line:84%
Rupert Sheldrake gave
a Ted Talk and speaks

00:02:17.502 --> 00:02:18.960 align:middle line:84%
at this thing that's
supposed to be

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.820 align:middle line:84%
an open forum for scientific
sharing, but he was suppressed.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is
really fascinating

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.610 align:middle line:84%
because there was a
great public backlash,

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.800 align:middle line:84%
and it totally
backfired on the people

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.140 align:middle line:90%
trying to suppress the truth.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.180 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very
exciting episode.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.120 align:middle line:84%
We're wrapping it all up
here with Rupert Sheldrake.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.530 align:middle line:90%
And get ready for the adventure.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.000 align:middle line:90%
Here it comes.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.600 align:middle line:10%
Well, you have me thinking about
the multiples effect, something

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.740 align:middle line:10%
where--

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.720 align:middle line:10%
I have this in my
slideshow that by--

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.670 align:middle line:10%
I believe it was
the year 1928, there

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.140 align:middle line:10%
was 128 or 144 documented
examples of this--

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.300 align:middle line:10%
I'm sure you've looked
into that as well--

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.760 align:middle line:10%
where different people
invent, or even in some cases,

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.450 align:middle line:10%
try to patent the same
inventions at the same time.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.340 align:middle line:84%
So could you tell us a
little bit about that

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.370 align:middle line:84%
and how this relates
to your model?

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.460 align:middle line:10%
>>RUPERT SHELDRAKE:
Well, morphic resonance

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.130 align:middle line:10%
is a theory that suggests that
when something's happened,

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.320 align:middle line:10%
it becomes easier for
someone else to do it,

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.710 align:middle line:10%
like the rats solving a puzzle
of getting out of the maze

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.800 align:middle line:10%
makes it easier for other
rats to do the same thing.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.340 align:middle line:10%
Now, when someone's working
on a technical puzzle,

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.550 align:middle line:10%
they're trying to
invent a new gadget

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.290 align:middle line:10%
to solve some problem,
then if they come up

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.600 align:middle line:10%
with an invention which is
original and which they patent,

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.600 align:middle line:10%
it often happens, as you say,
that someone else comes up

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.365 align:middle line:10%
with a very similar idea
around the same time.

00:03:48.365 --> 00:03:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a
dispute between them

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.840 align:middle line:90%
about who did it first.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.700 align:middle line:84%
Usually, one accuses the
other of cheating or stealing

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.420 align:middle line:90%
their secret or something.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.740 align:middle line:84%
This happened in the
history of science.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.450 align:middle line:84%
The most famous example was
with Isaac Newton and Gottfried

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.390 align:middle line:84%
Leibniz, who was the
great German philosopher

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.520 align:middle line:90%
and mathematician.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.460 align:middle line:10%
Both of them invented the
infinitesimal calculus

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.300 align:middle line:10%
around the same time.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.399 align:middle line:84%
And they spent years of
their lives quarreling

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:20.640 align:middle line:84%
with each other about
who did it first.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.160 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, you see, it
could have been independent.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.420 align:middle line:84%
Actually, one of them
probably did do it first.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And on morphic resonance
basis, the other

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.520 align:middle line:90%
would then find it easier to do.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.610 align:middle line:84%
But it's rather hard
to tell exactly who

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.170 align:middle line:90%
might have gone there first.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.270 align:middle line:84%
It's also, of course,
possible that confronted

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.030 align:middle line:84%
with the same problem,
people would independently

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.220 align:middle line:84%
come up with the same
solution if they're smart

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.370 align:middle line:84%
and they've got the same kind
of background information.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.820 align:middle line:84%
But there are many
examples from archeology

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.220 align:middle line:84%
and from cultural
anthropology where

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.610 align:middle line:84%
different cultures
separated widely physically

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.720 align:middle line:84%
have come up with similar
kinds of phenomena.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And the theories that
used to be put forward

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.090 align:middle line:84%
that they float around the
world on balsa wood rafts,

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.430 align:middle line:84%
people carry these
things from continent

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.090 align:middle line:84%
to continent on rafts blown
by the wind, morphic resonance

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.510 align:middle line:84%
makes the balsa wood
rafts unnecessary.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.050 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they might have existed.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So this could be
something like the ability

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.207 align:middle line:84%
to use a millstone to mill
grain into flour, for example.

00:05:20.207 --> 00:05:21.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SHELDRAKE: That sort of thing.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Is that
what you're saying?

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELDRAKE: And like
the independent invention

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:32.280 align:middle line:84%
of agriculture in Central
and South America,

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.550 align:middle line:90%
in Mexico and in Peru.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.470 align:middle line:84%
Completely independent origins
of agriculture and civilization

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.660 align:middle line:84%
and buildings from the Old World
civilizations and agriculture,

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.920 align:middle line:84%
whereas most people think there
was no contact between them.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.180 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.750 align:middle line:84%
So what you're
saying is that people

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:02.010 align:middle line:84%
are moving as a collective
in a given direction.

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:06.450 align:middle line:84%
Technology is improving as a
result of morphic resonance.

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:10.650 align:middle line:84%
It's happening globally because
we're all essentially connected

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.361 align:middle line:84%
to each other in this
greater consciousness matrix.

00:06:14.361 --> 00:06:15.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SHELDRAKE: I think so.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.860 align:middle line:84%
But of course,
it's also improving

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.560 align:middle line:84%
for obvious everyday
reasons like people

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.740 align:middle line:90%
seeing videos on the internet.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.949 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's lots of
other forms of communication.

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:26.031 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But in the
historical examples you gave--

00:06:26.031 --> 00:06:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELDRAKE: Oh, the
historical examples, yes.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.600 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays, with global
communication systems,

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.670 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to disentangle
morphic resonance

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:34.470 align:middle line:90%
from regular communication.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.570 align:middle line:84%
That's why you have to
do special experiments.

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:42.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, I've also looked
into the concept of how stress

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.520 align:middle line:90%
seems to create evolution.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And for example, the
Darwin's finches story

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:48.750 align:middle line:90%
with the Galapagos.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you are
familiar with that one.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.010 align:middle line:84%
Could you share with us a little
bit about Darwin's finches

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.487 align:middle line:90%
and what happened there?

00:06:55.487 --> 00:06:57.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELDRAKE: Well, I
don't know exactly what

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.430 align:middle line:90%
happened in the Galapagos.

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.160 align:middle line:84%
But what Darwin is saying is
that in different environments,

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.920 align:middle line:84%
you'd have different
selection pressures.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.480 align:middle line:84%
In modern evolutionary
theory, you'd

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.090 align:middle line:84%
also say you might have
random mutations, which

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.850 align:middle line:84%
in a small population
would mean things

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:12.470 align:middle line:90%
would drift in one direction.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.610 align:middle line:84%
On another island, they might
drift in another direction.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:21.490 align:middle line:84%
But there were minor differences
between these finches.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.210 align:middle line:84%
The point about Darwin
is he was actually

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.420 align:middle line:84%
studying quite small
differences, not things that

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.610 align:middle line:84%
made things different
species, but which were

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.960 align:middle line:90%
to do with local adaptations.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.220 align:middle line:84%
So he didn't actually study
the origin of species,

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:41.640 align:middle line:84%
he started the origin of
varieties or small adaptations.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.440 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.064 align:middle line:84%
I think there were
researchers who went

00:07:44.064 --> 00:07:46.310 align:middle line:90%
there later to the Galapagos.

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And what they saw was that
changes in the finches' beaks

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.540 align:middle line:84%
would be the result of changes
in their ability for food.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.420 align:middle line:84%
So if they need to get
really narrow seeds,

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.410 align:middle line:84%
their beaks would get
longer and sharper.

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:02.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.709 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And this would happen
in very short periods of time

00:08:04.709 --> 00:08:06.980 align:middle line:84%
compared to the traditional
Darwinian model,

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:08.480 align:middle line:84%
in which evolution
is random, and it

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.646 align:middle line:90%
takes a long period of time.

00:08:09.646 --> 00:08:10.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, you see, Darwin was
actually a Lamarckian.

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Darwin believed
in the inheritance

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.260 align:middle line:90%
of acquired characteristics.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.400 align:middle line:10%
He was convinced of it.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And in his book, "The
Variation of Animals and Plants

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.190 align:middle line:84%
Under Domestication,"
which is less well known

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:28.400 align:middle line:84%
than his most famous book,
"The Origin of Species,"

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:32.390 align:middle line:84%
he documents many cases of how
plant and animal breeders have

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:36.890 align:middle line:84%
produced different varieties of
dogs and pigeons and cabbages

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:39.440 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.049 align:middle line:84%
And he shows that
in many cases, there

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:44.780 align:middle line:84%
are adaptations which
can be inherited.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.390 align:middle line:84%
For example, he wrote
a paper in Nature,

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:51.350 align:middle line:84%
about a dog that he'd
been investigating

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:53.510 align:middle line:90%
that was afraid of butchers.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And whenever it got near a
butcher shop, it was terrified.

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And he discovered that
the father of that dog

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:03.150 align:middle line:84%
had been maltreated
by a butcher,

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.810 align:middle line:84%
and it had inherited
this fear of butchers.

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:07.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, you see,
that's not possible

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.650 align:middle line:90%
on regular genetic inheritance.

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:14.240 align:middle line:84%
It's an acquired characteristic,
this fear of butchers.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And so that side of Darwin,
the Lamarckian side of Darwin,

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.910 align:middle line:90%
was sort of airbrushed out.

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And the neo-Darwinian
theory of evolution,

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:26.420 align:middle line:84%
which is the current orthodoxy
is Darwin minus Lamarckian

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:27.800 align:middle line:90%
inheritance.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.780 align:middle line:84%
But interestingly, it's all
recently come back again,

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:36.110 align:middle line:84%
having been a taboo in biology,
under the rebranded name

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:41.330 align:middle line:84%
of epigenetic inheritance,
where acquired characteristics,

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:45.350 align:middle line:84%
it's now recognized that
they can indeed be inherited.

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And one molecular
basis of this is

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:53.390 align:middle line:84%
changing not the genes
themselves, but the methylation

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:56.630 align:middle line:84%
of side groups on the DNA,
or changing the proteins

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:59.360 align:middle line:90%
that wrap around the DNA.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.310 align:middle line:84%
Those can switch
on or off genes.

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And those, in some
cases, can be inherited.

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:06.890 align:middle line:84%
But now the taboo's
been lifted, there's

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:08.750 align:middle line:84%
a fascinating set
of studies going

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:11.340 align:middle line:90%
on at the moment in epigenetics.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.640 align:middle line:84%
A recent study that
was published in Nature

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.050 align:middle line:84%
is called inheriting
the fear of fathers.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.300 align:middle line:10%
And it was a study of mice.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And these mice were exposed
to a synthetic chemical

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:28.160 align:middle line:84%
they would never meet in
nature called acetophenone.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's an old style
experiment in the sense

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:32.720 align:middle line:84%
that male mice were
exposed to this,

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.090 align:middle line:84%
and they were given a
minor electric shock

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:36.590 align:middle line:90%
through their pores.

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:38.750 align:middle line:84%
So whenever they
smelled acetophenone,

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:40.850 align:middle line:90%
they were terrified.

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:41.690 align:middle line:90%
Not surprisingly.

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:44.570 align:middle line:84%
They knew it meant they'd
get an electric shock.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.670 align:middle line:84%
The researchers then
bred from these mice

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:48.360 align:middle line:90%
using artificial insemination.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.720 align:middle line:84%
So there was no contact
between these fathers

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.720 align:middle line:84%
and the mothers
and the children.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And they found that the
children and their grandchildren

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.930 align:middle line:90%
were terrified of acetophenone.

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:03.170 align:middle line:84%
So there'd been an
inheritance of this fear.

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:05.180 align:middle line:84%
That's why the paper
is called inheriting

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.580 align:middle line:90%
the fears of fathers.

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.204 align:middle line:90%
Over just one generation.

00:11:10.204 --> 00:11:12.620 align:middle line:84%
That's something that would
have been completely ruled out

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:17.240 align:middle line:84%
in 20th century biology, but is
now mainstream in 21st century

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.560 align:middle line:90%
biology.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, whether that's
because of modifications

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:25.760 align:middle line:84%
of the proteins
around the genes,

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.680 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's
something more mysterious

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.290 align:middle line:84%
like morphic resonance, or
whether it's a combination

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:33.020 align:middle line:90%
of the two is not yet known.

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.330 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting
thing is that now

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:38.750 align:middle line:84%
the taboo has been lifted,
this kind of research

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:39.980 align:middle line:90%
is going ahead.

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.280 align:middle line:90%
It's treated as mainstream.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.570 align:middle line:84%
It's not particularly
controversial.

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And this actually is one of the
most exciting areas of biology

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.890 align:middle line:90%
at the moment, epigenetics.

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:54.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, I know Johns
Hopkins University has

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:58.070 align:middle line:84%
done research with
hemispherectomies, where

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:01.550 align:middle line:84%
people who have seizures
have one hemisphere

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:03.580 align:middle line:90%
of their brain removed.

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And the entire half of
the brain is taken out.

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And the seizures, in
many cases, go away.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And there's no loss of
function or IQ or anything.

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:15.650 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in some cases,
it seems to get better.

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:17.441 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELDRAKE: Well, I'd
never heard of that.

00:12:17.441 --> 00:12:20.090 align:middle line:84%
But I'd heard of the so-called
split brain experiments that

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:22.040 align:middle line:84%
were done in the
'60s, where they

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:26.060 align:middle line:84%
severed the connection between
the two halves of the brain.

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they did
it, to stop seizures.

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:34.220 align:middle line:84%
The reason they went on doing
it is because most people

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.460 align:middle line:90%
didn't notice the difference.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.690 align:middle line:84%
The husbands and
wives of people who'd

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:42.650 align:middle line:84%
had the two halves of their
brain completely separated

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:45.950 align:middle line:84%
didn't notice any abnormal
behavior, which is amazing,

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:48.562 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it, because we assume
that the coordination

00:12:48.562 --> 00:12:50.270 align:middle line:84%
of the right and left
halves of the brain

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:51.830 align:middle line:90%
must go through nerves.

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:53.600 align:middle line:84%
The fact that they
were coordinated-- they

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.540 align:middle line:84%
could still walk and move
normally and speak normally

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:58.280 align:middle line:84%
and play the piano
normally, which

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:01.100 align:middle line:84%
must involve coordinating the
different sides of the body

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.200 align:middle line:84%
and the different
sides of the brain.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.380 align:middle line:84%
That rather suggests that the
coordination is not just based

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:08.540 align:middle line:84%
on nerves, but
there's a field which

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:11.420 align:middle line:84%
is working on and through
both halves of the brain

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.770 align:middle line:90%
and unifying what's happening.

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:17.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Are you familiar
with hydroencephaly patients?

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:22.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELDRAKE: Yes these cases
where people can have only 5%

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.260 align:middle line:84%
of normal brain volume
as a result of being

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.090 align:middle line:90%
born with hydroencephaly.

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:29.360 align:middle line:84%
There was a famous paper by
the British neuroscientist

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.840 align:middle line:84%
Lorber called, "Is Your
Brain Really Necessary."

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.240 align:middle line:90%
That was published in Science.

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:38.460 align:middle line:84%
When he found perfectly normal
people who-- one of them

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:40.910 align:middle line:84%
had got an IQ of
about 120 and had

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:42.770 align:middle line:84%
got a first class
degree in mathematics

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:44.420 align:middle line:90%
from Sheffield University.

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:47.184 align:middle line:84%
And he got 5% of his
normal brain volume.

00:13:47.184 --> 00:13:49.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And that means
that most of his brain

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:50.960 align:middle line:90%
is just water?

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELDRAKE: Yes, it's
fluid, cerebrospinal fluid.

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:54.110 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:56.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And it's only
really like the size

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:59.160 align:middle line:84%
of a strip of baloney around
the outside edge of his skull.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:13:59.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: The entire rest of
the interior is all water.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:03.125 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELDRAKE:
Totally astonishing.

00:14:03.125 --> 00:14:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And just a little
spot above the spinal column.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELDRAKE:
Totally astonishing.

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:11.720 align:middle line:84%
A recent case of a Chinese
woman who was found by a brain

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.880 align:middle line:84%
scan to have no
cerebellum, which

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.730 align:middle line:84%
is the part of the brain
responsible for coordinating

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:18.860 align:middle line:90%
movement and action.

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:20.480 align:middle line:84%
She was slightly
abnormal, but had

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:24.420 align:middle line:84%
led a normal, functional
life until they-- well, she

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:25.220 align:middle line:90%
still lives.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:27.350 align:middle line:84%
But they discovered
that she was totally

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:30.200 align:middle line:84%
lacking what is considered an
essential part of the brain

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.210 align:middle line:84%
for coordination of
movement and balance.

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:35.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So how could
this guy get a degree

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:39.620 align:middle line:84%
from Sheffield University in
mathematics, and all he's got

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:44.510 align:middle line:84%
is this little slice
of baloney for a brain?

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:46.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SHELDRAKE: Well, nobody knows.

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:50.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what it tells us is that
standard views, that the brain

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:53.930 align:middle line:84%
is the be all and end all of
consciousness and the mind,

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:54.845 align:middle line:90%
is--

00:14:54.845 --> 00:14:56.990 align:middle line:84%
they're rather
exaggerated, those views,

00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:00.650 align:middle line:84%
that somehow, people can
adapt to having far less brain

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:05.500 align:middle line:84%
tissue than normal and
yet get on perfectly well.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.450 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, you see, it depends
how you think the mind works.

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:11.270 align:middle line:84%
I think the mind works
through a system of fields

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:14.900 align:middle line:84%
that are expressed through
the brain, rather than it all

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:17.000 align:middle line:90%
being just inside the brain.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's still remarkable
that so little brain

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:25.700 align:middle line:84%
can result in somebody
who adapts to it in such

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.280 align:middle line:90%
a way they're fairly normal.

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:29.238 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, when
someone is clinically dead,

00:15:29.238 --> 00:15:30.890 align:middle line:84%
they have cessation
of heartbeat,

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:32.784 align:middle line:84%
they have cessation
of breathing,

00:15:32.784 --> 00:15:34.700 align:middle line:84%
and they have cessation
of electrical activity

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:35.609 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:15:35.609 --> 00:15:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm sure
you're aware, there's

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:39.740 align:middle line:84%
many cases of
near-death experience.

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And people see examples of
things happening in the room,

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.440 align:middle line:84%
but their body is
clinically dead.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.191 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So what do
you think is happening?

00:15:49.191 --> 00:15:50.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELDRAKE: You
see, I think we all

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:53.300 align:middle line:84%
have the experience of
the body which is not

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.210 align:middle line:84%
the same as our normal body,
that is separable from it,

00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:57.590 align:middle line:90%
in our dreams.

00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:59.480 align:middle line:90%
Every night, all of us dream.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:00.950 align:middle line:90%
Most of us forget our dreams.

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:03.484 align:middle line:84%
But when you
remember dreams, then

00:16:03.484 --> 00:16:05.900 align:middle line:84%
what happens in the dreams is
that you're going to places,

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:09.770 align:middle line:84%
you're talking to people, you're
running, walking, dancing,

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:12.479 align:middle line:90%
swimming, sometimes flying.

00:16:12.479 --> 00:16:14.270 align:middle line:84%
You can do all these
things in your dreams.

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:17.120 align:middle line:84%
But clearly, the dream body
that you're doing these with

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.680 align:middle line:84%
is not the same as
the physical body

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.950 align:middle line:90%
which is lying asleep in bed.

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:25.760 align:middle line:84%
So I think all of us have a kind
of parallel body, a dream body.

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And in out-of-the-body
experiences and in near-death

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:33.050 align:middle line:84%
experiences, I think what
happens is people, as it were,

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:36.690 align:middle line:84%
shift into this dream body,
which they've got anyway.

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:37.490 align:middle line:90%
We all have them.

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:38.860 align:middle line:90%
It's not that mysterious.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:42.530 align:middle line:84%
It's something we're familiar
with from our own experience.

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:45.200 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, their
center of consciousness

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.825 align:middle line:84%
moves out of the physical
body, as it does in dreams.

00:16:47.825 --> 00:16:50.630 align:middle line:90%


00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So that's a
very real thing now

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.660 align:middle line:90%
we can tangibly identify.

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:58.350 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the experiments you're
sharing with me suggest like,

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:00.600 align:middle line:84%
for example, that this
soul that we have--

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.140 align:middle line:90%
if you want to call it that--

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:04.399 align:middle line:84%
is moving in conjunction
with our aura.

00:17:04.399 --> 00:17:05.940 align:middle line:84%
But in the case of
phantom limb pain,

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:09.780 align:middle line:84%
you're still feeling from
some other aspect of yourself

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:12.119 align:middle line:84%
that can ultimately
separate from the body

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:15.850 align:middle line:84%
and is not necessarily dependent
on the body for its existence

00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:16.650 align:middle line:90%
per se.

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:17.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:18.599 align:middle line:90%
Well, so it seems.

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:20.149 align:middle line:90%
That's what the data suggest.

00:17:20.149 --> 00:17:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But you
could actually think

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:22.950 align:middle line:90%
with that part of yourself.

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe that part is
intrinsically necessary

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:29.610 align:middle line:84%
to think with, hence John
Lorber with his hydroencephaly

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:36.206 align:middle line:84%
patients, and that you cannot
separate the mind and identify

00:17:36.206 --> 00:17:38.580 align:middle line:84%
it as the brain, because these
people don't have a brain,

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:39.705 align:middle line:90%
and they're still thinking.

00:17:39.705 --> 00:17:41.621 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELDRAKE: They've
still got a bit of brain,

00:17:41.621 --> 00:17:43.470 align:middle line:84%
but they've certainly
got much, much less.

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:43.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Much less.

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:44.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:45.510 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's it.

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:48.330 align:middle line:84%
You see, this is the final
frontier, really, for science,

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:49.590 align:middle line:90%
the consciousness studies.

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And until 20 years
ago, most scientists

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:54.160 align:middle line:90%
simply ignored consciousness.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.260 align:middle line:84%
It was not really
studied at all.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, behaviorism
was the dominant fashion

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.650 align:middle line:84%
in 20th century
psychology in Britain

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:04.890 align:middle line:84%
and the United States, the
idea that all you can do

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:08.400 align:middle line:84%
is measure objective movements
and glandular secretions,

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.580 align:middle line:84%
that subjectivity,
actual experience,

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:14.380 align:middle line:84%
is nonscientific,
because it's subjective.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:17.760 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that's scientific
is objective measurements

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.050 align:middle line:90%
of behavior.

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:21.810 align:middle line:84%
They tried to eliminate the
whole realm of subjectivity

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:23.470 align:middle line:90%
and consciousness.

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:27.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's only recently
that this has become

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:28.710 align:middle line:90%
part of the scientific agenda.

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And we actually know very
little about the nature

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:33.300 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness
and how it works.

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:37.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: This brings me to the
subject of this very bizarre

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:38.460 align:middle line:90%
suppression.

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:42.630 align:middle line:84%
If anybody, in my mind,
can claim credibility

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:44.730 align:middle line:84%
in the field of consciousness
science, it's you.

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:49.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Deepak Chopra has
written some great books.

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And he also certainly
has a lot of credibility.

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:55.690 align:middle line:84%
But you've been doing this way
before he wrote "Ageless Body,

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:58.080 align:middle line:90%
Timeless Mind," since 1981.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:01.650 align:middle line:84%
You've thoroughly
documented your position

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:02.940 align:middle line:90%
with scientific results.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And you're not just aggregating
other scientific data.

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:07.530 align:middle line:90%
You're doing original research.

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:10.680 align:middle line:84%
You're finding highly
statistically abnormal results

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.680 align:middle line:84%
that are consistent
with your hypothesis.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And then you go
and do a TED Talk.

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:22.560 align:middle line:84%
OK, so what did you talk
about that got them so upset?

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.197 align:middle line:90%
They actually tried to ban you?

00:19:24.197 --> 00:19:26.280 align:middle line:84%
They tried to remove your
video from the internet?

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.450 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELDRAKE: They deleted
it from their main website.

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And then they put it in a
naughty corner of the internet,

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:37.230 align:middle line:84%
when a lot of people got very
upset about this censorship.

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:40.650 align:middle line:84%
I was talking about my most
recent book, "Science Set

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Free," which in Britain
is called "The Science

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.480 align:middle line:84%
Delusion," in which
I look at the 10

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:48.060 align:middle line:84%
dogmas of modern science,
the 10 assumptions

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:52.540 align:middle line:84%
that science is based on, which
are not facts, but assumptions.

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.540 align:middle line:84%
One of them is the idea
that the mind is nothing

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:56.010 align:middle line:90%
but the activity of the brain.

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:59.190 align:middle line:90%
It's all inside the head.

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Another one is that the
laws of nature are fixed.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And I would say they're
more like habits.

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:05.730 align:middle line:84%
So I was looking
at these dogmas,

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:09.390 align:middle line:84%
looking at them in the light
of scientific discoveries

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:13.920 align:middle line:84%
by science itself and showing
that these assumptions are not

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:17.200 align:middle line:84%
valid and that if we
abandon these assumptions,

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.840 align:middle line:84%
move on from them--
and they were all

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.590 align:middle line:84%
set down in science between
the 17th and the 19th century.

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:25.050 align:middle line:84%
Science has outgrown
these assumptions,

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:27.960 align:middle line:84%
and yet, it's still locked into
this kind of materialist world

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.070 align:middle line:90%
view--

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:31.590 align:middle line:84%
that science can move
on, and all sorts

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:34.740 align:middle line:84%
of new questions and new
research becomes possible.

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, scientific fundamentalists
don't like this position.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of militant atheists
have linked their atheism

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.920 align:middle line:84%
to a kind of scientific
fundamentalism.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.440 align:middle line:90%
Science isn't a set--

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:49.050 align:middle line:84%
materialism isn't, for
them, a set of assumptions

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:51.400 align:middle line:84%
or a worldview or
a belief system.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.280 align:middle line:90%
It's the truth.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.410 align:middle line:84%
So they think other
people have beliefs,

00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:57.120 align:middle line:90%
but they know the truth.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.710 align:middle line:84%
And some of them were deeply
offended by my TED Talk

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:04.590 align:middle line:84%
and protested to TED that
they'd given a platform to me

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:08.850 align:middle line:84%
for pseudo-science and that I
was accusing some scientists

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:10.360 align:middle line:90%
of being dogmatic.

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.575 align:middle line:90%
And this was so totally untrue.

00:21:12.575 --> 00:21:14.130 align:middle line:90%
And science wasn't dogmatic.

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:17.100 align:middle line:84%
It was totally open-minded
and finding out the truth.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And they got so
angry about me saying

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:23.310 align:middle line:84%
that science was dogmatic,
they insisted on TED

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:26.086 align:middle line:84%
removing this from
their main website.

00:21:26.086 --> 00:21:27.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And they
actually did it.

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:28.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELDRAKE: And
TED actually did it.

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:30.390 align:middle line:84%
They were frightened
by them, because they

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:31.560 align:middle line:90%
thought these people--

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.032 align:middle line:84%
they claimed to speak with
the authority of science.

00:21:34.032 --> 00:21:34.832 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:21:34.832 --> 00:21:36.780 align:middle line:84%
The science delusion
is the belief

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:39.810 align:middle line:84%
that science already understands
the nature of reality

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:44.070 align:middle line:84%
in principle, leaving any of
the details to be filled in.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:47.640 align:middle line:84%
This is a very widespread
belief in our society.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.440 align:middle line:84%
It's the kind of belief
system of people who say,

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe in God,
I believe in science.

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:56.270 align:middle line:84%
It's a belief system
which has now been

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:57.515 align:middle line:90%
spread to the entire world.

to be ideas worth sharing.

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:04.160 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that their logline?

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:04.993 align:middle line:90%
>>SHELDRAKE: Mm-hmm.

00:22:04.993 --> 00:22:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now, in
a modern society,

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.850 align:middle line:84%
with open information
available online,

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:14.290 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't people be allowed
to make up their own minds

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:15.930 align:middle line:84%
and survey the
evidence for themselves

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:17.580 align:middle line:90%
and decide what is true?

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:19.710 align:middle line:84%
TED's going to guard
the gate and not

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:22.830 align:middle line:84%
even allow people to consider
that what you're saying

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:23.917 align:middle line:90%
is true?

00:22:23.917 --> 00:22:26.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELDRAKE: Most people have
been bullied by people who

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:28.080 align:middle line:84%
claim to speak in
the name of science,

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.870 align:middle line:84%
who pull rank on them and
say, we know, and you don't.

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:33.970 align:middle line:84%
I think they were
bullied into doing this.

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:35.910 align:middle line:90%
And it was a major mistake.

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:40.090 align:middle line:84%
It has done great
damage to their brand.

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:42.080 align:middle line:90%
I think they recognize that now.

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And it
ended up actually

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.620 align:middle line:84%
causing the video to be seen
by many more people, right?

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:48.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELDRAKE: Exactly, because
Graham Hancock, whose talk was

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:52.800 align:middle line:84%
also banned, told people they're
about to ban it, lots of people

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:55.470 align:middle line:84%
put it up on websites
all over the internet.

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:59.420 align:middle line:84%
When my TEDx talk was taken
down from their main site,

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:01.470 align:middle line:90%
it had 35,000 views.

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:04.540 align:middle line:84%
It's now had well over
a million worldwide.

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And so in effect, this
is actually a good thing.

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:12.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they actually
helped get the message out.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think one has to see
that in any process of paradigm

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:20.190 align:middle line:84%
change, arguments and
controversy is inevitable.

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:24.900 align:middle line:84%
You can't change the paradigm
without people seeing

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.190 align:middle line:90%
how the arguments played out.

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And in the case
of TED, the people

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:32.810 align:middle line:84%
who were defending standard
scientific materialism

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:36.000 align:middle line:84%
put up extraordinarily
weak arguments.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they were basically
appealing to authority,

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:43.780 align:middle line:84%
their authority, and
indulging in verbal abuse,

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:46.770 align:middle line:84%
ad hominem attacks on me
and on Graham Hancock.

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: You now have your own--

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:51.030 align:middle line:84%
or you're part of a
whistleblower site

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:53.880 align:middle line:84%
that actually
investigates skeptics.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.940 align:middle line:90%
Talk to me about that.

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:58.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELDRAKE: I
helped set up a site

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:02.580 align:middle line:84%
10 years ago called
skepticalinvestigations.org,

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:04.360 align:middle line:90%
which investigates skeptics.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:08.790 align:middle line:10%
And we've now updated it to
a new site, Skeptical About

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:10.050 align:middle line:10%
Skeptics.

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:16.200 align:middle line:10%
And this builds up dossiers
on individual media skeptics

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.420 align:middle line:10%
and also organized skepticism.

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:20.160 align:middle line:84%
Because most people
don't realize

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.080 align:middle line:84%
there are
organizations whose job

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:26.100 align:middle line:84%
it is to try and debunk
what they call claims

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:27.750 align:middle line:84%
of the paranormal,
anything to do

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:31.530 align:middle line:84%
with parapsychology, alternative
medicine, many aspects

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:34.530 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness studies,
near-death experiences.

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:36.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Whole organizations
dedicated to this.

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:36.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:38.448 align:middle line:84%
One of them is
called The Committee

00:24:38.448 --> 00:24:41.100 align:middle line:90%
for Skeptical Inquiry.

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And it publishes a magazine
called the Skeptical Inquirer.

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:46.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And you said
you sent somebody in

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:49.170 align:middle line:84%
to infiltrate one of
these conferences.

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:50.070 align:middle line:90%
What did they see?

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:51.528 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELDRAKE: Well,
they went to one

00:24:51.528 --> 00:24:53.670 align:middle line:90%
of these big skeptic congresses.

00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Basically, a lot of people
who are rather angry,

00:24:55.830 --> 00:25:01.440 align:middle line:84%
who want to have certainty, who
want to suppress what they see

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:05.250 align:middle line:84%
as superstition and
pseudoscience, basically,

00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:08.250 align:middle line:84%
scientific reactionaries
who are clinging on

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:10.770 align:middle line:84%
to an outmoded worldview
because it gives them

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:12.600 align:middle line:90%
a sense of security.

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And they're setting up
organizations with chapters.

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:19.140 align:middle line:84%
One of the workshops they had
at one of these meetings in Las

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:21.900 align:middle line:84%
Vegas called the
Amazing Meeting--

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:26.000 align:middle line:84%
it was promoted by the Randi
organization, James Randi.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.920 align:middle line:84%
A workshop led by him
and Michael Shermer,

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:33.120 align:middle line:84%
editor of the
Skeptic magazine, was

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.010 align:middle line:90%
"How to be a Media Skeptic."

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And they train
people how to do it.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: "How To Be
a Media Skeptic."

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:39.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And the advertisement
for the workshop

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:45.570 align:middle line:84%
said, "Be the guy the
media call the next time

00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:47.770 align:middle line:90%
a charlatan shows up in town."

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:48.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:51.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELDRAKE: And what they
have is trained people.

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And then it says, you
don't have to have

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:57.150 align:middle line:84%
any particular
qualifications to do this.

00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:59.920 align:middle line:84%
Just behave as if you've
got the authority.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:00.720 align:middle line:90%
And then it says--

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:01.553 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, my god.

00:26:01.553 --> 00:26:04.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELDRAKE: And then it says,
found a local skeptics society.

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.170 align:middle line:84%
It said, if necessary, you can
be the president, the chairman,

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:09.510 align:middle line:90%
and the secretary yourself.

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:12.500 align:middle line:84%
So you create an organization
that looks credible.

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:15.720 align:middle line:84%
You then, every time
someone shows up

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:18.020 align:middle line:84%
who's promoting alternative
medicine, parapsychology,

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:20.340 align:middle line:84%
or anything like
that, the media like

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:24.450 align:middle line:84%
having someone they can ring
up, your number in their files

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:27.570 align:middle line:84%
that they can just call
for the alternative view.

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:29.100 align:middle line:90%
And you're the guy they call.

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And then you just say,
this guy is a charlatan.

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.060 align:middle line:90%
The stuff's been discredited.

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:35.640 align:middle line:84%
It's not scientifically
credible, etc.

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Did they teach them
to target the personal attacks

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:41.170 align:middle line:90%
instead of the actual data?

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:41.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:43.850 align:middle line:84%
It's largely by
focusing on people

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:47.370 align:middle line:84%
and saying they're
charlatans, or just saying

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:49.620 align:middle line:90%
their data has been discredited.

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:51.150 align:middle line:90%
They don't go into detail.

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:53.950 align:middle line:84%
Most of them know nothing
about the details.

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:57.570 align:middle line:84%
So we're not dealing
here with just people

00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:00.620 align:middle line:84%
using normal skeptical
commonsense skepticism.

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:02.840 align:middle line:84%
We're dealing with an
ideologically motivated

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:07.130 align:middle line:84%
campaign that is well organized,
that has local chapters, that

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:10.670 align:middle line:84%
has national organizations,
international organizations,

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:16.250 align:middle line:84%
and whose agenda is to
roll back the alternative

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:18.740 align:middle line:84%
and complementary medicine,
integrative medicine,

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:23.210 align:middle line:84%
holistic science,
parapsychology, consciousness

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:27.260 align:middle line:84%
studies in the name of an
extreme form of materialism,

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:30.620 align:middle line:90%
a dogmatic materialism.

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:32.690 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just
individual opinions.

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:35.420 align:middle line:84%
We're dealing with
organized efforts here.

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's what in our website,
Skeptical About Skeptics,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.790 align:middle line:84%
we're informing people about
and documenting the activities

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:45.426 align:middle line:90%
of these media skeptics.

00:27:45.426 --> 00:27:47.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So what do you
have coming up ahead?

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:48.950 align:middle line:84%
What's your next
big thing people

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:51.560 align:middle line:84%
can be looking out for so
that you continue this battle

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:55.430 align:middle line:84%
and fight the good fight
to educate humanity?

00:27:55.430 --> 00:28:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELDRAKE: Well, I'm
part of a group that met,

00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:05.250 align:middle line:84%
a group of scientists
that met in February 2014

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:09.050 align:middle line:84%
in Tucson, Arizona called
the Postmaterialist Summit.

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And what we're doing
is trying to move

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:13.520 align:middle line:84%
towards a
post-materialist science,

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.310 align:middle line:84%
so we can have science
that's still science.

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:19.010 align:middle line:84%
I and my colleagues are
all very pro-science.

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:20.720 align:middle line:84%
But we think science
should be liberated

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:24.335 align:middle line:84%
from this dogmatic
constraint of materialism.

00:28:24.335 --> 00:28:26.960 align:middle line:84%
We think it would be better and
more productive, more exciting,

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.860 align:middle line:90%
more interesting.

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And we're launching a website
called opensciences.org,

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:37.970 align:middle line:84%
which is a portal for the more
open-minded research going

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:39.545 align:middle line:90%
on in the sciences today.

00:28:39.545 --> 00:28:41.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I'll have
to check that out.

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:43.441 align:middle line:84%
So the books that
you're working on,

00:28:43.441 --> 00:28:44.690 align:middle line:90%
do you have a book coming out?

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Or what are you
doing in that front?

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:49.970 align:middle line:10%
>>SHELDRAKE: Well, the main
book I'm still working on

00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:53.090 align:middle line:10%
at the moment is my "Science Set
Free," "The Science Delusion,"

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:56.115 align:middle line:10%
in the sense that I'm
following up the kinds of ideas

00:28:56.115 --> 00:28:56.915 align:middle line:10%
that are there.

00:28:56.915 --> 00:28:59.330 align:middle line:10%
But I have a book coming
out with Matthew Fox,

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:04.040 align:middle line:10%
the theologian, called
"The Physics of Angels."

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is a whole big topic
we don't have time to get into.

00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:10.880 align:middle line:84%
But what we're doing is looking
at the idea of consciousness

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.540 align:middle line:90%
beyond the human level.

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:15.350 align:middle line:84%
In all traditional
societies, people

00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:17.750 align:middle line:84%
thought there were many
levels of consciousness

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:20.720 align:middle line:90%
beyond the human level.

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.640 align:middle line:84%
In the Middle Ages, they
thought, for example,

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:26.180 align:middle line:84%
that each star had a
mind or an intelligence,

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:28.620 align:middle line:84%
which they called the
angel of that star.

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And so the star
was like the body,

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:34.135 align:middle line:84%
and the angel was the mind
or intelligence of that star.

00:29:34.135 --> 00:29:35.510 align:middle line:84%
So what we do in
the book is look

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:38.600 align:middle line:84%
at traditional Western ideas
on angels, which were not,

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.150 align:middle line:84%
of course, of men
with colored wings.

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:44.210 align:middle line:84%
They were the idea of
cosmic intelligences

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:47.000 align:middle line:84%
and ordering spirits
of the cosmos that

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.670 align:middle line:84%
underlay the phenomena
of nature as the guiding

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:52.460 align:middle line:90%
intelligence of them.

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And these very
sophisticated views

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:59.780 align:middle line:84%
of angels in writers like
Dionysus the Areopagite, who

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:03.680 align:middle line:84%
was eighth century Syrian
monk, and Saint Thomas

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.420 align:middle line:84%
Aquinas in the 13th
century, and Hildegard

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:10.310 align:middle line:84%
of Bingen, a great
medieval abbess in Germany.

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:13.510 align:middle line:84%
All of them had extraordinarily
interesting views.

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:17.240 align:middle line:10%
So Matthew Fox and I take these
traditional Western teachings

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.170 align:middle line:10%
on angels.

00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:20.420 align:middle line:10%
We do an anthology
of the main texts,

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:23.930 align:middle line:10%
and we discuss them to
see their meaning today.

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:26.540 align:middle line:10%
And if you believe, as I do,
that the universe is full

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:29.090 align:middle line:10%
of many forms of
consciousness or intelligence,

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:32.990 align:middle line:10%
not just an inanimate,
unconscious universe with minds

00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:35.090 align:middle line:10%
existing only
inside human skulls

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:38.300 align:middle line:10%
and maybe the minds of a
few other higher animals,

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:41.690 align:middle line:10%
but a universe that is full of
intelligence and consciousness,

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:44.990 align:middle line:10%
then these traditional ways
of thinking about forms

00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:48.320 align:middle line:10%
of intelligence beyond
our own, and yet, not

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:51.560 align:middle line:10%
in the consciousness of god,
the intermediate between humans

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:55.109 align:middle line:10%
and god, many, many
levels of consciousness,

00:30:55.109 --> 00:30:57.650 align:middle line:10%
that's what we explore in this
book, "The Physics of Angels."

00:30:57.650 --> 00:30:59.576 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Wow, that
sounds fascinating.

00:30:59.576 --> 00:31:00.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, Rupert, I
want to thank you

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:02.994 align:middle line:90%
so much for being on my show.

00:31:02.994 --> 00:31:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And I want to commend
you for your heroic work

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:07.040 align:middle line:84%
to help humanity in
the face of danger.

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:09.492 align:middle line:84%
And I really appreciate all
that you've done for us.

00:31:09.492 --> 00:31:10.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SHELDRAKE: Well, thank you.

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Thank you.

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:16.020 align:middle line:84%
I was very encouraged to hear
Rupert Sheldrake say that he's

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:19.380 align:middle line:84%
doing a book with a
theologian named Matthew Fox

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:23.070 align:middle line:84%
called "The Physics of
Angels" because this

00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:26.370 align:middle line:84%
is something where I
feel as if he is starting

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:30.360 align:middle line:84%
to veer into a direction that
I've been going for a long time

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:33.210 align:middle line:84%
after I read this book called
"The Law of One" series,

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:35.490 align:middle line:84%
actually a series
of five books, that

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:37.950 align:middle line:84%
were allegedly channeled
from extraterrestrials

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:40.300 align:middle line:90%
all the way back in 1981.

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:41.100 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:43.020 align:middle line:84%
If we have morphic
resonance, if we

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:47.020 align:middle line:84%
have very obvious signs
of telepathy going on,

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:50.430 align:middle line:84%
such as the multiples effect,
where different people are

00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:53.310 align:middle line:84%
learning the same
things at the same time,

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:56.510 align:middle line:84%
why couldn't there be
nonphysical intelligence

00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:57.540 align:middle line:90%
as well?

00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:00.000 align:middle line:84%
If people can live
without having a brain,

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.310 align:middle line:84%
that suggests that
the cognitive process

00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:06.030 align:middle line:84%
itself may be happening
in the energy body.

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:08.804 align:middle line:84%
Now, you notice I was trying
to kind of shepherd Rupert

00:32:08.804 --> 00:32:09.970 align:middle line:90%
Sheldrake in that direction.

00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:11.730 align:middle line:90%
He didn't quite bite.

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:14.370 align:middle line:84%
But I believe, actually,
that the brain is really

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:18.030 align:middle line:84%
just an antenna, and that almost
the entire cognitive process--

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:21.420 align:middle line:84%
at least the intellect and
the thinking, rational mind,

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:22.980 align:middle line:84%
not so much the
physical things like

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:26.130 align:middle line:84%
keeping your heart beating,
but the thinking mind

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:27.820 align:middle line:90%
is all energetic.

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:30.210 align:middle line:84%
It's all happening in
an energetic field,

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:33.540 align:middle line:84%
and your brain and your DNA is
just a tuning fork for that.

00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:35.340 align:middle line:84%
So if that's true,
then why couldn't there

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:37.759 align:middle line:84%
be other energetic
beings out there,

00:32:37.759 --> 00:32:40.050 align:middle line:84%
like people who've been
through a near-death experience

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:43.802 align:middle line:84%
and actually died, who
can then speak to us?

00:32:43.802 --> 00:32:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And if that's true,
could there will also

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:48.060 align:middle line:84%
be beings of higher
intelligence, i.e.

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:51.910 align:middle line:84%
Angels, who are giving
us even more information?

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:54.960 align:middle line:84%
So this is really valuable,
because we're seeing science

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.120 align:middle line:90%
and spirituality come together.

00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:00.270 align:middle line:84%
The ancients took this for
granted because in the past,

00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:02.550 align:middle line:84%
apparently, the
angels, in some cases,

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:06.090 align:middle line:84%
were allowed to manifest here
and be luminous beings of light

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:08.730 align:middle line:84%
who could levitate
and could send images

00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:11.040 align:middle line:90%
and thoughts into your mind.

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.450 align:middle line:90%
And that's all gone away.

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:14.490 align:middle line:90%
But it may be coming back.

00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:18.330 align:middle line:84%
So I hope you're enjoying
this, Disclosure in action.

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:22.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, David Wilcock,
speaking truth to power

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:24.060 align:middle line:90%
and giving power to the truth.

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:26.810 align:middle line:90%
