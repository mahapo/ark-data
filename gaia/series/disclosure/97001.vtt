00:00:16.142 --> 00:00:17.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID WILCOCK:
I'm David Wilcock,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.760 align:middle line:90%
and welcome to "Disclosure."

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.480 align:middle line:10%
I've got a nice safe place
here where we can talk.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.550 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to be telling you
some very interesting stuff

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.700 align:middle line:10%
through the guise of
this interview with one

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.650 align:middle line:10%
of the real amazing, pioneering
truth-seekers in our field,

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.540 align:middle line:10%
none other than Andrew
Collins, a legend who

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.020 align:middle line:10%
has written many books and is
really breaking new ground.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, it should be
obvious to you,

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.900 align:middle line:84%
if you have spent time
looking into the truth arena,

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.640 align:middle line:84%
that the American
government has had

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.630 align:middle line:84%
its financial system outsourced
to the Federal Reserve, which

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.270 align:middle line:84%
is actually a private
consortium of bankers.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.230 align:middle line:84%
We have weird Egyptian symbolism
on the United States dollar

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.150 align:middle line:84%
with the pyramid that has the
eye on top, the all-seeing eye,

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.580 align:middle line:84%
clearly suggesting that there
is some sort of fascination

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.680 align:middle line:84%
with ancient mystery traditions
and ancient civilizations,

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.560 align:middle line:84%
specifically Egypt, on
behalf of the people

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.380 align:middle line:90%
who are printing our money.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.470 align:middle line:90%
Well, how far does this go?

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.420 align:middle line:84%
In some of my episodes on
"Wisdom Teachings" that I talk

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.150 align:middle line:84%
about "Disclosure" in,
I've gone into great detail

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.430 align:middle line:84%
about the so-called
Illuminati and how

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.600 align:middle line:84%
they are advertising essentially
Luciferian symbolism out there.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.260 align:middle line:90%
But where does this come from?

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.130 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that the most
powerful people on Earth

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.880 align:middle line:84%
do have some sort
of secret cult that

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.640 align:middle line:84%
relates back to
ancient traditions

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.410 align:middle line:90%
and ancient civilizations?

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, we start really drilling
into this in this interview

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.130 align:middle line:90%
with Andrew Collins.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.755 align:middle line:84%
And it isn't until
the second interview

00:01:52.755 --> 00:01:54.470 align:middle line:84%
that's coming up
later in our series

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.260 align:middle line:84%
that I really hit him with
some directly confrontational

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.210 align:middle line:90%
questions.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.590 align:middle line:84%
But bear in mind that based on
insiders who I've spoken to,

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.900 align:middle line:84%
the so-called Illuminati
do trace themselves back

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.580 align:middle line:84%
as the descendants of apparent
extraterrestrial beings who

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.700 align:middle line:84%
came here to Earth calling
themselves the Watchers.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.520 align:middle line:84%
And these Watchers
and their stories

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.410 align:middle line:84%
are preserved in an ancient
apocryphal gospel that

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.500 align:middle line:84%
was not included
in the Bible but is

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.460 align:middle line:84%
as old as the Book of Genesis
known as the Book of Enoch.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.480 align:middle line:84%
So there's some very
fascinating stuff here,

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.060 align:middle line:84%
because as we drill into
the story the Watchers,

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.250 align:middle line:84%
we're actually
drilling into what

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.680 align:middle line:84%
the most powerful
people on Earth

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.210 align:middle line:84%
believe themselves to
be the descendants of.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.140 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
very interesting things

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.590 align:middle line:84%
to explore coming up in this
interview with Andrew Collins.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.480 align:middle line:84%
I do rough him up a little bit
at the beginning just for fun.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.530 align:middle line:90%
He's an English guy.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.280 align:middle line:90%
He can handle it.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.980 align:middle line:90%
He's got a wry sense of humor.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.430 align:middle line:90%
So check it out and have fun.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.997 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:02:53.997 --> 00:02:55.080 align:middle line:90%
All right, Andrew Collins.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.210 align:middle line:90%
It's great to have you here.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.670 align:middle line:84%
You are a true
legend in this field.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.675 align:middle line:84%
You probably generated
so many tin-foil hats

00:03:01.675 --> 00:03:03.966 align:middle line:84%
that you could have your own
spot in the periodic table

00:03:03.966 --> 00:03:04.710 align:middle line:90%
of the elements.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.321 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW COLLINS: That's
very kind of you to say so.

00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Look, you've been
doing this for a long time.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.870 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And you're one of the
names that has just been around

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.530 align:middle line:90%
forever.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:14.460 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Thank you.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You've investigated
so many different fascinating

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.930 align:middle line:84%
subjects that are out-of-the-box
thinking, that break barriers,

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.170 align:middle line:84%
that are redefining what we
think we know in light of new

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.480 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.430 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel that the
nature of science

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.760 align:middle line:84%
is to follow the
trail of evidence?

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.370 align:middle line:10%
>>COLLINS: I think science
itself is something which only

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.540 align:middle line:10%
really gets the full picture
after people like ourselves

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.620 align:middle line:10%
investigate it, put it out into
the collective consciousness.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And then it's picked up in a way
which is probably transformed

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.330 align:middle line:84%
into something that's
more academic, scholarly,

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.140 align:middle line:84%
and very often, you won't
even get credit for it.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.660 align:middle line:84%
But I see that that is
the way that it works.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.150 align:middle line:84%
It's been doing that for
hundreds of years, maybe even

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.900 align:middle line:90%
thousands.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think that there is almost
like a tier of progress with it

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.980 align:middle line:90%
and that I'm somewhere there.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.292 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a scholar.

00:04:14.292 --> 00:04:15.125 align:middle line:90%
I'm not an academic.

00:04:15.125 --> 00:04:16.279 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't claim to be.

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:18.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm certainly not a scientist.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my background is
journalism, and I'm a writer.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.410 align:middle line:84%
I get my ideas
out through books.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And whoever takes
them up takes them up.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.430 align:middle line:84%
If that's an academic,
that's great.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.870 align:middle line:84%
If it's just the general public
taking it on, well, brilliant.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.500 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I've done my part.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.300 align:middle line:84%
I think that's about as
far as I can take it.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But as far as
what you are writing

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.070 align:middle line:84%
about as a journalist,
you're covering

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.950 align:middle line:84%
things that are being done by
scientists that are breaking

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:46.957 align:middle line:90%
new ground in science.

00:04:46.957 --> 00:04:47.790 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: They are.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.070 align:middle line:84%
But because I'm not a
scholar or an academic,

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.415 align:middle line:90%
I can say what I like.

00:04:52.415 --> 00:04:53.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.125 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: And
people like myself

00:04:55.125 --> 00:04:59.640 align:middle line:84%
or Graham Hancock can
seize these things

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.660 align:middle line:90%
and say exactly what's going on.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.010 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to worry
about peer review.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.290 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to worry about
how the academic world is going

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.830 align:middle line:84%
to react or accept what we
say because that's exactly

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.240 align:middle line:84%
the way of journalism,
true journalism, is about.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.560 align:middle line:84%
You print the truth, and people
either like it or they don't.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, with the
number of books I've done,

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.602 align:middle line:84%
the reaction has been horrendous
from the point of view

00:05:27.602 --> 00:05:28.810 align:middle line:90%
of the scholars and whatever.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And then you suddenly
find that they themselves

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.290 align:middle line:84%
have taken on bolder ideas
and are running with them

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.750 align:middle line:84%
in ways which people
who see it, who

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.470 align:middle line:84%
know that you've written about
these subjects, can't believe.

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like the discovery
of a huge, great cave system

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.200 align:middle line:90%
beneath the pyramids of Giza--

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:57.440 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: --which I achieved
with colleagues in 2008.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.360 align:middle line:84%
Once this had occurred and
been in the caves four times,

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.390 align:middle line:84%
I had to bring it to the
notice of the authorities.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.550 align:middle line:84%
I went to see the guy
in charge of the Supreme

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.500 align:middle line:84%
Council of Antiquities in
Egypt, Dr. Zahi Hawass,

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.880 align:middle line:90%
and sat down with him.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.350 align:middle line:84%
And he denied that
these caves existed,

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:20.450 align:middle line:84%
even though I was giving
him photographs to show him,

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:21.970 align:middle line:84%
and saying, look,
we know everything

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.585 align:middle line:90%
about the Giza Plateau.

00:06:23.585 --> 00:06:24.900 align:middle line:90%
You can't make discoveries.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.540 align:middle line:84%
Only we can, and
we know everything.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.790 align:middle line:90%
And there's no caves there.

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:33.780 align:middle line:84%
Within six months,
he was recording

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.370 align:middle line:84%
a series called "Chasing
Mummies," where he was actually

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.085 align:middle line:84%
inside those caves saying it's
the most incredible experience

00:06:40.085 --> 00:06:42.220 align:middle line:90%
he'd ever had at Giza.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.230 align:middle line:90%
This is massive.

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.680 align:middle line:84%
This is a whole
cave complex that

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.340 align:middle line:84%
actually flows all the
way beneath the Plateau

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.860 align:middle line:84%
and probably goes beneath
the second pyramid, which

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.020 align:middle line:84%
is the highest point
on the Plateau.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason, nobody
knew that it was there.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's within the shadow
of the Great Pyramid,

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:07.290 align:middle line:84%
and nobody had recognized
the fact it was there.

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And this was five
years of research,

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.361 align:middle line:84%
trying to pin down the
exact location going

00:07:14.361 --> 00:07:17.950 align:middle line:84%
from old journals and accounts
that were nearly 200 years old

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:22.760 align:middle line:84%
and realizing that a few
explorers had actually managed

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.510 align:middle line:84%
to find the entrance into this
cave system in the early part

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.850 align:middle line:90%
of the 19th century.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.325 align:middle line:90%
And then suddenly nothing.

00:07:29.325 --> 00:07:30.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Are you
saying these are

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.650 align:middle line:84%
the results of natural
underwater aquifers,

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:34.864 align:middle line:84%
or is it more of
carved passageways?

00:07:34.864 --> 00:07:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Well,
they're certainly

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.830 align:middle line:84%
natural in origin, almost
certainly carved out

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:45.530 align:middle line:84%
by water at a very great age,
perhaps tens of thousands,

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:48.710 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of thousands,
maybe millions of years ago.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:53.900 align:middle line:84%
However, they would seem to have
been enhanced by human hands.

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:58.570 align:middle line:84%
There are certain sort
of very primitive marks,

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:02.410 align:middle line:84%
symbolic forms,
within them, which

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:04.340 align:middle line:90%
clearly shows the human action.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.800 align:middle line:84%
Also, certainly the
early part of them

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.615 align:middle line:84%
would seem to have been used
as some kind of necropolis

00:08:10.615 --> 00:08:13.640 align:middle line:90%
for birds.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.010 align:middle line:84%
There was obviously some
kind of god form or goddess

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:21.500 align:middle line:84%
form associated with the
entrance area, which is now

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.280 align:middle line:90%
known as the Tomb of the Birds.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And evidence has
been found there

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.290 align:middle line:90%
of the internment of birds.

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:33.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this was reported
back in the mid-19th century.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:37.309 align:middle line:84%
One report actually talks about
finding these bird mummies

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:38.950 align:middle line:90%
and things and removing them.

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.909 align:middle line:84%
And that, along with
the other journal

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:45.790 align:middle line:84%
accounts from the early
part of the 19th century,

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.760 align:middle line:84%
made us realize that there was
something there that everybody

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.190 align:middle line:84%
else had missed and
was certainly not

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:54.990 align:middle line:84%
to be found in any academic
paper or book or anything that

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.790 align:middle line:84%
had been written
by anybody before.

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
that five-year search,

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:04.210 align:middle line:84%
we found the entrance into the
cave system and explored it.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was full
of bats, by the way.

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:09.380 align:middle line:90%
And it's a start.

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.150 align:middle line:84%
We explored it to
a certain distance.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.260 align:middle line:90%
We know they got further.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's very possible
that the stories

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:21.880 align:middle line:84%
of the existence of these caves
almost certainly influenced

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.460 align:middle line:84%
the fact that the pyramids
were actually constructed

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.120 align:middle line:90%
where they were on the Plateau.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.800 align:middle line:84%
Because the ancient
name of Giza is

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.640 align:middle line:84%
Rostau, which means,
basically, the entrance

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.810 align:middle line:84%
into underground
chambers or caves

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:39.030 align:middle line:84%
or something, which
suggests that there

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:41.790 align:middle line:84%
was a connection between
the actual placement

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:47.605 align:middle line:84%
of the whole pyramid field there
and the existence of the caves.

00:09:47.605 --> 00:09:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And that the caves were seen
as like some kind of entrance

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:55.350 align:middle line:84%
into the so-called Duat, the
otherworldly or underworld

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:58.570 align:middle line:84%
environment that the
ancient Egyptians believed

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:01.560 align:middle line:84%
that the soul had
to pass through

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:07.150 align:middle line:84%
before it could rise up into
the afterlife amongst the stars.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And that this was like a
symbolic representation

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.300 align:middle line:90%
of the Duat.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So then Zahi Hawass
ends up doing documentaries

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.080 align:middle line:84%
on this and never
gave you guys credit

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.460 align:middle line:90%
for having rediscovered them.

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Not really,
although he did start

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:23.965 align:middle line:84%
calling them Collins' Caves,
which is a title which stuck.

00:10:23.965 --> 00:10:25.300 align:middle line:90%
So I like the idea.

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:29.670 align:middle line:84%
But he inadvertently named
them after myself anyway,

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:34.440 align:middle line:84%
so that was some kind of credit
for having discovered them.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:39.910 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, I'm not worried
because Zahi Hawass,

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:44.250 align:middle line:84%
he was the boss of the Supreme
Council of Antiquities.

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:47.300 align:middle line:84%
It was his job to deny
that they existed.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And when I actually went to
interview him to give him

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:54.747 align:middle line:84%
this information, and
he was denying it,

00:10:54.747 --> 00:10:55.705 align:middle line:90%
it was almost farcical.

00:10:55.705 --> 00:10:56.860 align:middle line:90%
It was like a joke.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And at one point, it
almost looked as if there

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.380 align:middle line:90%
was a smile on his face.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And one of my
colleagues was there

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:06.530 align:middle line:84%
that just burst into
laughter because they

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:07.840 align:middle line:90%
thought it was a joke.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.320 align:middle line:90%
And in a way, it is a joke.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think that, at that
point, I got the joke.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And the joke is that
he had to say this,

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:20.660 align:middle line:84%
because there is no way that
amateurs like myself could

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.370 align:middle line:90%
make those type of discoveries.

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:24.650 align:middle line:90%
This is the problem.

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:26.440 align:middle line:84%
People like me, in
theory, should not

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.565 align:middle line:90%
make discoveries like this.

00:11:27.565 --> 00:11:29.606 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It's like the
Wright brothers cooking up

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:30.896 align:middle line:90%
the airplane in the garage.

00:11:30.896 --> 00:11:32.270 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: But I
understand this,

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:34.530 align:middle line:84%
and I haven't got
a problem with it.

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:39.360 align:middle line:84%
But although I am very glad
that a film crew actually filmed

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.070 align:middle line:84%
Zahi Hawass going into these
caves for the first time

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:45.250 align:middle line:84%
and experience them
for the first time

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:48.260 align:middle line:84%
and to record his
reaction to going in them.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:49.570 align:middle line:90%
And this was live.

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:51.730 align:middle line:90%
This was not edited in theory.

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:56.764 align:middle line:84%
And so it's good that
once he was inside them,

00:11:56.764 --> 00:12:02.065 align:middle line:84%
he saw how marvelous these were
and how incredible a discovery

00:12:02.065 --> 00:12:03.200 align:middle line:90%
it actually was.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.370 align:middle line:84%
So it was almost like
I was vindicated.

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:08.004 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very happy
with that really.

00:12:08.004 --> 00:12:08.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: That's great.

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.205 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: And so this
is the sort of area,

00:12:11.205 --> 00:12:14.300 align:middle line:84%
this is the type of
work which I like.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And I put it out there, and
if I get credit for it, great.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.100 align:middle line:84%
If I don't, well, I
understand the system.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:24.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So for people
who are entrenched

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:27.650 align:middle line:84%
in mainstream ideology,
mainstream beliefs,

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:31.920 align:middle line:84%
they have bought
this belief that all

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:36.230 align:middle line:84%
of Egyptian civilization starts
in the conventionally-accepted

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:37.820 align:middle line:90%
archaeological terms.

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Now we have Gobekli Tepe,
and you have written

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.970 align:middle line:90%
an incredible book on that.

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:45.650 align:middle line:84%
It just seems like
you keep leapfrogging

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:48.700 align:middle line:84%
and going beyond what
you already had done.

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:53.490 align:middle line:84%
How does Gobekli Tepe-- first
of all, what is Gobekli Tepe?

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:56.180 align:middle line:10%
And how have those
discoveries helped

00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:01.230 align:middle line:10%
to add potential weight
to the academic argument

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:03.970 align:middle line:10%
that Egypt could be a
lot older of a culture

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:07.110 align:middle line:10%
than we have now ascribed
its significance to be?

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:10.470 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Well,
in the early 1990s,

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:13.990 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Robert Schoch
of Boston University

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:19.120 align:middle line:84%
looked at the weathering of
the Sphinx monument, which

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.940 align:middle line:84%
sits on the eastern edge
of the Giza Plateau,

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.170 align:middle line:84%
and also the enclosure
walls around it

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:30.870 align:middle line:84%
and realized that the weathering
could not have been done

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:34.140 align:middle line:84%
by wind erosion, as had
been popularly believed up

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:35.840 align:middle line:90%
to that point by Egyptologists.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:41.060 align:middle line:84%
But almost certainly had been
caused by water, precipitation,

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:41.560 align:middle line:90%
i.e.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:46.010 align:middle line:84%
rain, coming down,
running along the Plateau,

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:48.380 align:middle line:84%
and going into the
enclosures and over the body

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:49.031 align:middle line:90%
of the Sphinx.

00:13:49.031 --> 00:13:51.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Yeah, you have these
smooth, sensuous curves.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.196 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Absolutely.

00:13:52.196 --> 00:13:53.400 align:middle line:90%
And I mean, it's obvious.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.435 align:middle line:84%
If you look at it, it
looks like rain weathering

00:13:56.435 --> 00:13:57.310 align:middle line:90%
and water weathering.

00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:59.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And yet
yesterday, I looked up

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:02.110 align:middle line:84%
on Wikipedia Orion
correlation theory, which

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:04.670 align:middle line:84%
is the belief that the
belt stars of Orion

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:08.440 align:middle line:84%
correspond to the Giza Plateau
and the three pyramids.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And it says right on Wikipedia,
as if it's totally credible,

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.180 align:middle line:84%
that that theory
of water weathering

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:17.140 align:middle line:84%
has been widely debunked
and that it obviously

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.870 align:middle line:84%
is the result of
things like the wind.

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:21.090 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Well, absolutely.

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:26.830 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, the problem there
is that Wikipedia is essentially

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:30.230 align:middle line:84%
controlled by people
who wish to remain

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:33.100 align:middle line:84%
within the orthodoxy of
the conventional thinking

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:37.910 align:middle line:84%
and that any new ideas and
ideologies that are generally

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:40.155 align:middle line:84%
put within it are
removed very quickly.

00:14:40.155 --> 00:14:43.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this happens on many
different subjects and areas

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:44.570 align:middle line:90%
of science.

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:46.990 align:middle line:84%
There's almost like
a sort of cabal,

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:50.620 align:middle line:84%
if you like, that is forever
watching certain pages

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:56.680 align:middle line:84%
on Wikipedia and removing
anything that they don't like,

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.510 align:middle line:84%
not because it's
wrong, but because they

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:01.900 align:middle line:84%
don't like it because it's
against their own paradigm

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:02.710 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:07.390 align:middle line:84%
But coming back to the ideas
of the civilization being

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:15.270 align:middle line:84%
much older than what we
knew is that Dr. Schoch

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:18.980 align:middle line:84%
tried to estimate when
that amount of rain

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:23.610 align:middle line:84%
would have fallen in
the area of the Nile.

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And he went back,
maybe, 5,000, 6.000 BC.

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Other assessments would
suggest that it goes back

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:35.147 align:middle line:90%
to as early as 10,500 BC.

00:15:35.147 --> 00:15:36.980 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
speculation about that.

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:40.035 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's no actual date
that we can sort of pull out

00:15:40.035 --> 00:15:41.200 align:middle line:90%
of an envelope and say.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.450 align:middle line:90%
But it's certainly older.

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:44.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm pretty certain of that.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:50.200 align:middle line:84%
But myself and various other
ancient mystery writers

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:54.340 align:middle line:84%
ran with this story
back in the 1990s,

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:59.870 align:middle line:84%
and it was going out
on a leg because there

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:03.600 align:middle line:84%
was no real evidence of
civilization being that old,

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.420 align:middle line:84%
other than myths and
legends, speculation, perhaps

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.520 align:middle line:84%
even forerunners of
ourselves that had written

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:12.060 align:middle line:90%
about these sort of subjects.

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:15.600 align:middle line:84%
But then in my
own area, I'd been

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.750 align:middle line:84%
writing about the
origins of civilization

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:21.880 align:middle line:84%
and looking into the
Hebrew legends relating

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:27.130 align:middle line:84%
to the Garden of Eden
being an actual location,

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:30.120 align:middle line:84%
the "terrestrial
Paradise," which it does

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.080 align:middle line:90%
seem to have been.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to
have been located

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:38.420 align:middle line:84%
in the area of Eastern Anatolia,
what is modern Asiatic Turkey.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.770 align:middle line:84%
And the "four
rivers of Paradise"

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:44.440 align:middle line:84%
were said to have taken their
rise from the Garden of Eden.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, two of those
rivers are easily

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:51.072 align:middle line:84%
identified as the Euphrates and
the Tigris, and both of those

00:16:51.072 --> 00:16:52.530 align:middle line:84%
rise in the area
that we're talking

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:55.470 align:middle line:90%
about here in Eastern Anatolia.

00:16:55.470 --> 00:17:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And this same area is the
cradle of civilization.

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:03.560 align:middle line:84%
A number of the firsts for
humanity all occurred here.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everything
from agriculture,

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:09.450 align:middle line:84%
to animal husbandry,
to metallurgy,

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:11.920 align:middle line:84%
to the first
structured buildings,

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:15.069 align:middle line:84%
even down to the first
beer and the first wine

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:19.339 align:middle line:84%
were all thought to have
originated from this area.

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And quite clearly,
something fundamental

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.329 align:middle line:84%
was happening, something
was changing here, probably

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:31.880 align:middle line:84%
around 9,000 BC, a time
that is known to scientists

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:35.580 align:middle line:84%
as the Neolithic
Revolution, a time

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:39.390 align:middle line:84%
which was seen as a point of
change within the climate.

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:40.670 align:middle line:90%
The climate warmed.

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:44.610 align:middle line:84%
You had this revolution in
agriculture and other things.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And this eventually led to
the rise of civilization.

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:50.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was looking at
the legends connected

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:54.670 align:middle line:84%
with the Garden of Eden and
terrestrial Paradise in Hebrew

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:56.605 align:middle line:90%
myths and what this suggests--

00:17:56.605 --> 00:17:58.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And do you think you
found the other two rivers?

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.900 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: The other two rivers
are-- there's more debate,

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.640 align:middle line:84%
but one of them is almost
certainly the Araxes River,

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.990 align:middle line:84%
also known as the Aras,
which flows eastwards

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:12.540 align:middle line:84%
from the same area of eastern
Anatolia into the Caspian Sea.

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:15.980 align:middle line:84%
The fourth river-- there is
more of a debate over that--

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:19.730 align:middle line:84%
but the best evidence seems
to be that it's the Great Zab

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:24.440 align:middle line:84%
River, which, again, flows
from eastern Anatolia

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:29.280 align:middle line:84%
and actually empties
into the Tigris in Iraq.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And then, obviously,
the two become one.

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:33.520 align:middle line:84%
But it's a big river
in its own right.

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.790 align:middle line:84%
So as I said, all of
them, all four of them,

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:40.800 align:middle line:84%
raise within a sort of
50 to 100-mile area,

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.830 align:middle line:84%
which is pretty
close considering

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:43.960 align:middle line:90%
the rest of the world.

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:46.270 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:50.600 align:middle line:84%
But you've also got, in this
very same area, the myths

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:56.210 align:middle line:84%
relating to these
wisdom-bringers, these angels

00:18:56.210 --> 00:19:00.120 align:middle line:84%
known as Watchers in a text
known as the Book of Enoch.

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:04.025 align:middle line:84%
They're mentioned in other
early Hebrews texts as well.

00:19:04.025 --> 00:19:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And what is said is
that they guarded

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:09.267 align:middle line:84%
the Garden of Righteousness
or the Garden of Eden.

00:19:09.267 --> 00:19:11.100 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they
were connected with it.

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:12.141 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: The Watchers do.

00:19:12.141 --> 00:19:13.250 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah.

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And that they lived in
Paradise, basically,

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.480 align:middle line:84%
which obviously
you could conceive

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.170 align:middle line:90%
as being somewhere in the sky.

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:23.940 align:middle line:84%
But I began to realize
that this was probably

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:29.640 align:middle line:84%
referring to a physical location
somewhere in Eastern Anatolia.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And it was said that the
Watchers not only descended

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.840 align:middle line:90%
amongst mortal-kind, i.e.

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.970 align:middle line:84%
ourselves, and took
wives for themselves

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:43.440 align:middle line:84%
who produced giant
offspring, who

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.950 align:middle line:84%
are referred to in
the text as Nephilim,

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:52.740 align:middle line:84%
but that they also revealed
the arts and sciences of heaven

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:55.810 align:middle line:84%
to their mortal wives
and whoever else I

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:57.620 align:middle line:90%
suppose they were talking to.

00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And these arts and
sciences of Heaven

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:03.930 align:middle line:84%
correspond pretty well to
the firsts for humanity

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:09.970 align:middle line:84%
that all took place in the
area of Eastern Anatolia.

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And so what I suggested
is that the Watchers,

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.820 align:middle line:84%
these human angels who
are described as extremely

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:21.990 align:middle line:84%
tall with quite pale
skin, pale hair,

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:24.730 align:middle line:84%
elongated faces,
which are described

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:29.800 align:middle line:84%
as like vipers or snakes on
occasions, with these piercing

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.140 align:middle line:84%
eyes, which are eyes that
are said to sort of like

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:36.180 align:middle line:84%
radiate out almost like the
sun, that they were actually

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:41.030 align:middle line:84%
a memory of some
kind of elite that

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:45.632 align:middle line:84%
had come into the area
of Eastern Anatolia

00:20:45.632 --> 00:20:50.040 align:middle line:84%
and taken control on the
development of humanity

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.340 align:middle line:90%
in this region.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:53.590 align:middle line:84%
And the way that
they were remembered

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:56.090 align:middle line:84%
by the people who
lived in this region

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:58.480 align:middle line:84%
end up becoming the myths
and legends relating

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:02.360 align:middle line:84%
to the Watchers, the
angels, which, by the way,

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:05.490 align:middle line:84%
those that gave this
wisdom to humanity

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:08.150 align:middle line:84%
were the ones that
became the rebels.

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:09.860 align:middle line:90%
These were the rebel angels.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.792 align:middle line:84%
But also they became
the fallen angels,

00:21:11.792 --> 00:21:13.250 align:middle line:84%
because it was
believed that they'd

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:14.560 align:middle line:90%
fallen from grace basically.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.285 align:middle line:84%
So you have 200 of them
in the Book of Enoch.

00:21:17.285 --> 00:21:17.550 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: That's right.

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:18.710 align:middle line:90%
200, indeed.

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:20.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And then
their offspring

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:22.259 align:middle line:84%
start to become
cannibals, right?

00:21:22.259 --> 00:21:23.300 align:middle line:90%
They start eating people.

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:24.591 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: That's what it says.

00:21:24.591 --> 00:21:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, what the reality
of that is, who knows?

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:32.840 align:middle line:84%
But what's said is the
offspring, these Nephilim,

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:36.690 align:middle line:84%
were rounded up and all
killed, many of them

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:39.780 align:middle line:84%
still as babies
apparently as well,

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:42.240 align:middle line:84%
and that their
Watcher parents were

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.640 align:middle line:84%
sort of forced to watch
this first infanticide

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.460 align:middle line:90%
of human history.

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:53.252 align:middle line:84%
And the rebel Watchers were
rounded up and incarcerated.

00:21:53.252 --> 00:21:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And this was something
that was allegedly

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:57.600 align:middle line:84%
witnessed by the writer
of the Book of Enoch,

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.420 align:middle line:84%
Enoch himself, although
it's unlikely to have

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:06.020 align:middle line:84%
been penned by this character
of biblical history.

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And that that's why we know
this story, because Enoch

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:17.700 align:middle line:84%
recorded the events down in the
book that his name bears today.

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And although we can
see these as myths,

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.190 align:middle line:84%
they are very similar
to other myths that

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:24.890 align:middle line:84%
exist in the same
region, for instance,

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:29.826 align:middle line:84%
to do with the Anunnaki,
the gods of heaven and earth

00:22:29.826 --> 00:22:33.610 align:middle line:84%
in Sumerian and Babylonian
tradition, which obviously

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:37.960 align:middle line:84%
relates to the country of
Iraq more specifically.

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's said that the Anunnaki
also have these piercing

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:43.760 align:middle line:90%
eyes like snakes.

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:48.840 align:middle line:84%
They are also described as
very serpentine in nature.

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And the texts say that
they lived originally

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:59.880 align:middle line:84%
on this holy mound
known as Duku, the Duku,

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:04.640 align:middle line:84%
and that the Duku mound was
situated on a sacred mountain

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.340 align:middle line:90%
called Kharsag.

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And that it was
from this position

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:14.610 align:middle line:84%
that they gave to humanity
the first sheep and grain.

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:17.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, quite clearly,
the sheep is a reference

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:18.990 align:middle line:84%
to animal husbandry,
which we know

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:22.410 align:middle line:90%
took place in Eastern Anatolia.

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And the grain clearly
is a reference

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.590 align:middle line:84%
to the foundations
of agriculture

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:29.380 align:middle line:90%
in the very same area.

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's said that the
Anunnaki lived on Kharsag,

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.220 align:middle line:84%
and that eventually
they help humanity

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:40.600 align:middle line:90%
create the first cities.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.100 align:middle line:84%
They help them
irrigate the land,

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:46.820 align:middle line:84%
create the first irrigation
channels, and things like this.

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And clearly, they are seen as
semi-divine at least figures,

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:57.160 align:middle line:84%
but who somehow interact
with mortal-kind, again,

00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:01.750 align:middle line:84%
to give them the knowledge
to found civilization.

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And there are other accounts
from Persia, ancient Iran

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:09.330 align:middle line:84%
as well, that talk about the
Immortals doing similar things.

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:13.140 align:middle line:84%
So similar legends coming
from exactly the same area.

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:16.440 align:middle line:10%
And I ran with all these
ideas in a book called

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:19.480 align:middle line:10%
"From the Ashes of Angels,"
which was published originally

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:24.270 align:middle line:10%
in 1996, and basically saying
that something big went on

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:25.570 align:middle line:10%
in this area.

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:28.000 align:middle line:84%
We don't know exactly
who these people were.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.580 align:middle line:84%
We don't know exactly
where they came from.

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:35.170 align:middle line:84%
But they clearly came from
the outside into this region

00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:36.550 align:middle line:90%
and took over the show.

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:38.580 align:middle line:90%
They were an elite.

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:41.030 align:middle line:84%
They either worked
with or controlled

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:43.900 align:middle line:90%
the local population.

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And that from this
connection, this trafficking

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:51.130 align:middle line:84%
between these two different
types of human, civilization

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:53.000 align:middle line:90%
eventually arose.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, what I didn't
know at this time

00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:02.164 align:middle line:84%
is that Gobekli Tepe had
just been discovered.

00:25:02.164 --> 00:25:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And this was something that
would not be made public

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:06.150 align:middle line:90%
until the year 2000.

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And what Gobekli
Tepe is, essentially,

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:13.850 align:middle line:84%
is if you can imagine
Stonehenge in England.

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:18.330 align:middle line:84%
If you then multiply that
by, let's say, 20 times

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:22.670 align:middle line:84%
and then cover the stones in
beautiful carvings of animals

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:26.040 align:middle line:84%
and make them
human-like in appearance

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:28.690 align:middle line:84%
with T-shaped
terminations at the top,

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:35.170 align:middle line:84%
sort of like a big letter T,
and create these enclosures

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:39.800 align:middle line:84%
around them and put
them on a mountaintop

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:48.960 align:middle line:84%
in Southeast Anatolia, and then
bury them 10,000 years ago.

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:52.300 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems as if
that these structures go

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:55.630 align:middle line:84%
back probably to around
11 and 1/2 thousand years

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:59.800 align:middle line:84%
when they would seem to
have first been erected.

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And that's not
being disputed by anybody

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:02.635 align:middle line:90%
with any credibility.

00:26:02.635 --> 00:26:03.218 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: No.

00:26:03.218 --> 00:26:05.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the important
thing about Gobekli Tepe

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:10.130 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that it was buried
around 10,000 years ago.

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:12.100 align:middle line:84%
The dates, obviously,
are before this.

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:17.110 align:middle line:84%
As I say, they go back
probably to 9,500 BC.

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:20.630 align:middle line:84%
But whereas there are many
other megalithic sites

00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:25.470 align:middle line:84%
around the world which
could date to this age,

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:27.040 align:middle line:90%
they've not been covered up.

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.590 align:middle line:84%
They've not been preserved
like a time capsule.

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:32.060 align:middle line:84%
That's the big difference
with Gobekli Tepe,

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:33.640 align:middle line:90%
because here it's untouched.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:36.120 align:middle line:84%
So what the archaeologists
are revealing

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:39.940 align:middle line:84%
from beneath this
layer cake of activity

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:45.210 align:middle line:84%
is something that's absolutely
unique because it's pristine.

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:49.280 align:middle line:84%
These enclosures, these
megalithic monuments,

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:53.230 align:middle line:84%
which, as I said, you could
liken to Stonehenge in England

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:57.426 align:middle line:84%
from a much later
date, are something

00:26:57.426 --> 00:26:59.830 align:middle line:84%
which tell us that
this what they

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:02.970 align:middle line:84%
call monumental architecture
was being constructed

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:05.530 align:middle line:90%
as early as 9,500 BC.

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
type of time frame

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:11.850 align:middle line:84%
that some people associate
the age of the Sphinx.

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:12.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Sure.

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: So those like
myself and Dr. Robert Schoch

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:19.620 align:middle line:84%
and Graham Hancock and
various other people who

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:23.170 align:middle line:84%
were suggesting that
civilization was much older

00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:26.570 align:middle line:84%
and who may have been
poo-pooed at the time over this

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:28.960 align:middle line:90%
are now being proved correct.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:32.020 align:middle line:84%
And even just in
the last year or so,

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.670 align:middle line:84%
the science magazine
"New Scientist"

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:38.980 align:middle line:84%
ran a front-page story saying
civilization much older

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:41.670 align:middle line:90%
than we ever expected.

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And so academia does
catch up eventually,

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:49.230 align:middle line:90%
but it might take 20 years.

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:53.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, the Book of Enoch
doesn't appear in the Bible,

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:54.320 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:57.770 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think that
book was not canonized?

00:27:57.770 --> 00:27:59.750 align:middle line:90%
Is there possibly a reason?

00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:03.750 align:middle line:84%
Do you think these fallen
angels and their descendants

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:05.850 align:middle line:84%
might still be around
somehow and wouldn't

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:07.570 align:middle line:90%
want to be found out?

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:10.510 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: I think that the
concepts of the Book of Enoch,

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:15.900 align:middle line:84%
being that humanity
trafficked with fallen angels,

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:21.150 align:middle line:84%
was something that was abhorrent
to the early Christian church,

00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:23.160 align:middle line:90%
anathema, quite literally.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And for this reason,
when they came

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:29.010 align:middle line:84%
to put together the
combined volume that we know

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:33.230 align:middle line:84%
today as the Old
Testament, that they looked

00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:35.190 align:middle line:84%
at the Book of Enoch,
which could easily

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:38.130 align:middle line:84%
have been in there-- I
mean, it's a very old text--

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:40.360 align:middle line:84%
and they said, look, we
don't want this sort of stuff

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:40.860 align:middle line:90%
in there.

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:43.740 align:middle line:84%
We don't want people
knowing about the idea

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:47.400 align:middle line:84%
that we may have been
trafficking with these angels,

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:53.140 align:middle line:84%
with these giants, with
these creatures that

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:56.530 align:middle line:84%
seem to be able to
take on corporeal form

00:28:56.530 --> 00:29:00.830 align:middle line:84%
and become extremely
unheavenly in their nature

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:04.380 align:middle line:90%
by having sex with mortal women.

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:05.730 align:middle line:90%
We don't want this in there.

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:09.580 align:middle line:84%
So books like that and
the accompanying volume,

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:11.650 align:middle line:84%
which was known as the
Book of Giants, which

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:14.840 align:middle line:84%
is the extended story, which
is the story of the Nephilim

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:17.460 align:middle line:84%
themselves, or
those that survived

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:20.960 align:middle line:84%
the initial infanticide,
these were just taken

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.110 align:middle line:90%
and removed and destroyed.

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, we didn't have a
full copy of the Book of Enoch

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:35.340 align:middle line:84%
until the 18th century,
when a Scottish explorer

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:39.390 align:middle line:84%
by the name of James
Bruce went to Ethiopia

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:42.390 align:middle line:84%
and actually found three
copies and brought them back

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:44.340 align:middle line:84%
to Europe, and they
were translated.

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And it was such a shock
for European society

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:52.090 align:middle line:84%
to read the Book of Enoch in
English or German or French

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:53.320 align:middle line:90%
for the first time.

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And it seriously
affected the development

00:29:56.360 --> 00:30:00.340 align:middle line:84%
of certain type of Christian
churches, who were very sort

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:05.020 align:middle line:84%
of anti-demons, anti--
the devil, and hell,

00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:07.340 align:middle line:84%
and all the rest of it,
hellfire and brimstone.

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:09.010 align:middle line:90%
This seriously affected them.

00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:11.120 align:middle line:90%
But that's another story.

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Well, thank you.

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:14.370 align:middle line:84%
This is all the time we
have for this episode.

00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, we'll
do another one.

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:19.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's a real honor to be
able to talk to you today.

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:20.196 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Thank you, David.

00:30:20.196 --> 00:30:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Thank you, Andrew.

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:24.790 align:middle line:84%
What an amazing body
of knowledge here.

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And remember, as I
said at the beginning,

00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:32.240 align:middle line:84%
these Watchers apparently
were extraterrestrial beings.

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
part is that they

00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:39.270 align:middle line:84%
may very well have colonized
our planet in the past.

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And this Atlantean
catastrophe that,

00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:46.380 align:middle line:84%
according to Graham Hancock
happened over 12,000 years ago,

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:48.550 align:middle line:90%
wiped out most of them.

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:50.780 align:middle line:84%
The legend of the Garden
of Eden may actually

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:54.520 align:middle line:84%
be that the positive
beings, called the Elohim,

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:58.400 align:middle line:84%
seeded a humanity here on
Earth that was distinctly

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.370 align:middle line:90%
indigenous to our planet.

00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And they actually drove
off these Watchers,

00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:06.580 align:middle line:84%
who may very well have
been reptilian beings.

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:09.230 align:middle line:84%
Now notice, as crazy
as this sounds,

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:12.340 align:middle line:84%
he did say that they appeared
to have serpent-like faces,

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:13.770 align:middle line:90%
penetrating eyes.

00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:16.830 align:middle line:84%
My insiders have said that
these people do appear

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:20.250 align:middle line:84%
to be reptilian, and
their children actually

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:22.040 align:middle line:90%
became these giants.

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:25.010 align:middle line:84%
They're hybrids, and
they're very tall people.

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:27.840 align:middle line:84%
They have elongated skulls,
all that kind of stuff.

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:30.085 align:middle line:84%
So this is pretty wild
and crazy stuff here.

00:31:30.085 --> 00:31:31.500 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.980 align:middle line:84%
You kind of have to suspend
disbelief a little bit.

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:36.950 align:middle line:84%
But remember, there's very
solid data about this.

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And Gobekli Tepe, this place
that has 23 or 24 stone

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:43.680 align:middle line:84%
circles like
Stonehenge, does appear

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:47.280 align:middle line:84%
to be the cradle of our modern
civilization, the place where

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:51.340 align:middle line:84%
modern humans were actually
created in the so-called Adam

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:52.010 align:middle line:90%
and Eve saga.

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:54.210 align:middle line:84%
It probably wasn't
just two people.

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:57.560 align:middle line:84%
But it may very well be that
a genetically-engineered new

00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:01.630 align:middle line:84%
humanity was created there
and nurtured from this place,

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:05.500 align:middle line:84%
and it has now spread out
across the entire planet.

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.310 align:middle line:84%
So coming up next
time, we're going

00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:11.520 align:middle line:84%
to have our second round of
interviews with Graham Hancock.

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we start
to get into a much broader

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:18.770 align:middle line:84%
discussion beyond just the
original Atlantean catastrophe.

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:21.890 align:middle line:84%
We get into such things as
the Ark of the Covenant, which

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:24.540 align:middle line:84%
appears to have been a
super-weapon developed

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:26.310 align:middle line:90%
by extraterrestrial life.

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:29.580 align:middle line:84%
We also talk about the
stone heads of the Olmecs.

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:32.760 align:middle line:84%
This is very
bizarre, huge stones

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:35.240 align:middle line:90%
that we see in Mesoamerica.

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:38.150 align:middle line:84%
That and much more coming up in
our next interview with Graham

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:40.070 align:middle line:90%
Hancock here on "Disclosure."

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:43.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host David Wilcock,
and I thank you for watching.

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:47.380 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:52.224 align:middle line:90%
