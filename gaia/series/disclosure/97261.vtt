00:00:16.272 --> 00:00:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID WILCOCK:
I'm David Wilcock.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And welcome back to
another exciting episode

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.280 align:middle line:90%
of "Disclosure."

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.100 align:middle line:10%
Here is the good stuff.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.230 align:middle line:10%
John Anthony West has completely
redefined Egyptian scholarship

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.980 align:middle line:10%
as we know it.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.160 align:middle line:10%
And by kind of getting in and
hacking the DNA of the very,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.450 align:middle line:10%
very arcane and dense work of
R.A. Schwaller de Lubicz, he

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.840 align:middle line:10%
has redefined what we think we
know about Egyptian culture.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.890 align:middle line:10%
The traditional
mundane view of Egypt

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.930 align:middle line:10%
is that it all
fits in very nicely

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.290 align:middle line:10%
with conventional
orthodox views.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And John Anthony
West, of course,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.580 align:middle line:84%
is most well known for the
Sphinx water weathering

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.090 align:middle line:90%
argument.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.250 align:middle line:84%
In my interview
with Graham Hancock,

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.490 align:middle line:84%
we also talk about how
John Anthony West was

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.270 align:middle line:84%
part of an expedition in which
they did seismograph readings

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.230 align:middle line:84%
and found a cathedral-sized
chamber under the paws

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.030 align:middle line:84%
of the Sphinx, just like
the Edgar Cayce readings

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.660 align:middle line:90%
said it would be there.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at how John
Anthony West has redefined

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.150 align:middle line:84%
Egyptian orthodox
view, what we're seeing

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.810 align:middle line:84%
is that they were
very, very involved

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.590 align:middle line:90%
in the quest for immortality.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.460 align:middle line:84%
Immortality is a
major, major focus,

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.670 align:middle line:84%
in fact, the central
axis, upon which

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.660 align:middle line:84%
all of Egyptian
philosophy revolves.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.310 align:middle line:90%
So think about this.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.150 align:middle line:84%
Immortality may actually be
the concept of ascension.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.380 align:middle line:84%
I ask him that point-blank
in this episode.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And he tells me that is,
in fact, what's going on.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.100 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians knew and aspired
to the idea that being human

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.980 align:middle line:84%
is just a stage in our
development and that,

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.030 align:middle line:84%
as we move forward, we can
become more than human.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.590 align:middle line:90%
We can become light beings.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.330 align:middle line:84%
We can become cosmic beings,
free from the shackles of death

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.920 align:middle line:90%
and the bounds of mortality.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.760 align:middle line:84%
When we get the chance to talk
to someone like John Anthony

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.480 align:middle line:84%
West, we have a
rare opportunity.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.190 align:middle line:84%
He has a fertile mind, and he
has been doing this research.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.260 align:middle line:84%
He's out there on the front
lines, battling the skeptics,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.560 align:middle line:84%
and showing us concrete
proof that this Atlantean

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.630 align:middle line:84%
civilization is, in fact, much
older than we give it credit

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:38.297 align:middle line:90%
for.

00:02:38.297 --> 00:02:40.880 align:middle line:84%
One of the things you're going
to hear about in this interview

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.290 align:middle line:84%
is a very enigmatic
new site that

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.630 align:middle line:84%
has been found in Indonesia
called Gunung Padang that

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.410 align:middle line:84%
has huge, huge basaltic
blocks that normally would be

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.320 align:middle line:84%
vertical, but they have
been clearly, intelligently

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.080 align:middle line:90%
manipulated into position.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And as he says, the
dating of these blocks

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.580 align:middle line:84%
could be as much as
20,000 years old.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And the more they dig down,
the more they're finding.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.420 align:middle line:84%
So everything we think we know
is being called into question.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And once we are
confronted with this idea

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.400 align:middle line:84%
that a highly technologically
advanced civilization existed

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.680 align:middle line:84%
on Earth before, we then
have to ask questions like,

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.250 align:middle line:84%
did all of the people that were
living on Earth at the time

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.390 align:middle line:90%
of Atlantis actually die?

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Or did some of them have
space-based platforms?

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Did some of them survive,
and are they, in fact,

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.200 align:middle line:90%
still out there today?

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're going to hear
John Anthony West quote Victor

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Hugo in saying that there is
one thing stronger than all

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.800 align:middle line:90%
the armies in the world.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And that is an idea
whose time has come.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.710 align:middle line:84%
This is the time, and
here comes the idea.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.780 align:middle line:90%
This is John Anthony West.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:51.710 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.890 align:middle line:84%
So John, the subject
of Atlantis is

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.120 align:middle line:84%
one of the most fascinating
subjects for our viewers.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And you certainly have
been a huge pioneer

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.300 align:middle line:84%
in bringing
credibility to the idea

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.680 align:middle line:84%
that many of these ancient
monuments around the world

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.760 align:middle line:90%
could be a lot older.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.330 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's
called the A-word.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.140 align:middle line:90%
People don't like the A-word.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.510 align:middle line:90%
Academics are terrified of it.

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.750 align:middle line:84%
Graham Hancock never
wants to use the A-word.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.840 align:middle line:84%
So do you think that
there was an Atlantis?

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.062 align:middle line:90%
Do you think Atlantis existed?

00:04:25.062 --> 00:04:27.020 align:middle line:10%
>>JOHN ANTHONY WEST: Even
when I wrote "Serpent

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.230 align:middle line:10%
in the Sky," which is
more than 30 years ago,

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.090 align:middle line:10%
I was wise enough to
put quotation marks

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.320 align:middle line:10%
around Atlantis.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.180 align:middle line:10%
The quackademics forget
about the quotation marks

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.090 align:middle line:10%
and accuse me of being
an Atlantis freak.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.890 align:middle line:84%
I think that there was
no-- I'll put it this way--

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.000 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily a physical
Atlantis in the middle

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.880 align:middle line:84%
of the Atlantic Ocean,
a la Plato's account,

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.460 align:middle line:84%
but that there was a
global civilization that

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.400 align:middle line:84%
went down under
catastrophic circumstances.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.860 align:middle line:84%
The Atlantis part
of it is not proved.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.190 align:middle line:84%
But the cataclysm that brought
down that global civilization

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:14.490 align:middle line:84%
is now verging on
irrefutable evidence.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.980 align:middle line:84%
Robert Schoch is doing
a lot of work on that.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.480 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: Well, you also wrote
the foreword for Rand and Rose

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.345 align:middle line:10%
Flem-Ath's revisited
"When the Sky Fell,"

00:05:23.345 --> 00:05:24.220 align:middle line:10%
which they retitled--

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.980 align:middle line:10%
>>WEST: Yeah,
that's complicated,

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.835 align:middle line:10%
because the Piri Reis
map is the Piri Reis map.

00:05:28.835 --> 00:05:30.310 align:middle line:10%
And there's Antarctica.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.590 align:middle line:10%
But the geological
cores-- I forget

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.320 align:middle line:10%
what they called them--
ice cores, sediment cores,

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.430 align:middle line:10%
according to Schoch,
that should show

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.710 align:middle line:10%
that there was a crustal
shift don't show that.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.040 align:middle line:90%
So that's now problematical.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.000 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't destroy the validity
of those very ancient maps

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.540 align:middle line:84%
that somebody, somewhere, knew
that the Americas were there

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.540 align:middle line:90%
and that Antarctica was there.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.890 align:middle line:84%
But it's a somewhat
different scenario

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:01.479 align:middle line:84%
now than when Rose and Rand
wrote that particular book,

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:02.270 align:middle line:90%
which was long ago.

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.720 align:middle line:84%
I forget when it was, the early
'80s or something like that,

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.040 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.331 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But we do know, with
the Younger Dryas period,

00:06:07.331 --> 00:06:11.050 align:middle line:84%
that there was a sudden rise
in sea level around the world.

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.970 align:middle line:84%
>>WEST: No, that's-- the Younger
Dryas brings in-- this is

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.320 align:middle line:90%
double catastrophe.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.110 align:middle line:84%
Graham was talking about that
yesterday at the symposium.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.680 align:middle line:84%
The Younger Dryas sets
off of a deeper ice age.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.930 align:middle line:84%
It's the ice age, and it goes
a sharp drop in temperature.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:33.570 align:middle line:84%
And then, around the time that
Plato-- very close, 9700 or so

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:38.860 align:middle line:84%
BC, there's a tremendous
cataclysmic event,

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.750 align:middle line:84%
probably a Carrington Event
of immensely more magnitude--

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.620 align:middle line:84%
Schoch is doing a lot of work on
this-- that actually takes out

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.300 align:middle line:90%
Atlantis between quotes.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.640 align:middle line:84%
It destroys, almost
in its entirety,

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.830 align:middle line:90%
that global civilization.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What is a
Carrington Event?

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>>WEST: They call
them a CME now.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.800 align:middle line:90%
It's a Coronal Mass Ejection.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.530 align:middle line:90%
It's a gigantic solar flare.

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And the Carrington Event
itself-- it was 1859

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.090 align:middle line:84%
or so-- it destroyed the
electrical grid at that time,

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.130 align:middle line:90%
which was just telegraph wires.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.690 align:middle line:90%
So that was not a catastrophe.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.730 align:middle line:84%
If we had even a
Carrington Event, which

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:19.960 align:middle line:84%
is a relatively minor
CME, if we had one today,

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.780 align:middle line:90%
it would fry everything.

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.610 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't be doing
this interview.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.240 align:middle line:84%
We probably wouldn't be here
or on the face of the planet,

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.070 align:middle line:90%
maybe.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So do you think that
the destruction of Atlantis

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.800 align:middle line:84%
could be the result
of a coronal mass

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.576 align:middle line:90%
ejection coming from the sun?

00:07:36.576 --> 00:07:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>>WEST: That's the best
theory that we have today.

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:41.970 align:middle line:90%
Robert Schoch's working on this.

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's based upon the
very solid, un-woowoo work

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:51.200 align:middle line:84%
of a plasma physicist
named Anthony Peratt, who

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.790 align:middle line:84%
works for the Los
Alamos-- whatever it

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:58.740 align:middle line:90%
is-- Nuclear Research Center.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.947 align:middle line:84%
And so the evidence is getting
better and better for that.

00:08:02.947 --> 00:08:05.030 align:middle line:84%
Like all of the evidence
we've been talking about,

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:05.982 align:middle line:90%
it's complicated.

00:08:05.982 --> 00:08:07.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What do you
think about the fact

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:12.120 align:middle line:84%
that this coronal mass ejection,
this massive solar event,

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:16.910 align:middle line:84%
occurred exactly one half of
the precession of the equinoxes

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:18.890 align:middle line:90%
ago in actual years?

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:21.869 align:middle line:90%


00:08:21.869 --> 00:08:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>>WEST: It might
just be coincidence.

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:31.500 align:middle line:84%
As far as I know, the people who
are studying the sequent CMEs

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.500 align:middle line:84%
have not found a
periodicity to it.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.090 align:middle line:84%
It's not as though,
so far, anyone

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:40.860 align:middle line:84%
can find that it happens every
12,000 years or every 36,000

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:42.549 align:middle line:90%
years or anything like that.

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:45.050 align:middle line:84%
But that it does
happen periodically,

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:46.720 align:middle line:84%
that seems to be
well-established.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And Schoch is of the
opinion-- and it's

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.750 align:middle line:84%
an informed opinion-- that
we're sort of ready for one now.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:55.936 align:middle line:84%
And if it happens-- when he
says that, it doesn't mean

00:08:55.936 --> 00:08:57.560 align:middle line:84%
that it's tomorrow,
and it doesn't even

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:03.420 align:middle line:84%
mean that it's next century--
but somewhere in the centuries

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:08.060 align:middle line:84%
to come, the chances of
one happening, he thinks,

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.670 align:middle line:90%
are pretty good.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:13.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Plato's "Timaeus"
and "Critias," of course, he

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:16.580 align:middle line:90%
mentions Atlantis in the books.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:20.470 align:middle line:84%
But the conventional
theory is, well,

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:22.400 align:middle line:84%
people who think that
Atlantis existed,

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.950 align:middle line:84%
they're just basing
it off of Plato.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:27.470 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe that there's
any other information

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:30.850 align:middle line:84%
besides Plato's
original account that

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:33.469 align:middle line:84%
would support the idea of
this global civilization?

00:09:33.469 --> 00:09:34.010 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: Sure.

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:35.900 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there's our work.

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.860 align:middle line:84%
There's Schwaller's work,
there's Laird Scranton's work,

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:42.650 align:middle line:84%
there's all the stuff that
Graham has been working on.

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:46.880 align:middle line:84%
There's Gobekli Tepe that
disappears that they cover over

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:47.960 align:middle line:90%
deliberately.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, in Indonesia,
there's Gunung Padang,

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.970 align:middle line:84%
which looks as though it's
fantastically ancient.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:55.630 align:middle line:84%
There's a ton of
evidence out there.

00:09:55.630 --> 00:10:00.650 align:middle line:90%


00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:04.780 align:middle line:84%
But the Plato myth
itself is complicated.

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.380 align:middle line:84%
The Atlantis hunters are
always looking-- every month,

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.910 align:middle line:84%
somebody says it's here, it's
there, it's somewhere else.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:11.400 align:middle line:84%
The Atlantis hunters
are basically

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.370 align:middle line:90%
looking only at Plato.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:15.970 align:middle line:10%
There's a very interesting book
called "The Pythagorean Plato"

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:20.950 align:middle line:10%
by a musicologist and Sufi named
Ernest G. McClain-- I think

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:24.240 align:middle line:10%
he may still be alive, he'd be
10 years older or so than I am;

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:28.180 align:middle line:10%
that's old-- in which
he demonstrates pretty

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:34.060 align:middle line:10%
convincingly that the story
of Atlantis, as told by Plato,

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:37.340 align:middle line:10%
is actually a musical
allegory designed

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:45.540 align:middle line:10%
to inform his musically
initiated pupils of how harmony

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:49.600 align:middle line:10%
in music, representing
the philosopher king,

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:55.510 align:middle line:10%
degenerates into tyranny
by musical rules, actually.

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And initially, as
I understand it,

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.740 align:middle line:84%
McClain didn't want to even
hear about the Sphinx, which

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.570 align:middle line:84%
actually basically proves
that there was an Atlantis,

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:06.407 align:middle line:90%
within inverted quotes.

00:11:06.407 --> 00:11:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And somewhere along the
line, I understand--

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.320 align:middle line:84%
I never got in touch
with him-- weird,

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.040 align:middle line:84%
I could've-- his book came out
around the same time as "The

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.200 align:middle line:90%
Serpent."

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm about to
rewrite, upgrade not

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:20.310 align:middle line:84%
"The Serpent," but "The
Traveler's Key," which

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:22.940 align:middle line:90%
is my guidebook to Egypt.

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And that will incorporate
McClain's work,

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.930 align:middle line:84%
because I think what it is
is that Plato actually gets

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:33.120 align:middle line:84%
the basic story of Atlantis,
of cataclysm and destruction

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.570 align:middle line:84%
of civilization, from
Solon, his grandfather,

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:41.610 align:middle line:84%
and then turns that into
this musical allegory of how

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:43.470 align:middle line:90%
harmony becomes disharmony.

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.900 align:middle line:84%
So both are actually
valid and are

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:49.339 align:middle line:84%
complimentary, rather than
antithetical, to each other.

00:11:49.339 --> 00:11:51.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, you mentioned
something that's new

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:54.480 align:middle line:84%
and that most people don't know
about, which is Gunung Padang.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:59.430 align:middle line:84%
Could you sort of give
us the basic 101 on that?

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:02.330 align:middle line:84%
>>WEST: Well, it's
a huge structure

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:06.710 align:middle line:84%
of immense basaltic blocks
in the middle of Indonesia

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:07.990 align:middle line:90%
somewhere.

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:10.750 align:middle line:84%
Schoch has visited
it now, and Hancock

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.800 align:middle line:90%
has spent some time there.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And the blocks, so
far, they haven't

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:20.180 align:middle line:84%
been able to see in them a
coherent structure, because it

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.500 align:middle line:90%
may be unbelievably old.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:27.650 align:middle line:84%
But this particular
rock formation

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:33.040 align:middle line:84%
is normally found
as vertical blocks.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And here in Gunung Padang,
it's kind of scattered blocks

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:41.260 align:middle line:84%
that were, at some point or
another, placed horizontally.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.070 align:middle line:84%
They're not as they
would be naturally.

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And they keep digging
down, and they

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:50.980 align:middle line:84%
keep on finding this structure
deep under the earth.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:59.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's still at a beginning
stage of excavation,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.040 align:middle line:84%
and of course, being
battled by the quackademics

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.470 align:middle line:84%
in Indonesia-- quackademics
are all over the world,

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:09.050 align:middle line:84%
doesn't matter what
race they're from.

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:12.210 align:middle line:84%
But there's a very brave
Indonesian geologist

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:16.400 align:middle line:84%
who's gathering the forces to
look deeper into Gunung Padang.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:17.610 align:middle line:90%
So yeah--

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:19.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What is
the dating saying

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:22.020 align:middle line:84%
in the dirt around these blocks
as they keep digging down?

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:23.042 align:middle line:90%
How old is it?

00:13:23.042 --> 00:13:25.787 align:middle line:90%


00:13:25.787 --> 00:13:27.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WEST: I'm not that
familiar with it.

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:30.780 align:middle line:84%
But judging from
Graham's talk yesterday,

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:33.860 align:middle line:84%
they're down somewhere
around 20,000 BC,

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:41.710 align:middle line:84%
and still finding that it's
human-- not human constructed,

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:43.740 align:middle line:90%
I'd say, but that it's--

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.415 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: There's
intelligence inside.

00:13:45.415 --> 00:13:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: That's right.

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:47.830 align:middle line:84%
There is intelligence
in the rocks.

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:50.410 align:middle line:90%
Yes, something like that.

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:53.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You also mentioned the
Valley Temple of the Sphinx.

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:55.350 align:middle line:90%
Could you cover that again?

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:59.940 align:middle line:90%


00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Let's just review again
the water weathering

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:07.519 align:middle line:84%
on the back of the Sphinx and
then the Valley Temple blocks.

00:14:07.519 --> 00:14:09.560 align:middle line:84%
>>WEST: Well, the water
weathering is not so much

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:10.620 align:middle line:90%
the back of the Sphinx.

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:13.250 align:middle line:84%
The Sphinx is-- all of
it has been weathered.

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:15.250 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of it
had been restored.

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:19.830 align:middle line:84%
It's the enclosure
wall behind the Sphinx

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:21.142 align:middle line:90%
and on the sides of the Sphinx.

00:14:21.142 --> 00:14:22.600 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
deepest weathering

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:26.450 align:middle line:84%
is, because that's where
the water came sweeping down

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:29.870 align:middle line:84%
the plateau and over
the walls, producing

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.610 align:middle line:84%
much deeper weathering
than on the Sphinx

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:33.600 align:middle line:84%
itself, which only would
have been weathered

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:38.010 align:middle line:84%
by the rainfall falling directly
upon it at some distant time

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:41.650 align:middle line:90%
when there was lots of rain.

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And the Valley Temple
is right next door.

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's constructed
of core masonry,

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.495 align:middle line:84%
of huge-- because these are the
ones, the blocks of stone that

00:14:49.495 --> 00:14:58.000 align:middle line:84%
weigh 75, 100 tons, that were
quarried out from the trench

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000 align:middle line:84%
that they had to dig
down in order to expose

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.060 align:middle line:90%
the core body of the Sphinx.

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:08.860 align:middle line:84%
It's like a cat sitting in
a bathtub, a very big cat

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:10.310 align:middle line:90%
sitting in a bathtub.

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And in order to get the
cat so that its body is

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:18.100 align:middle line:84%
free from-- call it
the bathwater, which

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:22.480 align:middle line:84%
happens to be stone, they
have to quarry out all

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.370 align:middle line:90%
around that form.

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:27.202 align:middle line:90%
And this they did.

00:15:27.202 --> 00:15:28.410 align:middle line:90%
They didn't just chop it out.

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:30.820 align:middle line:84%
They quarried it out
in these huge blocks.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And those huge blocks went to
build this remarkable Valley

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:41.801 align:middle line:84%
Temple, which then subsequently
were faced with huge granite

00:15:41.801 --> 00:15:42.300 align:middle line:90%
blocks.

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:45.790 align:middle line:84%
But it's the limestone
blocks that are original.

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And even the
academics acknowledge

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:50.230 align:middle line:84%
that those blocks come
out of the trench that

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:53.630 align:middle line:84%
was excavated to produce
the core body of the Sphinx.

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:56.870 align:middle line:84%
But they keep on insisting
still to this day

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:59.080 align:middle line:90%
that it's all 2500 BC.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:03.160 align:middle line:84%
But they won't be able to keep
up this charade much longer,

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:07.270 align:middle line:84%
because the evidence is piling
up almost on a daily basis.

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And if they have
any sense, they'll

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:16.310 align:middle line:84%
either acknowledge that,
heaven forbid, they were wrong,

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:18.300 align:middle line:90%
or go down with the ship.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:22.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And Gobekli
Tepe, as you said before,

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:23.520 align:middle line:90%
is sort of like the smoking gun.

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:25.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WEST: It is absolutely the
smoking gun, all by itself.

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.545 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Has anybody mounted
any type of academic objection

00:16:28.545 --> 00:16:29.917 align:middle line:90%
to the dating of Gobekli Tepe?

00:16:29.917 --> 00:16:30.750 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: Almost none.

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:32.810 align:middle line:84%
That's what's so
interesting, because it's

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:34.080 align:middle line:90%
done by one of their own.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:40.540 align:middle line:84%
It's done by an absolutely
orthodox German archaeologist

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:42.390 align:middle line:84%
named Klaus Schmidt,
who unfortunately

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:46.970 align:middle line:84%
died just a few months
ago-- not an old man,

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:51.320 align:middle line:84%
60; by my standards,
that's young--

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.650 align:middle line:90%
who was doing all of the work.

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:55.517 align:middle line:90%
And it was his dating.

00:16:55.517 --> 00:16:56.100 align:middle line:90%
We were there.

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And Schoch had a
lengthy talk with him

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:00.730 align:middle line:84%
and said that the
dating is impeccable.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:04.541 align:middle line:84%
And so the archaeologists are
just having to swallow that.

00:17:04.541 --> 00:17:05.999 align:middle line:84%
What they are doing,
however-- it's

00:17:05.999 --> 00:17:08.599 align:middle line:84%
had quite a bit of press,
not major, major press,

00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:11.579 align:middle line:84%
but it was the lead
article in, I think,

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:15.490 align:middle line:90%
May 2011 National Geographic.

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:19.349 align:middle line:10%
And the article was not a really
very satisfactory article,

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:24.690 align:middle line:10%
says that this will certainly
provoke certain changes

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:27.375 align:middle line:10%
to the archaeological picture.

00:17:27.375 --> 00:17:31.120 align:middle line:84%
It's not that it'll provoke
some sort of changes

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:34.830 align:middle line:84%
to the archaeological-- it
blows the picture completely out

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:40.110 align:middle line:84%
of the water and out of the
pages of their history books.

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:42.130 align:middle line:90%
And so does the Sphinx theory.

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:44.440 align:middle line:84%
But the excuse for
ignoring the Sphinx theory

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.090 align:middle line:84%
was always that, well, it was
hunter gatherers back then,

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:51.370 align:middle line:84%
so how could they have built
this amazing structure,

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:53.850 align:middle line:90%
this amazing statue?

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And we don't care
about the geology.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.282 align:middle line:90%
We're not geologists.

00:17:57.282 --> 00:17:58.240 align:middle line:90%
They simply ignored it.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:00.460 align:middle line:84%
But they can't
ignore Gobekli Tepe.

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And now Gunung
Padang is probably

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:06.260 align:middle line:84%
going to be another nail
in that big coffin that

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.580 align:middle line:90%
buries the entire discipline.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well,
mainstream egyptologists

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:18.050 align:middle line:84%
use Manetho's king-lists
to date the chronology

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:22.310 align:middle line:84%
of pharaonic dynasties
in Egypt, because Manetho

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:26.560 align:middle line:84%
and others wrote down when
these dynasties took place.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:29.360 align:middle line:84%
They'd backdate it
to a certain point.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.750 align:middle line:84%
But then, before that,
they'd say, well, everything

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:33.116 align:middle line:90%
before that is a myth.

00:18:33.116 --> 00:18:33.990 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: That's right.

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:35.350 align:middle line:90%
That's what they do.

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:38.950 align:middle line:84%
Manetho is quite right, except
he doesn't give regnal years.

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Up until quite
recently, maybe 30,

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:45.490 align:middle line:84%
40 years ago,
various egyptologists

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:48.160 align:middle line:84%
had bitter arguments
with each other.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
long history that

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:59.040 align:middle line:84%
went back to put the beginnings
of Egypt around 4000 BC.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And there was a short history
that put it back to about 1600

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:03.530 align:middle line:90%
BC.

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:05.370 align:middle line:90%
So that's a huge difference.

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And this was within
academia, actually.

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:11.520 align:middle line:84%
But up until Schwaller,
they were simply

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:16.210 align:middle line:84%
ignoring the Palermos down
in the Turin Papyrus that

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:19.850 align:middle line:84%
talk about the rule by
the Neteru themselves

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:25.010 align:middle line:84%
and the Shemsu Hor, the
sort of demiurge kings

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:27.830 align:middle line:84%
that came in later
as simply a fiction.

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:30.130 align:middle line:84%
But now the
combination of Sphinx

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:32.550 align:middle line:84%
and Gobekli Tepe
and Gunung Padang--

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:35.130 align:middle line:84%
and probably, Easter Island
comes into this play,

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:41.690 align:middle line:84%
as well-- it's now becoming
not only respectable,

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:43.890 align:middle line:84%
but at some point or
another, pretty soon, I

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:46.500 align:middle line:84%
think, it's going to
become irrefutable

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:52.810 align:middle line:84%
that this advanced global
civilization existed

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:55.610 align:middle line:84%
in the distant, distant
past and that it went down

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:58.430 align:middle line:84%
under cataclysmic
conditions, which we're now,

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:02.360 align:middle line:84%
I think, satisfactorily
beginning to understand.

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:05.340 align:middle line:84%
And the whole picture
is kind of exciting

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:08.430 align:middle line:84%
as our own stupid society,
the Church of Progress,

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:14.440 align:middle line:84%
is in the process
of self-destruction,

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:19.820 align:middle line:84%
that a number of us
are coming up with,

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:24.880 align:middle line:84%
let's say, the building
blocks to potentially create

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:27.590 align:middle line:84%
a new civilization in
the midst of the chaos.

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:30.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It's such
a mysterious concept

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:36.310 align:middle line:84%
to think about a highly advanced
civilization that disappeared.

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And as your research
has concluded,

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:44.400 align:middle line:84%
they were very keen
on creating monuments

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.350 align:middle line:84%
that had sacred geometry
built into them.

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:49.960 align:middle line:84%
So this suggests some
intrinsic difference

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.520 align:middle line:84%
in how they ran
their civilization.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.550 align:middle line:84%
So could you paint
a picture for us

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:58.190 align:middle line:84%
of what you see this very
ancient, antidiluvian

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:00.110 align:middle line:90%
civilization as being like?

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:01.970 align:middle line:84%
>>WEST: Yeah, I think
ancient Egypt and all

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:05.010 align:middle line:84%
of the other civilizations
that arise around 3000,

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:10.970 align:middle line:84%
4000 BC are legacies from
that earlier civilization.

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And what fueled
Egypt for 3,000 years

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:16.530 align:middle line:84%
was, in a word, the
quest for immortality,

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:20.160 align:middle line:84%
that we, as human beings,
have the capacity,

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.710 align:middle line:84%
through our own inner work--
it doesn't happen just

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:25.470 align:middle line:84%
by rubbing crystals--
through our own inner work,

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:29.470 align:middle line:84%
to achieve a higher level
of consciousness that

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:33.320 align:middle line:84%
is not subject to death, to
the dissolution of the body.

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:38.342 align:middle line:84%
Everything in Egypt was
devoted to that single aim.

00:21:38.342 --> 00:21:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And I'm pretty sure
that that could

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.450 align:middle line:84%
apply to all of those other
civilizations, all of which

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:46.930 align:middle line:84%
have degenerated down to our
Church of Progress, which,

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:49.510 align:middle line:84%
from a spiritual point
of view, is probably

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:54.680 align:middle line:90%
the nadir of the cycle.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:57.450 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is
read the paper any day

00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:00.280 align:middle line:84%
now to see that it can't get
much worse than it is now,

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.560 align:middle line:90%
despite the shiny technology.

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:06.980 align:middle line:90%
And it's touch and go.

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:08.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that
all of a sudden

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:12.190 align:middle line:84%
it's going to turn around and
become a civilization again.

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:16.570 align:middle line:84%
But at least we are now being
provided with the building

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:17.270 align:middle line:90%
blocks.

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:19.600 align:middle line:84%
There are a couple of hundred
people at this conference

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.150 align:middle line:90%
at the moment.

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:23.400 align:middle line:84%
But there are a million
watching the Kardashians,

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.360 align:middle line:84%
or millions watching
the Kardashians,

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.100 align:middle line:90%
and "American Idol."

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:31.600 align:middle line:84%
So it's a bit presumptuous
to think that we are actually

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:32.890 align:middle line:90%
going to prevail.

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:36.690 align:middle line:84%
But to go back to the
famous line of Victor Hugo,

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:39.550 align:middle line:84%
"There's one thing stronger than
all the armies in the world,

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:41.950 align:middle line:84%
and that is an idea
whose time has come."

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:45.320 align:middle line:84%
It may be that this is the
idea whose time has come.

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.840 align:middle line:84%
What Hugo forgot to mention,
which he didn't think of,

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.970 align:middle line:84%
actually, was that the second
strongest thing in the world

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:53.170 align:middle line:84%
is the idea whose
time has not yet gone.

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:56.360 align:middle line:90%


00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Since the idea that
has not yet gone

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:02.460 align:middle line:84%
has the support of all of
the armies in the world,

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:08.090 align:middle line:84%
be they military or scientific
or educational or whatever,

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:10.470 align:middle line:90%
there's a battle in store.

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:12.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Do you feel
that there's research

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:17.420 align:middle line:84%
that you would like to see
about trying to understand

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:19.220 align:middle line:84%
this civilization more
and date its remains

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:20.330 align:middle line:90%
and find its remains?

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Do you think there's research
that hasn't been done yet

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:23.622 align:middle line:90%
that could be done?

00:23:23.622 --> 00:23:25.080 align:middle line:84%
Would you have any
recommendations?

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.916 align:middle line:84%
Or if you had an
unlimited budget

00:23:26.916 --> 00:23:29.040 align:middle line:84%
and could just do whatever
you want, what would you

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:29.830 align:middle line:90%
like to see?

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:32.620 align:middle line:84%
>>WEST: Well, push further along
the lines that we're doing.

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:35.770 align:middle line:84%
Go do a certain amount
of deep sea exploration

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:37.700 align:middle line:84%
on the continental
shelves, because that's

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:40.450 align:middle line:84%
where you would expect,
once the sea levels rise,

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:42.020 align:middle line:84%
it covers everything
or virtually

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:43.770 align:middle line:84%
everything that
was there before.

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And if we're correct that
this civilization was global,

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:49.980 align:middle line:84%
we should be able
to find more there.

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:53.805 align:middle line:84%
Beyond that, the
budget, actually,

00:23:53.805 --> 00:23:56.550 align:middle line:84%
if I had that unlimited
budget, what I would do

00:23:56.550 --> 00:24:00.780 align:middle line:84%
is media, in other words,
not so much necessarily

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:06.010 align:middle line:84%
the science, but to get the
message out to everybody, not

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:07.700 align:middle line:84%
just on blogs and
all the rest of it.

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
we're hoping, in fact,

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:12.420 align:middle line:84%
to put the money together for
the follow-up to our "Mystery

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:16.240 align:middle line:84%
of the Sphinx," except
a global upgrade of it,

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.880 align:middle line:84%
of traveling to all
of these places,

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:25.690 align:middle line:84%
filming them, and then putting
it out, not first as a TV show,

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:30.440 align:middle line:84%
but in fact, in the cinemas,
in the movie theaters.

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And from there--
because the technology

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:35.620 align:middle line:84%
for all my sneering
at it, allows

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:39.150 align:middle line:84%
us to do what was impossible to
do up until a couple of decades

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:39.650 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And that is to get
the message out

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:43.900 align:middle line:90%
to everybody who's interested.

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And the proof is actually, our
own "Mystery of the Sphinx,"

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:50.675 align:middle line:84%
probably was seen
over time by a couple

00:24:50.675 --> 00:24:52.310 align:middle line:90%
of hundred million peoples.

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:54.920 align:middle line:84%
So the interest
is actually there.

00:24:54.920 --> 00:25:01.277 align:middle line:84%
And it's being suppressed,
basically, by the media,

00:25:01.277 --> 00:25:02.860 align:middle line:84%
not because they're
thinking that way,

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:05.930 align:middle line:84%
but because that's
just who they are.

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:08.000 align:middle line:84%
The Church of Progress
has its own Jesuits

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.550 align:middle line:84%
who are science,
education, and the media.

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:15.060 align:middle line:84%
Science creates the dogma--
life is meaningless,

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:17.170 align:middle line:90%
and it's all an accident.

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:20.040 align:middle line:84%
Education disseminates
the dogma.

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And the press, the media,
basically either sugarcoats it

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:32.140 align:middle line:84%
or camouflages it in Kardashians
and the stupidity that's

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:34.022 align:middle line:90%
called entertainment.

00:25:34.022 --> 00:25:36.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, if you had
this worldwide civilization,

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:40.960 align:middle line:84%
and it's all over the world,
where did these people go?

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:44.250 align:middle line:84%
They had high technology,
they had high advancement.

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:45.680 align:middle line:90%
Are any of them left?

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:47.870 align:middle line:90%
Did their lineage survive?

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:48.910 align:middle line:90%
Where did they go?

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:51.100 align:middle line:84%
>>WEST: Well,
wherever they survived

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:55.970 align:middle line:84%
in these little pockets--
and it took a few thousand

00:25:55.970 --> 00:26:01.410 align:middle line:84%
years before they could recreate
their civilizations-- India,

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:04.952 align:middle line:84%
China, Egypt-- all of these,
as I said, are legacies.

00:26:04.952 --> 00:26:06.410 align:middle line:84%
Almost certainly,
they're legacies.

00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:09.840 align:middle line:84%
They start, as far as
our records go back,

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:11.710 align:middle line:90%
almost entirely intact.

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:16.100 align:middle line:84%
But up until that point, they're
not building major structures.

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.640 align:middle line:84%
It looks as though,
actually, on the outside

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:21.850 align:middle line:84%
and from the textbook, you'll
see that nothing is going on.

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:25.160 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there was more
going on than you think.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.000 align:middle line:84%
But you just have to
put it all together,

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.090 align:middle line:84%
because there are little bits
here and little bits there.

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:36.080 align:middle line:84%
The Met, Metropolitan Museum in
New York, recently had a show,

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:41.560 align:middle line:84%
curated a big show, called
"Origins of Egyptian Art,"

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:42.650 align:middle line:90%
something like that.

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And they got all
of the artifacts

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:48.584 align:middle line:84%
that they could find together in
this one very interesting show.

00:26:48.584 --> 00:26:50.000 align:middle line:84%
And these were,
for the most part,

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.630 align:middle line:84%
quite small things, but often
absolutely elegantly carved,

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:56.990 align:middle line:90%
geometrically perfect.

00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:59.855 align:middle line:84%
And they were dating from
Predynastic and Protodynastic

00:26:59.855 --> 00:27:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Egypt, 3000 and
4000 and 5000 BC.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.840 align:middle line:84%
Recently, an incredible
obsidian bracelet

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:09.680 align:middle line:84%
was found in Turkey that
they date to 8000 BC.

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:11.345 align:middle line:84%
And even the
academics acknowledge

00:27:11.345 --> 00:27:16.807 align:middle line:84%
that this involves a very
sophisticated geometry

00:27:16.807 --> 00:27:17.640 align:middle line:90%
in its construction.

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.280 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's 8000 BC.

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.730 align:middle line:84%
It's supposed to be all hunter
gatherers or rude farmers

00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:22.389 align:middle line:90%
back then.

00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:23.680 align:middle line:90%
How were they going to do this?

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.263 align:middle line:84%
What do they do,
sitting down, saying,

00:27:25.263 --> 00:27:28.310 align:middle line:84%
what should we-- make a
little bracelet for the wife,

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:32.070 align:middle line:84%
for the little lady,
for our anniversary?

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:36.420 align:middle line:84%
Let's invent geometry so that
it really looks cool for her.

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:39.080 align:middle line:84%
No-- it means that they're
working with geometry,

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.100 align:middle line:90%
they've got the maths to do it.

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And you extrapolate from that
the Sphinx and Gobekli Tepe

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:46.330 align:middle line:90%
and all the rest of it.

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:48.100 align:middle line:90%
And the evidence is all there.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:53.190 align:middle line:84%
Put it this way-- if
it's a big jigsaw puzzle,

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:56.800 align:middle line:84%
there are enough pieces in place
now so that you can sort of

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.430 align:middle line:90%
visualize the big picture.

00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:00.180 align:middle line:90%
But it's not sort of.

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:07.120 align:middle line:84%
But we kind of know what we're
looking for to get in it.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:11.890 align:middle line:84%
But again, we don't have
any formal-- none of us

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:16.010 align:middle line:84%
have any formal
backing, financially.

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:19.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's all individuals
doing their own work,

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.620 align:middle line:84%
a few of us banding together
here and there, things

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:24.540 align:middle line:84%
like the Paradigm
Symposium spreading

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:27.960 align:middle line:84%
the word, the internet
spreading the word.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:33.950 align:middle line:84%
But it's still a long way, let's
say, from establishing itself.

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:36.230 align:middle line:84%
In biblical
terminology, the seed

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:40.974 align:middle line:84%
has to fall on fertile ground
for it to sprout and flourish.

00:28:40.974 --> 00:28:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And even when it
sprouts, it could

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:45.960 align:middle line:84%
be trampled into the ground
by any wandering jackass.

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, though, the
ground has to be prepared.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.560 align:middle line:84%
That means getting rid of all
the brambles and the poison

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:52.120 align:middle line:90%
ivy.

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.070 align:middle line:90%
That's sort of my job.

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:57.050 align:middle line:84%
I kind of delight in the
constructive destruction

00:28:57.050 --> 00:29:01.190 align:middle line:84%
so that the whole thing can
actually hopefully take root

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:04.067 align:middle line:84%
before we destroy
ourselves and our planet.

00:29:04.067 --> 00:29:06.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, I think the
vast majority of people

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:07.380 align:middle line:84%
agree that you've
done a great job.

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:08.500 align:middle line:90%
So John, I want to thank you--

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:08.970 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: Thank you, David.

00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:09.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: --for being here.

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:10.208 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: Thanks so much.

00:29:10.208 --> 00:29:11.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: All right.

00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:14.100 align:middle line:10%
John Anthony West said that
if he was given $1 billion

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:15.860 align:middle line:10%
and could do whatever
he wanted with it

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:18.160 align:middle line:10%
for any archaeological
expedition,

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.170 align:middle line:10%
that instead of
needing more science,

00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:23.020 align:middle line:10%
what he would invest
in is publicity.

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:27.210 align:middle line:10%
Well, I'm very happy to be
able to interview him and all

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:31.900 align:middle line:10%
the top players in this field
for "Disclosure" in this form

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:34.894 align:middle line:10%
that you're seeing now,
because, just as he said,

00:29:34.894 --> 00:29:36.310 align:middle line:10%
we're getting rid
of the brambles,

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:38.140 align:middle line:10%
we're getting rid
of the poison ivy.

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:42.480 align:middle line:84%
We're clearing the ground so
that the seeds can be planted.

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And the seeds of
truth can blossom

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:50.160 align:middle line:84%
into beautiful, fertile, new
vegetables and fruits that

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.490 align:middle line:90%
can be very nourishing for us.

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:54.070 align:middle line:84%
When we're coming
up next time, we're

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:58.890 align:middle line:84%
going to have part two of our
interview with Robert Bauval.

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is where I went
back and drank the haterade.

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:04.940 align:middle line:84%
I went online, and
I looked at what

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:08.490 align:middle line:84%
were the people saying about
him on such illustrious

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:12.080 align:middle line:84%
sites as Wikipedia, which
has been widely implicated

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.400 align:middle line:84%
as a target of government
intelligence agencies.

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And this has even
been now leaked

00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:20.100 align:middle line:84%
on firstlook.org, which
is the site that is now

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:23.150 align:middle line:84%
where Glenn Greenwald
is doing his work

00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:25.260 align:middle line:84%
and talking about the
Snowden documents.

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:29.220 align:middle line:84%
We know that the government
is, in fact, targeting people

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:30.630 align:middle line:84%
talking about the
things that I'm

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:34.640 align:middle line:84%
telling you right now, because
they don't want you to know.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.170 align:middle line:90%
But I want you to know.

00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we're
doing this show.

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:42.720 align:middle line:84%
Robert Bauval fought
the BBC and won.

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And they had to
admit it in writing.

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:49.360 align:middle line:84%
But now, to this day, they're
still claiming on Wikipedia

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.670 align:middle line:84%
that his theory has
been discredited,

00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:54.860 align:middle line:84%
and they never reference
this groundbreaking lawsuit

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:57.210 align:middle line:84%
that he actually
won against the BBC.

00:30:57.210 --> 00:31:00.300 align:middle line:84%
That's coming up next
time, here on "Disclosure."

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:01.330 align:middle line:90%
Check it out.

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:04.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm David Wilcock, and I
thank you for watching.
