00:00:16.212 --> 00:00:17.670 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID WILCOCK:
I'm David Wilcock,

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.130 align:middle line:10%
and welcome to another exciting
edition of "Disclosure."

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.390 align:middle line:10%
This is the cream of the crop.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.270 align:middle line:10%
This is the PhD class in ancient
civilizations bringing together

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.910 align:middle line:10%
the best of the best, the very
premier scholars and writers

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.310 align:middle line:10%
of our time investigating
what is going on,

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.160 align:middle line:10%
and perhaps the heavyweight
champion of them

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.100 align:middle line:10%
all is Graham Hancock.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.640 align:middle line:10%
I was very honored that when
I wrote my first book, "Source

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.390 align:middle line:10%
Field Investigations," that
he gave me a cover endorsement

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.260 align:middle line:10%
and said that my
research was magnificent.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.180 align:middle line:90%
That was the anointing.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And when I read
his book in 1995,

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.690 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea that one
day, almost 20 years later,

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.340 align:middle line:84%
here I would be on
my show giving you

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.190 align:middle line:84%
this interview with
him and actually

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.210 align:middle line:84%
getting the chance to have
such a high-minded conversation

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.510 align:middle line:84%
with him about very
fascinating subjects.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.790 align:middle line:84%
We dive into the subject
of the Ark of the Covenant,

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.060 align:middle line:84%
and the idea that
it's still here.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.710 align:middle line:84%
That it never left,
but that it actually

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.330 align:middle line:90%
still exists in Ethiopia.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And is being guarded in a place
called Axum by these temple

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.040 align:middle line:84%
priests, and that they get
cataracts on their eyes

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.030 align:middle line:84%
after only two or three years
apparently because the Ark is

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.190 align:middle line:84%
a thing of fire, suggesting
there may be radioactivity that

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.180 align:middle line:84%
is actually causing
their cataracts, which

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.990 align:middle line:84%
does happen in the presence
of radiation exposure.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.650 align:middle line:84%
Graham and I also start talking
about tunnels under the Giza

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:48.910 align:middle line:90%
Plateau.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And remember, the
sonar readings do

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.930 align:middle line:84%
show that there is a
cathedral-sized room

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.430 align:middle line:90%
down there.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.270 align:middle line:90%
We know this.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And the Egyptian
authorities completely

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.940 align:middle line:84%
denied it for the longest
time, but then they

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.950 align:middle line:84%
came out with this Temple
of Osiris television special

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.479 align:middle line:90%
that we're going to hear about.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.979 align:middle line:84%
Where none other
than the director

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.030 align:middle line:84%
of Egyptian antiquities,
Zahi Hawass,

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.660 align:middle line:84%
is going down into these
tunnels under the Giza Plateau,

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.420 align:middle line:90%
and he finds this temple.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.720 align:middle line:84%
We talk about what he does or
doesn't find in the sarcophagus

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.370 align:middle line:84%
down there, and we
talk of how bizarre

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.420 align:middle line:84%
it is to think about
the amount of work

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.000 align:middle line:84%
that it would take to
tunnel into bedrock

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.350 align:middle line:84%
and pull all that rock
out, especially if there's

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.470 align:middle line:84%
a large room down
there, which we've been

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.100 align:middle line:90%
able to prove that there is.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.920 align:middle line:84%
This is nothing easy, to
haul all that rock out

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.910 align:middle line:90%
is a huge project.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And if it was done with
conventional technology

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.810 align:middle line:90%
it would take forever.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.620 align:middle line:84%
But if there's an
advanced technology where

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.280 align:middle line:84%
you can carve through stone very
easily just by liquefying it,

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.770 align:middle line:84%
let's say, that becomes
a much different story.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.860 align:middle line:84%
Another point I want to say here
is that I have insiders who I

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.490 align:middle line:84%
cannot get to come
forward on camera,

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.250 align:middle line:84%
one of whom worked at a very
high level in the Reagan

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.980 align:middle line:90%
administration.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.440 align:middle line:84%
He talked to Ronald
Reagan all the time,

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.540 align:middle line:84%
and he has given me
many pieces of data

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.100 align:middle line:84%
that have correlated with
what other insiders told me

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.230 align:middle line:90%
independently.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.160 align:middle line:84%
Now this guy said
something very important

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.410 align:middle line:84%
that you're not going to
hear from Graham Hancock.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.400 align:middle line:84%
He said that, in the government,
we know on a secret level

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.460 align:middle line:84%
that, in fact, the Giza Plateau
was the highest point in a very

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.700 align:middle line:84%
ancient civilization
that covered

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.300 align:middle line:84%
the whole top third of
Africa, and that civilization

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.750 align:middle line:84%
was apparently wiped out 50,000
years ago in a very epic war.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, if you go
through the Sahara Desert,

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.830 align:middle line:84%
and you dig down anywhere
between as little as 30

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.580 align:middle line:84%
to 40 feet of sand, and in
some cases as much as 100

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.130 align:middle line:84%
to 300 feet of sand, there
are extensive ruins down there

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.620 align:middle line:84%
of a much older, much
more ancient civilization,

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.050 align:middle line:84%
and what we found in Egypt
is only the highlands up

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.120 align:middle line:84%
Another very fascinating
aspect of this testimony

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.230 align:middle line:84%
is that the ancient Egyptian
priests found multiple caches

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.060 align:middle line:84%
of books and documents
which they then

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.780 align:middle line:84%
spirited away to the Library
of Alexandria in Egypt.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And we are told that the burning
of the Library of Alexandria

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.490 align:middle line:84%
was a false flag, and the
only thing they really burned

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.720 align:middle line:84%
was the census
records, and the Romans

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.330 align:middle line:84%
took all of the real books, all
of the ancient, ancient stuff

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.080 align:middle line:84%
cataloged by the Egyptians,
and hid it away in where?

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.020 align:middle line:90%
The Vatican library.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.580 align:middle line:84%
I have another insider who was
given a top secret clearance

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.170 align:middle line:84%
to go into the Vatican
library and do research,

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.370 align:middle line:84%
and he actually saw
these books himself,

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.310 align:middle line:84%
and said that many of
them had bright colors.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.090 align:middle line:84%
They'd have a bright
blue leather cover

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.920 align:middle line:90%
or a bright red leather cover.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.890 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them apparently had
belt buckles over the book,

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.460 align:middle line:84%
and when you open
them up, the pages

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.250 align:middle line:84%
are made of some kind of
weird indestructible material.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.630 align:middle line:84%
So they're still white,
you can't tear them.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.780 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, all the
pages are like bar codes.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.340 align:middle line:84%
In other cases, the
writing is very pristine,

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.150 align:middle line:84%
and you actually see diagrams
of spaceships, space stations,

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.470 align:middle line:84%
all sorts of really
advanced technology

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.830 align:middle line:84%
that's being hidden
away in the Vatican.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.970 align:middle line:84%
It's all being kept from
us, and its researchers

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.370 align:middle line:84%
like Graham Hancock who are
truly looking for the bread

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.180 align:middle line:84%
crumbs, and have never
been given access

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.800 align:middle line:84%
to the really, really
good stuff hidden away

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.340 align:middle line:90%
in the Vatican library.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.840 align:middle line:84%
But we get tantalizingly close
to the center of the mystery,

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.810 align:middle line:84%
because in this
episode, we're talking

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.310 align:middle line:84%
about the super weapon of the
Ark of the Covenant, the idea

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.360 align:middle line:84%
that it's still there, and
these mysterious tunnels

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.210 align:middle line:90%
under the Giza Plateau.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.630 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the
piece de resistance

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.090 align:middle line:84%
of the tunnels
under the plateau,

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.880 align:middle line:84%
is the infamous Hall of Records
described by Edgar Cayce.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.520 align:middle line:84%
The idea that was
given in his readings

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.070 align:middle line:84%
that there are
highly technological

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:58.980 align:middle line:84%
artifacts there
that will give us

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:03.230 align:middle line:84%
the entire history of the
people who came to Earth

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.270 align:middle line:84%
and colonized it forming
what we now call Atlantis.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.260 align:middle line:84%
This is "Disclosure" with Graham
Hancock, the fifth interview

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.250 align:middle line:90%
out of six that we've done.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.660 align:middle line:90%
And I want you to enjoy this.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:14.840 align:middle line:90%
Check it out.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.830 align:middle line:84%
So you and I both have
spoken on "Ancient Aliens,"

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:22.020 align:middle line:84%
and the typical interpretation
on that show of the burning

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.000 align:middle line:84%
bush is, well, there
must be a UFO up there

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.160 align:middle line:84%
and the light is shining
through the bush.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.430 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you believe?

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.305 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM HANCOCK: No.

00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:30.800 align:middle line:90%
That's not my take on that.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.010 align:middle line:10%
I look at another
aspect of the story.

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.040 align:middle line:10%
And this draws from
the research that's

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.970 align:middle line:10%
been done by Professor Benny
Shanon at the Hebrew University

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:41.900 align:middle line:10%
in Jerusalem.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.510 align:middle line:84%
Benny Shanon is professor
of psychology at the Hebrew

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.270 align:middle line:84%
University in Jerusalem,
and it happens

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:50.000 align:middle line:84%
that he's a great expert on
ayahuasca, that visionary brew

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.840 align:middle line:90%
of the Amazon.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.830 align:middle line:84%
I personally had about 55 or
60 sessions with ayahuasca.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.590 align:middle line:84%
I know for sure that Benny
has had more than 400 sessions

00:06:58.590 --> 00:06:59.780 align:middle line:90%
with ayahuasca.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So he could
be clinically insane

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:02.829 align:middle line:90%
like 500 times over?

00:07:02.829 --> 00:07:04.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: But the thing
is he's absolutely sharp

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:08.620 align:middle line:84%
and a very, very,
very rational man.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And an important academic
in his own right.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.090 align:middle line:84%
But he's put his money
where his mouth is,

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:16.850 align:middle line:84%
and he's not just
studied academically,

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:18.080 align:middle line:84%
he's gone out and
drunk the brew,

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.860 align:middle line:84%
and he's interviewed hundreds
and hundreds of people

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.359 align:middle line:84%
around the world
who drunk the brew.

00:07:21.359 --> 00:07:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And he proposes a very
interesting theory,

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.060 align:middle line:84%
which is that ayahuasca,
in the Amazon,

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:27.570 align:middle line:90%
is a mixture of two plants.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.750 align:middle line:84%
One of them contains
DMT, and the other one,

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.785 align:middle line:84%
the ayahuasca vine itself,
contains a monoamine oxidase

00:07:33.785 --> 00:07:34.285 align:middle line:90%
inhibitor.

00:07:34.285 --> 00:07:35.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:39.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: This is necessary
because DMT cannot normally be

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.900 align:middle line:90%
accessed orally.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.280 align:middle line:84%
There's an enzyme in the gut
called monoamine oxidase, which

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.590 align:middle line:90%
switches off DMT.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.680 align:middle line:84%
That's why normally
you need to smoke it

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.460 align:middle line:90%
in order to get the effect.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, the clever thing
about the Amazonian brew

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.610 align:middle line:84%
is that the DMT is in the
leaves of the Psychotria viridis

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.210 align:middle line:90%
plant, OK?

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And the ayahuasca vine contains
a mononamine oxidase inhibitor,

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.460 align:middle line:84%
which switches off that
enzyme in the gut that allows

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.230 align:middle line:90%
the DMT to be absorbed orally.

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:09.151 align:middle line:84%
It's a very clever piece
of ethnopharmacology.

00:08:09.151 --> 00:08:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And could that
have been done randomly?

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:11.560 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: I don't believe it
could have been done randomly,

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:14.580 align:middle line:90%
nor do shamans in the Amazon.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.500 align:middle line:84%
They say that their
ancestors were taught

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.285 align:middle line:90%
to do this by the spirits.

00:08:18.285 --> 00:08:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Now, what
Benny Shanon's point

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.760 align:middle line:84%
is that there are plants
in the Middle East,

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.950 align:middle line:84%
indeed in the Sinai
Peninsula, which

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:30.700 align:middle line:84%
contain exactly the same
ingredients as ayahuasca brew.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.039 align:middle line:84%
Syrian Rue, you know,
contains the monoamine oxidase

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:38.100 align:middle line:84%
inhibitor and a species of
mimosa contains the DMT.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:42.039 align:middle line:84%
And he suggested-- he wrote
a detailed academic paper

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:42.760 align:middle line:90%
on this.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:48.040 align:middle line:84%
He suggested that Moses may
have been under the influence

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.097 align:middle line:90%
of an ayahuasca analog.

00:08:50.097 --> 00:08:52.180 align:middle line:84%
Of course, he couldn't get
those Amazonian plants,

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:56.210 align:middle line:84%
but he was using plants that
were locally available which

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:58.340 align:middle line:90%
produced the same effect.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And what is experience
at the burning bush

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:05.120 align:middle line:84%
was precisely like
an ayahuasca vision.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.380 align:middle line:84%
It's actually very
interesting, in the movie

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.890 align:middle line:84%
"Noah," which is
recently-- we've

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:14.610 align:middle line:84%
seen in the last few months,
which where Noah actually

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:18.600 align:middle line:90%
drinks a dark brew.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.110 align:middle line:84%
That is a reference
to this research,

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:25.090 align:middle line:84%
I believe, that there was a
brew available in the Middle

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:29.310 align:middle line:84%
East that would produce a deeply
altered state of consciousness.

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And in those deeply altered
states of consciousness,

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:35.130 align:middle line:84%
we do not always
encounter benign entities.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.890 align:middle line:84%
We sometimes encounter entities
that don't mean well for us,

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:40.300 align:middle line:90%
but hoodwink us.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And, again, I come back to
that my theme in my novels

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:47.500 align:middle line:84%
that demons are
manipulating human kind.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.180 align:middle line:84%
So that's my take on
Moses at the burning bush.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.310 align:middle line:84%
He's encountering what the
Gnostics called the Demiurge.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:57.140 align:middle line:84%
He's encountering this
negative spiritual entity,

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:01.317 align:middle line:84%
which is going to lead
him down a negative part.

00:10:01.317 --> 00:10:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And this entity
was able to use him

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.129 align:middle line:84%
as an intermediary to
build a super weapon.

00:10:05.129 --> 00:10:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Use him
as an intermediary

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.680 align:middle line:84%
to build a super
weapon, gives him

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.080 align:middle line:84%
the blueprint of the
Ark of the Covenant,

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.720 align:middle line:84%
which is very-- set out
in very great detail

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.890 align:middle line:90%
in the Book of Exodus.

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:19.540 align:middle line:84%
This monstrous instrument,
as I called it, this weapon,

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:23.680 align:middle line:84%
is built at the foot of
Mount Sinai by a craftsman

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.550 align:middle line:84%
called Bezaleel, who is
working to a blueprint

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:31.450 align:middle line:84%
that Moses has received from the
entity who he construes as God,

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:36.020 align:middle line:84%
and has created this
weapon of destruction.

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:38.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And let's go through
some of the descriptions

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:39.560 align:middle line:90%
of what the Ark could do.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.350 align:middle line:84%
What were some different
things that were used-- like,

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:43.730 align:middle line:90%
how bad ass was it?

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:46.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Let's say
that Steven Spielberg was

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:49.351 align:middle line:84%
right on the money in
the imagery of the Ark

00:10:49.351 --> 00:10:51.600 align:middle line:84%
of the Covenant that he gave
us in the famous "Raiders

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:57.020 align:middle line:90%
of the Lost Ark."

00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:00.310 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing in that
film that I can fault

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:02.090 align:middle line:90%
from a factual point of view.

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:04.550 align:middle line:84%
The Ark, as it is portrayed
by Steven Spielberg,

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:07.380 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a radio for
talking to God, as one

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:10.090 align:middle line:84%
of the phrases that Indiana
Jones uses, whether it's

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:12.860 align:middle line:84%
the bolts of fire
shooting out from it

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:16.220 align:middle line:84%
and striking people
dead, everything

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:22.010 align:middle line:84%
that we see about the Ark, this
powerful, powerful instrument,

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:24.320 align:middle line:84%
in that film is
absolutely in line

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.030 align:middle line:90%
with the biblical accounts.

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Including the idea that
the Nazis went looking for it?

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:29.990 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yes.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:33.210 align:middle line:84%
I would say that that
idea is quite correct.

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:36.145 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the Nazis
were on the dark side.

00:11:36.145 --> 00:11:40.470 align:middle line:84%
They were the ultimate
creatures of the Demiurge.

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:44.970 align:middle line:84%
They were the ultimate
attempt to lead mankind--

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:48.199 align:middle line:84%
to mislead mankind into
a dark and deadly path.

00:11:48.199 --> 00:11:49.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And if they
could get this weapon,

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:51.364 align:middle line:84%
then World War II
would have been

00:11:51.364 --> 00:11:53.170 align:middle line:90%
no problem for them ostensibly?

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: They were looking for
anything, any weapon of power.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.450 align:middle line:84%
By it's important to recognize
that the Nazis were deeply

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:00.820 align:middle line:90%
into the occult.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:04.540 align:middle line:84%
They were deeply
into the dark side.

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And I would say, when I talk
about spiritual forces at work,

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:10.340 align:middle line:84%
negative spiritual
forces, when I

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:14.340 align:middle line:84%
talk about War God misleading
Cortes and Moctezuma to create

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.700 align:middle line:84%
the catastrophe of the
Spanish conquest of Mexico,

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:20.140 align:middle line:84%
the catastrophe of Hitler
is another example of that.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Again and again throughout
history, human beings

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:26.190 align:middle line:84%
have felt themselves
to be in contact

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:29.000 align:middle line:84%
and guided and inspired
by spiritual forces, which

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.800 align:middle line:84%
have led them to do
terrible, terrible things.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.022 align:middle line:84%
And Hitler was one of
those, was one of those,

00:12:34.022 --> 00:12:36.230 align:middle line:84%
and it makes absolute sense
that he would have sought

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:37.852 align:middle line:90%
out the Ark of the Covenant.

00:12:37.852 --> 00:12:39.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Wouldn't
it be interesting

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:41.940 align:middle line:84%
if the Ark of the Covenant
was still around somewhere?

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Well, of
course, I think it is.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:44.446 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: You do?

00:12:44.446 --> 00:12:45.120 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.350 align:middle line:10%
>>HANCOCK: My book,
"The Sign of the Seal,"

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:49.860 align:middle line:10%
traces the Ark of the
Covenant to Ethiopia,

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.370 align:middle line:10%
to the highlands of Ethiopia.

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:54.240 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: So you actually think
that this ancient technology,

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:58.490 align:middle line:10%
this super weapon, actually
still exists on earth today?

00:12:58.490 --> 00:12:59.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: I do, yeah.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.245 align:middle line:90%
And I think that it's under--

00:13:01.245 --> 00:13:02.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: In Ethiopia?

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: It's under the
guardianship of a people, who

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:10.870 align:middle line:84%
are fortunately, for all
of us, keeping it out

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:13.480 align:middle line:90%
of modern history.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.630 align:middle line:90%
Keeping it away from the world.

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:20.470 align:middle line:84%
The very last thing we want
is for the Ark of the Covenant

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:22.570 align:middle line:90%
to appear again.

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:24.740 align:middle line:84%
All three of the
monotheistic faiths,

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:28.690 align:middle line:84%
the fundamentalist
aspects of Islam,

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:30.700 align:middle line:84%
the fundamentalist
aspects of Judaism,

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.700 align:middle line:84%
and the fundamentalists
aspects of Christianity,

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.840 align:middle line:84%
have prophecies
concerning the return

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.840 align:middle line:90%
of the Ark of the Covenant.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And for the Ark of the
Covenant to be reintroduced

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:44.490 align:middle line:84%
into the time bomb of
Jerusalem and Israel today

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:46.140 align:middle line:90%
would be catastrophic.

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And level-headed
people who belong

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:52.530 align:middle line:84%
to Judaism,
Christianity, and Islam,

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:55.600 align:middle line:84%
that's the last thing
that they want to see.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, I
remember, years ago when

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:03.270 align:middle line:84%
I was tracing the Ark of
the Covenant to Ethiopia,

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:05.610 align:middle line:84%
I had a long, pretty
much off the record,

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:08.730 align:middle line:84%
chat with the Israeli
ambassador at that time.

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And I said to-- the Israeli
ambassador to Ethiopia,

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:15.130 align:middle line:84%
and I said to him, come on,
you guys have got MaSat.

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:19.325 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if the Ark is there,
why don't you just go grab it?

00:14:19.325 --> 00:14:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And he looked me straight in
the eyes, he said, you know,

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.480 align:middle line:84%
that's the very last thing
that we would want to do.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.820 align:middle line:84%
For the Ark to be reintroduced
into Israel right now

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:30.160 align:middle line:84%
would be a catastrophe
for the world.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.780 align:middle line:90%
Very happy for it to stay here.

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:34.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What is some
tangible evidence

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.164 align:middle line:90%
that the Ark still exists?

00:14:36.164 --> 00:14:36.830 align:middle line:90%
What do we know?

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:41.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Well, for me,
it was an extended piece

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:45.240 align:middle line:84%
of historical detective work,
because I haven't seen it.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.910 align:middle line:84%
The Ark is kept in
a sanctuary chapel

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:51.010 align:middle line:84%
in the grounds of the oldest
Christian place of worship

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:55.110 align:middle line:84%
in Africa, which is the
Church of Saint Mary of Zion

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:56.310 align:middle line:90%
in the city of Axum.

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And the city of Axum is
itself an armed camp.

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:01.200 align:middle line:84%
The heartland of
the Tigrayan people,

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:05.730 align:middle line:84%
who overthrew the tyranny and
the dictatorship of Mengistu

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:07.840 align:middle line:90%
Haile Miriam back in 1991.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.110 align:middle line:84%
This was a barefoot army, who
overthrew the largest standing

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:12.410 align:middle line:90%
army in Africa.

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:14.530 align:middle line:84%
There heartland
is Axum, and they

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:18.960 align:middle line:84%
are the guardians of the Ark,
and there are men with guns

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:23.210 align:middle line:84%
everywhere around
that sacred precinct.

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:25.780 align:middle line:84%
It is possible to go up to
the gates of the chapel.

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:28.265 align:middle line:84%
It is possible to talk to
the monk who guards the Ark,

00:15:28.265 --> 00:15:29.140 align:middle line:90%
and I have done that.

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:30.848 align:middle line:84%
I've not talked only
to one, because they

00:15:30.848 --> 00:15:33.240 align:middle line:84%
have a very short
lifespan, these monks who

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.240 align:middle line:90%
guard the Ark of the Covenant.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.616 align:middle line:84%
Typically, once
they're appointed

00:15:36.616 --> 00:15:39.156 align:middle line:84%
to the guardianship of the Ark,
they don't live more than two

00:15:39.156 --> 00:15:39.902 align:middle line:90%
or three years.

00:15:39.902 --> 00:15:40.860 align:middle line:90%
And very rapidly they--

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:42.150 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: What happens to them?

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.191 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: They go blind.

00:15:43.191 --> 00:15:45.300 align:middle line:84%
They develop cataracts
over their eyes.

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And when I asked the
guardian, the first one that I

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:52.880 align:middle line:84%
met about this and about what
was causing his blindness,

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.390 align:middle line:84%
he said it was the Ark
that was doing it to him.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:56.730 align:middle line:90%
And I said why?

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And through the
translator, looking at me

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:01.670 align:middle line:84%
through these
clouded eyes of his,

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:05.080 align:middle line:84%
he said the Ark is
a thing of fire.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the story got
its hook into me, because there

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.540 align:middle line:90%
was truth in his words.

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:15.939 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe that the
Ethiopians do have that object

00:16:15.939 --> 00:16:17.730 align:middle line:84%
and I do believe it's
the best place to be.

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:19.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So could it be
radioactive, perhaps?

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:19.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yes.

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:20.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Radioactivity
caused the cataracts?

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Yes, this
is strongly suggesting,

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.900 align:middle line:84%
as we know from the
biblical accounts,

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:27.930 align:middle line:84%
still today, we're looking at
an object of immense power, that

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:29.960 align:middle line:90%
is likely to be radioactive.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.120 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a kind of
radioactivity we understand

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.980 align:middle line:84%
or something beyond our
understanding, I'm not sure.

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:37.647 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So how many have people
have lost their eyes like this?

00:16:37.647 --> 00:16:39.271 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Every
single guardian that I

00:16:39.271 --> 00:16:40.910 align:middle line:84%
met over a period
of about 10 years,

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:43.890 align:middle line:84%
because I kept going back,
all of them went blind.

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:46.039 align:middle line:84%
And they all said it was
the Ark doing it to them,

00:16:46.039 --> 00:16:47.580 align:middle line:84%
and they all died
within a few years.

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:48.954 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And
normally, cataracts,

00:16:48.954 --> 00:16:50.700 align:middle line:84%
like if you're in the
highlands of Peru,

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.032 align:middle line:84%
you're closer to the sun,
there's less atmosphere,

00:16:53.032 --> 00:16:54.740 align:middle line:84%
there's more radiation
hitting your eyes,

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.840 align:middle line:84%
and that's why these people
are getting cataracts.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.110 align:middle line:84%
So radiation and cataracts,
there is a relationship?

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:00.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: There
is a relationship.

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:02.493 align:middle line:84%
It's well-known that
there's a relationship.

00:17:02.493 --> 00:17:04.950 align:middle line:84%
But for me, it was
a detective work.

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:07.859 align:middle line:84%
It was tracing
how the Ark really

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:09.200 align:middle line:90%
could have got to Ethiopia.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:13.560 align:middle line:84%
We have the first temple, the
Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.440 align:middle line:84%
It is built as a house
of rest for the Ark

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.060 align:middle line:90%
of the Covenant of the Lord.

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:20.780 align:middle line:84%
The Ark is placed in
the Holy of Holies.

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.069 align:middle line:84%
Before that, it dominates
the biblical story.

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:25.180 align:middle line:84%
There's more than 200
separate references to it.

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.119 align:middle line:84%
After it enters the
Temple of Solomon,

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:29.400 align:middle line:84%
we hardly ever
hear from it again.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.320 align:middle line:84%
The mainstream view
is that the Ark

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:36.730 align:middle line:84%
was looted from Jerusalem
when the Babylonians sacked

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:39.890 align:middle line:90%
Jerusalem in 587 BC.

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:42.080 align:middle line:84%
They did take many
temple treasures,

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:46.130 align:middle line:84%
but the Babylonians were
notorious bureaucrats,

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:47.850 align:middle line:84%
and they kept a
record of everything

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:51.140 align:middle line:84%
they took from Jerusalem,
and included in that record

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:52.680 align:middle line:90%
is not the Ark of the Covenant.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.660 align:middle line:84%
It isn't mentioned and it isn't
amongst the treasures returned

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.960 align:middle line:84%
to Jerusalem at the end of the
exile when the people of Israel

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.970 align:middle line:90%
go back to the Holy Land.

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:05.530 align:middle line:84%
The Ark, it seems to me,
is missing from the temple

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:07.960 align:middle line:90%
before the Babylonian invasion.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I found a
very interesting episode

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:13.600 align:middle line:84%
of biblical history, which is
the reign of a monarch called

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Manasseh, who is
reviled in the Bible

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:19.630 align:middle line:84%
for abandoning the
traditional Judaic faith

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:21.930 align:middle line:84%
and for installing
in the Holy of Holies

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:25.550 align:middle line:84%
of the temple of Solomon
a pagan idol, which

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:28.460 align:middle line:84%
is an idle to the Canonite
goddess, a tree goddess,

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:29.930 align:middle line:90%
called Asherah.

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And I talked to biblical
scholars, particularly

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:35.340 align:middle line:84%
Menahem Haran at Hebrew
University in Jerusalem,

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:38.080 align:middle line:84%
and he said, look,
I don't believe

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:41.960 align:middle line:84%
that those who were loyal to the
traditional worship of Judaism

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:45.240 align:middle line:84%
could have allowed the Ark
to stay in the Holy of Holies

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.530 align:middle line:84%
when Manassas put
the Asherah in there.

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:50.210 align:middle line:84%
It would've been
ritually polluted.

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:51.260 align:middle line:90%
They had to take it out.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:52.635 align:middle line:84%
The Levites, who
carried the Ark,

00:18:52.635 --> 00:18:55.010 align:middle line:84%
had to take it out of
the temple at that point

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:57.080 align:middle line:90%
to save it from pollution.

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:59.540 align:middle line:84%
That was around
650 BC, and that's

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:02.950 align:middle line:84%
when I discovered in 650
BC, more or less exactly

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:06.420 align:middle line:84%
the same moment a Jewish
temple mysteriously

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:09.240 align:middle line:84%
is built on the island of
Elephantine in upper Egypt.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.399 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: I've been there.

00:19:10.399 --> 00:19:11.190 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Exactly.

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:12.320 align:middle line:90%
Near this modern town of Aswan.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Very bad
electrical system.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.340 align:middle line:90%
They blew out--

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:17.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: The Ark
is still at work.

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:18.480 align:middle line:90%
But this is a mystery.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.590 align:middle line:84%
For another temple to be built
in the first temple period

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:22.591 align:middle line:90%
outside of this Isreal--

00:19:22.591 --> 00:19:23.798 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right at that time--

00:19:23.798 --> 00:19:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Cannot be explained,
unless that temple was built

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.780 align:middle line:84%
to house the Ark
of the Covenant.

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:31.030 align:middle line:84%
So that's how I traced
the Ark to Southern Egypt

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:34.080 align:middle line:84%
to Elephantine,
then around 400 BC,

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.864 align:middle line:84%
that temple on the island
of Elephantine is destroyed.

00:19:36.864 --> 00:19:38.780 align:middle line:84%
There's conflict between
the Jewish population

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.960 align:middle line:84%
of the island of Elephantine
and the Egyptians.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:41.770 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:43.670 align:middle line:84%
Because the patron
deity of Elephantine

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:47.390 align:middle line:84%
is Khnum, a ram-headed deity,
and the Jewish population

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:50.890 align:middle line:84%
on the island of Elephantine
are sacrificing rams.

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:52.200 align:middle line:90%
This is well documented.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.070 align:middle line:90%
They're driven out.

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:56.290 align:middle line:84%
I believe they traveled south,
followed the Nile River system

00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:58.770 align:middle line:84%
all the way to Lake
Tana in Ethiopia.

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Cutting a long story short, I
found an island on Lake Tana

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.990 align:middle line:84%
with an ancient tradition
of the Ark of the Covenant.

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:05.690 align:middle line:84%
The monks there,
they're Christians now,

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:07.869 align:middle line:90%
they said we were Jews then.

00:20:07.869 --> 00:20:09.160 align:middle line:90%
The Ark was first brought here.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.920 align:middle line:84%
They showed me
ancient structures

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.120 align:middle line:84%
that had been part of
the housing of the Ark

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.540 align:middle line:90%
on the island of Tana Kirkos.

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And then they said,
when Ethiopia converted

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:20.680 align:middle line:84%
to Christianity, which it did
around 200 years after Christ,

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.580 align:middle line:84%
one of the first countries
to become Christian,

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:25.860 align:middle line:84%
the first Christian
King, King Ezana,

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:29.850 align:middle line:84%
sent his army to Lake Tana
and took the Ark off to Axum,

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:32.770 align:middle line:84%
and it's been in
Axum ever since.

00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:35.250 align:middle line:84%
It's a trail of
circumstantial evidence.

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:37.250 align:middle line:84%
There's more to it than
that, we don't have time

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:38.190 align:middle line:90%
to go into it all now.

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:41.060 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, it's in my book,
"The Sign of the Seal."

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:44.860 align:middle line:84%
But I can't absolutely prove
that the Ark of the Covenant

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.690 align:middle line:84%
is in Ethiopia, but I think
Ethiopia has a stronger

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:49.160 align:middle line:84%
case than anywhere
else, and it's

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.730 align:middle line:84%
the only place in
the world which

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:54.300 align:middle line:84%
has a living tradition
of veneration of the Ark

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:56.480 align:middle line:90%
of the Covenant to this day.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.510 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere else, the
Ark is a lost object,

00:20:58.510 --> 00:20:59.720 align:middle line:90%
forgotten in the past.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:02.010 align:middle line:84%
In Ethiopia, it's the
center of religious culture,

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:05.330 align:middle line:84%
and weirdly, that's a Christian
religious culture venerating

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:07.400 align:middle line:90%
a pre-Christian relic.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Every single church in
Ethiopia has a replica

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:12.610 align:middle line:84%
of the Ark of the Covenant
or of the Tablets of Stone

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:14.570 align:middle line:90%
in its Holy of Holies.

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And if that replica is removed,
the church is deconsecrated

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.602 align:middle line:84%
and it gains its
sanctity by reference

00:21:21.602 --> 00:21:23.060 align:middle line:84%
to the original
Ark of the Covenant

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:25.800 align:middle line:90%
that they say they keep in Axum.

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:29.710 align:middle line:84%
I think there is great merit
to the Ethiopian claim,

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:31.530 align:middle line:84%
and I'm very glad
that the Ark is

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:33.680 align:middle line:84%
hidden away in the
highlands of Africa

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.154 align:middle line:84%
and not on the center of the
world stage causing chaos.

00:21:36.154 --> 00:21:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well,
doesn't it seem too

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:40.870 align:middle line:84%
that Spielberg has been
leaked information, that he's

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:42.907 align:middle line:90%
disclosing truth through film?

00:21:42.907 --> 00:21:43.740 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Could be.

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:44.460 align:middle line:90%
Could be so.

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:46.460 align:middle line:84%
I think often truths are
disclosed through film.

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:46.980 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.438 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: The
uncomfortable truths

00:21:48.438 --> 00:21:52.090 align:middle line:84%
that we don't want to recognize
are leaked to us subliminally

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:55.660 align:middle line:84%
through film, and that
may well be the case.

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Let's talk along
that line of disclosure.

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:00.440 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
Temple of Osiris.

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:03.910 align:middle line:84%
This very strange thing
happens with Zahi Hawass.

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:06.510 align:middle line:84%
They do a television
documentary,

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:08.680 align:middle line:84%
they're now saying
on the documentary

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.984 align:middle line:84%
but there's tunnels under
the Egyptian plateau.

00:22:11.984 --> 00:22:12.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah.

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:13.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: They found--

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:14.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: That again, is
a very interesting process

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:16.660 align:middle line:84%
of the gradual leaking
of information,

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:18.564 align:middle line:84%
because if you go
back 15, 20 years,

00:22:18.564 --> 00:22:20.230 align:middle line:84%
you would find Zahi
denying that there's

00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.990 align:middle line:90%
tunnels under the Giza Plateau.

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:22.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: That's correct.

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:25.252 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Even though the
Edgar Cayce Organization,

00:22:25.252 --> 00:22:27.210 align:middle line:84%
the Association for
Research and Enlightenment,

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:31.840 align:middle line:84%
were allowed to carry out sonar
surveys on the Giza Plateau.

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.440 align:middle line:84%
It was done very
secretively, but they

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.260 align:middle line:84%
were allowed to do that,
and those sonar surveys

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:39.600 align:middle line:84%
did identify tunnel systems
underneath the Giza Plateau.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.460 align:middle line:84%
We know of some of
those tunnel systems.

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:43.640 align:middle line:84%
We know for sure
there's a chamber

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.330 align:middle line:84%
under the Sphinx, a big
chamber under the left fore-paw

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:46.940 align:middle line:90%
of the Sphinx.

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:47.730 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: We know for sure?

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:49.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: We know
for sure, because--

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Who's we
and how do we know.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.258 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Well,
the general public

00:22:52.258 --> 00:22:55.130 align:middle line:84%
know because thanks to two
individuals in particular,

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:57.140 align:middle line:84%
John Anthony West
and Professor Robert

00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Schoch of Boston
University, who went there

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:04.550 align:middle line:84%
with sonar equipment, and
back in the early 1990s,

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:07.220 align:middle line:84%
were able to conduct some
research around the Sphinx

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:10.290 align:middle line:84%
before they were
stopped by Zahi Hawass.

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:12.570 align:middle line:84%
They were able to
conduct sonar research,

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:14.800 align:middle line:84%
and hitting the
ground with hammers

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:18.690 align:middle line:84%
and seeing where the
sound waves bounced back.

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:23.840 align:middle line:84%
They identified a large regular
chamber down about 15 feet

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.597 align:middle line:84%
under the left
fore-paw of the Sphinx.

00:23:25.597 --> 00:23:27.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And the military
could use a similar technology

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:31.370 align:middle line:84%
looking for Saddam Hussein or
bin Laden underground bases?

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:34.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Of course,
technology has moved on a lot.

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:37.605 align:middle line:84%
Who knows what technology
is being deployed, but--

00:23:37.605 --> 00:23:40.105 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But the point is we've
got these seismic waves that

00:23:40.105 --> 00:23:42.780 align:middle line:84%
they created with the hammer,
you can measure exactly where

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:44.660 align:middle line:90%
they go, and they know--

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:45.864 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: They show voids.

00:23:45.864 --> 00:23:47.530 align:middle line:84%
They demonstrate voids
under the ground,

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:49.730 align:middle line:84%
and a large regular
void is demonstrated

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:50.650 align:middle line:90%
beneath the Sphinx.

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:51.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: How big?

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:55.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: About 35 feet
long by about 15 feet wide.

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:57.157 align:middle line:90%
It's a very substantial void.

00:23:57.157 --> 00:23:58.490 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Kind of like this room.

00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:01.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: A bit
like this room,yeah.

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:02.040 align:middle line:90%
And there it is.

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:03.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: There's
lot of stuff you

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:04.300 align:middle line:90%
can cram in there potentially.

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:06.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Potentially, you
could, and, of course, it's

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.960 align:middle line:84%
not an accident
that the Edgar Cayce

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.770 align:middle line:84%
Foundation, the Association
for Research and Enlightenment

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:12.520 align:middle line:84%
in Virginia Beach
have been involved

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.910 align:middle line:84%
in this rather clandestine
research on the Giza Plateau.

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Because Edgar Cayce prophesied
that the Hall of Records

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.282 align:middle line:84%
of Atlantis would be found
beneath the left fore-paw

00:24:22.282 --> 00:24:22.865 align:middle line:90%
of the Sphinx.

00:24:22.865 --> 00:24:23.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: In that exact location.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:26.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: In that exact
location, so naturally enough,

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:27.590 align:middle line:90%
they have an interest in this.

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:29.715 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And I've heard
that Zahi Hawass actually--

00:24:29.715 --> 00:24:31.877 align:middle line:84%
that the ARE paid for
his college education.

00:24:31.877 --> 00:24:33.210 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yes, that's the case.

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:34.876 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And then he
goes and completely

00:24:34.876 --> 00:24:36.880 align:middle line:84%
180s, and says that
all the Edgar Cayce

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.812 align:middle line:84%
stuff is not true, orthodox
Egyptology all the way.

00:24:39.812 --> 00:24:41.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: He and
Mark Lehner both.

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:42.840 align:middle line:90%
It's a very curious thing.

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:45.450 align:middle line:84%
Robert Bauval and I, in
our book, "The Message

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:47.910 align:middle line:84%
of the Sphinx," which
was published in 1996,

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:49.740 align:middle line:84%
did a detailed
appendix on this, where

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:53.180 align:middle line:84%
we looked at the education
of Mark Lehner, who arguably

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.880 align:middle line:84%
is the leading American
egyptologist at the Oriental

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Institute in the
University of Chicago,

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.120 align:middle line:84%
and Zahi Hawass, who arguably
is the leading Egyptian

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.130 align:middle line:90%
egyptologist.

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Zahi Hawass, for many
decades, was the man

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:06.220 align:middle line:90%
who ran the Giza Plateau.

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:08.760 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't at the moment.

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
that both of them

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:14.220 align:middle line:84%
are closely connected to the
Edgar Cayce Organization.

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And were indeed sent through
college by the Edgar Cayce

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:20.870 align:middle line:84%
Organization, and then
returned to the Giza Plateau

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:23.620 align:middle line:84%
to become the prominent figures
that the subsequently became,

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:25.720 align:middle line:84%
at which point, both
of them then say

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.300 align:middle line:84%
that they no longer believe
anything that the Edgar Cayce

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:29.600 align:middle line:90%
Organizations say.

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.960 align:middle line:84%
That there is no Hall
of Records of Atlantis,

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.280 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.830 align:middle line:84%
But both of them still
continue to give lectures

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:39.380 align:middle line:84%
at the Edgar Cayce
Organization in Virginia Beach.

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:41.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that we have
to come to any conclusions

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.815 align:middle line:84%
from that, I'm just
saying I find it odd.

00:25:43.815 --> 00:25:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And Mark
Lehner wrote the book

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.064 align:middle line:84%
"The Egyptian Heritage,"
which is still

00:25:47.064 --> 00:25:49.339 align:middle line:84%
the defining book on Edgar
Cayce's Atlantis story.

00:25:49.339 --> 00:25:50.380 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: He did indeed.

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:50.640 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.610 align:middle line:84%
Of course, now, he says
he's changed his view,

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:55.050 align:middle line:84%
and indeed, we're entitled
to change our views,

00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:57.587 align:middle line:90%
but it's still odd.

00:25:57.587 --> 00:25:59.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Perhaps
they were threatened,

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:01.587 align:middle line:84%
perhaps they were bribed, we
don't really know what it is.

00:26:01.587 --> 00:26:02.461 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Who knows?

00:26:02.461 --> 00:26:03.590 align:middle line:90%
Who knows what's going on?

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:06.520 align:middle line:84%
All it does for me is
it adds to the feeling

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:09.810 align:middle line:84%
that there's a hidden agenda
at work on the Giza Plateau,

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:12.600 align:middle line:84%
and that we, the public, are
not being told everything

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:15.060 align:middle line:84%
by any means that
is going on there.

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And, yes, the notion that there
is an underworld of chambers

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:23.730 align:middle line:84%
and passageways beneath
the Giza Plateau

00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:27.250 align:middle line:84%
is well-founded in the
ancient Egyptian texts.

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:31.320 align:middle line:84%
After all, the ancient
name for Giza was Rostau.

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And Rostau is also found in
the ancient Egyptian Books

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:36.690 align:middle line:84%
of the Dead, and
in particularly,

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:39.670 align:middle line:84%
in what's called the
Book-- what is in the Duat.

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:42.540 align:middle line:84%
The Duat was the ancient
Egyptian afterlife realm,

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:45.105 align:middle line:84%
which at one level, is an
area of the skyline, quite

00:26:45.105 --> 00:26:47.300 align:middle line:84%
an interesting area of
the sky in its own right,

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.420 align:middle line:84%
involving the
constellation of Orion

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:51.320 align:middle line:84%
over to the
constellation of Leo.

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And at another level, is
a three-dimensional space

00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:59.680 align:middle line:84%
of underground chambers and
corridors and passageways.

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And there's a very
strong suggestion

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:06.400 align:middle line:84%
that this notion of as above,
so below, that what is in heaven

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.210 align:middle line:90%
is replicated upon the earth.

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:12.359 align:middle line:84%
That we should expect to find
an underworld of chambers

00:27:12.359 --> 00:27:14.650 align:middle line:84%
and corridors and passageways
beneath the Giza Plateau,

00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:17.640 align:middle line:84%
and all the indications are
that we are seeing that today.

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And that the
subterranean chamber

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:22.760 align:middle line:84%
beneath the Great Pyramid and
that odd dead-end passageway

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.970 align:middle line:84%
that runs off it,
they're part of this.

00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:27.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Most people
who are not intimately

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.470 align:middle line:84%
familiar with this, like
I've been since the 1990s

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:32.810 align:middle line:84%
when I read "Fingerprints,"
may not know Zahi Hawass.

00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Zahi Hawass is the director
of Egyptian antiquities.

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Well, he was
for a very long time.

00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Zahi's star somewhat fell with
the fall of the Mubarak regime

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:50.410 align:middle line:90%
in Egypt in the Arab Spring.

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:53.900 align:middle line:84%
Zahi was very closely
connected to President Mubarak

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:59.440 align:middle line:84%
and to his wife Susan
Mubarack, and for decades, he

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:02.100 align:middle line:90%
ran the Giza Plateau.

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:05.390 align:middle line:84%
He started out as a junior
inspector on the Giza Plateau,

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:08.060 align:middle line:84%
and at that point, he was
picked out by the Edgar Cayce

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Organization and
sent through college,

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.010 align:middle line:84%
and then returned
to the Giza Plateau.

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And then began to rise very
rapidly through the ranks

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:18.120 align:middle line:84%
until he became the Chief
Inspector on the Giza Plateau,

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:21.100 align:middle line:84%
and then laterally, a minister
in the Egyptian government

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:25.180 align:middle line:84%
with specific responsibility
for the Giza pyramids

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:26.090 align:middle line:90%
and the Sphinx.

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:29.150 align:middle line:84%
So nobody could do anything
on the Giza Plateau

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:31.860 align:middle line:84%
without the go ahead
of Zahi Hawass.

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:35.050 align:middle line:84%
Zahi was, if you like,
the modern pharaoh

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:37.070 align:middle line:90%
off the pyramids.

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:39.170 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't move an
inch on the Giza Plateau

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:41.090 align:middle line:90%
without his say so.

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:41.940 align:middle line:90%
It had to be done.

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:44.820 align:middle line:84%
Any TV crew that worked
there, any archaeologist that

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:47.670 align:middle line:84%
worked there, any research, it
all have to go through Zahi.

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:49.140 align:middle line:90%
If he said yes, you could do it.

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:50.800 align:middle line:84%
If he said no, you
couldn't do it.

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.720 align:middle line:84%
It was a simple one
stop shop for working

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:54.630 align:middle line:90%
on the Giza Plateau.

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And what was his
opinion about Atlantis

00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:58.160 align:middle line:84%
or any of these
alternative theories?

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.076 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Well, you
see, this is the problem,

00:29:00.076 --> 00:29:05.630 align:middle line:84%
because Zahi has this heritage
of being sent through college

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:08.750 align:middle line:84%
by the Edgar Cayce Organization,
he continues to this day

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:11.917 align:middle line:84%
to give lectures at the
ARE in Virginia Beach,

00:29:11.917 --> 00:29:14.500 align:middle line:84%
but if you ask him about this,
he says, oh, it's all nonsense.

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe in
Atlantis at all.

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And he's more Catholic
than the pope, you know.

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:23.420 align:middle line:84%
He's the mainstream
archaeologists mainstream

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:27.120 align:middle line:84%
archaeologist, and he's the
popular face of Egyptology.

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.100 align:middle line:84%
He's been on so
many documentaries

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:34.030 align:middle line:84%
constantly repeating and
reemphasizing the mainstream

00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:37.450 align:middle line:84%
view and ridiculing
alternative views,

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:39.694 align:middle line:84%
but his heritage is in
the alternative side.

00:29:39.694 --> 00:29:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So what if we wanted to
send somebody out there and try

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:48.299 align:middle line:84%
to drill a core sample down into
this chamber under the Sphinx?

00:29:48.299 --> 00:29:50.840 align:middle line:84%
Is Zahi going to let that-- or
would he have let that happen?

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Well,
he said we wouldn't

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:56.600 align:middle line:84%
let that happen when he was
running the show, whether it

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.260 align:middle line:90%
could happen now, I don't know.

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:02.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what powers
are at work in Giza today.

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:07.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm interested to see
what happens next,

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:11.160 align:middle line:84%
and Zahi's star did fall with
the fall of the Mubarak regime,

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:14.540 align:middle line:84%
but he is rapidly
rehabilitating himself.

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:17.110 align:middle line:90%
He is Teflon man.

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:19.130 align:middle line:90%
Nothing sticks to him.

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And he's a very powerful
figure, and in some ways,

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.090 align:middle line:90%
a very engaging figure.

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:26.950 align:middle line:84%
He's an excellent talker, and
he knows his stuff for sure.

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:30.340 align:middle line:84%
Many people feel that he's been
very beneficial and positive

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:33.370 align:middle line:84%
for Egypt in many ways and
has brought huge numbers

00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:35.040 align:middle line:90%
of tourists to Egypt.

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:39.980 align:middle line:84%
He's a major player at Giza
and continues to be so.

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:41.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So let's
go back now to where

00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:45.260 align:middle line:84%
we were, "The Temple of
Osiris," this television

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:49.900 align:middle line:84%
documentary shows up on
television where Zahi is saying

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:52.990 align:middle line:84%
there's all these
underground passageways,

00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:55.310 align:middle line:84%
nobody's really talking
about how much work

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:58.340 align:middle line:84%
it would take to pull all
that stone out of the ground.

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:00.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: No, nobody's
thinking it through.

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's considering
what it might

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.870 align:middle line:84%
mean, that some huge
ancient project is

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:06.355 align:middle line:90%
being evidenced here.

00:31:06.355 --> 00:31:08.600 align:middle line:84%
A project that we
don't understand,

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:11.402 align:middle line:84%
which gets to the heart of
what Giza is really all about.

00:31:11.402 --> 00:31:12.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And then
they're claiming,

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:17.530 align:middle line:84%
similar to Geraldo Rivera
with the Al Capone vault,

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:21.072 align:middle line:84%
that they're opening this
sarcophagus for the first time.

00:31:21.072 --> 00:31:22.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: That was
so staged, wasn't it?

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:23.730 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:25.135 align:middle line:90%
And then they find what inside?

00:31:25.135 --> 00:31:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: I don't
even remember.

00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:26.780 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Nothing.

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:27.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Nothing basically.

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:29.255 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: There was
nothing, just a big empty.

00:31:29.255 --> 00:31:30.130 align:middle line:90%
It was a big letdown.

00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:31.588 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: It was
a huge non-event.

00:31:31.588 --> 00:31:32.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: It was
a huge non-event,

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:37.400 align:middle line:84%
and there have been quite a
number of these non-events

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:40.450 align:middle line:84%
where the public
is kind of wound up

00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:44.210 align:middle line:84%
to a pitch of anticipation,
and then nothing actually

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:46.440 align:middle line:90%
happens in the end.

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.560 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what's going on.

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:50.730 align:middle line:84%
I feel we're being
managed and manipulated,

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:53.044 align:middle line:90%
our opinions our understandings.

00:31:53.044 --> 00:31:55.210 align:middle line:84%
We're not being allowed to
get to the truth of Giza,

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:56.640 align:middle line:84%
and that's part
of what I've tried

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.014 align:middle line:84%
to do with my work
over the years

00:31:58.014 --> 00:32:01.570 align:middle line:84%
is to bring some
alternative information.

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Much work would it take
for allegedly primitive society

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:09.540 align:middle line:84%
like the Egyptians to dig
out a cathedral-sized room

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:13.750 align:middle line:84%
underground out of the
straight ahead bedrock

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:15.932 align:middle line:84%
and then keep bringing that
rock up to the surface?

00:32:15.932 --> 00:32:18.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Well, it was a
gigantic project, but so is

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:19.348 align:middle line:90%
the building of the pyramids.

00:32:19.348 --> 00:32:21.470 align:middle line:90%


00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:24.770 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at a superhuman
effort here, something

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:27.810 align:middle line:90%
above and beyond the ordinary.

00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:29.690 align:middle line:90%
This is a-- and we know that.

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:33.060 align:middle line:84%
Anybody who really goes
to Giza with an open mind

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:35.380 align:middle line:84%
and feels the energy in the
atmosphere of that place,

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:36.910 align:middle line:90%
knows that it's very special.

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:39.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So as you just
heard, the tunneling effort

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:41.530 align:middle line:90%
was superhuman in nature.

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:43.035 align:middle line:84%
There's an incredible
amount of rock

00:32:43.035 --> 00:32:44.826 align:middle line:84%
that would have had to
have been pulled out

00:32:44.826 --> 00:32:46.320 align:middle line:90%
by any conventional means.

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:49.309 align:middle line:84%
So this is very,
very interesting.

00:32:49.309 --> 00:32:50.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the next
episode, we're going

00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:54.580 align:middle line:84%
to finalize our interview
with Graham Hancock

00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:59.520 align:middle line:84%
and finalize our 14 part
miniseries on ancient history.

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:03.490 align:middle line:10%
And here is where we're going to
hear Hancock's view summarizing

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:05.650 align:middle line:10%
all of the different
things that we've learned

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:07.420 align:middle line:10%
throughout this miniseries.

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:09.250 align:middle line:10%
Talking about the
Orion correlation

00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:12.170 align:middle line:10%
theory of Robert Bauval,
talking about the Sphinx water

00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:15.820 align:middle line:10%
weathering of John Anthony
West, tying together the giants

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:17.950 align:middle line:10%
that Andrew Collins
was talking about,

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:21.050 align:middle line:10%
tying together the
proto civilization

00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:23.540 align:middle line:10%
and the unified teaching that
spread out over the world

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:25.820 align:middle line:10%
that Laird Scranton
has been talking about.

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:28.260 align:middle line:84%
All the different pieces
are coming together,

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:31.850 align:middle line:84%
coming up next time in our final
interview with Graham Hancock

00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:35.460 align:middle line:84%
and our final section
of this ancient history

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:37.890 align:middle line:90%
subdivision of "Disclosure."

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:41.200 align:middle line:84%
I hope you'll be here next time
to enjoy it, I know I will.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:44.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm waiting here for ya, just
turn it on and we'll be here.

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:45.990 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for watching.
