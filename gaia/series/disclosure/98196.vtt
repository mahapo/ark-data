>>DAVID WILCOCK:
I'm David Wilcock,

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.670 align:middle line:90%
and this is "Disclosure."

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.040 align:middle line:10%
What you are about to see is one
of the most important, concise,

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.110 align:middle line:10%
information-packed episodes
of our entire show--

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.030 align:middle line:10%
and some of the most
important information

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.540 align:middle line:10%
that I feel we could
possibly get into.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about my
second and final interview

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.200 align:middle line:84%
with Andrew Collins, who has
done incredible work in really

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.670 align:middle line:84%
showing us the
big picture of how

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.430 align:middle line:84%
all these different pieces
of ancient civilizations

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.480 align:middle line:84%
and extraterrestrials
colonizing the Earth-- how

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.660 align:middle line:90%
all that stuff fits together.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.600 align:middle line:84%
There's some very,
very fascinating stuff

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.350 align:middle line:90%
in this episode.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.634 align:middle line:84%
In fact, just my written notes
on all of the specific factoids

00:01:00.634 --> 00:01:02.300 align:middle line:84%
that Andrew goes
through in this episode

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.750 align:middle line:84%
is like three pages
long, all single-spaced.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.530 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.290 align:middle line:84%
What we're going to be
hearing about in this episode

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.380 align:middle line:84%
is centering on this
legend of the giants.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.220 align:middle line:90%
But it's not just a legend.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.240 align:middle line:84%
As it turns out,
giant skeletons have

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.090 align:middle line:90%
been found all over the planet.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.360 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are around
7 to 8 feet tall,

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.090 align:middle line:84%
but believe it or not,
many, many examples

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.000 align:middle line:84%
of giant skeletons have
been found all the way up

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.190 align:middle line:90%
to 12 to 13 feet in height.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just
that they're taller.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.500 align:middle line:84%
There are cases in which
the skull is literally

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.650 align:middle line:84%
is large as a big oak barrel,
and the bone on the skull

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.920 align:middle line:90%
is one inch thick.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, Andrew
Collins and I really

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.450 align:middle line:84%
get into this, because,
for some reason,

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.230 align:middle line:84%
there has been a very
clear orchestrated campaign

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.190 align:middle line:84%
to completely wipe
the slate clean

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.510 align:middle line:84%
of any records of
these giant skeletons.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.310 align:middle line:84%
It's as if someone
who is very powerful

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.940 align:middle line:84%
never wants us to
figure this out.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.610 align:middle line:84%
If we knew that there were 12
to 13 foot tall humans on Earth

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.660 align:middle line:84%
up until the very
recent past-- in fact,

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.600 align:middle line:84%
you're going to find out
that eyewitnesses saw them

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.050 align:middle line:90%
on Easter Island in the 1700s.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.860 align:middle line:84%
Explorers like de Soto saw them
when they came to the Americas

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.630 align:middle line:90%
in recent past.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.090 align:middle line:90%
These people were very real.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.150 align:middle line:84%
We've found thousands and
thousands of their skeletons,

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.970 align:middle line:84%
and all of that evidence
has been suppressed.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.880 align:middle line:90%
What is going on here?

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.210 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
the giant skeletons

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.250 align:middle line:84%
are the remains of an
extraterrestrial human species

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.420 align:middle line:84%
that is actually a hybrid
between extraterrestrial

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.320 align:middle line:84%
visitors known in the Book
of Enoch as the Watchers,

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.890 align:middle line:84%
and the native
humans here on Earth?

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.200 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that their
children became these giants?

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And, as he goes through
in this interview

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.470 align:middle line:84%
that we are now hearing about,
people called Denisovans--

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.240 align:middle line:84%
or Denisovans-- and
that the Denisovans,

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.450 align:middle line:84%
their DNA is still a
part of who we are now.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And some of the Denisovans,
their actual remains

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.720 align:middle line:84%
of which very little has
been officially announced,

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.660 align:middle line:84%
show that their teeth
could be twice the size

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.370 align:middle line:90%
of our own teeth.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.100 align:middle line:90%
Now, that suggests giants.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And if you think that
the subject of giants

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.730 align:middle line:84%
is hokey or
superstitious, it's only

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.900 align:middle line:84%
because the people researching
ancient civilizations

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.810 align:middle line:84%
were not really on
the track of this.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.430 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I only
started to really

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.640 align:middle line:84%
get on the track
of giants recently,

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.470 align:middle line:84%
and I've discovered
that it is, in a sense,

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.440 align:middle line:84%
the central architecture
that draws together

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.670 align:middle line:84%
so many different
data points, including

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.770 align:middle line:84%
the idea that the number
one member of the Watchers,

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.240 align:middle line:84%
of these fallen angels,
called himself Lucifer.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And it may be that these
Watchers were, in fact,

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.620 align:middle line:90%
reptilian-appearing humans.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.270 align:middle line:84%
This may be why
we have the legend

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.790 align:middle line:84%
of the nagas in the
Hindu tradition-- people

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:04.960 align:middle line:90%
that look like serpents.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.730 align:middle line:84%
There are serpentine
beings apparently

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.100 align:middle line:84%
around the time all
of the step pyramids

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.200 align:middle line:84%
that were built in
Mesoamerica, hence

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.510 align:middle line:84%
there are frequent references
to Quetzalcoatl, the serpent.

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.490 align:middle line:84%
This is something
very interesting.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.459 align:middle line:84%
It's something we've explored
on "Ancient Aliens" quite a bit,

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.250 align:middle line:84%
and now I'm getting
into it here-- the idea

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.540 align:middle line:84%
that these reptilian-looking
humans innerbred with us.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And maybe because their DNA
was really supercharged,

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.270 align:middle line:84%
the offspring actually
became much taller.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.290 align:middle line:90%
They looked sort of like us.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.730 align:middle line:84%
They had white skin,
red hair or blonde hair,

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.550 align:middle line:84%
but they were really,
really tall, in many cases.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.060 align:middle line:90%
And they kept their secrets.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.650 align:middle line:84%
So is it possible that
their descendants actually

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.050 align:middle line:84%
developed the ability
to become gods among us

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.830 align:middle line:84%
and that they saved all of
their secrets, kept their power,

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.030 align:middle line:90%
and are hiding it from us?

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.650 align:middle line:84%
This may sound like
conspiracy theory you

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.220 align:middle line:84%
but it's a very
compelling narrative.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.020 align:middle line:90%
Check it out.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.637 align:middle line:90%
Andrew Collins, welcome back.

00:05:05.637 --> 00:05:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW COLLINS:
Thank you very much.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: This is incredible
information-- exactly what

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.540 align:middle line:90%
I was hoping we'd get into.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.630 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to take an
episode and focus

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:22.330 align:middle line:84%
on the subject of the Anunnaki
and the subject of the giants

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.570 align:middle line:84%
and the skeletons and the actual
archaeological evidence that

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:26.800 align:middle line:90%
has been found.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Because even for people
within our field,

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.910 align:middle line:84%
I feel this is almost
virgin territory.

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.580 align:middle line:84%
You're actually one of the
longest-standing scholars who's

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.990 align:middle line:84%
investigated this subject
and really gotten into.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.664 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about the Book
of Enoch in a previous episode.

00:05:44.664 --> 00:05:45.330 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And I think that's
a very, very important point

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.060 align:middle line:90%
to jump off of again.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.334 align:middle line:90%
That book is ancient, right?

00:05:52.334 --> 00:05:53.250 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Absolutely.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It's comparable to
the Book of Genesis in its age.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.010 align:middle line:10%
>>COLLINS: I mean,
obviously the earliest forms

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.480 align:middle line:10%
of both of those books come
from exactly the same place,

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.820 align:middle line:10%
and that's the Dead Sea Scrolls.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.800 align:middle line:10%
And although in
their material form,

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.810 align:middle line:10%
the Dead Sea Scrolls
probably only date

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:15.280 align:middle line:10%
to maybe the first century
B.C. The form that they take

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.630 align:middle line:10%
suggests that they probably
go back to at least 200 to 300

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.110 align:middle line:10%
B.C. Now, that doesn't
sound like a long time ago,

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.050 align:middle line:10%
but that's in
their current form.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.430 align:middle line:84%
But what's quite clear is
of that the Book of Enoch

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.410 align:middle line:84%
is actually made up of much
earlier texts, one of which

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.300 align:middle line:84%
the title is known, and
that's the Book of Noah.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And the Book of Noah quite
clearly predates all of these,

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.050 align:middle line:84%
and almost certainly was
constructed in the area

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:45.670 align:middle line:84%
that we now know as Eastern
Anatolia, which is also

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:48.290 align:middle line:90%
known as Northern Mesopotamia.

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And it was constructed
in this area--

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.960 align:middle line:84%
whether even just as an
oral book at that point.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And most of these
ideas were brought

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:59.990 align:middle line:84%
into Canaan, the promise
land of God, as it were,

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:06.750 align:middle line:84%
by Abraham, and his family,
and the other proto-Israelites.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:12.256 align:middle line:84%
Because they began their
journey in Southeast Anatolia.

00:07:12.256 --> 00:07:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now let me just ask you
a brief question that picks up

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.504 align:middle line:84%
on what we said in the previous
episode, which most people will

00:07:17.504 --> 00:07:18.430 align:middle line:90%
have watched.

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.800 align:middle line:84%
Gobekli Tepe, 10,000
years old plus,

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.570 align:middle line:84%
because it's a Stonehenge-type
series of monuments

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.040 align:middle line:84%
buried under the dirt, and
the dirt's been carbon-dated.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.230 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.554 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Is Gobekli Tepe
in Eastern Anatolia?

00:07:29.554 --> 00:07:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Absolutely.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:33.870 align:middle line:84%
Gobekli Tepe is just
eight miles from the city

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:39.390 align:middle line:84%
of what's today Sanliurfa, which
was the ancient city of Odessa

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:40.530 align:middle line:90%
in the Bible.

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's also Ur of
the Chaldees, the place

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:46.890 align:middle line:90%
that Abraham was born.

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:52.360 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's a cave
shrine still there today,

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:58.350 align:middle line:84%
where thousands of people come
to revere the birth of Abraham

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:01.030 align:middle line:90%
to this day-- Muslim people.

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's fully believed
by the people of Turkey

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.870 align:middle line:84%
that this is where
Abraham was born.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And although you'll find
in the history books

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:16.400 align:middle line:84%
that Sir Leonard
Woolley investigated

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.070 align:middle line:84%
a city called Ur in
Southern Iraq, which

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:22.037 align:middle line:84%
is considered to be
Ur of the Chaldees,

00:08:22.037 --> 00:08:23.370 align:middle line:90%
I think that's absolutely wrong.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:26.010 align:middle line:84%
Because the actual folklore
of tradition surrounding

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:32.380 align:middle line:84%
where Ur, where Abraham was
born, is in Southeast Anatolia,

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.900 align:middle line:84%
just a few models away
from Gobekli Tepe.

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And the importance here is
that Abraham was the guy who,

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:45.700 align:middle line:84%
the patriarch who brought the
ideas of the proto-Israelites

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:50.030 align:middle line:84%
in Canaan, where they
established themselves

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.260 align:middle line:84%
and where the Bible was
eventually formulated and put

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:53.960 align:middle line:90%
down.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.080 align:middle line:84%
So we know that these
early ideas came

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.460 align:middle line:84%
from the very area of
Gobekli Tepe themself,

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.360 align:middle line:84%
and that's very, very
important, because--

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So this could actually
be the original human nursery.

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:05.480 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Absolutely.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.400 align:middle line:84%
It is the original
Garden of Eden.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:06.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Because
the Adam and Eve

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.180 align:middle line:84%
creation story is that
humans were created here.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:10.096 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Absolutely.

00:09:10.096 --> 00:09:11.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, here's
something that I only

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:13.740 align:middle line:90%
found out within the last year.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's the fact that one
of the names of Sanliurfa

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:22.230 align:middle line:84%
in the past was Adamna, which
means the place of Adam.

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:23.960 align:middle line:84%
Which I-- you
know, to be honest,

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.085 align:middle line:84%
it's not even in my book,
because I only found this

00:09:26.085 --> 00:09:27.601 align:middle line:90%
out when I was there last year.

00:09:27.601 --> 00:09:28.142 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:09:28.142 --> 00:09:28.766 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:09:28.766 --> 00:09:31.600 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: So this
is the place of Adam.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.350 align:middle line:84%
Even the lead archaeologist
that was doing all the work

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:38.755 align:middle line:84%
at Gobekli Tepe-- professor
Klaus Schmidt, who

00:09:38.755 --> 00:09:42.990 align:middle line:84%
was the guy who really sort of
rediscovered it in the 1990s

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:46.720 align:middle line:84%
and worked there through until
his unfortunate and quite

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.710 align:middle line:84%
sudden death earlier
on this year.

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:56.490 align:middle line:84%
He has linked this site not
only with the Garden of Eden,

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:59.670 align:middle line:84%
but also with the Watchers
of the Book of Enoch.

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:02.110 align:middle line:84%
He's mentioned this in
one or two interviews.

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:03.410 align:middle line:90%
But also the Anunnaki.

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:06.860 align:middle line:84%
He's actually
suggested that place,

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:10.735 align:middle line:84%
this mountaintop on which
Gobekli Tepe is placed

00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:15.765 align:middle line:84%
was the original Duku mound, the
place where the Anunnaki were

00:10:15.765 --> 00:10:18.910 align:middle line:84%
born, it was said-- the place
where they gave humanity

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.490 align:middle line:84%
the first grain, the
first sheep, which

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:25.890 align:middle line:84%
is a reference almost certainly
to the origins of agriculture

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:29.400 align:middle line:84%
and animal husbandry, which
both took place in this region

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.980 align:middle line:90%
around 11,000 years ago.

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I'd like to
drop something on you.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.970 align:middle line:84%
It's a little wild card
here, but bear with me.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:39.970 align:middle line:84%
I have an insider who does not
want to come forward on camera,

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:41.940 align:middle line:84%
but he worked at
a very high level.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.440 align:middle line:84%
He worked in the
Reagan administration

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.530 align:middle line:90%
in very classified programs.

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:48.570 align:middle line:84%
This insider came
across a series

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:54.357 align:middle line:84%
of documents procured by Howard
Hughes, the aviation pioneer.

00:10:54.357 --> 00:10:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And Howard Hughes, in the
course of working with defense

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:58.860 align:middle line:84%
contractors, figured
out that there

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:03.660 align:middle line:84%
was an Illuminati, or a
cabal-- an occult world group

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.860 align:middle line:90%
that was controlling things.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:13.170 align:middle line:84%
He actually hired women to work
as undercover sex workers, who

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.320 align:middle line:84%
then had sex with
some of these people

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.640 align:middle line:84%
and got them under
drug influence

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.670 align:middle line:84%
to reveal what their
cult was teaching.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And what Howard
Hughes' documents

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.750 align:middle line:84%
from these various
couriers came up with

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:27.770 align:middle line:84%
is that these people
believe that they

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.220 align:middle line:90%
are the descendants of Lucifer.

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.470 align:middle line:84%
They actually-- they have a
mythology that says that when

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:35.710 align:middle line:84%
Eve bit the apple in
the Garden of Eden,

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:39.770 align:middle line:84%
that the apple that
Lucifer tempted her with

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:42.635 align:middle line:84%
was actually sex with
an extraterrestrial, one

00:11:42.635 --> 00:11:44.230 align:middle line:90%
of these Watchers.

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And they linked it to
the Book of the Watchers

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.090 align:middle line:90%
and the Book of the Enoch.

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And the idea being
that one of Eve's kids

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.000 align:middle line:90%
was Lucifer's kid, that's Cain.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And the other child, Abel,
was the child of Adam.

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:01.856 align:middle line:84%
And so this group--
the important point

00:12:01.856 --> 00:12:03.230 align:middle line:84%
is whether it's
true or not, they

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:07.300 align:middle line:84%
believe that they are the
descendants of Cain-- hence

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:11.150 align:middle line:84%
Canaan and Canaan Land,
and actually, apparently,

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:12.520 align:middle line:90%
John McCain.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
interesting connections here.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.480 align:middle line:84%
The Masons have the Tubal-cain
as their basic thing.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And if you see the movie "Noah,"
with Russell Crowe, which

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:24.830 align:middle line:84%
I only watched after he
told me all of this--

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:27.360 align:middle line:84%
and it didn't even come until
after he told me all of this--

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.670 align:middle line:84%
they have the bloodline
of Cain and the flood,

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:34.295 align:middle line:84%
and the bloodline of Cain is
denied entry to Noah's Ark.

00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:34.920 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Mhm.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:35.370 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:35.869 align:middle line:90%
Well--

00:12:35.869 --> 00:12:37.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So what do you
think about all that?

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.700 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: I mean, obviously
I can't verify the story.

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.710 align:middle line:84%
But we come back to some
fundamental issues, here.

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's the fact that, if the
Watchers existed, what, or who,

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.340 align:middle line:90%
were they?

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:51.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how can we
explain their existence?

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, if they
did exist in the past,

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:57.380 align:middle line:84%
are there survivors
still around today?

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.570 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what
it comes down to.

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:01.820 align:middle line:84%
So let's take the
first question first.

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:02.320 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Who or what are they?

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:07.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, the evidence I
seem to have accumulated

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:09.590 align:middle line:84%
would tend to suggest that
they were very striking

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:11.282 align:middle line:90%
in appearance, to start with.

00:13:11.282 --> 00:13:12.490 align:middle line:90%
They were probably very tall.

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:15.326 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Is it possible
that those descriptions--

00:13:15.326 --> 00:13:17.200 align:middle line:84%
because you mentioned
in the previous episode

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.870 align:middle line:84%
they had glowing eyes, and I
want to go through that again.

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:21.586 align:middle line:84%
The skeptic with
their arms crossed--

00:13:21.586 --> 00:13:22.710 align:middle line:90%
they always do that, right?

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:25.430 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be
saying, oh, they just

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:27.720 align:middle line:84%
mistranslated the
words, and it's just

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.052 align:middle line:84%
a misunderstanding of a
word, and that kind of thing.

00:13:30.052 --> 00:13:31.010 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Well, maybe.

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:32.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Is it possible
that that could be?

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:33.220 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Maybe.

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:34.844 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the thing is
that when somebody

00:13:34.844 --> 00:13:37.161 align:middle line:84%
is said to have eyes that
shine like the Sun, what

00:13:37.161 --> 00:13:38.160 align:middle line:90%
does that actually mean?

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.779 align:middle line:84%
I mean, does it mean that rays
of light come out of them?

00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:41.320 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.861 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously
we can interpret it

00:13:42.861 --> 00:13:44.830 align:middle line:90%
in whatever way we wish.

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:47.300 align:middle line:84%
To me, it suggested
that their eyes

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:51.170 align:middle line:84%
are strange-- there's something
about them, something unique.

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And they're said to almost
have a glow about them,

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:56.050 align:middle line:84%
whether it be their
skin, whether it

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:58.840 align:middle line:84%
be their hair-- which
is, to be honest,

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.480 align:middle line:84%
described as white
when it is described.

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:05.650 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: And although
these are really

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:10.150 align:middle line:84%
sort of quite iffy ways of
describing it-- because,

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:13.420 align:middle line:84%
you know, you start thinking
of quite sort of Aryan ideas

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:15.950 align:middle line:84%
and things like that,
which is not there

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:17.940 align:middle line:90%
within the Book of Enoch.

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:21.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, clearly you're
describing a type of people.

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And the evidence that I
seem to have accumulated

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:27.560 align:middle line:84%
relating to their
origins-- if indeed they

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.280 align:middle line:84%
were the founders
of civilization,

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.175 align:middle line:84%
and the Garden of Eden, the
cradle of civilization, which

00:14:33.175 --> 00:14:40.820 align:middle line:84%
is Southeast Anatolia--
is that they were probably

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:44.620 align:middle line:84%
an elite that came into the
region from somewhere else.

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.260 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to
say, well, where?

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, the evidence suggests
they came in from the north,

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:52.350 align:middle line:84%
from the area of
what is today Central

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:55.790 align:middle line:90%
Russia-- the Russian plane.

00:14:55.790 --> 00:15:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And that they were part of a
culture that existed just prior

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:06.640 align:middle line:84%
to the foundation of
Gobekli Tepe, who stretched

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:10.420 align:middle line:84%
from the Carpathian Mountains
in Central Europe right

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:15.485 align:middle line:84%
the way across to some of the
big rivers in Central Russia,

00:15:15.485 --> 00:15:20.140 align:middle line:84%
and possibly even with links as
Far East as the Ural Mountains.

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And they were known
as the Swiderians.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is a term
which refers not

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:28.230 align:middle line:84%
so much to their
appearance, necessarily,

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:31.670 align:middle line:84%
but to the tradition,
as it's known,

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:35.120 align:middle line:84%
of their stone technology,
which was extremely advanced.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.490 align:middle line:84%
These people were
the earliest miners.

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:42.400 align:middle line:84%
They were possibly some of
the earliest astronomers.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.890 align:middle line:84%
They had this
incredible technology--

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:51.320 align:middle line:84%
that they were creating
built structures, log houses.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:55.560 align:middle line:84%
And more important is
that, anatomically, they

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.730 align:middle line:84%
would seem to have been
slightly different to us,

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:01.910 align:middle line:84%
or certainly the anatomical
evidence that's come out,

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:03.780 align:middle line:84%
they would seem to
almost certainly

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:10.380 align:middle line:84%
have belonged to a right type
of human which was a hybrid.

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And we're not talking
here about alien hybrids.

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:17.160 align:middle line:84%
We talking about the admixture
between two different types

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:21.510 align:middle line:84%
of human-- one being ourselves,
anatomically modern humans,

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:24.110 align:middle line:84%
which, obviously today
we'd see as Homo sapien

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:29.390 align:middle line:84%
sapiens-- and another
type of human or hominid,

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:31.320 align:middle line:90%
as it would be, known.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.655 align:middle line:84%
And that seems to have
been Neanderthals.

00:16:33.655 --> 00:16:38.170 align:middle line:84%
The Neanderthal people have
had bad press, in all honesty.

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:40.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they've been made
out to be almost ape-like,

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:45.140 align:middle line:84%
and sort of crouching down,
and sort of been pretty thick

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.760 align:middle line:84%
and sort of not done
much with their lives,

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.790 align:middle line:84%
and eventually
probably wiped out

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:51.720 align:middle line:84%
by the humans that
came and replaced them,

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:57.110 align:middle line:84%
or they were wiped out in
some kind of Ice Age cataclysm

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:58.260 align:middle line:90%
or something like this.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:02.050 align:middle line:84%
But the evidence would seem to
suggest that they could even

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:06.079 align:middle line:84%
have been more intelligent
than the earliest humans

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:10.589 align:middle line:84%
when they arrived in Europe
about 40,000, 45,000 years ago,

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:16.050 align:middle line:84%
and that we actually inherited
from them, both verbally

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:21.030 align:middle line:84%
but also probably genetically,
a lot of their ideas relating

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:28.480 align:middle line:84%
to the importance of creativity,
of art, and dreams, and magic,

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:32.870 align:middle line:84%
and connections with the
sky world, with the stars,

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:38.310 align:middle line:84%
and the contact with
otherworldly realms.

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And this admixture,
this hybridization,

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:47.240 align:middle line:84%
created a new type of being--
something that was not

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:50.040 align:middle line:84%
just human, but
something that was

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.125 align:middle line:84%
very tall, had
extremely long heads--

00:17:53.125 --> 00:17:57.300 align:middle line:84%
elongated heads, which were
eventually probably replicated

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.960 align:middle line:84%
through artificial
deformation of them.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.300 align:middle line:84%
And these people
were quite tall.

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And they came south at the
time of a cataclysm known

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:12.720 align:middle line:84%
as the Younger
Dryas event, which

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:17.990 align:middle line:84%
seems to involve a comet impact
around 10,900 B.C., which

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:22.570 align:middle line:84%
caused fire and flood of
the sort which is recorded

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:26.610 align:middle line:84%
in biblical tradition-- but
also a mini Ice Age that

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:31.540 align:middle line:84%
lasted for 1,300 years, which
pushed people further south.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And almost certainly,
people were

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:38.220 align:middle line:84%
pushed down between the Black
Sea and the Caspian Sea, down

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:41.390 align:middle line:84%
through the Caucasus
Mountains, and ended up

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.840 align:middle line:84%
in Eastern or
Southeastern Anatolia--

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:49.827 align:middle line:84%
right in the very area that
Gobekli Tepe then rises

00:18:49.827 --> 00:18:52.270 align:middle line:90%
from almost nothing, basically.

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's my opinion
that Gobekli Tepe

00:18:55.160 --> 00:19:00.130 align:middle line:84%
was created by human hybrids--
admixtures between Neanderthals

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:02.180 align:middle line:90%
and anatomically modern humans.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And they look
striking, these people.

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And because they
look so different,

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:08.700 align:middle line:84%
the local population
that would seem

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:12.320 align:middle line:84%
to have been quite different
in appearance and perhaps even

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:18.560 align:middle line:84%
mindset-- the way that they
remember these encounters

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.890 align:middle line:84%
with these people, who would
seem to have come in and taken

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:27.380 align:middle line:84%
control of the local population,
and to have been an elite,

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:28.970 align:middle line:84%
and to have created
a tiered society,

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:31.530 align:middle line:84%
which would have been
necessary to create something

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:33.050 align:middle line:90%
like Gobekli Tepe.

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:35.910 align:middle line:84%
The way that they
remembered comes down to us

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:38.160 align:middle line:84%
as the stories of the
Watchers and the Anunnaki

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:41.940 align:middle line:84%
and the immortals
of Iranian myth

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:45.170 align:middle line:84%
and various other gods-- even
though the gods of Olympus,

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:46.730 align:middle line:90%
if you like.

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is really
what's going on here,

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.570 align:middle line:84%
that these gods, these
immortals, these human angels

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:55.002 align:middle line:84%
are really human
hybrids, in my opinion.

00:19:55.002 --> 00:19:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: This brings up a
really interesting subject,

00:19:57.210 --> 00:20:00.884 align:middle line:84%
which is I've been looking at
the research of various people

00:20:00.884 --> 00:20:02.050 align:middle line:90%
who are studying the giants.

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:04.600 align:middle line:84%
I got a stack of books
on giants right now.

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:07.060 align:middle line:84%
One of the names that
pops up is Jim Vieira.

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And he has found over 1,500
academically documented

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:17.880 align:middle line:84%
accounts of discoveries of giant
skeletons all over the planet.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And this includes
a number of them

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:21.650 align:middle line:84%
that show up in
the New York Times.

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And you can still look them up
on the New York Times website.

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:29.570 align:middle line:84%
So as far as I know, the
amount of human remains

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:31.730 align:middle line:84%
that have been
found that are used

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:34.760 align:middle line:84%
to build the chronology
of human life

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:38.730 align:middle line:84%
on Earth-- all of those bones
can fit into one coffin.

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And yet the number of giant
skeletons that apparently have

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:43.950 align:middle line:90%
been found vastly exceeds that.

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:46.064 align:middle line:84%
And yet it's all
been suppressed.

00:20:46.064 --> 00:20:46.980 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Absolutely.

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:47.530 align:middle line:90%
Um--

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:49.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Why do you think
it's being suppressed?

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:50.946 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Because
it doesn't fit.

00:20:50.946 --> 00:20:53.590 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't fit the
paradigm that existed

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:57.460 align:middle line:10%
in the 19th Century,
particularly,

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:00.800 align:middle line:10%
obviously, in the United
States, with the foundation

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:04.500 align:middle line:10%
of the Smithsonian
Institute and their control

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.350 align:middle line:10%
over archaeological excavations
all over the country.

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:12.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they were sending people
who were not even academics,

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:17.660 align:middle line:84%
in many cases, to excavate
mound sites and cemeteries

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:22.830 align:middle line:84%
of the Native American
peoples all over the country.

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And they were
documenting, in theory,

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:27.960 align:middle line:90%
what they were discovering.

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And very often, they would
describe the discovery

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:36.650 align:middle line:84%
of individual skeletons,
or collectively,

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:39.510 align:middle line:84%
that were at least 7 to 7
and 1/2 feet-- sometimes

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:43.670 align:middle line:84%
they're described as
much longer than that.

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's put this
into perspective.

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:48.400 align:middle line:84%
Some of these stories
can almost certainly

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.440 align:middle line:84%
be put down to a
misinterpretation

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.296 align:middle line:90%
of the evidence that's found.

00:21:53.296 --> 00:21:54.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the fact
of the matter is

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:59.690 align:middle line:84%
that when a skeleton is laid to
rest and laid out, over time,

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:03.500 align:middle line:84%
the pressure of the earth on
it will push the bones apart

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:07.520 align:middle line:84%
so that once just a
general measure is made

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:12.430 align:middle line:84%
of that skeleton when found,
it can be at least six inches,

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:18.080 align:middle line:84%
perhaps even a foot longer
than the actual skeleton when

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.390 align:middle line:90%
it was actually alive.

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:20.967 align:middle line:90%
That's a fact of archaeology.

00:22:20.967 --> 00:22:21.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:23.591 align:middle line:84%
But you have some people
saying they found skulls

00:22:23.591 --> 00:22:24.780 align:middle line:90%
as big as oak barrels--

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Oh, of course.

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:26.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: --that have
one-inch thick bone.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.060 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Absolutely.

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.430 align:middle line:84%
But-- and the other
thing is that some

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:31.900 align:middle line:84%
of these stories, at least,
particularly those that

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:35.020 align:middle line:84%
appeared within the
newspapers-- like the New York

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:40.080 align:middle line:84%
Times, Washington Post, and
whatever-- were the landowners

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:43.472 align:middle line:84%
trying to create some
kind of attention

00:22:43.472 --> 00:22:45.540 align:middle line:90%
to activities on their land.

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:47.140 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's a fact.

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:51.840 align:middle line:84%
Myself and my colleague Greg
Little researched for a book

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.770 align:middle line:84%
called "Path of
Souls," which looks

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:59.660 align:middle line:84%
into the whole story of the
giant skeletons of North

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:01.676 align:middle line:84%
America, but also
the fact that they

00:23:01.676 --> 00:23:04.670 align:middle line:84%
seem to have been
an elite that was

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:09.350 align:middle line:84%
behind the spread of the first
cosmology, the first star

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:13.460 align:middle line:84%
knowledge that was introduced
to the North American continent

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:18.230 align:middle line:84%
before the land bridge
between Alaska and Siberia

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:22.650 align:middle line:84%
was submerged, probably
around 8500 B.C.

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:23.950 align:middle line:90%
We looked into all of these.

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:26.082 align:middle line:84%
We looked into various
different accounts.

00:23:26.082 --> 00:23:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And some of them were
quite easily explainable.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:31.990 align:middle line:84%
We actually went to the places
where the skeletons were found,

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:35.420 align:middle line:84%
asked local archaeologists,
looked through local papers,

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:37.920 align:middle line:84%
and we got to the
bottom of some of it.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.610 align:middle line:84%
But having said
this, we also found

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:43.110 align:middle line:84%
that many of these accounts
were absolutely real,

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:45.130 align:middle line:90%
and that we went to the sites.

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And even the archaeologists
were providing us

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:52.190 align:middle line:84%
with more evidence of
giant remains being found.

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And this was all
over the country.

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.101 align:middle line:84%
But what was also
interesting is that there

00:23:57.101 --> 00:24:01.490 align:middle line:84%
were certain patterns relating
to where these giant skeletons

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:02.580 align:middle line:90%
were being found.

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:05.210 align:middle line:10%
And it was quite
clear that there

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:08.422 align:middle line:10%
was one area in the country
where they were found

00:24:08.422 --> 00:24:09.880 align:middle line:10%
more than anywhere
else, and that's

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:13.990 align:middle line:10%
the Kanawha Valley
of West Virginia.

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:17.470 align:middle line:84%
And here, there are dozens
and dozens of accounts

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:19.900 align:middle line:90%
of giant skeletons being found.

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, Greg did
a statistical analysis

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:26.690 align:middle line:84%
of the giant
skeletons as opposed

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:30.760 align:middle line:84%
to the regular-sized skeletons
that were found and documented.

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, these are
in Smithsonian reports.

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:36.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are not in
local newspapers or whatever.

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And the analysis
showed quite clearly

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:46.230 align:middle line:84%
that these giants
were not humans

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:48.340 align:middle line:84%
with some kind of
genetic disorder.

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:51.660 align:middle line:84%
Because obviously we have
giants in the world today.

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:53.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, many of them
play for baseball teams--

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.810 align:middle line:84%
national baseball
teams or whatever.

00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:58.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have
giants in the world.

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:01.290 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing that's
a problem with that.

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:04.770 align:middle line:84%
But most of these guys
suffer from what's

00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:10.100 align:middle line:84%
known as gigantism, which allows
their bodily form, their DNA,

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:15.830 align:middle line:84%
to supersize them at
the point of birth.

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:18.270 align:middle line:84%
These skeletons that have
been found in, as I say,

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:21.816 align:middle line:84%
West Virginia and also
in neighboring Ohio,

00:25:21.816 --> 00:25:24.300 align:middle line:84%
are nothing to do
with gigantism,

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:28.520 align:middle line:84%
or certainly the
percentage, average,

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:33.940 align:middle line:84%
suggests that these
populations had

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:38.190 align:middle line:84%
real population, real
societies, or whatever,

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:41.715 align:middle line:84%
or links that included a
number of different giants.

00:25:41.715 --> 00:25:44.450 align:middle line:84%
In other words, what
we're talking about here

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:47.549 align:middle line:84%
is that there were people
of exceptional size,

00:25:47.549 --> 00:25:49.340 align:middle line:84%
and they would have
children that were also

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:52.833 align:middle line:84%
of exceptional size, who
would also give birth to more

00:25:52.833 --> 00:25:54.470 align:middle line:90%
children of exceptional size.

00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:57.270 align:middle line:84%
In other words, this
was a race of giants.

00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:57.540 align:middle line:90%
That's really, really important.

00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:59.581 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Are you familiar
with the Paiute Indians

00:25:59.581 --> 00:26:02.075 align:middle line:84%
and the Si-Te-Cah, the
legend of these giants?

00:26:02.075 --> 00:26:03.200 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yes, absolutely.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:03.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.070 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Another example.

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:06.066 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:26:06.066 --> 00:26:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I mean, there
are dozens if not hundreds

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:14.780 align:middle line:84%
of legends that talk
about the encounters

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:17.840 align:middle line:84%
between the Native
American peoples

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:22.630 align:middle line:84%
and the giants who would seem
to have already been present

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:26.810 align:middle line:84%
in North America when they
arrived into those territories.

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And they had battles
with them, or the giants

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:31.470 align:middle line:84%
disappeared-- i.e.,
sort of withdrew

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:33.970 align:middle line:90%
to some other territory.

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:37.320 align:middle line:84%
They were killed in some
way or they died out.

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.966 align:middle line:90%
And these accounts are there.

00:26:38.966 --> 00:26:40.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, the
first Dutch explorer

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:45.470 align:middle line:84%
of Easter Island, Jacob
Roggeveen, gets there in 1714

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And finds this whole
group of people

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:51.130 align:middle line:84%
called Hanau epe, that are
apparently 12-foot-tall whites

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:52.054 align:middle line:90%
with red hair.

00:26:52.054 --> 00:26:52.970 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Absolutely.

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that,
you've got the fact

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:58.980 align:middle line:84%
that a number of the
first European explorers,

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:06.780 align:middle line:84%
like de Soto, were actually
encountering giant characters

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:10.516 align:middle line:84%
when they were going into
the Native American villages.

00:27:10.516 --> 00:27:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And how
recent was that?

00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Before
they were decimated.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:13.958 align:middle line:90%
Well, when was de Soto?

00:27:13.958 --> 00:27:17.005 align:middle line:90%
Was he the 16th, 17th Century?

00:27:17.005 --> 00:27:17.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:19.421 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: I can't
remember the exact date.

00:27:19.421 --> 00:27:20.050 align:middle line:90%
But, I mean--

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:20.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Very recent.

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:21.767 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:27:21.767 --> 00:27:23.100 align:middle line:90%
You've got to ask yourself-- OK.

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.016 align:middle line:90%
The giants were there.

00:27:24.016 --> 00:27:24.930 align:middle line:90%
Who were they?

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:28.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you're saying
that there was a giant race,

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:28.880 align:middle line:90%
who were they?

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And I come back to
what I said earlier

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:34.260 align:middle line:90%
about the idea of human hybrids.

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:39.600 align:middle line:84%
The best explanation is
that they are, in some way,

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:44.310 align:middle line:84%
some kind of admixture between
two different types of humans.

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
best evidence so far

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:51.620 align:middle line:84%
is that they are a mixture of
anatomically modern humans,

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:56.010 align:middle line:84%
i.e., ourselves, and
probably-- not Neanderthals

00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:58.090 align:middle line:90%
in this case-- Denisovans.

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:03.743 align:middle line:84%
Denisovans is a human population
that existed possibly down to,

00:28:03.743 --> 00:28:07.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, 30,000, 40,000
years ago, and arguably

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.970 align:middle line:84%
much later, and that there are
many different populations,

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:16.310 align:middle line:84%
particularly in East Asia,
also in Australia, in places

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:21.530 align:middle line:84%
like Melanesia, that have quite
a high percentage of Denisovan

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:24.140 align:middle line:90%
DNA in them, even to this day.

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And various Native
American tribes also

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:29.780 align:middle line:90%
have Denisovan DNA within them.

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And it would be my best
bet that the giants

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:38.830 align:middle line:84%
are some kind of hybrid between
Denisovans and Homo sapiens.

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And to back this up, I would
say that the Denisovans themself

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:47.760 align:middle line:84%
would seem to have been the
descendants of an even earlier

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:52.920 align:middle line:84%
type of human known as
Homo heidelbergensis, who

00:28:52.920 --> 00:29:00.620 align:middle line:84%
was a hominid that existed
in Europe, in Africa,

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:03.260 align:middle line:90%
and parts of Asia, as well.

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And there are absolute
records of bones

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:12.402 align:middle line:84%
of Homo heidelbergensis being
found that are at least 7 to 7

00:29:12.402 --> 00:29:14.040 align:middle line:90%
and a 1/2 feet tall.

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:17.402 align:middle line:84%
So that makes absolute sense
that the Denisovans were

00:29:17.402 --> 00:29:18.610 align:middle line:90%
almost certainly that height.

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:23.060 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the very
frugal anatomical

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:25.240 align:middle line:84%
remains that we have
of the Denisovans

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:29.100 align:middle line:84%
includes teeth that are double
the size of our own human teeth

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:33.840 align:middle line:84%
today, which strongly suggests
that we're dealing with giants.

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Do you
think it's possible

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:42.035 align:middle line:84%
that the giants' legends or
records or their social order

00:29:42.035 --> 00:29:45.270 align:middle line:84%
or whatever had been preserved,
and that they are still,

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:49.050 align:middle line:84%
in some ways, perhaps
involved with this Illuminati

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:52.000 align:middle line:84%
subject or the Federal
Reserve and the cabal?

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.240 align:middle line:90%
Do you think that's possible?

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:55.670 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Well, we come
back to the second question

00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:57.610 align:middle line:90%
that was posed earlier.

00:29:57.610 --> 00:29:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
fact of, are there

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:02.179 align:middle line:84%
the descendants of the
Watchers and the Anunnaki

00:30:02.179 --> 00:30:03.595 align:middle line:84%
still around today--
and obviously

00:30:03.595 --> 00:30:05.330 align:middle line:90%
the giants of North America.

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:06.820 align:middle line:90%
And the fact is, of course.

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:08.750 align:middle line:90%
They are you and I, ultimately.

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:13.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have the DNA
of Neanderthals in us,

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:15.290 align:middle line:90%
of Denisovans.

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And in some way, we resonate
that-- I mean, some people

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:23.700 align:middle line:84%
probably more than others,
whether they be extremely tall,

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:25.520 align:middle line:84%
the complexion of
their skin, the fact

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:29.450 align:middle line:84%
they've got extremely long
heads, or something like that.

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:33.570 align:middle line:84%
And you could look at those
individuals, perhaps even

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:36.910 align:middle line:84%
their background, their
genetic background, whatever,

00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:40.400 align:middle line:84%
and come to the conclusion
that they, themselves,

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:43.490 align:middle line:84%
are descended from these
mythical characters

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:44.460 align:middle line:90%
of the past.

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And in some strange way,
there's some truth in that.

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And whether these people
then come together and share

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:53.400 align:middle line:84%
these ideas and create a cabal,
that's probably a little bit

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:54.100 align:middle line:90%
beyond me.

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:57.280 align:middle line:84%
But I certainly know that there
are a number of traditions

00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:01.360 align:middle line:84%
relating to survivors of
the Watchers existing today,

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:05.527 align:middle line:84%
and that, yes, they do have
some kind of hold upon society.

00:31:05.527 --> 00:31:06.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Absolutely fascinating.

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:09.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, Andrew Collins, I want to
thank you for being on my show.

00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:09.300 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Thank you, David.

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:09.800 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Thank you for being
a part of "Disclosure."

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:13.696 align:middle line:84%
So you heard him say
it right at the end

00:31:13.696 --> 00:31:17.330 align:middle line:84%
there-- the descendants of
the Denisovans are you and I,

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:20.750 align:middle line:84%
and there are traditions
of the Watchers actually

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:24.700 align:middle line:84%
having a hold on our society,
and that their descendants have

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:27.220 align:middle line:84%
preserved who they
really are and kept

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:29.060 align:middle line:90%
it very secret from us.

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:31.780 align:middle line:84%
He isn't quite as willing
to go over the ledge

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:34.480 align:middle line:84%
as I am into the
so-called conspiracy

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:38.930 align:middle line:84%
theory of the Illuminati, but
all of the pieces are there.

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:42.630 align:middle line:84%
This is fascinating information
because it reveals but there

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:46.240 align:middle line:84%
may in fact to be a group
that considers themselves

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:49.570 align:middle line:84%
to be aliens among
us, extraterrestrials,

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:51.370 align:middle line:84%
and they are
protecting themselves

00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:54.720 align:middle line:84%
from us knowing the truth
because-- let's face it.

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.800 align:middle line:84%
Human beings have a
tendency to bring out

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.400 align:middle line:84%
the torches and pitchforks
when they think that they're

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.310 align:middle line:90%
faced with the unknown.

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And I personally think
that is a terrible idea.

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:09.510 align:middle line:84%
We are all possessing this
various hybridized DNA,

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:11.890 align:middle line:84%
and we shouldn't
assume that if someone

00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:14.010 align:middle line:84%
comes from another planet
that that automatically

00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:15.890 align:middle line:90%
means that they are evil.

00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:18.550 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
deserves our attention,

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:22.040 align:middle line:84%
but it also deserves
sober consideration.

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Coming up next time
here on "Disclosure,"

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:26.520 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be
interviewing Graham

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.740 align:middle line:90%
Hancock for the third time.

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to have some
truly fascinating information.

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:36.790 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that there is a
pyramid in Indonesia called

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Caral that looks
exactly like the step

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:44.870 align:middle line:90%
pyramids in Mesoamerica?

00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:47.780 align:middle line:84%
I never heard this
before I interviewed him.

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And during the interview, I
didn't even really get it.

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:53.240 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until I went back
and watched this footage

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:56.282 align:middle line:84%
to be able to give you this
that I'm telling you now

00:32:56.282 --> 00:32:58.490 align:middle line:84%
that I actually went and
looked at the Caral pyramid.

00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And my god, it's just
the same as the pyramids

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:04.540 align:middle line:90%
that we see in Mesoamerica.

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:06.510 align:middle line:90%
But it's in Indonesia.

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:08.920 align:middle line:84%
Nobody ever talks
about this stuff.

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:10.000 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Because it suggests
that we were dealing

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:14.500 align:middle line:90%
with a worldwide civilization.

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:17.090 align:middle line:84%
That's coming up next
time here on "Disclosure."

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:21.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, David Wilcock,
and I thank you for watching.
