00:00:16.102 --> 00:00:17.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID WILCOCK:
I'm David Wilcock,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.430 align:middle line:84%
and I welcome you
to "Disclosure."

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.940 align:middle line:10%
This is our opportunity to
have a fireside chat about some

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.340 align:middle line:10%
of the most fascinating
information ever put forward

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.500 align:middle line:10%
by anyone who has been writing
books and doing research.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.630 align:middle line:84%
What we have here is a
14-episode miniseries

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.470 align:middle line:90%
on ancient history.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.990 align:middle line:84%
If you think that
you know all there

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.400 align:middle line:84%
is to know about
ancient history,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.810 align:middle line:90%
you may be very surprised.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:51.930 align:middle line:84%
Never before have we had such
an array of incredible talent

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.610 align:middle line:84%
put together in a
synergistic sequence

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.550 align:middle line:84%
where one concept
builds upon the next.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And we have all these
guys talking to you--

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.379 align:middle line:84%
and talking to me because
I'm interviewing them--

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.130 align:middle line:84%
about some of the most
fascinating mysteries

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.270 align:middle line:90%
in Earth's primordial past.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, skeptics oftentimes
believe that we have nailed down

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.590 align:middle line:84%
the truth, there's
nothing more that

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.300 align:middle line:84%
really needs to be discovered,
and that Orthodox mainstream

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.480 align:middle line:90%
thought is infallible.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.420 align:middle line:84%
This is much like a
religion-- the belief

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.340 align:middle line:84%
that what we know now
is all we need to know.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.430 align:middle line:84%
Skeptics also can be
very aggressive and very

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.660 align:middle line:84%
sarcastic and shaming
and demeaning in the way

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.080 align:middle line:84%
that they try to
convey their opinions.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.100 align:middle line:84%
We are not looking
at anything here

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.900 align:middle line:84%
that requires us to
suspend disbelief.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.720 align:middle line:90%
We're not looking at fantasy.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.364 align:middle line:90%
We're not looking at fiction.

00:01:48.364 --> 00:01:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And we're not
looking at something

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.240 align:middle line:84%
that was channeled by angelic
beings from higher realms.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.220 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at straight
ahead, hardcore, empirical data

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.180 align:middle line:84%
that can be researched--
anybody has the opportunity.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.670 align:middle line:90%
It's democratic.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.910 align:middle line:90%
You can go out there.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.990 align:middle line:84%
You can verify this
stuff for yourself.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.229 align:middle line:84%
The guy we're starting with
today is Graham Hancock,

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.000 align:middle line:84%
and Hancock is specifically one
of the most brilliant pioneers

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.670 align:middle line:84%
in the entire field of
ancient civilizations.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.160 align:middle line:84%
In 1995, he released
"Fingerprints of the Gods."

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.190 align:middle line:90%
I had it as soon as it came out.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.420 align:middle line:84%
I'd already read 300 books
by that point on this topic.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.210 align:middle line:84%
I was blown away by what
Graham Hancock had to say.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.760 align:middle line:84%
In the traditional
view, civilization

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.690 align:middle line:84%
begins with the so-called
Fertile Crescent and Sumeria,

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.384 align:middle line:84%
and then it progresses
forward to Ancient Greece.

00:02:41.384 --> 00:02:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
first time that we

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.610 align:middle line:84%
have any really
significant architecture

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.350 align:middle line:90%
and roads and systems of law.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.880 align:middle line:84%
Some of that does
occur in Sumer,

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.880 align:middle line:84%
but then it kind of grows into
its fruition in Ancient Greece.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.170 align:middle line:84%
The new knowledge is
the idea that there

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.200 align:middle line:84%
was a highly advanced ancient
civilization before Sumer,

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.510 align:middle line:84%
before all of this
stuff took place,

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.680 align:middle line:84%
and that what we think
of as recorded history

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.650 align:middle line:84%
is in fact not the only
history that's been recorded.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.110 align:middle line:84%
It's only the approved
version of history,

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.060 align:middle line:84%
and the deeper truth
may involve the concept

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.910 align:middle line:84%
that there was a
civilization that

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.150 align:middle line:84%
had greater technology
than we have now

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.410 align:middle line:84%
and that was wiped away in
a gigantic catastrophe that

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.540 align:middle line:84%
started roughly 12,980 years
ago and then put the earth

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.170 align:middle line:84%
into a profound period of cold
for 1,600 years, after which

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.820 align:middle line:84%
time there was yet
another catastrophe.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And both of these catastrophes
involved massive flooding

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.200 align:middle line:84%
and literally wiped the
surface clean of the earth,

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.280 align:middle line:84%
taking away whatever remnant
of this foreign civilization

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.060 align:middle line:90%
had once existed.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.980 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
explore this as we

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.050 align:middle line:84%
get into this first
episode of "Disclosure"

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.460 align:middle line:90%
with Graham Hancock.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.380 align:middle line:90%
Check it out.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.620 align:middle line:90%
All right, Graham Hancock.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.190 align:middle line:84%
I am obviously a friend
of yours, a huge fan.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.290 align:middle line:84%
What you did with "Fingerprints
of the Gods" for me

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.149 align:middle line:90%
was a phenomenal thing.

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:23.220 align:middle line:84%
I had been reading 300 books
on ancient civilizations

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.410 align:middle line:84%
up until I found
yours, and I started

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.200 align:middle line:84%
to get really tired of
it because everybody's

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.520 align:middle line:90%
trumpeting the same data.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's got the Rhodes
calculator, everybody talks

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:40.210 align:middle line:84%
about Stonehenge, the
antediluvian flood maps.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.310 align:middle line:90%
And then along comes this book.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.770 align:middle line:84%
I think it was 1995, I had
just graduated from college.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And bam, this guy has
got all of the best stuff

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.260 align:middle line:84%
that I had seen in all these
300 books I've been reading

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.430 align:middle line:84%
and other stuff that
I'd never found before.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.662 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
know you for that.

00:04:59.662 --> 00:05:00.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM HANCOCK: Definitely.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.328 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely my
best-known book.

00:05:02.328 --> 00:05:03.980 align:middle line:90%
No doubt about it.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And that was
a major seller, right?

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.250 align:middle line:90%
You sold a lot of copies.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: About 5 million
copies of that book.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.470 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: 5 million?

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.605 align:middle line:10%
>>HANCOCK: Of which 2 and 1/2
million in hardback in Japan.

00:05:14.605 --> 00:05:15.480 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: Wow, really?

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.240 align:middle line:10%
>>HANCOCK: And the other 2 and
1/2 million around the world.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.945 align:middle line:10%
It became a bit of a
sensation in Japan.

00:05:19.945 --> 00:05:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: That's incredible.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.190 align:middle line:90%
That's an incredible number.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.320 align:middle line:90%
You can't do that now.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.694 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: You
can't do that now.

00:05:25.694 --> 00:05:26.940 align:middle line:90%
It was a phenomenon.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.520 align:middle line:90%
It was one of those things.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.090 align:middle line:90%
It caught a wave.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.840 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of
new stuff in the air.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.790 align:middle line:84%
There was a suggestion
that maybe we've

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.720 align:middle line:84%
got the story of
civilization wrong,

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.791 align:middle line:84%
and I think I was fortunate
to write "Fingerprints" when

00:05:41.791 --> 00:05:42.290 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.460 align:middle line:90%
I think it caught that moment.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.560 align:middle line:84%
If I had published it some years
earlier or some years later,

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it would
have had that impact.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And it is true that
actually the people that wrote

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.566 align:middle line:84%
the movie "2012"
optioned the rights to--

00:05:56.566 --> 00:05:57.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: They did indeed.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:58.731 align:middle line:90%
They optioned the rights.

00:05:58.731 --> 00:06:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And if you can bear
to sit through the 20

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.520 align:middle line:84%
minutes of credits at
the end of that movie,

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.370 align:middle line:84%
you will see that it does
say at the very last line,

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.610 align:middle line:84%
inspired in part by the book
"Fingerprints of the Gods"

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:12.590 align:middle line:90%
by Graham Hancock.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, and
"2012" is allegedly

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.340 align:middle line:84%
a disaster movie
in modern times.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.520 align:middle line:84%
Why would they use
your book for that?

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Well, actually, I
would've liked to have-- were I

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.690 align:middle line:84%
a producer, which
I'm not, I would

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.240 align:middle line:84%
have liked to have seen that
movie delve a little more

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.040 align:middle line:90%
into archaeology.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.280 align:middle line:84%
But what they took from
that book, I would say,

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:41.000 align:middle line:84%
was just one thing, which
was as far as I know,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.470 align:middle line:84%
"Fingerprints" is the first book
that has connected the Mayan

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:48.410 align:middle line:84%
calendar with Charles
Hapgood's notion of earth crust

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:49.610 align:middle line:90%
displacement.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And those two
issues were actually

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:56.719 align:middle line:84%
key to the scenario
in the movie "2012."

00:06:56.719 --> 00:06:58.760 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't take
anything else from the book.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.135 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Let me
just briefly toss

00:07:00.135 --> 00:07:03.060 align:middle line:84%
in for people who don't know
that Hapgood's theory is

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.450 align:middle line:84%
that the external crust
could slide over the mantle,

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:11.410 align:middle line:84%
and therefore the whole Earth
has a shift in its crust,

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:14.370 align:middle line:84%
even though the inner part
is still in the same place.

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Indeed,
rather like the skin

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.930 align:middle line:84%
of an orange moving around
the fruit, to give an analogy.

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And and this was the mechanism
envisaged in the movie "2012"

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.250 align:middle line:84%
for the cataclysm that
they portrayed there,

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:31.390 align:middle line:84%
because Roland Emmerich does
do big cataclysm movies.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:37.678 align:middle line:84%
And this was at the
heart of that idea.

00:07:37.678 --> 00:07:39.986 align:middle line:84%
I think that I
definitely would have

00:07:39.986 --> 00:07:42.510 align:middle line:84%
liked to have seen more
archaeology in the story,

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:45.372 align:middle line:84%
but they focused
on the big effects.

00:07:45.372 --> 00:07:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It seems
strange that they

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:49.840 align:middle line:84%
would want to option
"Fingerprints of the Gods"

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.655 align:middle line:84%
for a movie that only barely
touches on two little data

00:07:52.655 --> 00:07:53.530 align:middle line:90%
points from the book.

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:56.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Well, see, as
the project developed,

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:00.830 align:middle line:84%
their ideas of what they were
going to do with the project

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.400 align:middle line:90%
changed.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And they became more
focused on the cataclysm

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.040 align:middle line:84%
and less perhaps on the
backstory to the cataclysm.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.530 align:middle line:84%
That's what they
became focused on.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.655 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So there may have
been some Mayan calendar

00:08:13.655 --> 00:08:15.530 align:middle line:84%
stuff in the earlier
drafts of the script,

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:16.170 align:middle line:90%
and that kind of thing?

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:17.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah, indeed.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.996 align:middle line:90%


00:08:19.996 --> 00:08:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Before we
go into your story--

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:24.780 align:middle line:84%
because I want to do the
whole arc-- if you were going

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:30.572 align:middle line:84%
to try to briefly summarize
what we learn from "Fingerprints

00:08:30.572 --> 00:08:32.030 align:middle line:84%
of the Gods," what
would you say is

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:36.080 align:middle line:84%
the hypothesis or the goal of
"Fingerprints of the Gods"?

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.860 align:middle line:10%
>>HANCOCK: At the
heart of it, that we

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:40.620 align:middle line:10%
are a species with
amnesia, that there

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:44.200 align:middle line:10%
has been a major forgotten
episode in human history.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And we are not taking
that forgotten episode

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:50.080 align:middle line:84%
into account in our
understanding of who we are

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:55.140 align:middle line:84%
and why we're here-- that
that has been buried,

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.780 align:middle line:84%
partly as a result of
global cataclysmic events

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:02.810 align:middle line:84%
12,980 years ago,
or thereabouts,

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:06.290 align:middle line:84%
and partly because there are
forces at work in our society

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:09.630 align:middle line:84%
that don't want that
information known,

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:13.880 align:middle line:84%
that want the idea of a
simple linear development

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.750 align:middle line:84%
from primitive, stone
age hunter-gatherers,

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:22.300 align:middle line:84%
through settled
civilization, to us, the apex

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:25.080 align:middle line:90%
and pinnacle of the human story.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And if you're committed
to that timeline,

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.440 align:middle line:84%
then it's very
annoying to discover

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.850 align:middle line:84%
that there was an earlier
episode of civilization when

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:40.430 align:middle line:84%
humanity did achieve a very
high level, which was brought

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:46.520 align:middle line:84%
cataclysmically to an end,
so massively and so severely,

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.520 align:middle line:84%
as Plato put it, that
mankind had to begin again

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.170 align:middle line:84%
like children, with no
memory of what went before.

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:55.300 align:middle line:84%
I think there are people
who do have that memory,

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.360 align:middle line:84%
but I don't think
they want it shared.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.500 align:middle line:84%
So that's the message at
the heart of "Fingerprints

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.054 align:middle line:90%
of the Gods," I would say.

00:10:02.054 --> 00:10:03.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: The people
who don't want

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.450 align:middle line:84%
this to be shared, it
appears that there has been

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:11.000 align:middle line:84%
a narrative constructed in
the average person's mind

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.390 align:middle line:84%
in which they might listen
to what you just said,

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:18.715 align:middle line:84%
but then they'll say,
well, there's no evidence.

00:10:18.715 --> 00:10:21.810 align:middle line:10%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah, because
the whole institution

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:25.730 align:middle line:10%
of archaeology and
mainstream history

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:29.520 align:middle line:10%
has set before the
public, through the media,

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.760 align:middle line:10%
through the education
system, a timeline

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.880 align:middle line:10%
for the story of
human civilization.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And that timeline has
become embedded in the way

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.550 align:middle line:90%
that we think about ourselves.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And that timeline
is this linear story

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:54.150 align:middle line:84%
from primitive caveman to smart,
super-sophisticated, modern

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:55.220 align:middle line:90%
human beings.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:58.486 align:middle line:84%
And we are supposed to have
gone through certain episodes

00:10:58.486 --> 00:10:59.110 align:middle line:90%
of development.

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:03.280 align:middle line:84%
You know, we started
to make agriculture,

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.780 align:middle line:84%
that agriculture provided the
possibility for a leisure class

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.720 align:middle line:84%
who could become the priests
and kings in the cities that

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.980 align:middle line:90%
were formed.

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.340 align:middle line:90%
And we went on from there.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.020 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there were
some ups and downs,

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:18.400 align:middle line:84%
but by and large, it's been
a straight, clean story.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And what disturbs that
is the possibility

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:25.760 align:middle line:84%
that we've forgotten a
whole episode of earlier

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:26.690 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And new bits of archaeology
that are coming out--

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:33.640 align:middle line:84%
like Gobekli Tepe in Turkey,
which cannot be denied

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.060 align:middle line:84%
by the mainstream, because
mainstream archaeologists have

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:38.920 align:middle line:84%
actually found
that archaeology--

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:43.690 align:middle line:84%
themselves create ripples
in this timeline and make it

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:45.180 align:middle line:90%
difficult to explain.

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:49.920 align:middle line:84%
You see, if you're telling
people that hunter-gatherers

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:53.460 align:middle line:84%
were this very simple kind
of society who were not

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:57.080 align:middle line:84%
capable of large-scale feats of
engineering and construction,

00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:00.180 align:middle line:84%
and then suddenly in the
hunter-gatherer epoch,

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:03.070 align:middle line:84%
before anything like a
city or a civilization

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:06.710 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to have existed, you
have a very large-scale project

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:10.090 align:middle line:84%
with enormous stone circles
and multi-ton megaliths

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:15.280 align:middle line:84%
being put up and requiring
intense organizational skills,

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.640 align:middle line:84%
management of a workforce,
a plan, all of that

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.530 align:middle line:84%
in place, it doesn't fit
with the picture we've

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:23.720 align:middle line:84%
been given of what our
ancestors are supposed

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.170 align:middle line:90%
to have been like at that time.

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And when I first went
to go Gobekli Tepe

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:32.480 align:middle line:84%
and talked to Klaus Schmidt,
the excavator, who unfortunately

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.480 align:middle line:90%
has recently passed away.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.950 align:middle line:10%
But I had an opportunity
to spend three days walking

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:42.020 align:middle line:10%
around that side with
Klaus Schmidt in 2013.

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him,
what does it feel

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:46.560 align:middle line:84%
like to be the man who's
discovered the site that's

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.180 align:middle line:90%
rewriting history?

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:49.510 align:middle line:90%
And he was very careful.

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:53.130 align:middle line:84%
He said, no, I prefer not to
say it's rewriting history.

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.852 align:middle line:84%
I prefer to say it's adding
a new chapter to history.

00:12:55.852 --> 00:12:58.060 align:middle line:84%
That seems to be how mainstream
archaeology is trying

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:00.560 align:middle line:84%
to finesse this--
that they still

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:04.500 align:middle line:84%
don't want their basic
timeline, their basic story

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.660 align:middle line:84%
of human progress to
be disturbed by this.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.950 align:middle line:84%
They just want to fit it
into the existing model.

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:13.130 align:middle line:84%
I believe it won't fit
into the existing model.

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:15.230 align:middle line:84%
It's going to
overthrow everything.

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: The conventional
archaeologists

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.300 align:middle line:90%
will attack guys like you.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:19.960 align:middle line:84%
I've seen this online
a bunch of times.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:24.190 align:middle line:84%
They say, if guys
like Graham Hancock

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:27.410 align:middle line:84%
say that this civilization
was here on Earth

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:31.340 align:middle line:84%
and it was very advanced,
show me the pottery shards.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:35.200 align:middle line:84%
Show me the linear curve of
how they built up to the point

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.860 align:middle line:84%
to be able to manipulate
these large blocks of stone.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:40.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: That's what they say.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's why Gobekli Tepe
is becoming a serious problem

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:48.370 align:middle line:84%
for them, because for example,
that particular point was made

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:51.570 align:middle line:84%
in relation to the Great
Sphinx of Giza and the notion

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:56.940 align:middle line:84%
that the Great Sphinx might
be vastly older than 2500 BC.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.360 align:middle line:10%
Well, the argument
of archaeology

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.610 align:middle line:10%
was how could that be so?

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:04.250 align:middle line:10%
There is no other large-scale
monument which is 12,000-plus

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:05.890 align:middle line:10%
years old anywhere in the world.

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:09.300 align:middle line:84%
If there was a culture that
could make the Sphinx 12,500

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.670 align:middle line:84%
years ago, then surely it
must have made other monuments

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:12.170 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:14.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, suddenly we have
that other monument.

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.190 align:middle line:90%
We have Gobekli Tepe.

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's not even very
far from the Sphinx.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:17.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: That's true.

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: So you
know, it becomes--

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.310 align:middle line:84%
the whole notion that the Sphinx
may be much older suddenly

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:25.570 align:middle line:84%
becomes much more credible
than it was before.

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:28.300 align:middle line:84%
I think the second point
which archaeologists are not

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.400 align:middle line:84%
taking into account--
archaeologists

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.550 align:middle line:90%
tend to be uniformitarians.

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:37.460 align:middle line:84%
They don't really like
cataclysms very much.

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And they don't, in my
view, take enough account

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.500 align:middle line:84%
of the role of
cataclysmic events

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.070 align:middle line:84%
in the story of
human civilization.

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And again, there's new
information and new evidence

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.100 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:51.950 align:middle line:84%
We now know-- it's really
no longer in dispute--

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:57.130 align:middle line:84%
that the Earth was hit by a
fragmenting comet round about

00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:02.390 align:middle line:84%
12,980 years ago, give
or take five years.

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:03.810 align:middle line:84%
You can bring the
resolution down

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:08.590 align:middle line:84%
that tight to a very exact date
from the Greenland Ice Cores,

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:10.440 align:middle line:84%
because when comets
hit the earth,

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:15.420 align:middle line:84%
they leave a signature in the
chemistry of the earth all

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:19.910 align:middle line:84%
over the planet-- nanodiamonds
and iridium and platinum--

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:20.925 align:middle line:90%
there are remnants.

00:15:20.925 --> 00:15:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And these have been preserved
in the Greenland Ice Cores.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And we can say for
sure, this event

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:31.330 align:middle line:84%
happened 12,980 years ago,
give or take five years.

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And it initiated an episode
that geologists have been aware

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:38.950 align:middle line:84%
of for a very long time, which
they call the Younger Dryas.

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:44.980 align:middle line:84%
See, 12,980 years ago, the Earth
was coming out of the Ice Age.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:49.680 align:middle line:84%
The Ice Age reached its maximum
extent 21,300 years ago,

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:50.920 align:middle line:90%
approximately.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And there began a gradual
meltdown-- not always gradual.

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:56.550 align:middle line:84%
There were some episodes
of rapid flooding

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:57.940 align:middle line:90%
during that story.

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.660 align:middle line:90%
But it was a process of warming.

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly,
12,980 years ago,

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:05.450 align:middle line:84%
for reasons that
until recently it's

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:08.530 align:middle line:84%
not been possible to explain,
the Earth was plunged back

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:12.600 align:middle line:84%
into a dramatic
refreeze, went back

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:16.010 align:middle line:84%
to colder than it had been at
the coldest point of the Ice

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:16.720 align:middle line:90%
Age.

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's the episode that
they call the Younger Dryas.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And it lasts from 12,980
years ago, give or take

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:26.720 align:middle line:84%
five years, down to
11,600 years ago,

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.310 align:middle line:84%
when suddenly the cold
lifts and the Earth

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:31.810 align:middle line:90%
resumes its warming process.

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:35.560 align:middle line:84%
You have roughly
1,600, 1,700 years

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.770 align:middle line:84%
of radical, unexplained
deep freeze.

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:39.550 align:middle line:90%
We now know why that happened.

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:42.274 align:middle line:84%
It happened because of that
comet which fragmented.

00:16:42.274 --> 00:16:44.440 align:middle line:84%
Its fragments hit many
different parts of the Earth,

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:47.400 align:middle line:84%
but the greatest impact of
all was in North America.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And it was on the
North American ice cap.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.920 align:middle line:84%
That's why there isn't a
crater, because the ice cap was

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:58.100 align:middle line:84%
best part of a mile and
a half to two miles deep.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And that fragmenting comet
smacked into the ice cap.

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:06.800 align:middle line:84%
The crater was made in ice,
not in the body of the Earth.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.308 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we don't
see the crater today.

00:17:09.308 --> 00:17:11.224 align:middle line:84%
But what we do see are
the chemical signatures

00:17:11.224 --> 00:17:13.460 align:middle line:84%
of that impact all
over the world.

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:15.940 align:middle line:90%
So the comet hits.

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:19.760 align:middle line:84%
The initial effect is
dramatic, large-scale flooding,

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.839 align:middle line:84%
because the ice cap is
suddenly liquidized.

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:26.250 align:middle line:84%
There's a huge
flooding event results

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:28.830 align:middle line:84%
from that, which leaves scars
all over the North American

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:30.570 align:middle line:90%
landscape.

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And then, enormous
quantities of dust

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:36.000 align:middle line:84%
are thrown up into
the upper atmosphere.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.650 align:middle line:84%
These enshroud the
Earth completely

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:42.600 align:middle line:84%
in a mantle of dust, which
stops the sun's rays reaching

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:43.730 align:middle line:90%
the Earth.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:46.320 align:middle line:84%
Then we go into the deep freeze
called the Younger Dryas,

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.650 align:middle line:84%
because the sun's warming
effect on the Earth

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:50.240 align:middle line:90%
is no longer happening.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And it takes 1,600 or so
years for that dust mantle

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:58.710 align:middle line:90%
to disperse.

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:01.510 align:middle line:84%
It's possible that the
Earth interacted again

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:03.450 align:middle line:84%
with fragments of
that comet, and that

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:06.310 align:middle line:84%
may be part of
why it ends rather

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:08.687 align:middle line:90%
suddenly about 11,600 years ago.

00:18:08.687 --> 00:18:10.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What's the
data on sea level?

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:11.436 align:middle line:90%
What did it do to sea level?

00:18:11.436 --> 00:18:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Well, then you have a
very rapid episode of sea level

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.810 align:middle line:84%
rise, exactly following
11,600 year ago,

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:19.250 align:middle line:90%
so you have instant flooding.

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:21.970 align:middle line:90%
12,980, sea level goes up.

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:24.860 align:middle line:84%
Then it goes down again,
because you go into a freeze.

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Then 11,600 years ago, the
Earth is suddenly warming up

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.520 align:middle line:84%
very rapidly, and sea
level rises very rapidly.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's not an accident that
11,600 years ago is exactly

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:39.110 align:middle line:84%
the period that Plato pointed
to in the story of Atlantis,

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:42.990 align:middle line:84%
because he said that Atlantis
was destroyed, submerged

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:47.010 align:middle line:84%
by a giant flood
and earthquakes,

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:49.380 align:middle line:84%
9,000 years before
the time of Solon.

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And 9,000 years-- Solon is
600 BC, so that's 9,600 BC.

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.790 align:middle line:90%
That is 11,600 years ago.

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:57.350 align:middle line:84%
That is the end of
the Younger Dryas.

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:59.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, how could Plato
have made that up?

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.487 align:middle line:90%
It connects perfectly.

00:19:01.487 --> 00:19:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: To try to
say that that isn't

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:04.321 align:middle line:90%
a link is a conspiracy theory.

00:19:04.321 --> 00:19:06.236 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: I believe
it's a conspiracy theory.

00:19:06.236 --> 00:19:08.450 align:middle line:84%
To dismiss that, as mainstream
academics have done,

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:11.550 align:middle line:84%
they've tried every
way to make Plato not

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:15.520 align:middle line:84%
say there was a cataclysm
11,600 years ago.

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.600 align:middle line:84%
They even say that he's talking
about months instead of years.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.880 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this was Plato.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.350 align:middle line:84%
When he said years,
he meant years.

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:24.540 align:middle line:90%
Solon was his own ancestor.

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:27.720 align:middle line:84%
He received this
story through Solon.

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.850 align:middle line:84%
He was reporting what for him
was a very strong and definite

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:35.010 align:middle line:84%
fact, that there had been
an event that had destroyed

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:39.380 align:middle line:84%
a great civilization 9,000
years before the time of Solon.

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And in our time frame, that is
11,600 years before our time.

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:47.610 align:middle line:90%
And it just all adds up.

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:49.110 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's
going to become more

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:53.160 align:middle line:84%
and more difficult for
mainstream archaeology

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:57.219 align:middle line:84%
to dismiss this as we start
seeing new evidence emerging

00:19:57.219 --> 00:19:58.010 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:00.560 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we now
have a smoking gun.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.050 align:middle line:90%
We didn't have that before.

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we all understood
that the end of the Ice Age

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:08.600 align:middle line:84%
was cataclysmic, but we didn't
have an actual, very specific

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:09.200 align:middle line:90%
smoking gun.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.830 align:middle line:84%
See, when I wrote
"Fingerprints of the Gods,"

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:13.650 align:middle line:84%
I focused very
much on the window

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:19.510 align:middle line:84%
between 12,000 and
13,000 years ago.

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:23.667 align:middle line:84%
And the moment that the comet
hits the Earth, which we now

00:20:23.667 --> 00:20:25.750 align:middle line:84%
know but I did not know
when I wrote "Fingerprints

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:29.210 align:middle line:84%
of the Gods," is
12,980 years ago.

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:31.590 align:middle line:90%
That is exactly in that window.

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:35.320 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't able to give my
readers a smoking gun when

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.880 align:middle line:84%
I wrote "Fingerprints
of the Gods."

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:37.395 align:middle line:90%
Rather just say that--

00:20:37.395 --> 00:20:38.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Yeah, I didn't
remember reading that.

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:39.956 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah,
it isn't in there

00:20:39.956 --> 00:20:41.710 align:middle line:84%
because the evidence
on the comet

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:44.250 align:middle line:90%
had not been discovered in 1995.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:46.690 align:middle line:84%
This has all come
out since 2007.

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's been a
debate in science,

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:50.280 align:middle line:84%
but the evidence
keeps coming in.

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And really, no serious
geologist is now

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:57.910 align:middle line:84%
disputing that the Earth was
hit by a comet 12,980 years ago.

00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And then you have this
1,600 year deep freeze.

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And 11,600 years ago,
we come out of it.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And the whole story
of human civilization

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:13.040 align:middle line:84%
as we have it today all unfolds
in that last 11,600 years.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
before that is a blank.

00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And I would say the
reason that it's

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:21.679 align:middle line:84%
a blank is because of this
horrendous cataclysm that

00:21:21.679 --> 00:21:22.470 align:middle line:90%
overtook the Earth.

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:24.690 align:middle line:84%
We know that many of
the great megafauna,

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:29.490 align:middle line:84%
the mammoths, the rhinos, died
out during the Younger Dryas.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And we now know what
caused the Younger Dryas.

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:35.110 align:middle line:84%
So we're getting much closer
to understanding what happened

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:37.650 align:middle line:84%
and why we are a
species with amnesia.

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, let me put
the tin foil hat on real snug

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.450 align:middle line:90%
here for a moment.

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible-- that's the
"Ancient Aliens" signature

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:46.130 align:middle line:90%
line, right?

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:47.660 align:middle line:90%
Is it possible.

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:52.940 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
someone disliked

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:56.460 align:middle line:84%
whoever was here on Earth--
maybe there was a war,

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:59.200 align:middle line:84%
maybe they had gotten
themselves in a lot of trouble--

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.170 align:middle line:84%
and that somebody had the
ability to take that comet

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:03.730 align:middle line:84%
and deliberately
make sure that it

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:05.005 align:middle line:90%
was going to hit the ice cap?

00:22:05.005 --> 00:22:08.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Well, David, that's
a very interesting speculation,

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:10.140 align:middle line:90%
I have to say.

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:12.460 align:middle line:84%
Because there are
serious studies now

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:15.980 align:middle line:84%
being done--
unfortunately by the war

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.340 align:middle line:90%
mongers in our own civilization.

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.350 align:middle line:84%
One of the weapons
they're looking at

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:23.150 align:middle line:84%
is how do we use an
asteroid as a weapon?

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:28.750 align:middle line:84%
How do we target an asteroid
at our, quote unquote, enemies?

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:32.520 align:middle line:84%
What a shame, what a horror
that human beings could even

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.060 align:middle line:84%
think that way, that
our imagination could

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:36.600 align:middle line:90%
go in that direction.

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.590 align:middle line:84%
But maybe that's in
our DNA in some way.

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:42.380 align:middle line:90%
So it is not impossible.

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:46.020 align:middle line:84%
I can't sit here and say, no,
that's absolutely impossible

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:49.605 align:middle line:84%
that somebody could have
fired that comet at us

00:22:49.605 --> 00:22:52.850 align:middle line:84%
or deflected it from its
orbit to the point where

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:57.040 align:middle line:84%
it interacted with the
Earth in cataclysmic ways.

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You and I spoke
in the car on the way

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:01.430 align:middle line:90%
here about the Book of Enoch.

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And the Book of Enoch describes
fallen angels, the watchers,

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:08.790 align:middle line:84%
and that they inter-bred with
humanity, that they created

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:14.910 align:middle line:84%
a race of giants, and that
in the aftermath of that,

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Enoch was asked by the giants
to talk to the Elohim, or God,

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:25.182 align:middle line:84%
and say, please don't wipe us
out, because God, Elohim, said,

00:23:25.182 --> 00:23:26.640 align:middle line:84%
you guys have become
wicked and you

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.410 align:middle line:84%
need to be purged
from the Earth.

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:31.385 align:middle line:84%
And that apparently was the
genesis of Noah's flood.

00:23:31.385 --> 00:23:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe
that we're talking

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.570 align:middle line:90%
about the biblical flood here?

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Yes, I do,
as a matter of fact.

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:41.004 align:middle line:84%
I think the biblical flood needs
not to be seen in isolation.

00:23:41.004 --> 00:23:42.420 align:middle line:84%
We need to understand
that that is

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:47.270 align:middle line:84%
part of a global tradition
of a cataclysmic flood--

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:51.470 align:middle line:84%
often, by the way, accompanied
by a radical deep freeze.

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:55.740 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
cataclysmic myths in Iran,

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:59.080 align:middle line:84%
for example, they don't
speak so much of a flood.

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:03.060 align:middle line:84%
They speak more of a terrible
freeze, a dragon that

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:05.375 align:middle line:90%
caused the world to freeze.

00:24:05.375 --> 00:24:12.349 align:middle line:84%
And the Iranian Noah
figure, who is called Yima,

00:24:12.349 --> 00:24:13.640 align:middle line:90%
actually doesn't create an ark.

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.650 align:middle line:84%
He creates an
underground sanctuary

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:19.177 align:middle line:84%
into which human beings go,
where the seeds of all life

00:24:19.177 --> 00:24:19.760 align:middle line:90%
are preserved.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.980 align:middle line:84%
The same story is told
all around the world

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:24.950 align:middle line:84%
and with interestingly
different angles on it.

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:26.510 align:middle line:90%
In some cases, it's a flood.

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:29.590 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, as in the
case of the Iranian myths,

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:30.700 align:middle line:90%
it's a deep freeze.

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And what we now know is
that both things happened--

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:36.120 align:middle line:84%
that there was flooding and
there was a deep freeze.

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And the biblical
story of the flood

00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:41.799 align:middle line:84%
is part of that
global tradition.

00:24:41.799 --> 00:24:42.840 align:middle line:90%
And it's well understood.

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:45.010 align:middle line:84%
There's been very good
scholarship on this,

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:47.910 align:middle line:84%
that the biblical flood
is genetically related

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:51.890 align:middle line:84%
to the Gilgamesh
epic from Sumer.

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And really, we're
looking at one story

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:56.547 align:middle line:84%
told in a number
of different ways.

00:24:56.547 --> 00:24:58.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, I'm
thinking of Rand and Rose

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:00.465 align:middle line:84%
Flem-Ath and "When
the Sky Fell."

00:25:00.465 --> 00:25:01.090 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yes.

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:02.230 align:middle line:90%
Brilliant, brilliant book.

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:04.750 align:middle line:90%
They did really fantastic work.

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And they were the ones
who raised the-- working

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.800 align:middle line:84%
with the earth crust
displacement theory of Charles

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.980 align:middle line:84%
Hapgood, they were the ones
who worked with and brought

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:19.350 align:middle line:84%
before the public the notion
that Antarctica might have been

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:23.300 align:middle line:84%
the home of the
lost civilization.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And there's another author whose
work is overlooked but deserves

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.840 align:middle line:90%
to be paid attention to.

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And that is Flavio Barbiero,
who's an Italian author, a very

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:36.485 align:middle line:84%
scholarly man, who actually
published a book called

00:25:36.485 --> 00:25:37.890 align:middle line:90%
"Civilization Under the Ice."

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:38.980 align:middle line:10%
I can't say it in Italian.

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.700 align:middle line:10%
It was published in
the Italian language--

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.470 align:middle line:10%
"Civilization Under the Ice."

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:48.500 align:middle line:84%
Back in 1973 or '74, way before
the Flem-Aths or me or anybody

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:52.450 align:middle line:84%
was working on this,
suggesting that Antarctica

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:54.940 align:middle line:84%
might have been the
site of Atlantis.

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
about Flavio Barbiero's work

00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:02.090 align:middle line:84%
is that he connects
this to a comet impact.

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:05.220 align:middle line:84%
Flavio Barbiero is looking
at pole shift or earth crust

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:08.880 align:middle line:84%
displacement, but he is
considering the process that

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.720 align:middle line:84%
sets the earth crust
displacement in motion.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And what he suggests is that
the Earth is hit a glancing

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:20.240 align:middle line:84%
blow by a huge astronomical
object, by a large comet,

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:24.410 align:middle line:84%
and that that imparts
the momentum that

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:29.290 align:middle line:84%
sets the crust in motion, or
that creates the pole shift.

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:33.790 align:middle line:84%
So he was very, very far
ahead of his time in that.

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:35.790 align:middle line:84%
There is a history
to these ideas,

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:38.570 align:middle line:84%
and it's important to recognize
Flavio's part in them.

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:40.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Have you
looked into how long

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:43.220 align:middle line:84%
most of the stuff
that we have now

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:46.630 align:middle line:84%
would last if there
was a pole shift?

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:48.344 align:middle line:90%
Because metal rusts away, right?

00:26:48.344 --> 00:26:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah, absolutely.

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:53.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that our
civilization is very solidly

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:54.810 align:middle line:90%
founded.

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:59.050 align:middle line:84%
I think we could lose
it all very rapidly.

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:03.380 align:middle line:84%
We are putting ourselves in
danger in a number of ways.

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And one of those ways is
the intense specialization

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:10.910 align:middle line:84%
of our civilization--
that everybody

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:14.230 align:middle line:84%
is a specialist at
something, but nobody

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:16.510 align:middle line:90%
knows how to do everything.

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:19.830 align:middle line:90%
We're all very interdependent.

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:21.760 align:middle line:90%
We take so much for granted.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.560 align:middle line:90%
There's food in the supermarket.

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, what does that
all come down to?

00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:28.650 align:middle line:84%
There's the concept
called just-in-time

00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:29.940 align:middle line:90%
with the delivery of food.

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:31.870 align:middle line:84%
We actually have
about three days

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:33.840 align:middle line:90%
of food supplies in our cities.

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And if the supply
line was cut, as it

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:39.960 align:middle line:84%
would be by a major
cataclysm, you

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:44.730 align:middle line:84%
would have people starving
in our cities within weeks,

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:46.170 align:middle line:90%
probably within days.

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:47.790 align:middle line:90%
It would be that bad.

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:50.410 align:middle line:90%
And you would then have riots.

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:54.520 align:middle line:84%
You would have massive
civil disorder taking place.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:58.210 align:middle line:84%
We've already seen it
with what in these terms

00:27:58.210 --> 00:28:01.325 align:middle line:84%
are very small-scale events,
like Hurricane Katrina--

00:28:01.325 --> 00:28:04.600 align:middle line:90%
the chaos that that caused.

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:08.060 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that
multiplied 1,000 times.

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Imagine a Katrina
but 1,000 times

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:15.430 align:middle line:84%
larger affecting the advanced
technological societies

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:16.480 align:middle line:90%
of our world.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:20.260 align:middle line:84%
Imagine an event that raises
sea level overnight 30 feet,

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:22.850 align:middle line:84%
flooding every coastal
city in the world.

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:24.540 align:middle line:84%
Would our civilization
survive that?

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:26.140 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:30.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we have
the psychic resources

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:30.890 align:middle line:90%
to survive that.

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:33.760 align:middle line:84%
I think we're
psychically very fragile.

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.480 align:middle line:84%
We're all very
comfortable in our lives.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:38.550 align:middle line:84%
We are all
interdependent on others.

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:41.150 align:middle line:84%
Very few of us actually
know how to survive.

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:44.290 align:middle line:84%
There are people who
take survival seriously

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:47.757 align:middle line:84%
and who would know
how to survive.

00:28:47.757 --> 00:28:48.840 align:middle line:90%
But it's very interesting.

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:52.330 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
the NASA satellite

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:55.040 align:middle line:84%
photos of the areas
of the earth that

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:57.290 align:middle line:84%
are lit up by electricity
today-- it's very beautiful,

00:28:57.290 --> 00:28:58.956 align:middle line:84%
they call it the Black
Marble, I think--

00:28:58.956 --> 00:29:02.180 align:middle line:84%
you can see these wonderful,
brightly lit areas, the United

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:08.520 align:middle line:84%
States, Europe, India also
increasingly brightly lit.

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And then you can see
other areas that are dark,

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:16.410 align:middle line:84%
like the Amazon rainforest
or like Central Africa--

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:19.670 align:middle line:84%
completely dark and almost no
electricity showing at all.

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:23.434 align:middle line:84%
And these images are taken by
us as a sign of the advancement

00:29:23.434 --> 00:29:24.850 align:middle line:84%
and achievement
of our technology,

00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:26.170 align:middle line:90%
that we can light up the world.

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:28.120 align:middle line:84%
But what I would
say is that it's

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:30.810 align:middle line:84%
the people who live
in the dark areas,

00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:33.990 align:middle line:84%
they're the ones who would
survive a coming cataclysm,

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:36.460 align:middle line:84%
because they know how
to live off the land.

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And we have forgotten
that skill by and large.

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:41.330 align:middle line:90%
So we're fragile.

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, we're impermanent
in the nature of the structures

00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:46.650 align:middle line:90%
that we make.

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:49.310 align:middle line:84%
How many of our
skyscrapers would still

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:51.460 align:middle line:90%
be there in 10,000 years' time?

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:53.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't think many
of them would be.

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And if this was accompanied
by gigantic earthquakes,

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:59.127 align:middle line:84%
as it easily could be,
by large-scale flooding,

00:29:59.127 --> 00:30:00.960 align:middle line:84%
we could be wiped from
the face of the Earth

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.690 align:middle line:90%
in the blink of an eye.

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And we would become the
next lost civilization.

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.899 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Yeah, in
the blink of an eye,

00:30:09.899 --> 00:30:11.940 align:middle line:84%
we could all be wiped from
the face of the Earth.

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:15.600 align:middle line:84%
That's not exactly the
most comforting thought.

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:18.450 align:middle line:84%
But look, I don't
think that's what's

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:20.149 align:middle line:84%
going to happen to
us this time around,

00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:21.690 align:middle line:84%
so please don't
think that I'm trying

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:23.710 align:middle line:90%
to peddle fear porn here.

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:26.410 align:middle line:90%
But it did happen before.

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:28.450 align:middle line:84%
There is absolutely
conclusive evidence,

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:30.870 align:middle line:84%
as you saw with
the nanodiamonds,

00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:33.580 align:middle line:84%
with the platinum, with the
iridium that's been found.

00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:35.830 align:middle line:84%
We know that there was
some sort of impact.

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:38.780 align:middle line:84%
It could've been a comet, it
could have been asteroids.

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:40.700 align:middle line:84%
John Anthony West,
as we'll see later,

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:42.340 align:middle line:84%
says that it might
have been some kind

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:45.221 align:middle line:84%
of coronal mass
ejection from the sun.

00:30:45.221 --> 00:30:47.220 align:middle line:84%
But the point is, there
was a great catastrophe,

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:49.400 align:middle line:90%
a series of two.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.920 align:middle line:84%
And what this
means is that there

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:56.560 align:middle line:84%
could have been a highly
advanced civilization that

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:58.630 align:middle line:90%
got completely wiped clean.

00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And that means that all bets are
off as far as whether we would

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:05.260 align:middle line:84%
ever be able to find really
tangible evidence of the type

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:07.530 align:middle line:84%
that archaeologists
want to have.

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:10.570 align:middle line:84%
There's some intrinsic
human blockage

00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:13.440 align:middle line:84%
that we have around the
idea of a mega-catastrophe

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:14.040 align:middle line:90%
of this scope.

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.373 align:middle line:90%
We don't want to think about it.

00:31:15.373 --> 00:31:17.640 align:middle line:90%
It's too horrifying.

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:19.840 align:middle line:84%
Coming up in the
next episode, we're

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:23.300 align:middle line:84%
going to be talking
to John Anthony West.

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And specifically, I wanted
to engage him on something

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.330 align:middle line:84%
that people don't
usually ask him about.

00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:29.870 align:middle line:84%
Everybody knows
John Anthony West

00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:34.180 align:middle line:84%
as the guy who essentially
back-dated the Sphinx

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:37.410 align:middle line:84%
to make it much older, and we'll
talk about how he did that.

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:39.550 align:middle line:84%
But I also wanted to talk
to him about, really,

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:42.650 align:middle line:84%
the core of his work,
"The Serpent in the Sky,"

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:46.640 align:middle line:84%
which is this notion of
this French researcher named

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.480 align:middle line:90%
Schwaller de Lubicz.

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:51.260 align:middle line:84%
I tried to get through
his book "Temple of Man."

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And as I say in the interview,
I enjoyed the pictures.

00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:56.370 align:middle line:84%
That's about as
much as I could do.

00:31:56.370 --> 00:31:59.080 align:middle line:84%
So with West, we're going to
hear some very interesting

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:02.240 align:middle line:84%
stuff about what did
de Lubicz contribute

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.770 align:middle line:84%
to the field of
Egyptology in general.

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And specifically, how
do we you use the Sphinx

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:11.850 align:middle line:84%
and a new site in
Turkey to help date

00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:15.710 align:middle line:84%
ourselves much older than we
ever thought we were before?

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:18.360 align:middle line:84%
That's coming up next
time here on "Disclosure,"

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:20.470 align:middle line:90%
and I thank you for watching.

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:29.934 align:middle line:90%
