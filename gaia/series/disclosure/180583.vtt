00:00:03.444 --> 00:00:19.535 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.535 --> 00:00:20.660 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID WILCOCK: All right.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.220 align:middle line:10%
Welcome to "Disclosure."

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.230 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, David
Wilcock, and I am here

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.440 align:middle line:10%
with Dr. Pete Peterson,
continuing our investigation

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.680 align:middle line:10%
into his stunning
work on what he has

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.020 align:middle line:10%
called the informational field.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.620 align:middle line:84%
So, Pete, welcome
back to the show.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.036 align:middle line:84%
>>PETE PETERSON:
Thank you, David.

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: We have been
talking about things that

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.170 align:middle line:90%
involve radionics technology.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And we had specifically
been mentioning

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.140 align:middle line:84%
these cameras that
could take photographs

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.840 align:middle line:84%
of the interior
of someone's body,

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.550 align:middle line:84%
but apparently
were using nothing

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.620 align:middle line:84%
but what you called a witness,
some piece of their hair,

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.240 align:middle line:84%
or a blood sample, or
something like that.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, obviously, there is some
component of that camera,

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.864 align:middle line:84%
as you said in the last
episode, that is psychic.

00:01:05.864 --> 00:01:07.280 align:middle line:84%
For lack of a
better term, there's

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.240 align:middle line:84%
a consciousness thing
going on with the person.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.740 align:middle line:84%
But is it also having to do
with the, as you would say,

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.260 align:middle line:84%
information that is
stored in the witness?

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.030 align:middle line:90%
Is that somehow related to this?

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.820 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Witness doesn't
seem to store the information.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.980 align:middle line:84%
It seems to tune it or to
be able to go to wherever

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.720 align:middle line:84%
that type of
information is stored

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.420 align:middle line:90%
and gain that information.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And it has very little to
do with the mechanical part

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.850 align:middle line:90%
of the camera.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.400 align:middle line:84%
There's no-- some of the cameras
had some wire coils in them.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.670 align:middle line:84%
Some of them didn't
have those at all.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.090 align:middle line:84%
They still both took
excellent photographs,

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.240 align:middle line:90%
excellent pictures.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.130 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.671 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: A lot
of technology there

00:01:53.671 --> 00:01:57.140 align:middle line:84%
could have been used
in the video industry,

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.350 align:middle line:84%
because everything
was in perfect focus.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.960 align:middle line:90%
Everything was in perfect color.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.800 align:middle line:84%
You could mentally ask it
to do different things.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.220 align:middle line:90%
And it would do those things.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.400 align:middle line:84%
It basically was a device
that dealt with information.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.170 align:middle line:90%
It dealt with input information.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.910 align:middle line:84%
It dealt with information
of the subject matter.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And it dealt with
the information

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.110 align:middle line:84%
that you maybe even
subconsciously wanted it

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.060 align:middle line:90%
to have or have access to.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: That's
certainly very different

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.467 align:middle line:84%
than the conventional
view of things.

00:02:31.467 --> 00:02:32.300 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Exactly.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.890 align:middle line:84%
It was completely--
it's completely

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.610 align:middle line:84%
different than typical
physics as we would use it

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.890 align:middle line:90%
in electronics, mechanics.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.640 align:middle line:84%
It was very much different
from that and very much better.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.870 align:middle line:84%
And I know that I've
had reports of people

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.430 align:middle line:84%
dealing with using
the information field

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.770 align:middle line:84%
and contacting aliens
and getting information

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.630 align:middle line:90%
from them that was just--

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.450 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't even
possible to ask for.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Because we had nothing like
it in our physical universe.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.940 align:middle line:84%
It's an informational
component of the universe.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And its whole structure and the
way that it puts words together

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.760 align:middle line:90%
is very different.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.830 align:middle line:84%
That's why the Russians are
so very good at science,

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.750 align:middle line:84%
because science consists
of things that are real.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.790 align:middle line:84%
But things that
are real in science

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.430 align:middle line:84%
don't necessarily have to be
real in the physical world.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.390 align:middle line:84%
It can be real in the
informational world.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.580 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot more
information there.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I remember
reading about a guy who was

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.600 align:middle line:90%
doing live blood cell analysis.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And he had come up
with the conclusion

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.320 align:middle line:84%
that if someone had
a particular problem

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.440 align:middle line:84%
with certain organs in the
body or things like this,

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.240 align:middle line:84%
that there would actually be
particles in the blood that

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.520 align:middle line:84%
would appear as
that organ and would

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.150 align:middle line:84%
have the same type of
damage or distortion

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.880 align:middle line:84%
that the organ had
visible on those.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.650 align:middle line:84%
Is that a possibility of
something that could happen?

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.470 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: That's
one of the dimensions

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.810 align:middle line:90%
of the informational universe.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.200 align:middle line:84%
Things relate to
each other so much

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.650 align:middle line:84%
that they happen on a
microscale, a macroscale

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.880 align:middle line:90%
and a scale in between.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.900 align:middle line:84%
So many times you'll see
things in a photograph

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.190 align:middle line:90%
that you would--

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.390 align:middle line:84%
if you blew them down,
you would see them

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:44.110 align:middle line:84%
in a microscope slide
of the subject matter.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.760 align:middle line:84%
So there are a lot of
things that replicate.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.190 align:middle line:84%
The information, for
example, of a video picture

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.270 align:middle line:84%
you would take with
your cell phone--

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.000 align:middle line:84%
it'll appear on your
little cell phone screen.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.690 align:middle line:84%
But like we watched
one that you made

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:06.120 align:middle line:84%
last night that was on a very
large 5 or 6-foot format video

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.740 align:middle line:90%
screen.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And we were seeing
the same thing,

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.840 align:middle line:90%
but with a lot more clarity.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.010 align:middle line:84%
It's the mind that
sees, not the eye.

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.030 align:middle line:84%
The eye is a very
crude mechanism.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And at a distance of 8 feet,
about the smallest thing

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.330 align:middle line:84%
I can see would be
the light that-- it

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.650 align:middle line:84%
was reflected through the lens
of the eye onto the macula.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.055 align:middle line:84%
And maybe a 3/4 inch in
diameter is closest thing

00:05:34.055 --> 00:05:35.220 align:middle line:90%
that you see at 8 feet.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.460 align:middle line:84%
Yet, I can look at 8 feet
to the wall over there.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And I can see a flea
crawling on the wall.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.810 align:middle line:90%
My mind would generate that.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.590 align:middle line:90%
My eye couldn't see that at all.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So in this
experiment that I described

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.120 align:middle line:84%
or this observation I described
in "Source Field," a father was

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.140 align:middle line:84%
hypnotized that he would not
be able to see his daughter,

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.480 align:middle line:84%
that he would not
hear her or see her.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And they brought
him out of hypnosis.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And his daughter was
literally standing right

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.480 align:middle line:84%
in front of his
face and giggling.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And he was unaware
of her presence.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.982 align:middle line:84%
And then the hypnotist
took out a watch.

00:06:09.982 --> 00:06:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And he took it out of
his pocket and palmed it,

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.920 align:middle line:90%
so nobody could see what he had.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And then he immediately pressed
it behind the girl's back

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.350 align:middle line:84%
and asked the father to look at
his hand and see what he had.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And the father is staring
right through the little girl's

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.360 align:middle line:90%
chest.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And he was able to accurately
see that it was a pocket watch,

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.330 align:middle line:84%
and he was able to see the
inscriptions on the pocket

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:35.130 align:middle line:90%
accurately.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:35.930 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Right.

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:36.730 align:middle line:90%
And read the time.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:37.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yes.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I've seen
those experiments.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So I'm interested to
hear any other stuff like that,

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:43.380 align:middle line:90%
that you've heard.

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, something
is going on here.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.150 align:middle line:84%
Because conventional science
would say those photons

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.700 align:middle line:84%
from that watch could not pass
through that little girl's

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:51.570 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.010 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well,
in the Hindu Vedas,

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.440 align:middle line:84%
it says if you see anything
that's physical in nature,

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.320 align:middle line:90%
it's an illusion.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.575 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that we live
in a reciprocal universe.

00:07:04.575 --> 00:07:06.770 align:middle line:84%
A gentlemen by a
name of Dewey Larson

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.690 align:middle line:84%
prompted a whole set
of physics about that.

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:13.880 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that as
you take more and more

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.280 align:middle line:84%
of the physicalness away
from what we call reality,

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.720 align:middle line:84%
the more, and more, and more
you can learn and see about what

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.815 align:middle line:90%
it is you're looking at.

00:07:23.815 --> 00:07:24.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Interesting.

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: The world
is not as we think it.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And as we take away
information, we

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:34.590 align:middle line:84%
see more and more clearly
in physical nature

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:38.070 align:middle line:90%
with our eyes and our mind.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:44.075 align:middle line:84%
And the more we put into things,
the less, and less, and less

00:07:44.075 --> 00:07:45.850 align:middle line:90%
of physical nature there is.

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:48.140 align:middle line:90%
The physical nature goes away.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:52.250 align:middle line:84%
The physical nature is
reality minus a lot.

00:07:52.250 --> 00:08:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And so as the human being or
spiritual being would evolve,

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:05.000 align:middle line:84%
we would come to less and less
of a physicalness to nature.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And we would be able to
be many places at once,

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:13.037 align:middle line:84%
see many things at once, see
great or infinite distances.

00:08:13.037 --> 00:08:14.370 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Well, it's interesting.

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:16.770 align:middle line:84%
Because I talk a lot about
the "Law of One" material

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:17.570 align:middle line:90%
on my show.

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:20.900 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's the most
accurate revealed teaching

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.940 align:middle line:90%
or channeling that we've had.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And they express in there
that as you go higher up

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.510 align:middle line:84%
in the universe,
that you go into more

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:31.010 align:middle line:90%
what they call density.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:34.020 align:middle line:84%
So third density-- this
physical reality that we're in--

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.530 align:middle line:84%
they're always saying that
it's actually much less dense,

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:38.510 align:middle line:90%
including our physical body.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:41.390 align:middle line:84%
It's much less
dense with what they

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:43.580 align:middle line:90%
would call intelligent energy.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And that as you go
higher in density,

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:49.880 align:middle line:84%
the amount of intelligent
energy in a particular area

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.600 align:middle line:90%
actually goes way up.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.230 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I call
it information.

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:59.720 align:middle line:84%
The more information you get,
the less physically dense,

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.560 align:middle line:84%
the more information there
is room and space for.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And there are mechanisms
in both the body

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:12.370 align:middle line:84%
and in the mind that
bring that into being.

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:13.170 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Sure.

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: We don't--
we use very little.

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:18.442 align:middle line:84%
And we always hear you use
very little of your brain.

00:09:18.442 --> 00:09:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's very little
of your physical body.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.670 align:middle line:84%
For example, you can count
the molecules in the body.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.980 align:middle line:84%
You can say, well, OK,
with these molecules,

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:34.460 align:middle line:84%
if I were to form some
coding, that would indicate

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.710 align:middle line:84%
the things I see or the things
that I can feel, or taste,

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:40.290 align:middle line:90%
or touch, or whatever.

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:45.340 align:middle line:84%
The less dense in information
those things become.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:50.320 align:middle line:84%
So in our mind, we have a saying
that, like I say, the eye--

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.150 align:middle line:84%
about the the smallest thing
an eye can see at 8 feet

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:56.080 align:middle line:84%
distance is about a
3/4 inch in diameter.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I can look over
there and count legs on an ant

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:03.130 align:middle line:84%
at that distance, that I
couldn't even possibly see it.

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:06.620 align:middle line:84%
There isn't a visual
mechanism I can see that.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.200 align:middle line:90%
But I have seen it up close.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.540 align:middle line:90%
The mind has recorded that.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.791 align:middle line:84%
I've seen what it
looks like close.

00:10:12.791 --> 00:10:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And then I've gotten back a
little, and back a little,

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:15.700 align:middle line:90%
and back a little.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.074 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon
I look over there

00:10:17.074 --> 00:10:20.750 align:middle line:84%
and see a dot on the wall, and
it crawls in a certain way.

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.570 align:middle line:90%
My body says that's an ant.

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And what I see in my
mind's eye is an ant.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.736 align:middle line:84%
But the funny thing of it
is, is that you can say--

00:10:30.736 --> 00:10:34.270 align:middle line:90%
you can dye stain an ant's eye.

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And you can say, well,
what color is that eye?

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:38.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a color
organ that could even

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:41.800 align:middle line:84%
see a 1/2 inch in
diameter at that distance,

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.010 align:middle line:84%
yet I can tell you
what color the eye is.

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:48.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm perceiving with a
different mechanism.

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And that mechanism is
adding into the mechanism

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.030 align:middle line:90%
that we see with.

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:55.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So just
to break this down,

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:57.470 align:middle line:84%
is there light coming
off of that watch

00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:59.375 align:middle line:84%
through the little
girl's body somehow?

00:10:59.375 --> 00:11:00.175 align:middle line:90%
Are there photons?

00:11:00.175 --> 00:11:02.425 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: No, we're getting
something very different

00:11:02.425 --> 00:11:03.240 align:middle line:90%
from light.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.350 align:middle line:90%
What does he seeing?

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:07.310 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: The information.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:09.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: How did
it get to his eyes?

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:10.710 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: It's there already.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:12.040 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere and everywhen.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.839 align:middle line:84%
You can see it clear
across the universe.

00:11:13.839 --> 00:11:16.255 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What are some of the
other experiments like that,

00:11:16.255 --> 00:11:17.130 align:middle line:90%
that you've heard of?

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:18.700 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the
best one I found.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.470 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned that
there were some others.

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:22.900 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well,
There's been a lot

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:29.020 align:middle line:84%
of work done since we started
researching remote viewing.

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And there are things that can
be seen with remote viewing

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:36.370 align:middle line:84%
that you couldn't possibly see
with the eye at all outside.

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:41.890 align:middle line:84%
The eye has a certain range
of frequencies or oscillations

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:44.830 align:middle line:90%
of light energy.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:45.730 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Sure.

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:48.620 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And we have a way
of separating and sorting those

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:49.420 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:50.920 align:middle line:90%
The mind does.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:55.450 align:middle line:84%
The eye has a small mechanism--
does a small job of that.

00:11:55.450 --> 00:12:00.160 align:middle line:84%
The rest of what sees does
a greater part of that.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And you can-- for
example, there have

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:07.870 align:middle line:84%
been a lot of studies in
teaching people to see things.

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:11.290 align:middle line:84%
One of the old knowledge
things-- and for example,

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:14.320 align:middle line:84%
table tennis, or
tennis, or any sport

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.400 align:middle line:84%
that's played where the object
is moving faster than the eye

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.200 align:middle line:84%
can really see, yet
the eye sees it.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.880 align:middle line:90%
Fine.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:25.180 align:middle line:84%
So you see someone do
some magic thing in tennis

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.610 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, man, how in
the world did you do that?

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And they start
thinking about it.

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as they
start thinking about it,

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.940 align:middle line:84%
they're not able
to do it anymore.

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:38.369 align:middle line:84%
It happens faster than
the eye could see.

00:12:38.369 --> 00:12:39.910 align:middle line:84%
There have been a
lot of studies done

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:43.870 align:middle line:84%
as to how long it takes for
something to be seen by the eye

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:45.670 align:middle line:90%
and recognized.

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:48.160 align:middle line:84%
Martial artists are
very well aware of this.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.170 align:middle line:90%
They have what they call chi.

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:51.760 align:middle line:90%
They use what they call chi.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:57.340 align:middle line:84%
It's an information that
appears to parts of our spirit.

00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:00.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't say body, because
the body has pretty well

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:01.420 align:middle line:90%
been mapped out.

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:02.920 align:middle line:90%
We know the sizes of things.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.110 align:middle line:90%
We know the speed of things.

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Information is transmitted
by electrical waves over--

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.700 align:middle line:90%
or in a fluid media.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.490 align:middle line:90%
And it's very slow.

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:16.960 align:middle line:90%
And yet, we see things faster.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.330 align:middle line:84%
Martial artists
can react to things

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.400 align:middle line:84%
that they couldn't
possibly have seen.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.590 align:middle line:84%
They will strike
something that hasn't

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:26.034 align:middle line:90%
yet even been put toward them.

00:13:26.034 --> 00:13:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, I have
a personal example

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.320 align:middle line:90%
of that, that was very strange.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:33.400 align:middle line:84%
I had been studying
martial arts for two years.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And a kid came up behind
me as we were walking out

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.230 align:middle line:90%
from a tennis class in gym.

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:39.694 align:middle line:90%
And he swung his racket.

00:13:39.694 --> 00:13:41.110 align:middle line:84%
He was going to
hit me in the back

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:44.890 align:middle line:84%
of the knee with his tennis
racket at full velocity.

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And I had my tennis
racquet in my hand.

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And without any
conscious awareness

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:53.380 align:middle line:84%
to my regular mind whatsoever,
I'm just walking along.

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
my hand goes wham!

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And I just slammed the
tennis racket down.

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And I collided with his
racket, right as he's

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.150 align:middle line:90%
going to take out my knee.

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, my God,
how did you do that?

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:10.030 align:middle line:90%
You didn't even see it.

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.890 align:middle line:84%
Because he knew what
he was going to do.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:16.600 align:middle line:84%
So that was a personal
example of something that--

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.700 align:middle line:84%
obviously, if you hear
these martial arts stories,

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:22.180 align:middle line:84%
you have allegedly guys who
can be completely blindfolded

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:24.055 align:middle line:84%
and still do perfectly
well in a sword fight.

00:14:24.055 --> 00:14:24.854 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Right.

00:14:24.854 --> 00:14:26.650 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
children in India

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:29.410 align:middle line:84%
that, for example,
they'll blindfold them

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:34.770 align:middle line:84%
with several layers of
impervious silk clothes

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:35.820 align:middle line:90%
or things like that.

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll
hand them a book.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And they'll read
out of the book.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:39.705 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:14:39.705 --> 00:14:41.080 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And
some of them will

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.900 align:middle line:84%
take the book page by page,
and turn it backwards,

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:47.080 align:middle line:90%
and read the book from behind.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.600 align:middle line:90%
So information is something.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.245 align:middle line:84%
And it's there very differently
than physical matter

00:14:53.245 --> 00:14:56.860 align:middle line:84%
is there, and can be
scrambled in form,

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:59.830 align:middle line:90%
and then put back together.

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:01.810 align:middle line:84%
It can be encrypted
and yet read.

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And it will look to the
person who's doing it,

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:06.520 align:middle line:84%
who knows nothing of the
encryption algorithm.

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.820 align:middle line:84%
The information is still
there and it's intact.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:16.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: We have stories of
yogis who have their mouth,

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:21.130 align:middle line:84%
and their ears, and their nose
completely sealed off with wax.

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And then they submerge
underwater for like a week.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And then people bring their body
out, and they totally are fine.

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.950 align:middle line:84%
So what do you think is
going on in a case like that?

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:37.160 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Most times
it's fraud and stage

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.460 align:middle line:90%
magic, which is not magic.

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:44.800 align:middle line:84%
It's just doing things
in a manner that

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:50.350 align:middle line:84%
are to you perceptible
as a different thing

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:51.370 align:middle line:90%
than this happening.

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:55.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, on the other hand,
I've seen things like that.

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:56.530 align:middle line:90%
I've examined them.

00:15:56.530 --> 00:16:00.550 align:middle line:84%
I spent some times in India
and times in other places

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:03.100 align:middle line:84%
where that type
of thing is done.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And there's no question
that these people

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.770 align:middle line:90%
are able to sense information.

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And all this evidence is
what got me looking for,

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:15.880 align:middle line:84%
how does information
really affect

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:20.020 align:middle line:84%
our universe and the
universe we're in,

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:26.456 align:middle line:84%
rather than that that's visible
and available to our senses?

00:16:26.456 --> 00:16:28.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It is kind of
unfortunate, isn't it,

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:33.940 align:middle line:84%
that these guys that were doing
these feats were called fakers?

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:34.740 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Fakirs.

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:35.540 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:36.470 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:38.400 align:middle line:90%


00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Is there
any truth behind--

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.275 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: There was a great
difference between the word

00:16:42.275 --> 00:16:44.290 align:middle line:90%
fakir and faker.

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:47.620 align:middle line:84%
However, they're very
similar in our language.

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:51.460 align:middle line:90%
And it is very humorous.

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:55.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Is there any reality
behind some of the yogis who

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.010 align:middle line:90%
would apparently--

00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:58.570 align:middle line:84%
pretended they were
snake charmers?

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:01.229 align:middle line:84%
And they could get a rope
to come up out of a basket.

00:17:01.229 --> 00:17:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And the rope would
stand up straight,

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:05.560 align:middle line:84%
and they could actually
sit on the rope

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.060 align:middle line:90%
or balance on the rope.

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:13.500 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: You can see this
if you go on to YouTube.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:16.040 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole-- I'm trying
to think what they call it

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.270 align:middle line:90%
besides street magic.

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:20.970 align:middle line:84%
But there are a lot of people
who practice these things.

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:23.780 align:middle line:84%
There's one fellow that
takes a little flower

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:29.690 align:middle line:84%
and hangs it up with a rod
or something, up about 10

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:31.310 align:middle line:90%
feet on a brick wall.

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:33.146 align:middle line:84%
And then he rises
up and puts his hand

00:17:33.146 --> 00:17:35.270 align:middle line:84%
on the flower on the brick
wall and just sits there

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:41.300 align:middle line:84%
with his legs crossed in
the yogi position and seems

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:42.680 align:middle line:90%
totally suspended.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:47.060 align:middle line:84%
And there are a few places where
they've shown how that's done.

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:51.160 align:middle line:84%
But there are things
that are done that way.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.400 align:middle line:84%
I've seen people
move through walls--

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.200 align:middle line:90%
brick walls.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.990 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:17:55.990 --> 00:18:02.770 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And I've seen people
build a brick wall with a man

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:06.340 align:middle line:84%
who has no idea that he's
there building a wall--

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:08.230 align:middle line:84%
building a wall,
carrying a wall,

00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:10.680 align:middle line:84%
and then having
someone pass through--

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:14.630 align:middle line:84%
pass a hand through the wall
or see things through the wall.

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:19.870 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And so like I
say, the world that we see

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:23.920 align:middle line:84%
is merely a part of the
world that there is.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And the more we think we're
seeing it with our five senses,

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.870 align:middle line:90%
the less of the world it is.

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And the more it's the
world that we generated

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:34.247 align:middle line:90%
in our mind to appear that way.

00:18:34.247 --> 00:18:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What do you
think is stopping

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:39.530 align:middle line:84%
most people from having a
greater access to this reality?

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:42.297 align:middle line:84%
It seems like most people
have hardly any access

00:18:42.297 --> 00:18:43.255 align:middle line:90%
to this reality at all.

00:18:43.255 --> 00:18:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: All of our
religions tell us that.

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:46.460 align:middle line:90%
It's faith.

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.160 align:middle line:90%
It's belief.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So the belief
is really very important.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Belief
is all important.

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:57.130 align:middle line:84%
The rest of it is as the
Hindi's scriptures tell you.

00:18:57.130 --> 00:19:00.220 align:middle line:90%
The rest of it is imagination.

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:03.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I also was very
fascinated by reading

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:05.620 align:middle line:84%
Russian research
into cytokinesis

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:09.640 align:middle line:84%
and specifically a woman
named Alla Vinogradova,

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.200 align:middle line:84%
in which she was
getting something

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.000 align:middle line:90%
to move with her mind.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And then they measured the
energetics of the object

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:19.450 align:middle line:90%
that she was moving.

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And they found wavelengths
that duplicated

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:28.780 align:middle line:84%
her respiratory rate, her heart
rate, and her EKG patterns,

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:30.550 align:middle line:90%
and her brainwave patterns.

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:33.490 align:middle line:84%
They were actually-- there
was these fluctuations

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:36.820 align:middle line:84%
of energy in the object
that she was moving,

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:38.361 align:middle line:90%
which suggests what, exactly?

00:19:38.361 --> 00:19:39.610 align:middle line:90%
What do you think's happening?

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:41.443 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, I
would suggest definitely

00:19:41.443 --> 00:19:42.400 align:middle line:90%
a connection.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And if there's a connection,
then the next thing

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:46.900 align:middle line:90%
is, what's connected?

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:51.350 align:middle line:84%
And then the next question
is, how does this work?

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And there's been a lot
of work done on it.

00:19:53.570 --> 00:20:01.210 align:middle line:84%
A lot more in the Soviet
block area than over here,

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:04.890 align:middle line:84%
though there are a number of
government agencies doing that.

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the
government agencies that

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:10.400 align:middle line:84%
are using what we call
psychic phenomena,

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:14.800 align:middle line:84%
almost every agency has people
that are there using that.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.930 align:middle line:84%
The way we hear
about remote viewing.

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:18.050 align:middle line:90%
Who did remote viewing?

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:20.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Navy was involved,
and the Army was involved,

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.180 align:middle line:84%
and the CIA was
involved, and so forth.

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And they got very
good results from it.

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And then they wrote that they
got moderately poor results.

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And then the
laboratories for that

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:39.700 align:middle line:84%
was being done, or either
compromised, or taken down.

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:41.090 align:middle line:90%
Programs moved on.

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:44.360 align:middle line:84%
People became-- did that
same kind of work, but out

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.690 align:middle line:90%
in civilian life.

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:50.150 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you that the
number of people doing it

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:54.000 align:middle line:84%
in the government has
grown, and grown, and grown.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.770 align:middle line:90%
And something is very real.

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:01.190 align:middle line:84%
That's all I should
say about it.

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:06.620 align:middle line:84%
But if you have a skill
or a talent in that--

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:09.730 align:middle line:90%
a natural skill or talent--

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:11.120 align:middle line:84%
there are people
who are artists,

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.070 align:middle line:90%
and there are people who aren't.

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:14.480 align:middle line:84%
I can draw a
picture of anything.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And I've never seen anyone that
could recognize what it was.

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:18.460 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:19.260 align:middle line:90%


00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:22.310 align:middle line:90%
Just no talent at all for that.

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:25.940 align:middle line:84%
But there are things that
I do have a talent for.

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's adding one and one
and getting two every time

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:33.900 align:middle line:84%
or adding one and one and
getting 18 once in a while.

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:38.930 align:middle line:84%
But it allows me to do things
that other people don't

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:41.550 align:middle line:90%
have the ability to do.

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And the more you
learn to trust in it,

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:47.750 align:middle line:90%
the more you have faith--

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:50.270 align:middle line:84%
you have in it and
faith in your ability

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:54.060 align:middle line:84%
to do it, the better
you can do it.

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:55.590 align:middle line:90%
And the more you learn.

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And then the better
you can do it again.

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's an area
that's hardly been scratched.

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.499 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, I was thinking
about as you're talking,

00:22:05.499 --> 00:22:07.790 align:middle line:84%
some of the studies that have
come out of the Institute

00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:11.476 align:middle line:84%
of HeartMath, where they
find people who are--

00:22:11.476 --> 00:22:12.600 align:middle line:90%
they don't know each other.

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.266 align:middle line:84%
They're not interacting
with each other,

00:22:14.266 --> 00:22:16.325 align:middle line:84%
but they live in
adjacent apartments.

00:22:16.325 --> 00:22:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And they measure these people's
heart rate, and their breathing

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:21.440 align:middle line:84%
rate, and their
brainwave activity.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And they find that there
is a synchronization

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.570 align:middle line:90%
between those two people.

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:28.970 align:middle line:84%
So that's along the lines
of what we've talked about.

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:31.220 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing I thought
was really interesting--

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:34.100 align:middle line:84%
and I did talk about
this in "Source Field"

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:38.420 align:middle line:84%
is that whoever has the
more coherent pattern

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.390 align:middle line:84%
of brainwave activity, heart
rate activity-- whoever

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:46.460 align:middle line:84%
has the higher and healthier
pattern, that pattern seems

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:51.320 align:middle line:84%
to be the one that spreads,
whereas a less coherent, a more

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:56.840 align:middle line:84%
disjointed pattern
will be overcome

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:59.910 align:middle line:90%
by a higher level of coherence.

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:02.960 align:middle line:84%
So where do you think
this coherence factors in?

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.980 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: That's the word.

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:07.890 align:middle line:84%
That's what you're
looking for in that area.

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:11.640 align:middle line:84%
There are patterns
of information.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:15.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of those
patterns is a sound wave.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:18.410 align:middle line:84%
One of those patterns is a
picture or a photograph that's

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:21.230 align:middle line:90%
illuminated coming toward you.

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:23.900 align:middle line:84%
But there are many, many
others in different areas

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:26.030 align:middle line:90%
that we haven't studied.

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And there are areas in some
things that we've studied.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's been laughed at,
and put down, and passed

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:35.630 align:middle line:90%
by for one reason or another.

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:40.220 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of them
that are especially known.

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:44.660 align:middle line:84%
Because some of the states
that the mind gets in--

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.270 align:middle line:84%
when you're a
religious person, some

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:51.675 align:middle line:84%
of the states you're called
on to get into to have faith--

00:23:51.675 --> 00:23:53.210 align:middle line:90%
it says, what moves mountains?

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:55.160 align:middle line:90%
Faith moves mountains.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.300 align:middle line:90%
And it moves you.

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And it moves a lot
of other things.

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:01.310 align:middle line:84%
So as a person
becomes religious,

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:05.510 align:middle line:84%
sees these things actually
happening in their life.

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:07.370 align:middle line:84%
Because they learn
techniques that

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:09.830 align:middle line:84%
were taught within
the religion that

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:13.200 align:middle line:84%
weren't taught
within the public.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.960 align:middle line:84%
And there are a
number of religions

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.420 align:middle line:90%
that are known for this.

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:21.290 align:middle line:84%
The Sufis, for example, and
certain movements and things

00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:24.410 align:middle line:84%
that they do that put
them into certain states.

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:28.490 align:middle line:84%
I had some unique experiences
in my personal life,

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:33.620 align:middle line:84%
because of the book my
parents chose to use and--

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:34.830 align:middle line:90%
how do you raise a child?

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:36.950 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Spock wrote a book in the--

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:38.420 align:middle line:90%
I don't know-- '30s or '40s.

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:42.230 align:middle line:84%
It was very popular
when I was a child.

00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And so he said, well, your
child should have good sleep.

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And you should put him
to bed at a certain age.

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:51.560 align:middle line:84%
You should go to
bed at 6 o'clock,

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.170 align:middle line:90%
and 7 o'clock, 8 o'clock.

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:56.360 align:middle line:90%
And I was bored.

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.310 align:middle line:84%
My mind worked a
little differently,

00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:04.850 align:middle line:84%
I think because of a bump
I received on my eyebrow.

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And I know my life
changed at that point.

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And I got where I
could guess things

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:16.530 align:middle line:90%
that we're going to happen.

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:18.500 align:middle line:84%
I got where I could
understand things

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.000 align:middle line:90%
that adults were talking about.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And my father was an engineer,
and he had engineer friends.

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And I could understand what
they were talking about.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.110 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand it
how they understood it,

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:32.800 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't know
that until much later.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And I would tell him, well,
why don't you see this?

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:39.110 align:middle line:84%
So it was something
I was seeing.

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And we have different
ways of accessing.

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:45.060 align:middle line:84%
We access a lot more with vision
than you would think we do,

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:49.440 align:middle line:84%
a lot more with touch, and
feel, and emotion, and so forth.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:53.170 align:middle line:84%
So we have ways of dealing
in that and thinking in it.

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:55.170 align:middle line:84%
We don't have words in
the English language that

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:56.980 align:middle line:90%
talk about it.

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:59.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, I know
Dr. William Braud has

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:02.160 align:middle line:84%
done some remarkable
scientific research-- very

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:05.400 align:middle line:84%
thorough replicability
like you can't imagine,

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:09.360 align:middle line:84%
which the key of science is
to replicate the experiment.

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things he did is
the sense of being stared at.

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:14.730 align:middle line:90%
We feel something.

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:15.813 align:middle line:90%
Somebody is looking at us.

00:26:15.813 --> 00:26:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And then we turn and
sure enough, they are.

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:21.540 align:middle line:84%
He was able to determine
that even if you stare

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:24.090 align:middle line:84%
at someone intensely for a
short burst of time when there's

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:27.240 align:middle line:84%
a hidden camera in the room, and
they're not aware that they're

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:31.389 align:middle line:84%
being filmed, they may not
consciously show anything,

00:26:31.389 --> 00:26:33.180 align:middle line:84%
because you tell them
just sit in this room

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:33.970 align:middle line:90%
and read a magazine.

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:35.940 align:middle line:84%
They don't even realize
there's a camera there.

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:42.150 align:middle line:84%
But their body shows
excitation, noticeable increases

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:45.810 align:middle line:84%
in vital signs, across
the board at the times

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:47.670 align:middle line:90%
that they're being stared at.

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:49.530 align:middle line:84%
So there's something
going on in the body

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:52.830 align:middle line:84%
that our conscious mind is
either vetoing or is completely

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:54.184 align:middle line:90%
unaware of.

00:26:54.184 --> 00:26:56.350 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Again, I call
this informational fields.

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:58.960 align:middle line:84%
It's information
that's taking place.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:04.595 align:middle line:84%
Information-- well,
the Hindi Vedas--

00:27:04.595 --> 00:27:06.170 align:middle line:90%
and I'll tell you.

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:10.900 align:middle line:84%
If you can find something
physical in nature,

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:13.590 align:middle line:90%
it's an illusion.

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:17.730 align:middle line:84%
The reality is when
you have a sense of it,

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:21.060 align:middle line:84%
but then you have a
sense of all of it

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:23.310 align:middle line:84%
and all the information
that goes with it.

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:26.130 align:middle line:90%
So it's an informational thing.

00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's a lot
like a radio wave.

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:31.380 align:middle line:90%
We don't see a radio wave.

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And parts of our
body-- there are

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:35.520 align:middle line:84%
people who learn to
be-- who are taught

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:38.820 align:middle line:84%
and learn to be sensitive to
a radio wave or a television

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:44.110 align:middle line:84%
wave, where they can see it,
so to speak, with their skin.

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:46.800 align:middle line:84%
So there's just a
lot of information

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:51.630 align:middle line:84%
that we haven't needed to
protect ourself from animation.

00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:58.180 align:middle line:84%
It'll be bears, or lions,
or bad guys, or whatever.

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:02.460 align:middle line:84%
But some people can sense those
things, and some people can't.

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: We at this
network ended up

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:07.710 align:middle line:84%
acquiring footage from
Gail Thackray, who

00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:11.160 align:middle line:84%
had filmed some remarkable
faith healing work.

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.430 align:middle line:90%
Some of it was John of God.

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:13.890 align:middle line:90%
There were some others.

00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:17.610 align:middle line:84%
Some of these faith healers
that she actually filmed

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:20.850 align:middle line:90%
have like a radial saw.

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:23.130 align:middle line:84%
And they literally saw
open a person's chest

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:25.380 align:middle line:90%
without anesthetic.

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And they perform
a heart operation

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:30.030 align:middle line:84%
while the person
is fully conscious.

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:32.280 align:middle line:84%
So this goes way beyond
the idea of somebody

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.320 align:middle line:84%
palming a little piece
of guts in his hand

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.699 align:middle line:84%
and pretending that he's
pulling something out of you.

00:28:36.699 --> 00:28:37.740 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Very much so.

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:39.270 align:middle line:84%
I spent some time
in the Philippines.

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:40.145 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, you did?

00:28:40.145 --> 00:28:42.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I spent
some time in Brazil.

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:45.240 align:middle line:90%
You know Vern Woolf.

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:48.360 align:middle line:90%
And he was favored down there.

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:52.710 align:middle line:84%
John of God felt him from
miles and called his people

00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:53.940 align:middle line:90%
to bring him to him--

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:54.937 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:28:54.937 --> 00:28:56.520 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: --and
said this is the man

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:58.980 align:middle line:84%
we've been waiting for,
for certain things.

00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And there were things that
couldn't have happened

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:06.930 align:middle line:84%
without the knowledge,
that various people had

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:09.330 align:middle line:84%
various knowledge,
that they didn't get it

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:13.020 align:middle line:84%
from reading something, or
hearing something, or seeing

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:14.580 align:middle line:90%
with their eyes something.

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:17.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: One of the
things that Dr. Don Elkins

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.350 align:middle line:84%
states in the introduction
to the "Law of One"

00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:21.900 align:middle line:84%
series in book one
of "Law of One"

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:24.480 align:middle line:84%
is that he witnessed
a faith healer working

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:27.090 align:middle line:84%
on someone, where
his two fingers were

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:29.430 align:middle line:90%
acting as some sort of scalpel.

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:30.750 align:middle line:90%
And he got a little careless.

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And his fingers swept
and touched someone's arm

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:36.570 align:middle line:90%
who he was not operating on.

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:38.480 align:middle line:90%
And literally, he watched--

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:41.160 align:middle line:84%
Don Elkins watched the
flesh part on this person

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:45.000 align:middle line:84%
as if an invisible scalpel
had cut their arm open.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And then the guy
just said, oh, sorry,

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:49.290 align:middle line:84%
and just did this and
closed it back up,

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:50.795 align:middle line:90%
just like nothing had happened.

00:29:50.795 --> 00:29:51.920 align:middle line:90%
Did you see anything like--

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.310 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I've seen
many things like that.

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: There was a lady
that probably still brings

00:29:57.050 --> 00:30:00.360 align:middle line:84%
healers over in
Central California

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:02.820 align:middle line:90%
from the Philippines.

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And I've watched people
go through a CAT scan

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:10.380 align:middle line:90%
or an MRI go in there.

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:13.800 align:middle line:90%
I've seen tissue removed.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And then I've seen them go back
and have-- right after that,

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:19.320 align:middle line:84%
drive back over into
Nevada where they

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:22.480 align:middle line:90%
had a CAT scan done or an MRI.

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And the tissue was
no longer there.

00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And then I've seen the
tissue examined from this.

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And then, yes, it was
the DNA of the person

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:33.510 align:middle line:90%
that the tissue came from.

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:35.880 align:middle line:90%
And it was malignant cancer.

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:37.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now, we
have these curanderos

00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:41.100 align:middle line:84%
where it appears that they
are taking bad spirits out

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:43.920 align:middle line:84%
of a person's body and then
putting them into an egg.

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And then you crack the egg,
and it's all disgusting inside.

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:50.494 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, there's got to be a
way that this could be fraud,

00:30:50.494 --> 00:30:52.410 align:middle line:84%
where maybe they're
popping a hole in the egg,

00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:55.120 align:middle line:84%
or they're putting poison
in it or something.

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:57.660 align:middle line:84%
But are there cases where
that could actually be--

00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:00.630 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Many-- very much
more definitive cases than that

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:05.790 align:middle line:84%
where a lot of the errors
that could have crept in--

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:11.460 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people like Penn
and Teller looking at it.

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:13.770 align:middle line:84%
Similar people looking
at it and seeing if they

00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:17.650 align:middle line:90%
could see sleight of hand.

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And many of the various things
that are mute and fraud.

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And there are people
that do tricks and magic

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:29.670 align:middle line:84%
tricks on the internet,
especially on YouTube.

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see
them doing things,

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:35.700 align:middle line:84%
and it later is explained by
Penn and Teller or by others.

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Many times it
can't be explained.

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:40.650 align:middle line:84%
There are programs
that I've been involved

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:43.595 align:middle line:90%
in that people that could do--

00:31:43.595 --> 00:31:46.080 align:middle line:90%
what is called warm forming.

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.730 align:middle line:90%
They take a fork, for example--

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:50.730 align:middle line:84%
hold it like this
and have it just

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:55.480 align:middle line:84%
roll up like a tape measure,
or have it selectively--

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:58.440 align:middle line:84%
the tines roll
opposite directions,

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.990 align:middle line:84%
or take it with a finger
and just barely touch it,

00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:05.130 align:middle line:84%
and wind it up, or
twist it up into things

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:07.620 align:middle line:84%
that you couldn't
do mechanically

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:10.480 align:middle line:84%
without breaking--
without tearing the metal,

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:13.350 align:middle line:84%
crystalizing the metal,
breaking the metal.

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:15.015 align:middle line:84%
And yet, you could
do these things.

00:32:15.015 --> 00:32:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, I'm also
thinking about Paul Dong who

00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:22.110 align:middle line:84%
wrote the book "China's
Super Psychics" in which he

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:26.100 align:middle line:84%
was describing kids in
China who, for example,

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:27.510 align:middle line:84%
there was a little
girl who could

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:31.680 align:middle line:84%
wave her hand over a whole
bush of flowers that had not

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.000 align:middle line:90%
blossomed.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And the flowers would
all spontaneously bloom.

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:40.270 align:middle line:84%
So these clearly do appear
to be real abilities

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:41.640 align:middle line:90%
that some people have.

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:47.640 align:middle line:84%
But you believe that it's the
power of our consciousness,

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:51.960 align:middle line:84%
our belief systems that
actually will restrict us

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.220 align:middle line:90%
from being able to do this?

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:56.010 align:middle line:84%
Because we talked about the
spoon bending stuff before.

00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:57.900 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: A lot of
kids have no problem

00:32:57.900 --> 00:32:59.700 align:middle line:90%
doing many of these things.

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And as they grow older,
they have problems,

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:05.650 align:middle line:84%
because they're taught that
you can't do those things.

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the main
thing is belief.

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And if you go back and look
at all religious texts,

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:14.490 align:middle line:90%
belief is mentioned everywhere.

00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:18.330 align:middle line:84%
Belief is the power
behind the secret.

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:21.210 align:middle line:84%
The belief is the thing
that allows it to happen,

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:24.184 align:middle line:84%
makes it take place, or
allows it to take place.

00:33:24.184 --> 00:33:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, this gets
into some other stuff

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:27.766 align:middle line:84%
that I think is really
interesting, too.

00:33:27.766 --> 00:33:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
idea of black magic

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:36.780 align:middle line:84%
and the idea of
stealing people's energy

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:40.290 align:middle line:90%
and feeding on people's energy.

00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:42.600 align:middle line:84%
This gets into like
the Cabal and things

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:47.760 align:middle line:84%
like this, where I've seen
some pretty compelling

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:51.600 align:middle line:84%
scientific experiments to
suggest that energy can

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:52.980 align:middle line:90%
be taken from living things.

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And we could talk about
that a little later,

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:57.300 align:middle line:84%
and that it will actually
restrict their health.

00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:59.890 align:middle line:90%
It will decrease their health.

00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:03.090 align:middle line:84%
So is it possible that there
are forces in the universe that

00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:06.510 align:middle line:84%
are preying on this
energy, that are wanting

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:09.731 align:middle line:84%
to use this energy for their own
enrichment in a negative way?

00:34:09.731 --> 00:34:12.230 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I've read created
quite a few things about that.

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:14.130 align:middle line:84%
Those aren't things
that I've investigated,

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:18.659 align:middle line:84%
because I've tried to stay
with things that I could easily

00:34:18.659 --> 00:34:21.600 align:middle line:84%
go to the store,
buy simple parts,

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:25.620 align:middle line:84%
build equipment that would
demonstrate the things that I

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:27.330 align:middle line:90%
was involved in.

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And I built a
medical system based

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:35.340 align:middle line:90%
around an instrument like that.

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:38.429 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't invent
the instrument,

00:34:38.429 --> 00:34:42.510 align:middle line:84%
but I found out how it
worked, because the people who

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:45.030 align:middle line:90%
invented it didn't have words.

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:46.290 align:middle line:90%
They stumbled onto it.

00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:51.360 align:middle line:84%
Their belief allowed them to do
it, because they saw it happen.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:52.710 align:middle line:90%
And then I took--

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:55.920 align:middle line:84%
from that I took, well,
how does this happen?

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:57.460 align:middle line:90%
And why does it happen?

00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:59.920 align:middle line:90%
How can we control it?

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And can we take a
positive control of it?

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:09.490 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
that has information--

00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:11.560 align:middle line:84%
almost all information
you find out

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:14.370 align:middle line:84%
has a positive aspect
and a negative aspect.

00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:17.090 align:middle line:90%


00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:19.450 align:middle line:84%
That makes a great
healing system,

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:21.640 align:middle line:90%
makes a great weapon system.

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:24.580 align:middle line:84%
How do we keep the
weapons thing out of it?

00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:30.020 align:middle line:84%
How do we keep the natural
human feelings out of it?

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And so I studied with two
people and-- or studied

00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:38.880 align:middle line:84%
four different people
that built equipment

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:42.190 align:middle line:84%
that would operate independently
of a human operator

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:45.010 align:middle line:90%
other than themselves.

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:49.760 align:middle line:84%
If they imbued that into the
instrument, then it would work.

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And many of these instruments
will work for a period of time.

00:35:53.350 --> 00:35:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And then it'll
require the person

00:35:55.420 --> 00:36:01.540 align:middle line:84%
who had the initial
thought form, belief form--

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:04.080 align:middle line:84%
it will require a
little input from them.

00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And in Hindi, fakirism
rather than magic.

00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And Magic is basically
sleight of hand and bologna.

00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And fakirism is
actually causing things

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:22.690 align:middle line:84%
to take place that so far
in our scientific knowledge

00:36:22.690 --> 00:36:24.550 align:middle line:84%
are totally impossible
that have happened.

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And so that's talked
about with those people.

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:31.930 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that's talked
about is called Shaktipat.

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And we've had a number
of Hindi people come

00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:38.200 align:middle line:84%
to this country that
could cause things

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:41.440 align:middle line:90%
to happen with Shaktipat.

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:45.940 align:middle line:84%
They could touch
you from behind.

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:47.570 align:middle line:90%
No speech.

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:48.370 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:50.782 align:middle line:84%
No written words or
things like that.

00:36:50.782 --> 00:36:52.240 align:middle line:84%
They could touch
you, and knowledge

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:53.960 align:middle line:90%
would come to your mind.

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And you would have absolute
knowledge of things.

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:58.660 align:middle line:84%
It's very different from
anything that you've had.

00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Over a period of time
that tends to die out.

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:06.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you were to study some
of the things they've studied--

00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:10.420 align:middle line:84%
study techniques, yoga
techniques, for example.

00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And tai chi techniques,
other techniques in oriental

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:24.940 align:middle line:84%
or foreign to us methods
of belief and study.

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:27.070 align:middle line:84%
Just learning to
see things enough

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:30.220 align:middle line:84%
that you could take on
a new belief system.

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not know how it worked,
but see that it happens.

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:38.140 align:middle line:84%
Then for you, it
happens as well.

00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And then if you practice that
a lot, it tends to go away.

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:45.141 align:middle line:90%
You tend to lose that knowledge.

00:37:45.141 --> 00:37:47.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, this is really
fascinating stuff, Pete.

00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
you've been involved

00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:51.970 align:middle line:84%
in some very classified
stuff that you're not

00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:53.970 align:middle line:90%
authorized to talk about.

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:56.374 align:middle line:84%
But I think that even what
you can talk about here-- just

00:37:56.374 --> 00:37:57.790 align:middle line:84%
the breadth of
your experience has

00:37:57.790 --> 00:37:59.200 align:middle line:90%
been very, very fascinating.

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.620 align:middle line:90%
So I want to thank you.

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:01.830 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, you're
welcome very much.

00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And there's lots of information
on the internet people

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:05.050 align:middle line:90%
can go to.

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:07.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: All right I'm
your host, David Wilcock,

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:09.370 align:middle line:90%
here with Dr. Pete Peterson.

00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:11.330 align:middle line:84%
I hope you've enjoyed
this as much as I have.

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:12.820 align:middle line:90%
And we'll see you next time.

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:16.170 align:middle line:90%
