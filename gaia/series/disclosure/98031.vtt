00:00:16.536 --> 00:00:18.660 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID WILCOCK: All right,
it's me, David Wilcock,

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.380 align:middle line:10%
and here we are in "Disclosure."

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.850 align:middle line:10%
This is the show that is
breaking the boundaries down

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.370 align:middle line:10%
and revealing to you the
truth of the knowledge that

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.620 align:middle line:10%
has been suppressed from us.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.130 align:middle line:84%
This is our final
interview, part two

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.850 align:middle line:84%
of the groundbreaking
pioneer Robert Bauval

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.800 align:middle line:84%
giving us very, very enigmatic,
fascinating information

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.310 align:middle line:84%
about the Orion
correlation theory,

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.820 align:middle line:84%
the idea that the Sphinx,
the pyramids of Egypt,

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.450 align:middle line:84%
and in fact the Nile River
are all precise duplicates

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.760 align:middle line:84%
on the ground of the Milky
Way and the belt stars

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.135 align:middle line:84%
and actually some of the other
stars in the constellation

00:01:02.135 --> 00:01:04.780 align:middle line:90%
of Orion up in the sky.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.110 align:middle line:84%
There's a variety of very robust
evidence that supports this,

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.640 align:middle line:84%
and we go through a lot of that
in this particular episode.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, Robert Bauval
has dug up some things

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.420 align:middle line:84%
that the powers that
were, pun unintended,

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.460 align:middle line:90%
really don't want him to know.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.240 align:middle line:84%
So in this particular
episode, I go

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.080 align:middle line:84%
through some of the most
vociferous attacks that

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.300 align:middle line:84%
have been made against him
to try to tear him down.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.240 align:middle line:90%
But this man keeps on fighting.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.410 align:middle line:84%
So one level of the attack is
that they did a show with him

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:42.370 align:middle line:84%
on BBC, and the show actually
set him up and then attacked

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.840 align:middle line:84%
him and never allowed
him to have a response.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And he actually went
to court, and he won.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.800 align:middle line:84%
And the BBC was forced to print
an apology in the newspaper.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.500 align:middle line:90%
You're going to hear that story.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And I talk about how even
though he won the case,

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.430 align:middle line:84%
on Wikipedia they
actually still talk

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.330 align:middle line:84%
as if the negative side
was true and that he's

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.620 align:middle line:90%
been widely discredited.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.229 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is nonsense.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.400 align:middle line:84%
Then the other big thing
that he's gotten rolled up in

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.640 align:middle line:84%
is that two German
explorers actually

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.640 align:middle line:84%
scratched some of
these red quarry

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.410 align:middle line:84%
marks off from the relieving
chambers over the King's

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.050 align:middle line:90%
Chamber in the pyramid.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And they carbon dated
that red ochre paint,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.045 align:middle line:84%
and six Egyptians are now in
prison as a result of this.

00:02:27.045 --> 00:02:28.670 align:middle line:84%
The Germans are in
trouble, and they've

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.950 align:middle line:84%
tried to blame this
on Robert Bauval

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.680 align:middle line:84%
even though Bauval had
nothing to do with it.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.260 align:middle line:84%
But coming from this story is
something very interesting,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.460 align:middle line:84%
because the Germans saw these
black marks on the granite

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.080 align:middle line:84%
stones inside the
Relieving Chambers that

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.120 align:middle line:84%
suggested that it had been
burned in with a technology

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.510 align:middle line:84%
that the Egyptians
could not have had.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's very tantalizing
because Bauval tells us

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.930 align:middle line:84%
that they got some very
interesting results

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.980 align:middle line:84%
from the carbon dating
tests, but he won't tell us

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.077 align:middle line:90%
exactly what they said.

00:03:01.077 --> 00:03:02.660 align:middle line:84%
I'll talk to you at
the end about what

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.470 align:middle line:84%
I think this is all going
towards, but check it out.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.060 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very
fascinating information,

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.590 align:middle line:84%
the haters closing in on Bauval
and him fighting back here

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.700 align:middle line:90%
on "Disclosure."

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.800 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:21.400 align:middle line:84%
So we have been discussing
some very new interpretations

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.200 align:middle line:84%
of the Egyptian pyramids
that you, essentially,

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.280 align:middle line:84%
are single-handedly
responsible for bringing

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.370 align:middle line:84%
to the public attention--
the Orion correlation

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.800 align:middle line:84%
theory-- the idea that the
two large pyramids and then

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.320 align:middle line:84%
the smaller one in
Menkaure, actually, the

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.100 align:middle line:84%
offset pyramid
corresponds to the offset

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.690 align:middle line:84%
of the smaller of the three
stars in Orion's Belt.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And this has sort of entered
into the public lexicon now.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.100 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people who
read about this stuff

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.450 align:middle line:90%
now know this as a fact.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.380 align:middle line:90%
They consider it to be a fact.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And yet I looked on
Wikipedia, and there's

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.930 align:middle line:84%
an entry on Wikipedia called
Orion correlation theory.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.440 align:middle line:10%
And they say that your
theory is widely discredited.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.350 align:middle line:10%
And they say that scientists--
and they named the scientists,

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.016 align:middle line:10%
I don't remember their
names off the top

00:04:10.016 --> 00:04:14.030 align:middle line:10%
of my head-- had
said that you flipped

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.130 align:middle line:10%
around the image of the sky.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And that you covered it
up, and you lied about it.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.220 align:middle line:90%
And you didn't tell anybody.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.595 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT BAUVAL:
Let me tell you.

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:25.300 align:middle line:10%
When the book came
out, it came out

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.810 align:middle line:10%
with a BBC program, a
very popular program,

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.410 align:middle line:10%
called "Everyman."

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.040 align:middle line:10%
It's like your "Primetime Live"
and these kind of programs

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.250 align:middle line:10%
you have here, and a very,
very highly respected program

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.950 align:middle line:10%
in England.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.480 align:middle line:90%
And it was a show of the week.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.260 align:middle line:84%
I was very lucky
that the BBC decided

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.010 align:middle line:84%
to do the program-- and the
TV magazine's front cover.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.490 align:middle line:84%
So it really was
splashed in a big way,

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.020 align:middle line:90%
and it came from nowhere.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all the academics,
the Egyptologists,

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.160 align:middle line:84%
the archaelogists, just had no
idea this thing was coming out.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, there it is, on
a Saturday night at 9 o'clock

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.610 align:middle line:84%
on a major TV show-- bang--
showing this correlation,

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.740 align:middle line:84%
with Professor
Edwards commenting.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And it just took
everybody by surprise.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And it was incredible
because I was accused

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.500 align:middle line:90%
of just about everything.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm used to it, now.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.160 align:middle line:84%
But there was a very violent
reaction from Egyptologists,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.830 align:middle line:90%
very violent.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.820 align:middle line:84%
Particularly Zahi Hawass,
I was ranging from mad man

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.140 align:middle line:90%
to Zionist to you name it.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.350 align:middle line:90%
I've heard it all.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.720 align:middle line:84%
But the real debunking, or
the attempt to debunk it,

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:51.630 align:middle line:84%
came in '99, because the BBC had
been put under such pressure.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.040 align:middle line:90%
There was anger against them.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.456 align:middle line:84%
How can you allow
this amateur to,

00:05:54.456 --> 00:05:58.870 align:middle line:84%
you know-- on a prime show
and a scientific program.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.730 align:middle line:84%
So at the end,
they decided to do

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.680 align:middle line:84%
a program which was
going to kind of look

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.970 align:middle line:84%
at the other side
of the argument.

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.550 align:middle line:90%
They interviewed myself.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.280 align:middle line:84%
By that time, I was working
with Graham Hancock.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.485 align:middle line:84%
And they called it
"Atlantis Reborn."

00:06:12.485 --> 00:06:14.026 align:middle line:84%
And the idea was
that they were going

00:06:14.026 --> 00:06:16.940 align:middle line:84%
to bring people who
were well-known critics

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.860 align:middle line:84%
of my theories and
Hancock's theories.

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And unknown to us, although the
program was a British program,

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.540 align:middle line:84%
they contacted some
scientists here in the States.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:34.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, they deny that they
knew the scientists were part

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.565 align:middle line:90%
of a debunking organization.

00:06:35.565 --> 00:06:38.106 align:middle line:84%
At the time it was called Psi
Corp. I don't know if you are--

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:39.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, yeah, of course.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.106 align:middle line:84%
>>BAUVAL: You know,
it was kind of

00:06:41.106 --> 00:06:44.150 align:middle line:84%
like a Spanish Inquisition
of the scientific world.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And they had me
on their hit list.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.090 align:middle line:90%
They were going to get me.

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
scientists that they

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.760 align:middle line:84%
had was a fella called Ed
Krupp, who was, and still is I

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.880 align:middle line:84%
think, the director of
the Griffith Planetarium

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:01.630 align:middle line:90%
in Los Angeles.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:02.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Griffith Park, yeah.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.370 align:middle line:10%
>>BAUVAL: And he
had written already

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:11.170 align:middle line:10%
a couple of articles arguing
against it, with very, very

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:14.200 align:middle line:10%
derogatory titles, like "Pyramid
Marketing" and that sort

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.029 align:middle line:10%
of stuff.

00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:17.570 align:middle line:84%
In a magazine, I think it was
called-- an astronomy magazine,

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:21.370 align:middle line:84%
"Astronomy Now" or one of these
magazines-- another fellow--

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:25.900 align:middle line:84%
I also forget his name--
who was an anthropologist,

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.522 align:middle line:84%
he was going to sort of
debunk Graham Hancock.

00:07:29.522 --> 00:07:31.605 align:middle line:84%
And they both belong to
the Psi Corp organization.

00:07:31.605 --> 00:07:37.925 align:middle line:90%


00:07:37.925 --> 00:07:39.300 align:middle line:84%
Totally out of
the blue-- I mean,

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:43.610 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea it was coming
my way-- the BBC asked

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.490 align:middle line:90%
me to be interviewed at Giza.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:47.970 align:middle line:84%
They actually paid
for my flight.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:49.200 align:middle line:90%
I went there.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And they said that somebody--
one of the scientists,

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.796 align:middle line:84%
we can't tell you
who-- was saying

00:07:52.796 --> 00:07:54.820 align:middle line:90%
that you put maps upside down.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:58.087 align:middle line:84%
So I knew who it was, of
course, as I mentioned before.

00:07:58.087 --> 00:07:59.920 align:middle line:84%
So they said, well,
what do you say to this,

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.910 align:middle line:90%
what you're asking me now?

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:04.073 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well,
let me give you my,

00:08:04.073 --> 00:08:06.250 align:middle line:84%
uh-- I mean, what he
was saying was this.

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:10.260 align:middle line:90%


00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:11.780 align:middle line:90%
And I gave the analogy.

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.420 align:middle line:84%
I think I will give
the analogy first,

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.650 align:middle line:84%
and you'll see what
he was getting at.

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:18.320 align:middle line:84%
If you see a hot
air balloon flying

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.410 align:middle line:84%
in the sky with a basket,
a little standard hot air

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:23.760 align:middle line:90%
balloon.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.654 align:middle line:90%
And you look at it.

00:08:25.654 --> 00:08:26.570 align:middle line:90%
How would you draw it?

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:27.986 align:middle line:84%
Well, everybody
would say, well, I

00:08:27.986 --> 00:08:30.116 align:middle line:84%
would draw the balloon
and the basket underneath.

00:08:30.116 --> 00:08:31.240 align:middle line:90%
That's how you would do it.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:35.297 align:middle line:84%
And if it was flying south,
well, you look at the south sky

00:08:35.297 --> 00:08:37.130 align:middle line:84%
and draw the balloon
with a basket under it.

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:39.780 align:middle line:90%
Well, according to Ed Krupp, no.

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:43.679 align:middle line:84%
You should be drawing
the basket at the top.

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:45.490 align:middle line:90%
Now, the big question is why.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, his reasoning was-- and
it's not wrong in a sense.

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:52.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was inspiring in a
way, very clever, he thought.

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:53.610 align:middle line:90%
His reason was this.

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:57.090 align:middle line:90%
The basket's pointing down.

00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:58.850 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking
at the southern sky,

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:00.590 align:middle line:84%
it's pointing to the
southern horizon.

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:04.610 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the top of the
balloon, if it's pointing

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:09.230 align:middle line:84%
upwards and over your
head, it's pointing north.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:15.160 align:middle line:84%
So when you draw this
on a sheet of paper,

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.071 align:middle line:84%
the top of the balloon
will be pointing south.

00:09:18.071 --> 00:09:19.070 align:middle line:90%
You drew it upside down.

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:19.653 align:middle line:90%
There you are.

00:09:19.653 --> 00:09:20.970 align:middle line:90%
That was his conclusion.

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:23.094 align:middle line:84%
And then what he said about
the pyramids-- he said,

00:09:23.094 --> 00:09:25.920 align:middle line:84%
well, here is a picture of
Orion's Belt looking south.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:31.100 align:middle line:84%
The top star is pointing
north, so over your head.

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the pyramids
on the ground,

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.920 align:middle line:84%
the small pyramid
is pointing south.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:40.120 align:middle line:90%


00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.940 align:middle line:84%
This theory had been running
for about three years already.

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:45.370 align:middle line:84%
No astronomer had
raised this question.

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:48.230 align:middle line:84%
To them it was a
visual representation,

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:49.820 align:middle line:90%
which everybody would do.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.530 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
if the pyramids

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:53.300 align:middle line:84%
were pointing in
the wrong, I would

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.204 align:middle line:84%
have had the criticism
saying, no, they're wrong.

00:09:56.204 --> 00:09:57.370 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, that's what he said.

00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:59.680 align:middle line:84%
But the way it
was said was this.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.580 align:middle line:90%
Here is a map of the pyramids.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:04.950 align:middle line:84%
This pyramid, the top
one, points south.

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And here is a picture
of the three stars,

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:07.730 align:middle line:90%
and this points north.

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:09.040 align:middle line:90%
The maps are upside down.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.590 align:middle line:84%
You can't believe
the effect this had.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:16.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was watching the show,
and I had given them my reply.

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:19.680 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't use my reply.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.059 align:middle line:90%


00:10:21.059 --> 00:10:23.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about here, but
the BBC is under a charter

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:25.240 align:middle line:84%
that they have to give
balanced argument.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.950 align:middle line:84%
If somebody is going to
attack you that's hard,

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:29.980 align:middle line:84%
they're obliged to
give the counter view.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.470 align:middle line:90%
But they didn't use it.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:35.070 align:middle line:84%
So of course my lawyer called
me up and said, Jesus Christ.

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:37.570 align:middle line:84%
There's a guy who went on
television saying you put maps

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:38.280 align:middle line:90%
upside down.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is going
to ruin you, Robert.

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:43.390 align:middle line:84%
I said, no, and I explained
to him this balloon stuff.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:44.880 align:middle line:90%
So he said, no, no, no.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.046 align:middle line:84%
We've got to take them to
the Broadcasting Standards

00:10:47.046 --> 00:10:50.490 align:middle line:84%
Commission, which is
the government watchdog

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:52.580 align:middle line:90%
if the BBC breaks its charter.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:53.800 align:middle line:90%
And we did.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:54.300 align:middle line:90%
And we did.

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And for the first time,
the BBC "Horizon" program--

00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:00.260 align:middle line:84%
this "Horizon" program
is the most prestigious

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.120 align:middle line:84%
scientific program
in England, probably

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.900 align:middle line:90%
in the world-- lost the case.

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: They lost the case?

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BAUVAL: Oh, yes, they lost
the case-- apart from the fact

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:13.352 align:middle line:84%
that many, many astronomers
who had seen the program

00:11:13.352 --> 00:11:15.310 align:middle line:84%
and were friends of mine
called me up and said,

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:17.596 align:middle line:90%
who is this mad man?

00:11:17.596 --> 00:11:19.220 align:middle line:84%
So of course we'll
back you up, Robert.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.790 align:middle line:84%
They wrote letters
to BBC saying,

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:24.564 align:middle line:90%
this is taking us for idiots.

00:11:24.564 --> 00:11:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, it's still
written in Wikipedia

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.030 align:middle line:84%
as if he won the argument
and that you're an idiot.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:31.140 align:middle line:90%
It's unbelievable.

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:32.660 align:middle line:90%
>>BAUVAL: Leave Wikipedia be.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:33.743 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, yeah, I know.

00:11:33.743 --> 00:11:36.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Wikipedia, we had
another guest here saying--

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BAUVAL: No, it
would look a bit now

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:40.259 align:middle line:84%
for me to go there
and correct it.

00:11:40.259 --> 00:11:40.800 align:middle line:90%
I mean, fine.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.091 align:middle line:90%
He said it, and it stays there.

00:11:42.091 --> 00:11:43.840 align:middle line:90%
But no, no, it was--

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But you won the
case against the BBC.

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:48.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BAUVAL: Absolutely, well,
apart from the argument

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:51.510 align:middle line:84%
that there was letters
from top astronomers.

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:54.906 align:middle line:84%
One of them was the late
Professor Archie Roy,

00:11:54.906 --> 00:11:56.280 align:middle line:84%
who was a very
serious astronomer

00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:00.730 align:middle line:84%
at Glasgow University,
who was not only furious.

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:02.850 align:middle line:84%
He was a backer of the
Orion correlation theory.

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:04.130 align:middle line:90%
To him, there was no problem.

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:04.880 align:middle line:90%
It was very clear.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.990 align:middle line:84%
The evidence was
very supportive.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:09.590 align:middle line:84%
He had no bias like
the Egyptologists.

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Many astronomers were supporting
it, but he was furious.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.420 align:middle line:84%
What he couldn't
understand is why here we

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.530 align:middle line:84%
have astronomers
galore in England

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:18.910 align:middle line:90%
who would have commented.

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:20.484 align:middle line:90%
Why didn't they ask me?

00:12:20.484 --> 00:12:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
I did tell them.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.080 align:middle line:84%
I gave you name, and they
didn't bother to contact him.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.140 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to debunk it.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.330 align:middle line:90%
It was very obvious.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:27.920 align:middle line:84%
Of course, BBC
denied that they were

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.600 align:middle line:84%
linked to Psi Corp. Once this
was exposed at the Broadcasting

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.305 align:middle line:84%
Standards Commission,
they were furious.

00:12:33.305 --> 00:12:36.100 align:middle line:90%


00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.540 align:middle line:90%
The judge there was furious.

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:38.090 align:middle line:90%
How?

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:38.950 align:middle line:90%
How?

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:42.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, you've got
debunkers on BBC.

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:45.410 align:middle line:90%
But here's the big one.

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:48.270 align:middle line:84%
The question was asked,
through with the BBC, when

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:51.180 align:middle line:84%
the name of Dr. Archie
Roy, who would have given

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:53.600 align:middle line:84%
a balanced argument,
a counterargument,

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:57.050 align:middle line:84%
was given to you, why
did you not contact him?

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And they made a
terrible mistake.

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, Dr. Archie
Roy's astronomy is outdated.

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:07.900 align:middle line:84%
At that point, the judge--
I'll never forget this moment.

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.390 align:middle line:90%
He said, that's it.

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:14.510 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, what they had to do
was to make a public apology

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:15.250 align:middle line:90%
in The Times.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:18.150 align:middle line:84%
I had to choose the
paper on my own.

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:20.140 align:middle line:84%
I chose The Times of
London, of course.

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:23.950 align:middle line:84%
The quarter-page apology and
to rebroadcast the program

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:27.580 align:middle line:90%
with the counter view.

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.580 align:middle line:90%
To me, that was it.

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:32.510 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it was picked up by
all the media-- the first time

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:34.377 align:middle line:84%
that Horizon lost
a program review.

00:13:34.377 --> 00:13:36.210 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I've been
through all these things.

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:38.990 align:middle line:90%


00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:40.750 align:middle line:90%
I don't bother anymore.

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.400 align:middle line:84%
The correlation is a
very, very compelling one.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.630 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's publicly accepted.

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And I know that many
Egyptologists reluctantly

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.680 align:middle line:84%
would discuss and support
it, and I know many of them

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.480 align:middle line:90%
do support it.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.650 align:middle line:84%
It's one of those
things that I've

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:02.310 align:middle line:84%
presented a case
where the evidence is

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:04.080 align:middle line:90%
compelling to say the least.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.720 align:middle line:84%
You've got shafts
within the pyramids

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.190 align:middle line:90%
pointing to Orion's Belt.

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:09.255 align:middle line:84%
You've got the
pyramid texts, saying

00:14:09.255 --> 00:14:11.580 align:middle line:84%
the king wants to go to
Orion to join the god

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:14.030 align:middle line:90%
Osiris in this massive kingdom.

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:19.460 align:middle line:84%
You've got the
astronomical invitation

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:20.590 align:middle line:90%
to look at astronomy.

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that,
pyramids were given names.

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:27.850 align:middle line:84%
Pyramids were actually named
by the ancient Egyptians.

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:31.140 align:middle line:84%
They were given names, and
they personified the pharaoh.

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:32.880 align:middle line:84%
So we have pyramids
of the fourth dynasty

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.950 align:middle line:90%
that were called stars.

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:37.880 align:middle line:84%
The pyramid of Djedefre
who is actually

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.100 align:middle line:90%
called-- Djedefre is a star.

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:42.010 align:middle line:90%
That is a star.

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:44.880 align:middle line:84%
The evidence is compelling
that this correlation is

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.490 align:middle line:90%
unlikely to be a coincidence.

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:50.370 align:middle line:84%
It's been checked by
professional statisticians

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:53.002 align:middle line:90%
in Italy and England.

00:14:53.002 --> 00:14:54.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't have the smoking
gun with a certificate

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.260 align:middle line:84%
from King Cheops with
two witnesses saying,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.520 align:middle line:90%
that's what we want to do.

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.490 align:middle line:84%
But the evidence is
extremely compelling,

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:04.560 align:middle line:90%
and the public has absorbed it.

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:07.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, I think the
archaeologists' concern is

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:13.160 align:middle line:84%
that you're trying to tell
the world that there was

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.910 align:middle line:84%
a civilization capable of doing
advanced astronomy and advanced

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:22.330 align:middle line:90%
construction 12,500 years ago.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And people think that back
then all we were doing

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.177 align:middle line:84%
was burning dried
manure and cooking--

00:15:28.177 --> 00:15:29.260 align:middle line:90%
>>BAUVAL: Let me say this.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:33.527 align:middle line:84%
It's not advanced astronomy
to look at the stars.

00:15:33.527 --> 00:15:35.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, anybody can
look at the stars.

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And you will see that
there's two stars in a row

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:37.940 align:middle line:90%
and the third one offset.

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:39.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's visible
to the naked eye.

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:42.430 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't take
advanced astronomy

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:45.130 align:middle line:90%
to draw this map on the ground.

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:47.715 align:middle line:84%
What we have on the ground
is advanced technology,

00:15:47.715 --> 00:15:48.360 align:middle line:90%
if you like.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:52.090 align:middle line:84%
We have pyramids set at very,
very accurate alignments, built

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:54.790 align:middle line:84%
in a manner that we
still can't understand.

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And we know that the
ancient Egyptians were

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:01.370 align:middle line:90%
very keen observers of the sky.

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:03.000 align:middle line:84%
We can call them
astronomers today.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.791 align:middle line:84%
They were doing this
for religious reasons,

00:16:04.791 --> 00:16:07.290 align:middle line:84%
but we know for example that
the priesthoods or the pyramid

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:10.610 align:middle line:84%
cults were astronomers,
if you like.

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:12.320 align:middle line:90%
They observed the sky.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.240 align:middle line:90%
They had calendars.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.180 align:middle line:84%
So there's nothing
surprising about this.

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:19.120 align:middle line:90%


00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.130 align:middle line:90%
It dovetails.

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:23.340 align:middle line:84%
I call it the Cinderella
shoe of Egyptology.

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.520 align:middle line:84%
It dovetails very neatly,
and what they-- the

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:29.770 align:middle line:84%
stars that they had
in Egypt in the sky.

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:31.290 align:middle line:90%
They had a night in the sky.

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:33.950 align:middle line:84%
They give star names
to the pyramids.

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:35.240 align:middle line:90%
There are shafts pointing.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.810 align:middle line:90%
It all fits.

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:41.070 align:middle line:84%
The thing that doesn't fit is
the consensus of Egyptologists.

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:42.610 align:middle line:90%
Let's put it this way.

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:45.800 align:middle line:84%
If the Orion correlation
is accepted by them,

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.980 align:middle line:90%
then there is an admittance.

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:50.850 align:middle line:84%
The weird thing about
this Orion correlation

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:53.934 align:middle line:84%
is that once you point
it out, it's obvious.

00:16:53.934 --> 00:16:55.600 align:middle line:84%
People see it, and
it's the three stars,

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.760 align:middle line:90%
three pyramids, the shafts.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:00.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's obvious, and
yet they didn't pick it up.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.930 align:middle line:90%
They didn't pick it up.

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:06.609 align:middle line:84%
And it makes Egytpology look,
like, really weird here.

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:09.720 align:middle line:84%
It becomes so obvious
when you see it.

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.000 align:middle line:90%
It's one of those things.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.702 align:middle line:90%
It's very fast to understand.

00:17:12.702 --> 00:17:15.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, let's talk for
a minute about Colonel Howard

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:21.380 align:middle line:84%
Vyse's quarry marks
because the only real proof

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:24.410 align:middle line:84%
right now that the
Egyptologists would

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:30.160 align:middle line:84%
have about what they consider
to be a chronological dating is

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.990 align:middle line:84%
that Colonel Howard Vyse was
running out of money and on,

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:37.180 align:middle line:84%
like, the last day of his
excavation of the pyramid.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.480 align:middle line:90%
And he's in there by himself.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.040 align:middle line:84%
It's been proven he went
in the night before.

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.900 align:middle line:84%
He finds, in these
Relieving Chambers

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:48.180 align:middle line:84%
over the King's Chamber,
these red quarry marks.

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:49.861 align:middle line:84%
But the angle that
they were written at

00:17:49.861 --> 00:17:51.360 align:middle line:84%
is the angle that
his arm would have

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:52.960 align:middle line:90%
been at if he was in there.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And he made the same mistakes
as were in Wallis Budge's

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:57.980 align:middle line:90%
book for the time.

00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:59.602 align:middle line:84%
>>BAUVAL: Yeah,
I know the whole.

00:17:59.602 --> 00:18:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: OK, what do
you feel about that?

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:03.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BAUVAL: Look, I'll
be honest with you.

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:05.960 align:middle line:84%
I would love them
to be forgeries.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:10.170 align:middle line:10%
It would fit many
things that I believe.

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:12.750 align:middle line:10%
But I'll be frank with you.

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:14.895 align:middle line:10%
The evidence is very
much against this.

00:18:14.895 --> 00:18:16.950 align:middle line:10%
But let me tell you
the background for this

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:19.640 align:middle line:10%
because there's been a huge
controversy, as you may or may

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.876 align:middle line:10%
not know, over the last year.

00:18:22.876 --> 00:18:25.050 align:middle line:90%
Well, here is another one.

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:28.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Orion correlation--
pyramids were observed,

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.690 align:middle line:90%
studied, they had maps.

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:34.960 align:middle line:84%
In 1964, an astronomer
with an Egyptologist,

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.380 align:middle line:84%
Virginia Trimble, a very well
known astronomer in America,

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:40.490 align:middle line:84%
with Alexander Badawy, one of
the top Egyptian astronomers,

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:43.900 align:middle line:84%
wrote a thesis showing
that the shafts pointed--

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.560 align:middle line:90%
all this was known.

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:49.130 align:middle line:90%
Amazingly, it escaped attention.

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:53.020 align:middle line:84%
Grant Bey, the shafts
were discovered in 1872.

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:56.460 align:middle line:84%
It took until 1993 for an
outsider to say, hey, come on.

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:58.030 align:middle line:90%
Let's send a machine up there.

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:02.060 align:middle line:84%
So the complacency of
Egyptologists is incredible.

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:03.310 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I don't get it.

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:05.264 align:middle line:84%
The same thing with
this cartouche.

00:19:05.264 --> 00:19:06.680 align:middle line:84%
The same thing
with this graffiti.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.250 align:middle line:84%
The graffiti was
discovered in 1837.

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:14.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, OK, in 1837, we didn't
have the technology to date it.

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:19.040 align:middle line:84%
But since the last 30 years
or so, we know carbon dating.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.190 align:middle line:84%
All you had to do was
take a little sample

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:22.230 align:middle line:90%
and try and test it.

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:26.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's true that
red-- because they

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:28.840 align:middle line:90%
are dobbed in red ochre paint.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:32.640 align:middle line:84%
This graffiti is
actually ferrous oxide.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.035 align:middle line:84%
You cannot carbon
date ferrous oxide.

00:19:35.035 --> 00:19:36.340 align:middle line:90%
You need an organic material.

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:40.480 align:middle line:84%
But it's been
suggested many times

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:45.620 align:middle line:84%
that this red ochre
paint was probably stuck

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:48.250 align:middle line:90%
on the wall with organic resin.

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:49.820 align:middle line:90%
That can be carbon dated.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:53.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, the proof is in the
pudding, as they say.

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:56.310 align:middle line:84%
We can have theories that it
is fake, forged, whatever.

00:19:56.310 --> 00:20:00.460 align:middle line:84%
But the only way to know
this is to carbon date it.

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:04.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, since the last 30
years, no Egyptologist

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.680 align:middle line:90%
had suggested this.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And many people were talking
about, why not carbon date it?

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.020 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the
Education Foundation

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:16.740 align:middle line:84%
was suggesting this in 1984,
saying, let's carbon date it.

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:18.060 align:middle line:90%
What's the problem?

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:25.080 align:middle line:84%
However, the story
with Vyse is this.

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Let's explain for your
viewers what this is really.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.420 align:middle line:10%
We're talking
about chambers that

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:35.130 align:middle line:10%
are above the King's Chamber,
known as the Relief Chambers.

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:36.900 align:middle line:10%
In fact, they don't
relieve the chamber.

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.700 align:middle line:84%
Structural engineers
just laugh at this.

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:40.530 align:middle line:90%
They actually cause a problem.

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:45.220 align:middle line:84%
There are five low chambers
above the King's Chamber.

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:48.010 align:middle line:10%
The ceilings of these chambers,
and the floors, of course,

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:52.430 align:middle line:10%
are made of granite
beams that weigh 70 tons.

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:54.631 align:middle line:84%
And each chamber has
about eight of these.

00:20:54.631 --> 00:20:56.880 align:middle line:84%
The collective weight of
this so-called Relief Chamber

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.412 align:middle line:90%
is about 2,500 tons.

00:20:59.412 --> 00:21:01.120 align:middle line:84%
The last thing you
want to do is put that

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.794 align:middle line:90%
on the walls of the chamber.

00:21:02.794 --> 00:21:03.710 align:middle line:90%
They don't do relieve.

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:05.497 align:middle line:90%
They actually cause a problem.

00:21:05.497 --> 00:21:06.830 align:middle line:90%
They must have another function.

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:08.790 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
this function is.

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:10.660 align:middle line:84%
But the weird thing
is having bothered

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:15.680 align:middle line:84%
to built these chambers with
such a difficult construction

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:19.400 align:middle line:84%
because the blocks of granite
are not found locally.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.689 align:middle line:84%
They are brought from Aswan,
which is 1,000 kilometers away.

00:21:22.689 --> 00:21:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And they're pretty giant
blocks, let me tell you.

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:29.610 align:middle line:84%
They're about seven
meters long, some of them

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:30.890 align:middle line:90%
about two meters deep.

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:34.762 align:middle line:84%
When Howard Vyse
explored the pyramid,

00:21:34.762 --> 00:21:38.370 align:middle line:84%
the first of these
Relief Chambers

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:41.900 align:middle line:90%
had been known since 1760.

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:43.270 align:middle line:90%
When it was open, we don't know.

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:45.600 align:middle line:84%
But it was certainly
visited by a British man

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.050 align:middle line:90%
called Nathaniel Davison.

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:51.620 align:middle line:84%
We know that because his name
was written on the chamber.

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:53.860 align:middle line:90%
He wrote his name with the date.

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:57.380 align:middle line:84%
So Howard Vyse knew
there was this chamber.

00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:58.900 align:middle line:84%
To get to it, by
the way, you have

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:02.590 align:middle line:84%
to climb at the top of
the Grand Gallery, which

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:04.910 align:middle line:84%
butts at the entrance
of King's Chamber.

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:06.641 align:middle line:90%
And there's this little tunnel.

00:22:06.641 --> 00:22:07.640 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty hairy stuff.

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:10.140 align:middle line:84%
I've never done it, by the way,
but it's pretty hairy stuff.

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:13.340 align:middle line:84%
You need a several-meter
ladder, and you crawl

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:16.320 align:middle line:90%
into this very narrow tunnel.

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And you emerge, crouching,
into this Davison Chamber.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.380 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you, in
Howard Vyce's day--

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:27.272 align:middle line:84%
even today, I've
seen films of it.

00:22:27.272 --> 00:22:28.480 align:middle line:90%
I know people who went there.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Robert Schoch went
several times,

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:32.977 align:middle line:84%
and the Germans, which
I'll tell you in a minute.

00:22:32.977 --> 00:22:34.560 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty hairy
stuff because you're

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.125 align:middle line:90%
in a very alien environment.

00:22:37.125 --> 00:22:38.070 align:middle line:90%
You're crouching.

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.840 align:middle line:90%
It's dark.

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And even with torches,
it's very confusing.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.540 align:middle line:84%
So I can imagine Howard Vyse
going there with oil lamps.

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:46.380 align:middle line:90%
It's a mess.

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.030 align:middle line:84%
It's not as easy
as people think.

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:50.640 align:middle line:84%
You go there with a bucket of
paint, and you start painting.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.550 align:middle line:84%
Howard, what he
did, as you know,

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:56.519 align:middle line:84%
he used gunpowder to
blast through the ceilings

00:22:56.519 --> 00:22:58.310 align:middle line:84%
of the various chambers
and finally reached

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:00.210 align:middle line:90%
the top chamber.

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:03.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, there is graffitti
in four of the chambers.

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:05.976 align:middle line:84%
The Davison chamber
does not have graffitti,

00:23:05.976 --> 00:23:07.930 align:middle line:84%
but there's graffiti
in the others.

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And the last one-- Howard
Vyse gave them British names.

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:17.272 align:middle line:84%
There is Wellington's Chamber
and Davison's Chamber.

00:23:17.272 --> 00:23:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And the last one is
called Campbell's Chamber.

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:21.220 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
Campbell's Chamber,

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:22.520 align:middle line:90%
with the gable roof.

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And in there is this
famous cartouche.

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:30.380 align:middle line:84%
A cartouche, as you know,
is an oval-shaped design

00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:33.670 align:middle line:84%
in which there are
hieroglyphs that

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:35.640 align:middle line:90%
write the name of the king.

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And this cartouche
had the name Khufu,

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:42.020 align:middle line:84%
and that was the smoking gun as
far as Egyptology was concerned

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.390 align:middle line:84%
because the pyramid is
totally bare of inscriptions

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:47.730 align:middle line:84%
outside and inside,
except this graffitti.

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:49.040 align:middle line:90%
So there you are.

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:53.340 align:middle line:84%
The signature of the
pharaoh, deep inside, sealed.

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:54.280 align:middle line:90%
To them, that's it.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.050 align:middle line:84%
It's the Holy Grail
of Egyptology.

00:23:56.050 --> 00:24:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And they rested on this,
until of course Zecharia

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:05.970 align:middle line:84%
Sitchin in the 1980 said,
what if Howard Vyse forged it?

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And of course it's spawned all
these theories and so forth.

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:11.940 align:middle line:84%
I must admit that
I'm not 100% sure.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:14.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm not 100% sure,
but the evidence

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:18.530 align:middle line:84%
is very much tilting towards
them being authentic.

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:21.680 align:middle line:84%
But again, what I think
and what I don't think

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:25.160 align:middle line:84%
will only be proved if
you can carbon date.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And this brings in
our two Germans.

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:31.720 align:middle line:84%
A bit rash they took
it upon themselves.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.160 align:middle line:90%
Now, look.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.462 align:middle line:84%
I do not approve
of anybody going

00:24:35.462 --> 00:24:37.420 align:middle line:84%
in the pyramids or anywhere
else or in a museum

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:40.950 align:middle line:84%
and taking samples
without permission.

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:44.060 align:middle line:84%
But let's put this
in perspective.

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:45.896 align:middle line:84%
What's being taken
is a few milligrams.

00:24:45.896 --> 00:24:48.117 align:middle line:90%


00:24:48.117 --> 00:24:50.200 align:middle line:84%
Really, a few milligrams--
I mean, you blow on it,

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.510 align:middle line:90%
and you won't see it.

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:53.550 align:middle line:84%
So it's not what
it's been accused

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:58.180 align:middle line:84%
of-- vandals who damaged
the pyramid and all this.

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.870 align:middle line:90%
And here's the story.

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:02.370 align:middle line:90%
They went with a private permit.

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:04.440 align:middle line:84%
They had a permit to
enter the pyramid,

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.240 align:middle line:84%
and they were supervised
by six Egyptians.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.570 align:middle line:90%
They even asked for a ladder.

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:11.689 align:middle line:84%
So it's bizarre that
all this was allowed.

00:25:11.689 --> 00:25:13.730 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't the first time
that people were allowed

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:14.938 align:middle line:90%
to go in the Relief Chambers.

00:25:14.938 --> 00:25:18.360 align:middle line:84%
In Zahi Hawass' time, it
was quite common for those

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.270 align:middle line:90%
who had a private permit.

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:25.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, it may sound weird to
us in the Western world,

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:27.800 align:middle line:90%
that you can rent the pyramid.

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.780 align:middle line:84%
But the Egyptian authorities
do rent the pyramid.

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:33.320 align:middle line:84%
So if you have
$1,000 to spare, you

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:36.060 align:middle line:84%
can rent the pyramid
for two hours, alone

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:38.050 align:middle line:84%
or with a bunch of
friends-- the same price.

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:41.360 align:middle line:84%
So for $1,000, you can be alone
or have 20 people with you,

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.430 align:middle line:90%
same price, $1,000.

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:46.800 align:middle line:84%
So you divide $1,000
by 20, not bad.

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.725 align:middle line:84%
For $50 each, you can have
the pyramid for two hours.

00:25:49.725 --> 00:25:51.350 align:middle line:84%
I've been opposing
this for a long time

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:53.642 align:middle line:84%
because sooner or later,
there's going to be a problem.

00:25:53.642 --> 00:25:55.516 align:middle line:84%
Because you never know
who is going in there,

00:25:55.516 --> 00:25:57.560 align:middle line:84%
and it's very tempting
for people to try and take

00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:02.060 align:middle line:84%
souvenirs and scratch a bit
of the wall if they can.

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:03.630 align:middle line:90%
And this was common practice.

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:06.320 align:middle line:84%
With private permits,
the inspectors

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:09.450 align:middle line:84%
allowed people to go in areas
that they weren't, strictly

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:12.840 align:middle line:84%
speaking, to go to, like
the subterranean chamber.

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.590 align:middle line:84%
You can't do damage
to this monument,

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:18.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean this 6-million-ton
massive monument.

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:22.080 align:middle line:84%
You'd have to go in there
with a bomb to do some damage.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.320 align:middle line:84%
So of course,
nobody was worried.

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Nonetheless, here
is what happened.

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, their
intention was not

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:35.540 align:middle line:84%
only to take some red ochre
paint from the graffiti.

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:38.490 align:middle line:84%
Their intention, primarily,
was to take samples

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:41.590 align:middle line:84%
from the ceiling of
the King's Chamber,

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:42.640 align:middle line:90%
from these granite beams.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.070 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people don't know this.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they
wanted to do this was they

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:53.630 align:middle line:84%
had noticed, like we had
noticed for many years,

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:56.590 align:middle line:90%
but we thought it was soot.

00:26:56.590 --> 00:27:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Those beams that rest on
the wall, right at the edge,

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:01.960 align:middle line:90%
have very dark marks.

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.330 align:middle line:90%
It's very visible.

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:06.400 align:middle line:84%
But everybody assumed
they were soot

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.760 align:middle line:84%
from the torches
or ancient people

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.940 align:middle line:84%
visiting in maybe the
days of Howard Vyse.

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:15.860 align:middle line:84%
What they noticed, with
high-definition photography,

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:22.490 align:middle line:84%
was that whatever it is was
encrusted in the granite.

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:24.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, granite is a
very hard stone.

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.612 align:middle line:84%
So to encrust
something in it, it

00:27:26.612 --> 00:27:31.395 align:middle line:84%
must be at very high pressure,
to push something into stone.

00:27:31.395 --> 00:27:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And obviously,
having realized this,

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:36.730 align:middle line:84%
they were keen to test it
and see what was there.

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And so they first
went up the ladder

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:44.870 align:middle line:84%
and took 14 samples
from the various beams--

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:47.560 align:middle line:84%
I think two milligrams or three
milligrams from each edge.

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.490 align:middle line:84%
You can't even
see it from below.

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:51.880 align:middle line:10%
They put the stuff
in plastic boxes,

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:55.290 align:middle line:10%
went out of the King's
Chamber, took the ladder,

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:58.370 align:middle line:10%
attached another ladder because
they had to go much higher,

00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:01.236 align:middle line:10%
and two of them-- one of them
called Dominique Goerlitz, who

00:28:01.236 --> 00:28:03.290 align:middle line:10%
I have become a very
good friend of Goerlitz

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:06.870 align:middle line:10%
because of this affair-- went
up the ladder with a cameraman.

00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:09.672 align:middle line:10%
There was a third German
called Stephan Erdmann who

00:28:09.672 --> 00:28:10.880 align:middle line:10%
had been many times up there.

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.360 align:middle line:10%
But he panicked apparently
and didn't want to go.

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.295 align:middle line:10%
So they went up there.

00:28:14.295 --> 00:28:16.110 align:middle line:10%
It was the first time
they went up there.

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:17.150 align:middle line:10%
They had torches.

00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:18.140 align:middle line:10%
The dropped the torch.

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:19.120 align:middle line:10%
It was a mess.

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.690 align:middle line:10%
They finally got
to Campbell's room,

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:25.580 align:middle line:10%
and they took a
bit of graffitti,

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:28.360 align:middle line:10%
about two milligrams,
from a hieroglyph

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:31.550 align:middle line:10%
but not from the cartouche--
not from the cartouche.

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:32.826 align:middle line:10%
This has been proven.

00:28:32.826 --> 00:28:35.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, whether the intention
was taking from the cartouche,

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm not so sure.

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:38.920 align:middle line:90%
But why did they make a mistake?

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:41.055 align:middle line:84%
But they took from somewhere
near the cartouche.

00:28:41.055 --> 00:28:43.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, the mistake is
easily made, by the way,

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:45.470 align:middle line:84%
because once you're
in that chamber,

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:47.700 align:middle line:84%
you scramble through
all the others.

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.560 align:middle line:90%
There's dust all over the place.

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.290 align:middle line:90%
Your eyes are totally blurred.

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:52.600 align:middle line:90%
It's really a mess, I'm told.

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:55.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Robert Schoch
described it to me in detail.

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And people have been there
to specifically go and take

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:02.050 align:middle line:84%
pictures of the cartouche
and ended up not finding it.

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:05.599 align:middle line:84%
Unless you know precisely
where it is, you can miss it.

00:29:05.599 --> 00:29:06.640 align:middle line:90%
It's one of those things.

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:09.580 align:middle line:90%
It's very dark and very faint.

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:12.400 align:middle line:84%
Whether they made a mistake
or not is another matter.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.725 align:middle line:84%
But they took samples from
somewhere near the cartouche,

00:29:15.725 --> 00:29:17.004 align:middle line:90%
from the graffitti.

00:29:17.004 --> 00:29:18.420 align:middle line:84%
They took pictures
of it, and they

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:19.628 align:middle line:90%
were filming the whole thing.

00:29:19.628 --> 00:29:22.850 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea is they were
going to do a documentary.

00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:25.670 align:middle line:84%
They went out, took
the samples to Dresden.

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:28.675 align:middle line:84%
Dominique Goerlitz is an
experimental archaeologist.

00:29:28.675 --> 00:29:31.170 align:middle line:90%
He knew exactly what to do.

00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:35.650 align:middle line:84%
By the way, for the
interest of your viewers,

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:38.002 align:middle line:84%
Dominique Goerlitz is the
successor of Thor Heyerdahl--

00:29:38.002 --> 00:29:39.210 align:middle line:90%
Thor Heyerdahl, the Kon-Tiki.

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:41.880 align:middle line:90%


00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.930 align:middle line:84%
His main interest, actually,
is ancient navigation.

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:48.965 align:middle line:84%
He's actually just
built an Egyptian barge,

00:29:48.965 --> 00:29:53.649 align:middle line:84%
and he's proposing to sail
it across the Atlantic.

00:29:53.649 --> 00:29:55.940 align:middle line:84%
So if you're interested, you
might want to talk to him.

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:57.760 align:middle line:84%
He's a really cool
guy, actually.

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:01.890 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, they threw the
samples to Dresden University,

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:03.730 align:middle line:90%
and there's a laboratory there.

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And the idea was to carbon date
and to test this black thing

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:09.779 align:middle line:90%
that they picked up.

00:30:09.779 --> 00:30:12.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm sure you're going
to ask me what's the result.

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And from what they told
me-- and I'm very good.

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:18.820 align:middle line:84%
How I got into this
affair is very bizarre.

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:21.310 align:middle line:84%
Because what they did,
having filmed all this,

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:23.100 align:middle line:90%
they did a trailer.

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And they put the trailer
on YouTube in November,

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:27.030 align:middle line:90%
several months later.

00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:28.800 align:middle line:90%
And of course, hell broke lose.

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.480 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian authorities
went bananas.

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.310 align:middle line:84%
Zahi Hawass, of all
things, he was now

00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:37.670 align:middle line:84%
fired from-- having been my
bitter enemy for so many years,

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:39.930 align:middle line:84%
having accused me of
being a Zionist and a Jew

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:41.820 align:middle line:84%
and you name it-- all
these nasty things

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:43.882 align:middle line:90%
that Arabs think is bad.

00:30:43.882 --> 00:30:46.310 align:middle line:84%
Put on the front page of
one of the Arab newspapers,

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:49.320 align:middle line:84%
Robert Bauval paid the
Germans to steal the cartouche

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:53.360 align:middle line:84%
to prove the pyramids
were built by the Jews.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, my God.

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:58.269 align:middle line:84%
>>BAUVAL: Excuse my
French, bugger this.

00:30:58.269 --> 00:31:00.060 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well, let
me find those Germans.

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:02.862 align:middle line:84%
I was in Italy at the
time, giving conferences.

00:31:02.862 --> 00:31:04.320 align:middle line:84%
I finally found
Dominique Goerlitz.

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.130 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea who they were.

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:08.152 align:middle line:90%
He was in New York.

00:31:08.152 --> 00:31:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And I said, hey, did you
steal this cartouche?

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.770 align:middle line:90%
And why are they accusing me?

00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:17.190 align:middle line:84%
He said, I don't know, but we
didn't steal the cartouche.

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:18.845 align:middle line:90%
The cartouche was not stolen.

00:31:18.845 --> 00:31:20.040 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And in any case,
we didn't touch it.

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:25.646 align:middle line:84%
OK, well send me pictures
and all this stuff.

00:31:25.646 --> 00:31:27.520 align:middle line:84%
They sent me a picture
of where they took it.

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:30.920 align:middle line:84%
But I still was skeptical
because it took seven days

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:34.183 align:middle line:84%
after Hawass' accusation
for the Egyptian authorities

00:31:34.183 --> 00:31:35.160 align:middle line:90%
to send inspectors.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, the
cartouche was there.

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:40.230 align:middle line:84%
But they did notice that
there were some scratches

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:41.650 align:middle line:90%
on the cartouche.

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:43.190 align:middle line:90%
So there, again, they said, OK.

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:45.866 align:middle line:84%
The cartouche is not stolen, but
they did take samples from it.

00:31:45.866 --> 00:31:46.710 align:middle line:90%
And it's very clear.

00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:51.700 align:middle line:84%
You can see four clear marks
that have been scraped off.

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:53.050 align:middle line:90%
So I found the Germans again.

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:53.675 align:middle line:90%
I said, listen.

00:31:53.675 --> 00:31:55.370 align:middle line:90%
You've told me a lot of rubbish.

00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:59.080 align:middle line:84%
OK, you didn't steal it,
but you've taken samples.

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:00.956 align:middle line:84%
And they kept saying,
no, we didn't.

00:32:00.956 --> 00:32:03.140 align:middle line:90%
They sounded very genuine.

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Then I remembered
that Robert Schoch

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:06.770 align:middle line:90%
had been there several times.

00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:08.070 align:middle line:90%
So I phoned him up.

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:10.415 align:middle line:84%
He said, yes, I
was there in 2003.

00:32:10.415 --> 00:32:12.895 align:middle line:90%
And I was there in 2006.

00:32:12.895 --> 00:32:15.020 align:middle line:84%
As you know, Robert Schoch
is at Boston University.

00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:17.010 align:middle line:84%
I happened to be in
Vermont at the time,

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:19.552 align:middle line:90%
on a trip to my publisher.

00:32:19.552 --> 00:32:21.340 align:middle line:90%
I said, send me pictures.

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:22.390 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:23.210 align:middle line:90%
And he did.

00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And, wow, in 2003, the
cartouche is untouched.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.140 align:middle line:90%
Nobody touched it.

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:33.740 align:middle line:84%
But in the picture from
2006, those scratches

00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:36.370 align:middle line:84%
are there, as they
were seen in 2013.

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:39.670 align:middle line:84%
So it was clear the Germans
were telling the truth.

00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Most annoyingly, that in 2003 to
2006 when this damage occurred,

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:48.010 align:middle line:84%
we can't tell precisely when,
Zahi Hawass was responsible.

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:51.100 align:middle line:84%
So the whole story flung
back to him, saying,

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:52.500 align:middle line:90%
you were responsible.

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:54.570 align:middle line:90%
And it's still going on.

00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:56.050 align:middle line:90%
We had six Egyptians with us.

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:58.790 align:middle line:84%
The six Egyptians that
were with the Germans

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:01.090 align:middle line:84%
were in jail for the
last eight months.

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:03.400 align:middle line:84%
I had been in Egypt trying
to get them out of jail

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:05.180 align:middle line:90%
because they're innocent.

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:08.410 align:middle line:84%
All they did wrong, that
was common practice,

00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:11.675 align:middle line:84%
was to allow the Germans
to climb a ladder.

00:33:11.675 --> 00:33:13.050 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know
that the Germans

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:14.710 align:middle line:90%
were going to take samples.

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:16.590 align:middle line:84%
The Germans were very
chivalrous to write

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:19.760 align:middle line:84%
an affidavit, sent to the
Egyptian authorities saying,

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:20.420 align:middle line:90%
it's true.

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:23.680 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian people who
were with us did not know.

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:25.761 align:middle line:84%
They let us climb the
ladder to take photographs,

00:33:25.761 --> 00:33:26.760 align:middle line:90%
but we took the samples.

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:27.801 align:middle line:90%
They weren't aware of it.

00:33:27.801 --> 00:33:31.170 align:middle line:84%
Signed, sealed, and yet they
put these poor people in jail.

00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:33.630 align:middle line:84%
I've been following this case
for the last eight months.

00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Was there any
conclusive carbon dating?

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:39.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BAUVAL: Yeah, you were
going to ask me that.

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:41.640 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you what
I was told by them.

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.904 align:middle line:84%
And I can't tell
you certain things,

00:33:43.904 --> 00:33:45.820 align:middle line:84%
and it's not because I
don't want you to know.

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:48.140 align:middle line:84%
It's because the Germans
had made an agreement

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:49.950 align:middle line:90%
with the Egyptian authorities.

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:52.180 align:middle line:84%
Although they had
been criminalized,

00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:54.440 align:middle line:84%
they agreed that they would
not publish the results.

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And they will give
priority to Egyptians

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:58.020 align:middle line:90%
to publish the results.

00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:01.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, I can tell
you this, though.

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:03.210 align:middle line:84%
They didn't manage to
carbon date the red ochre.

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:08.260 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't enough material
to produce a conclusive test.

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:11.389 align:middle line:84%
They did find something
very strange in red paint.

00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:13.579 align:middle line:84%
They found that it
contained aluminum.

00:34:13.579 --> 00:34:15.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, aluminum is
not supposed to have

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:18.830 align:middle line:90%
existed in the pyramid times.

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:23.480 align:middle line:84%
But aluminum existed in paint
at the time of Howard Vyse.

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:27.270 align:middle line:84%
That might indicate that the
paint was a modern paint.

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:30.159 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
here is the problem.

00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:33.540 align:middle line:84%
They used a spatula to
remove it, which has also

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:36.469 align:middle line:90%
aluminum on the handle.

00:34:36.469 --> 00:34:39.034 align:middle line:84%
So in order to be
100% sure, they

00:34:39.034 --> 00:34:41.592 align:middle line:84%
have to take another
sample, which at the moment,

00:34:41.592 --> 00:34:42.550 align:middle line:90%
nobody will allow them.

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:44.940 align:middle line:84%
So that's the position
with red ochre, right?

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:46.760 align:middle line:90%
As one, proves nothing.

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:49.560 align:middle line:84%
With the black soot,
it's very interesting.

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And they allowed
me to go that far.

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:56.070 align:middle line:84%
They say-- I know what it
is, OK, but I can't tell you.

00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:59.585 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, and I'm not
playing games here.

00:34:59.585 --> 00:35:00.710 align:middle line:90%
It's a very serious matter.

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:02.900 align:middle line:90%
There's legal cases going on.

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:07.420 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell
you that what they

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:14.930 align:middle line:84%
found there in this black soot
will certainly strongly suggest

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:18.040 align:middle line:84%
that the way the
pyramid was built

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:21.510 align:middle line:84%
and the way that
the stones were cut

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:26.110 align:middle line:84%
required a technology that, as
far as Egyptologists would say,

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:28.247 align:middle line:90%
was not available at the time.

00:35:28.247 --> 00:35:28.830 align:middle line:90%
There you are.

00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:30.220 align:middle line:90%
That's all I can say.

00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, and this gets
into Christopher Dunn, also,

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.598 align:middle line:84%
that kind of stuff--
looking at the sarcophagus

00:35:34.598 --> 00:35:36.170 align:middle line:84%
and seeing drill
marks that would

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:38.220 align:middle line:84%
go five times faster than
a diamond-tipped drill.

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:41.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BAUVAL: Correct, and
I'm sure Chris Dunn would

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:43.764 align:middle line:90%
guess what they found.

00:35:43.764 --> 00:35:44.930 align:middle line:90%
But I can't take it further.

00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:47.496 align:middle line:90%
So it's a very exciting time.

00:35:47.496 --> 00:35:49.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, and
you also had told me

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:52.140 align:middle line:84%
that there's been
red ochre marks found

00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:55.417 align:middle line:84%
in one of the chambers
up there in the shaft.

00:35:55.417 --> 00:35:57.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BAUVAL: Which
indicates, by the way,

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.400 align:middle line:84%
that it was not uncommon for
red ochre paint to be used.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.700 align:middle line:84%
We know they've used it
in many other places,

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:08.130 align:middle line:84%
but the funny thing is that this
red ochre paint in the pyramid

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:12.620 align:middle line:84%
is only found in places
that are deliberately sealed

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:14.120 align:middle line:90%
and inaccessible.

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:16.190 align:middle line:84%
Had Howard Vyse not
blown his gunpowder,

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:18.740 align:middle line:90%
we wouldn't have known.

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You said that
it was the number 121

00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:22.845 align:middle line:90%
was written inside the chamber.

00:36:22.845 --> 00:36:23.660 align:middle line:90%
That's fascinating.

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:24.980 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't heard that before.

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:27.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BAUVAL: Very eerie
because, as you know,

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:30.040 align:middle line:84%
the pyramid is designed
using prime numbers.

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And the prime number that comes
more commonly in the design

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:34.870 align:middle line:90%
is 11.

00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And surprisingly,
the number that

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:40.920 align:middle line:84%
is behind the Gantenbrink door,
which has been filmed in 2010,

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:44.100 align:middle line:90%
is 11 times 11, 121.

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:45.790 align:middle line:90%
So we've got a code there.

00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:47.040 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt.

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:50.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, could you tell my
audience how they can find out

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:51.166 align:middle line:90%
more about your work.

00:36:51.166 --> 00:36:52.790 align:middle line:84%
Are you working on
any books right now?

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:53.460 align:middle line:84%
Are you about to
release any book?

00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:55.630 align:middle line:10%
>>BAUVAL: Well, all
I've told you now

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:58.260 align:middle line:10%
is written in great
detail with pictures

00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:00.800 align:middle line:10%
about the cartouche affair,
about the Gantenbrink door,

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:04.790 align:middle line:10%
about the Education Foundation
in the book that I just

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:05.760 align:middle line:10%
released.

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.760 align:middle line:10%
It's called "Secret
Chamber Revisited,"

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:10.895 align:middle line:10%
published by Inner Tradition
and available in all good stores

00:37:10.895 --> 00:37:12.598 align:middle line:10%
and on Amazon.

00:37:12.598 --> 00:37:13.840 align:middle line:90%
There you are.

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:16.131 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, it's been a
real honor to have you here.

00:37:16.131 --> 00:37:17.280 align:middle line:90%
It's totally fascinating.

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And any time you got the truth,
people want to fight you,

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:20.950 align:middle line:90%
don't they?

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BAUVAL: Oh, well,
yeah-- but you

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:24.106 align:middle line:90%
know one thing about the truth.

00:37:24.106 --> 00:37:26.660 align:middle line:90%
The truth is not democratic.

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:30.380 align:middle line:84%
It's the only thing
that is not democratic.

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:32.120 align:middle line:90%
You don't vote on truth.

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:33.670 align:middle line:90%
If it's true, it's true.

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:34.920 align:middle line:90%
And we know this from history.

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.350 align:middle line:84%
If one person is
true, it doesn't

00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:38.240 align:middle line:84%
matter if a million
people say he's wrong.

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.630 align:middle line:90%
If he's right, he's right.

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:42.010 align:middle line:90%
And we've got a case here.

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:46.476 align:middle line:84%
We've got a case of a few people
who have touched the truth.

00:37:46.476 --> 00:37:47.600 align:middle line:90%
And there's been an uproar.

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.610 align:middle line:84%
The people don't
agree, but too bad.

00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:52.124 align:middle line:84%
Too bad, because the
truth will prevail.

00:37:52.124 --> 00:37:54.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm very, very sure that
in a few years' time,

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.990 align:middle line:84%
we'll be talking
about correlations.

00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:58.945 align:middle line:84%
It will be common
knowledge in textbooks.

00:37:58.945 --> 00:38:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, we'll be talking
about how the pyramid was

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.800 align:middle line:84%
designed, prime numbers, all
these things that has been

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:05.860 align:middle line:90%
opposed by the establishment.

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:06.942 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Excellent.

00:38:06.942 --> 00:38:07.590 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you, Robert.

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:08.673 align:middle line:90%
>>BAUVAL: It's a pleasure.

00:38:08.673 --> 00:38:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Thank you
for being here.

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:12.400 align:middle line:90%
I love that line.

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:15.690 align:middle line:90%
The truth is not democratic.

00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:17.840 align:middle line:90%
We don't vote on the truth.

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:21.130 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that
everybody has to agree on.

00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:23.280 align:middle line:84%
Once it's the truth,
it's the truth.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And it will prevail even
if it is widely opposed.

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:29.260 align:middle line:90%
The facts ultimately win out.

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And the facts
clearly argue, as he

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:35.200 align:middle line:84%
said if you listen
very carefully,

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:38.650 align:middle line:84%
those black marks that were
found in the Relieving Chambers

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:41.230 align:middle line:84%
over the King's Chamber
in the Great Pyramid

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:45.420 align:middle line:84%
demonstrate a technology that
the Egyptians did not have.

00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:49.040 align:middle line:84%
I actually don't know what the
results of those carbon dating

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:50.500 align:middle line:90%
tests will be.

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:51.970 align:middle line:84%
There's a few
things that he says

00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:55.600 align:middle line:84%
in there that suggest that it
may date the pyramid closer

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:58.450 align:middle line:84%
to where conventional
archaeology thinks

00:38:58.450 --> 00:38:59.700 align:middle line:90%
that it would happen.

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:01.690 align:middle line:84%
But bear in mind that
there could very well

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:05.890 align:middle line:84%
have been extraterrestrials
visiting Egypt during the time

00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:08.770 align:middle line:84%
that conventional
archaeologists attribute

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:11.960 align:middle line:84%
to being Egyptian
civilization and that they

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:15.840 align:middle line:84%
had the technology to help
build these monuments.

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:19.330 align:middle line:84%
Or it's possible that in
fact the carbon dating

00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:21.930 align:middle line:84%
goes much, much
older, and they are

00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:23.550 align:middle line:90%
worried about getting killed.

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:25.830 align:middle line:84%
They're worried about the
potential ramifications

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:28.760 align:middle line:84%
to the archaeological community,
considering that this thing has

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.300 align:middle line:90%
become a big lawsuit.

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's all getting
ready to pop.

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:35.170 align:middle line:90%
So there's a lot more in store.

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And believe me,
as soon as we know

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:40.140 align:middle line:84%
what those carbon
dating tests reveal,

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:43.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be all over it on
this show and on my other show.

00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:47.070 align:middle line:84%
So we will keep you informed
as to these fast-processing

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:48.590 align:middle line:90%
developments.

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:50.970 align:middle line:84%
Coming up next time,
we're going to have

00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:55.760 align:middle line:84%
part two of my incredible
interview with Andrew Collins.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And what is so
exciting about this

00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:00.190 align:middle line:84%
is that I pin him
in the corner, and I

00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:03.850 align:middle line:84%
get him to talk about
the Illuminati directly.

00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:08.080 align:middle line:84%
Because remember, the core of
what the insiders have told

00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:11.830 align:middle line:84%
me is that the people who
have now essentially taken

00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:14.200 align:middle line:84%
control of our financial
system, they're

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:17.210 align:middle line:84%
the shadow government that's
running various militaries

00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:19.700 align:middle line:84%
in various governments
around the world.

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:21.880 align:middle line:84%
They've been
controlling the media

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:24.730 align:middle line:84%
through all different
forms, whether it is movies,

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:29.370 align:middle line:84%
whether it's television, print
journalism, radio journalism

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:30.890 align:middle line:90%
to a lot of extent.

00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:33.450 align:middle line:84%
They're out there, and
more and more people

00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:34.600 align:middle line:90%
are becoming aware of this.

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:37.520 align:middle line:84%
They're advertising
themselves more and more.

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And it appears that
they consider themselves

00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:43.700 align:middle line:84%
to be the descendants of an
invading extraterrestrial human

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:44.840 align:middle line:90%
race.

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:46.490 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
interesting things

00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:50.080 align:middle line:84%
to explore next time, when
I'm talking to Andrew Collins

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.480 align:middle line:90%
here on "Disclosure."

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And as always, I thank
you for watching.
