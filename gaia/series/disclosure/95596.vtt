[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:16.512 --> 00:00:17.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID WILCOCK:
I'm David Wilcock,

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.022 align:middle line:90%
and welcome to "Disclosure."

00:00:20.022 --> 00:00:21.730 align:middle line:10%
If the government's
not going to do this,

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.680 align:middle line:10%
then we have to take
it into our own hands

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.520 align:middle line:10%
and make this disclosure
process a reality.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.370 align:middle line:10%
And that's what I'm
trying to do here

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.970 align:middle line:10%
by bringing you some of the
finest minds that have ever

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.830 align:middle line:10%
graced our presence in terms
of studying the real data that

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.840 align:middle line:10%
comes out from the field
of ancient civilizations.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And one of the all-time
heroes in the field

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.050 align:middle line:84%
of ancient civilizations is none
other than John Anthony West.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.470 align:middle line:84%
I was very honored to
have the opportunity

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.730 align:middle line:84%
to interview him at the Paradigm
Symposium in Minneapolis.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.920 align:middle line:84%
John Anthony West
is a scholar whose

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.480 align:middle line:84%
work is legendary in
terms of the scope

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.420 align:middle line:84%
and implications of
how he has re-imagined

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.240 align:middle line:90%
the history of Egypt.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.640 align:middle line:84%
The central
hypothesis of his work

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.200 align:middle line:84%
is that there is a far
more spiritual core

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.680 align:middle line:84%
to Egyptian civilization,
to their philosophy,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.760 align:middle line:84%
to their hieroglyphics,
to their monuments,

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.830 align:middle line:84%
than any conventional
archaeologist

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.420 align:middle line:90%
normally gives credit for.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.280 align:middle line:84%
The spiritual component
has been stripped away,

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.050 align:middle line:84%
and what we're left with is
this academic bookkeeping.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.200 align:middle line:84%
One of the other things
that is really significant

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.560 align:middle line:84%
here is that archaeologists
and anthropologists

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.900 align:middle line:84%
take certain parts of
data from the Egyptians

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.260 align:middle line:84%
and treat that data as if it's
totally credible, because it

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.460 align:middle line:90%
fits with their preconceptions.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.750 align:middle line:84%
But then there's other data
from the exact same data sets,

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.350 align:middle line:84%
and they arbitrarily say,
well that stuff is wrong,

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.380 align:middle line:90%
but this stuff is right.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.320 align:middle line:84%
You're going to hear
about that in this show.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.880 align:middle line:84%
You're also going to hear
about the staggering complexity

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.670 align:middle line:84%
of Schwaller de
Lubicz's research.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.690 align:middle line:90%
I tried to get into it.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.900 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't get very far.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.260 align:middle line:84%
John Anthony West
has truly given us

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.950 align:middle line:84%
a groundbreaking
reinterpretation of Schwaller

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.590 align:middle line:84%
de Lubicz, making it
easier to understand.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And we talk about how de
Lubicz's philosophies really

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.680 align:middle line:84%
do explain how much
of a sacred basis

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.920 align:middle line:84%
there is to every aspect of
Egyptian culture and society.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.330 align:middle line:84%
We also start out with
John Anthony West giving us

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.370 align:middle line:84%
a rather interesting background
about how he got into all this

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.850 align:middle line:84%
to begin with, going to the
Spanish island of Ibiza,

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.680 align:middle line:84%
or "Ibitha," as my Spanish
friend used to call it.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.580 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of interesting
things to explore here.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And we're obviously
not going to get away

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.910 align:middle line:84%
from the real core of
what is the smoking gun.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly,
John Anthony West

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.950 align:middle line:84%
says that the
ammunition for the gun

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.547 align:middle line:84%
is the Sphinx
water-weathering argument

00:03:12.547 --> 00:03:14.130 align:middle line:84%
that you're going
to be hearing about.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.810 align:middle line:84%
But the gun itself is this
very curious site in Turkey

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.740 align:middle line:84%
that you may have never heard
of before called Gobekli Tepe.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.660 align:middle line:90%
That's all coming up right now.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.800 align:middle line:90%
Check it out.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.580 align:middle line:84%
All right, John Anthony
West, welcome to Disclosure.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm really happy
to have you here.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.161 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN WEST: And I'm
delighted to be here, David.

00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:33.880 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So we are at
the Paradigm Symposium

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.239 align:middle line:90%
in Minneapolis.

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.655 align:middle line:84%
And you actually
were the one that

00:03:39.655 --> 00:03:41.720 align:middle line:84%
told us that this was
happening out here.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.540 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: Yes.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.800 align:middle line:84%
It was strange that you
guys didn't know about this,

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.820 align:middle line:90%
but yeah.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It's a real
great gathering of talent.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And you are, of
course, a legend.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And most people who are
familiar with your work

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.775 align:middle line:84%
know you for a relatively
small footnote, actually,

00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:03.400 align:middle line:84%
of the greater body
of work that you've

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.170 align:middle line:84%
done, which is this Sphinx
water-weathering argument.

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.670 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: Yes.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.400 align:middle line:84%
That is a relatively
small segment.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.490 align:middle line:10%
I didn't start out to
prove that the Sphinx was

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.670 align:middle line:10%
older than it's supposed to be.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.579 align:middle line:10%
In fact, I didn't
start out intending

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.330 align:middle line:10%
to do scholarship at all.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.870 align:middle line:84%
Basically, at the
age of 13 I knew

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.390 align:middle line:84%
I'd been born into
a lunatic asylum,

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.120 align:middle line:84%
and it was pretty
lonely for some years.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.460 align:middle line:84%
When I got to be about 19,
I knew what I wanted to do.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.060 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be a
writer, and I wanted

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.610 align:middle line:84%
to be the boy who said the
emperor wears no clothes.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.150 align:middle line:84%
Another long story, but
one thing led to another.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.000 align:middle line:84%
I started getting published--
first short story was-- novels,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.490 align:middle line:84%
plays, scripts, essays,
reviews-- and never made

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.190 align:middle line:90%
any money.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.020 align:middle line:84%
I started getting
published, and that

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.470 align:middle line:84%
was-- it's almost a
birthday now, October 15,

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.810 align:middle line:84%
1957-- first short
story accepted.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.830 align:middle line:84%
I was wildly in
love with a woman

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.110 align:middle line:84%
who wouldn't have me, thank God,
and I took off back to Europe,

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.340 align:middle line:84%
where I'd been a year and
a half in the US Army.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.230 align:middle line:90%
This was '57.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.720 align:middle line:84%
So I got to the
island of Ibiza when

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.990 align:middle line:90%
it was just getting started.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.980 align:middle line:84%
You may be too young
to know about Ibiza.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: I do know about it.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.920 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: You know about it.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:22.753 align:middle line:90%
It was a wild place.

00:05:22.753 --> 00:05:26.490 align:middle line:84%
It was sort of an island
Paris of the '20s.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.580 align:middle line:84%
A few people with some
real talent who worked,

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.220 align:middle line:84%
writers and painters
for the most part.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.559 align:middle line:84%
And I stayed there
for nine years--

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:35.100 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.030 align:middle line:84%
>>WEST: --getting
my writing done.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.950 align:middle line:90%
I wrote a novel.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: That's a hard life.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>>WEST: It was really--
it was medieval.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And it taught me how
unnecessary most technology

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.916 align:middle line:84%
is when you actually
have to live that way.

00:05:50.916 --> 00:05:51.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.274 align:middle line:90%


00:05:54.274 --> 00:05:55.940 align:middle line:84%
>>WEST: When I got
there, no telephones,

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.790 align:middle line:90%
almost no paved roads.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.110 align:middle line:84%
The few automobiles
that were there

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.970 align:middle line:84%
were '30s, and some of
them '20s, automobiles.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:08.330 align:middle line:84%
Which made it look
even older than it was.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.080 align:middle line:84%
No newspapers, no radio,
obviously no television.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.160 align:middle line:84%
We made our own entertainment,
which we did pretty well,

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.340 align:middle line:90%
I must say.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And it was there that
I got first introduced

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.150 align:middle line:84%
by-- all of these are
long stories, which

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.530 align:middle line:90%
we don't have time for.

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.360 align:middle line:84%
I got interested in
astrology to begin with.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And then that led, through
another strange set

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:36.720 align:middle line:84%
of circumstances, to the
work of G. I. Gurdjieff.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.170 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, OK.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WEST: And then Gurdjieff
was-- that really interested me

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.655 align:middle line:90%
more than the astrology.

00:06:42.655 --> 00:06:46.900 align:middle line:84%
He was-- Gurdjieff--
posthumously--

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:54.710 align:middle line:84%
he died in '49-- was the only
person I'd ever encountered who

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:58.039 align:middle line:84%
was as contemptuous of
Western civilization as I was.

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:00.080 align:middle line:84%
The difference was that
he knew how to live in it

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.520 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't, or only barely.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And at a certain point
I realized that I really

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:09.030 align:middle line:84%
had to go somewhere where one of
the schools that was practicing

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:14.550 align:middle line:84%
his doctrine, system, whatever
you want to call it, existed.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.400 align:middle line:84%
So in those days
that was New York--

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.230 align:middle line:84%
where I absolutely didn't
want to get back to-- Paris--

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:21.950 align:middle line:84%
and my French was
pretty rudimentary

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:25.690 align:middle line:84%
so I didn't want to
go there-- and London.

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And I had a girlfriend who was
an actress, a very good one,

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.530 align:middle line:84%
so we went to London where she
could act and I could write.

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And she had a son by
a former marriage.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And there I joined one
of the Gurdjieff groups.

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:42.770 align:middle line:84%
My novel got published,
called "Osborne's Army."

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.040 align:middle line:84%
It was almost a movie
on several occasions,

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.170 align:middle line:90%
and it didn't happen.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And the editor of
the publishing house

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:55.530 align:middle line:84%
was a pretty interesting guy, a
mathematician turned publisher.

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:58.190 align:middle line:84%
Very opposite me in
philosophy, certainly

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:00.770 align:middle line:84%
not interested in
esoteric things.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And we were having a
jar in a pub one night

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:05.630 align:middle line:84%
and the subject of
astrology came up.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:07.895 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh, that's
a bunch of codswallop.

00:08:07.895 --> 00:08:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, as a
matter of fact it isn't.

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's a subject
I know a lot about.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.155 align:middle line:84%
And there's a certain
amount of direct evidence,

00:08:15.155 --> 00:08:17.390 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of indirect
evidence, that

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:19.720 align:middle line:84%
said there really is
something to the notion

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.350 align:middle line:84%
that there's a
correlation between the,

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:26.770 align:middle line:84%
call it the human
personality, and the positions

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:30.314 align:middle line:90%
of the stars and the planets.

00:08:30.314 --> 00:08:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
I'd like to see that.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.059 align:middle line:90%
And I brought in documentation.

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, I'm
not necessarily convinced,

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:40.070 align:middle line:90%
but would you do a book on it?

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And my answer basically
then, and it would be now,

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:46.460 align:middle line:84%
is pay me some money and I'll
write a book about anything.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:50.080 align:middle line:84%
Not quite true, but
it's not far off.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And there "The Case for
Astrology" was born.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.120 align:middle line:10%
And in doing the
research for that

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.170 align:middle line:10%
I came across the work
of the French genius

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:02.402 align:middle line:10%
with the unpronounceable name,
R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz.

00:09:02.402 --> 00:09:03.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Schwaller de Lubicz.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: Schwaller de Lubicz.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:05.635 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: The dreaded.

00:09:05.635 --> 00:09:06.900 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: The dreaded.

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And I spent a year
journeying across London--

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.340 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't find a copy of
the big book, which had not

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.910 align:middle line:84%
been translated-- with
a dictionary by my side,

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:19.580 align:middle line:84%
going through "The
Temple of Man"

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:23.300 align:middle line:84%
well enough so that I could
write a chapter about it

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:24.527 align:middle line:90%
in "The Case for Astrology."

00:09:24.527 --> 00:09:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And for
those who don't know,

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:28.300 align:middle line:84%
Schwaller de Lubicz
essentially gets

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:31.690 align:middle line:84%
into a review of
Egyptian iconography,

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:34.429 align:middle line:84%
but takes it from a more
spiritual standpoint

00:09:34.429 --> 00:09:34.970 align:middle line:90%
than they do.

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And also has a lot
of sacred geometry

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.740 align:middle line:84%
that he incorporates into
the analysis of the monuments

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:40.329 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:09:40.329 --> 00:09:41.120 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: Absolutely.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I regard
"The Temple of Man"

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:46.270 align:middle line:84%
and Schwaller's
work, as a totality,

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:49.560 align:middle line:84%
as the most important
scholarship since Jesus Christ.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.530 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:56.060 align:middle line:84%
Because he
reformulated-- and it's

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:58.710 align:middle line:84%
a very difficult and
impenetrable book--

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:02.760 align:middle line:84%
but nevertheless, he
reformulated the sacred science

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.700 align:middle line:84%
of the ancients that
people have been talking

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:10.350 align:middle line:84%
about since the ancient
Greeks in a way--

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:13.300 align:middle line:84%
with unchallengeable
modern scholarship.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.080 align:middle line:90%
There it was.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.625 align:middle line:84%
That's why all the geometry is
there, and all the mathematics.

00:10:17.625 --> 00:10:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, by the
time he got done--

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:24.120 align:middle line:84%
He went there looking to
prove-- he's an extraordinarily

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:28.080 align:middle line:84%
interesting man, but
not much room really

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.370 align:middle line:84%
for a biography of
Schwaller here--

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:35.170 align:middle line:84%
but he went there
in 1937 looking

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:39.150 align:middle line:84%
to see if the Egyptians
employed the golden section

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.340 align:middle line:90%
and the Fibonacci series.

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.885 align:middle line:84%
Because that was kind of the
key to the sacred science.

00:10:43.885 --> 00:10:45.440 align:middle line:84%
Because both-- well,
both of those--

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Fibonacci
series supposedly

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:50.980 align:middle line:84%
was invented or discovered
by a 12th century

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.620 align:middle line:90%
Italian mathematician.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.350 align:middle line:84%
The golden section
was supposedly

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:57.815 align:middle line:84%
discovered by Pythagoras
around 6th century BC.

00:10:57.815 --> 00:11:02.370 align:middle line:84%
So Schwaller went there to
see if he could find out--

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.327 align:middle line:84%
and there was already
some evidence that they

00:11:04.327 --> 00:11:08.820 align:middle line:84%
had that they knew
those mathematical terms

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:09.780 align:middle line:90%
and used them.

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:10.405 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:11:10.405 --> 00:11:15.060 align:middle line:84%
So Fibonacci is the
ratio of 1 to 1.618.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:15.560 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: No.

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:16.335 align:middle line:90%
That's the golden section.

00:11:16.335 --> 00:11:17.793 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: That's
the golden section.

00:11:17.793 --> 00:11:20.160 align:middle line:84%
>>WEST: Fibonacci
is a number series

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.290 align:middle line:84%
in which you add the number
before to the next number.

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:25.575 align:middle line:90%
So you start off at 1.

00:11:25.575 --> 00:11:27.110 align:middle line:90%
1 plus 1 is 2.

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:28.620 align:middle line:90%
2 plus 1 is 3.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.300 align:middle line:90%
3 plus 2 is 5.

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:31.625 align:middle line:90%
5 plus 3 is 8.

00:11:31.625 --> 00:11:32.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:35.180 align:middle line:84%
>>WEST: 8 plus 5
is 13, et cetera.

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:37.140 align:middle line:84%
If you connect all
the numbers, you

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:40.685 align:middle line:84%
get a spiral that looks
exactly like the--

00:11:40.685 --> 00:11:41.560 align:middle line:90%
what's the sea shell?

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.476 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: The nautilus.

00:11:42.476 --> 00:11:44.515 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: The nautilus.

00:11:44.515 --> 00:11:47.280 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: It's an expansion
rate between different types

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.240 align:middle line:10%
of sacred geometry.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:48.740 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: Yes.

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:52.380 align:middle line:84%
It's an expansion
constant, you might say,

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.150 align:middle line:90%
that pervades all of nature.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And recently even the physicists
have discovered the Fibonacci

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:04.010 align:middle line:84%
series commanding
certain arcane aspects

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:08.520 align:middle line:84%
of very basic
cosmological physics,

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:12.250 align:middle line:84%
of the motion of
atoms, or sub-atoms.

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:13.630 align:middle line:90%
I don't know my physics.

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And since sacred
geometry is essentially

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.954 align:middle line:84%
a crystallized form of
harmonic vibration--

00:12:19.954 --> 00:12:20.620 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: Exactly.

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Then the
widespread prevalence

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:29.240 align:middle line:84%
of Fibonacci and phi, and all
that throughout both nature

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.160 align:middle line:84%
itself and sacred
architecture suggests

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.230 align:middle line:84%
that there is some
sort of energy

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:37.750 align:middle line:84%
that we haven't recognized
in Western science--

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:39.860 align:middle line:84%
it's not necessarily
electromagnetic--

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:41.480 align:middle line:84%
that may be the
precursor to matter,

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:45.290 align:middle line:84%
or in some ways influencing
matter and life.

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:46.310 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: Well, yes.

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:49.360 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of the
framework upon which

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:53.980 align:middle line:84%
matter and life and
everything material is based.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:13:00.390 align:middle line:84%
It follows the laws that
are-- that follow naturally

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:06.120 align:middle line:84%
from phi and Fibonacci
series, and actually

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.750 align:middle line:84%
musical harmony-- the
laws of harmony and so on.

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:09.390 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Sure.

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:10.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WEST: And so this
is what Schwaller

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.710 align:middle line:90%
was looking for in Egypt.

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:14.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: When you see such a
widespread amount of this--

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:18.410 align:middle line:84%
of sacred geometry
used in architecture,

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:20.900 align:middle line:84%
it has suggested
to me in the past

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:25.250 align:middle line:84%
that the actual building
itself, in some way,

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:28.610 align:middle line:84%
is tuned to provide
higher consciousness,

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:31.680 align:middle line:84%
that there is a consciousness
connection when you build

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.660 align:middle line:84%
a shape in that
type of proportion.

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.680 align:middle line:84%
Especially when it's
made out of stone

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.570 align:middle line:84%
that there is a
consciousness-raising effect

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:38.940 align:middle line:90%
from that.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And I have a lot of scientific
documentation to prove it.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.240 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: Oh yeah, absolutely.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.520 align:middle line:84%
It provokes
consciousness, actually.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And in Egypt, for
example, which is probably

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:52.610 align:middle line:84%
the most sophisticated
application of phi

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:56.380 align:middle line:84%
and Fibonacci series and
so on, the so-called gods

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:57.140 align:middle line:90%
are misnamed.

00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.810 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you call
things gods everyone says,

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:03.290 align:middle line:84%
you know, wink-wink,
nod-nod, it's superstition.

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:07.270 align:middle line:84%
If you substitute for
gods, cosmic principles,

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:10.440 align:middle line:84%
then you're talking
sacred science.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.200 align:middle line:90%
Each of the--

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.110 align:middle line:84%
Let's say in the organic
world, sacred principles

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:20.250 align:middle line:84%
would be fertilization,
gestation, birth, growth,

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:24.660 align:middle line:84%
maturity, old age,
death, renewal.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And so each of those
is a principle.

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:33.170 align:middle line:84%
To the academic-- to
scientists and quackademics,

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:36.940 align:middle line:84%
it's just evolution that just
happens somehow or another,

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:40.530 align:middle line:84%
and these things arise
out of a bunch of gas.

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:44.594 align:middle line:84%
I don't have too much sympathy,
obviously, for that philosophy.

00:14:44.594 --> 00:14:46.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Quackademic is a
term that we will probably

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:47.930 align:middle line:90%
start using now.

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:50.120 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: A lot of people.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:54.180 align:middle line:84%
Anyhow, each of the
neterus, each of the gods--

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:57.770 align:middle line:84%
I'll use the common terms
just to keep it simple.

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Each of the gods is associated
for specific reasons

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.950 align:middle line:84%
with certain numbers
and sets of numbers.

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Those numbers give rise
to particular geometries,

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.565 align:middle line:90%
harmonies, and proportions.

00:15:09.565 --> 00:15:10.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Ahh.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WEST: When those harmonies,
proportions, numbers, measures,

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.100 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, are
employed in a building

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:20.800 align:middle line:84%
by a genius architect who
understands the sacred science,

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:24.120 align:middle line:84%
what you have is a kind
of a symphony in stone.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:27.230 align:middle line:84%
It was Goethe who called
architecture frozen music.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:28.800 align:middle line:84%
Which is not just
poetically true,

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.330 align:middle line:90%
it's actually physically true.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:31.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:35.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WEST: Except that with music
we hear audio vibrations,

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:40.630 align:middle line:84%
and with architecture it's
actually visual vibrations.

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:41.630 align:middle line:90%
But it's more than that.

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:44.260 align:middle line:84%
When you go through
an Egyptian temple,

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.010 align:middle line:84%
you're walking through
the instrument itself

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:48.670 align:middle line:90%
as the instrument is playing.

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:49.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.260 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: And so--

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:55.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, it sounds as if
orthodox mainstream Egyptology

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:58.260 align:middle line:90%
has completely missed the boat.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you don't
hear them talking

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:03.390 align:middle line:84%
about these sacred
proportions in the monuments.

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:05.140 align:middle line:84%
You don't hear them
talking about the idea

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.771 align:middle line:84%
that the neteru would
be cosmic principles.

00:16:07.771 --> 00:16:08.270 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: No.

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:10.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It seems as
if they've completely

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:14.180 align:middle line:84%
divorced the spirituality
of the whole basis

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:15.057 align:middle line:90%
of that civilization.

00:16:15.057 --> 00:16:16.390 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: Yeah, they've denied it.

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:18.780 align:middle line:84%
Actually, through
the 19th century

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.220 align:middle line:84%
there was a kind
of a tug of war.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:23.300 align:middle line:84%
There were those who
understood, from Champollion on,

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:27.950 align:middle line:84%
that this is a great,
great civilization

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:30.220 align:middle line:90%
with a genuine sacred science.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:32.270 align:middle line:84%
They didn't necessarily
use that term,

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:34.800 align:middle line:84%
but they understood
that this was really

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:38.290 align:middle line:84%
something of immense
sophistication.

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And really it goes back
probably to Darwin.

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:45.200 align:middle line:84%
It became-- what we live
in, the quackademics

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.560 align:middle line:84%
and the scientists,
for the most part

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.530 align:middle line:84%
are the priesthood of what I
call the Church of Progress.

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And the central dogma of
the Church of Progress

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:56.060 align:middle line:84%
is that we, with our
hydrogen bombs and our nerve

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:59.630 align:middle line:84%
gas and our striped toothpaste,
are the most advanced beings

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:01.634 align:middle line:84%
that have ever walked
the face of this planet.

00:17:01.634 --> 00:17:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Civilization
began in ancient Greece.

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:05.008 align:middle line:84%
>>WEST: It began
in ancient Greece.

00:17:05.008 --> 00:17:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's gone on this
wonderful upward path,

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:13.369 align:middle line:84%
with a few blips here and
there like the Dark Ages

00:17:13.369 --> 00:17:14.490 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:19.939 align:middle line:10%
But basically it's been
on an upward linear path

00:17:19.939 --> 00:17:23.380 align:middle line:10%
to our advanced selves.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:26.390 align:middle line:10%
But of course, the
thing about Egypt

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:29.025 align:middle line:10%
is, I often say that
Egypt is like sex.

00:17:29.025 --> 00:17:30.890 align:middle line:90%
That gets everybody's attention.

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:33.100 align:middle line:90%
And then why?

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:34.800 align:middle line:90%
Well, you can read all about it.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:35.830 align:middle line:90%
And that's interesting.

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:37.454 align:middle line:84%
It's complicated,
but it's interesting.

00:17:37.454 --> 00:17:38.860 align:middle line:90%
You could look at pictures.

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.290 align:middle line:84%
That gives you a little
bit of understanding.

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:45.760 align:middle line:84%
But you don't really understand
it until you experience it.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.180 align:middle line:90%
You just can't do it.

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:48.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I've been
there, and I know

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.832 align:middle line:90%
exactly what you're saying.

00:17:49.832 --> 00:17:50.540 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: To Egypt?

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:51.127 align:middle line:90%
Or have sex?

00:17:51.127 --> 00:17:51.710 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:52.270 align:middle line:90%
Well, both.

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.790 align:middle line:90%
I've done both actually.

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:56.480 align:middle line:90%
You do the cruise on the Nile.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:01.370 align:middle line:84%
We stopped off at Aswan Dam,
and just a whole bunch--

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:06.390 align:middle line:84%
you see these places
and the photographs

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:08.557 align:middle line:84%
don't do justice
because, as you said,

00:18:08.557 --> 00:18:09.890 align:middle line:90%
you're moving through a machine.

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>>WEST: Yes, it's
three dimensional.

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:13.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: A harmonically tuned,
consciousness resonating

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:13.700 align:middle line:90%
device.

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:14.120 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: That's right.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:15.130 align:middle line:90%
This is what it is.

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And this is why Egypt
is so interesting.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:25.190 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the proof of
the level of sophistication

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:27.230 align:middle line:90%
available to the ancients.

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And the weird thing is
that it has been taken over

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:36.760 align:middle line:84%
by the people least
qualified to write about it.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:40.830 align:middle line:84%
The quackademics are
very good at data

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:44.950 align:middle line:84%
and absolutely almost
bereft of understanding.

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:46.010 align:middle line:90%
It's changing now.

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:47.590 align:middle line:84%
It's a new generation
growing up.

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:49.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Let me also
say, John, that I

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:53.200 align:middle line:84%
went through last night all
of the comments on your book

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.850 align:middle line:90%
on Amazon.

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:57.909 align:middle line:84%
There's a surprisingly
large number of them.

00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:58.700 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: Well, yeah.

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.116 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And they're almost
all five star recommendations.

00:19:01.116 --> 00:19:01.830 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: Mostly.

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:05.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And a significant
number of people commenting

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:08.330 align:middle line:84%
said, this is the best
book-- "Serpent in the Sky"

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:10.580 align:middle line:84%
is the best book on
ancient Egyptian science

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:12.490 align:middle line:84%
and mythology that's
ever been written.

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:15.590 align:middle line:90%
It should be used in colleges.

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And that you've completely
redefined and broken away

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:23.940 align:middle line:84%
from orthodox Egyptology and
presented a logical, coherent,

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:29.099 align:middle line:84%
and much more spiritual version
of what they were up to.

00:19:29.099 --> 00:19:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: Yeah.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.410 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I won't
even try to deny that.

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:35.930 align:middle line:84%
But what I've done, really,
it's really Schwaller.

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:39.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm a self-appointed
Schwaller's Boswell.

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:42.410 align:middle line:84%
Because Schwaller is
almost impenetrable.

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And if you really get
into "The Temple of Man,"

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.700 align:middle line:90%
it's a very difficult book.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.870 align:middle line:90%
It's not everybody's cup of tea.

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:53.467 align:middle line:84%
And it's very
difficult to understand

00:19:53.467 --> 00:19:54.800 align:middle line:90%
what Schwaller is talking about.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.150 align:middle line:84%
Like many great, great
minds, he did not

00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:00.245 align:middle line:90%
have a gift for communication.

00:20:00.245 --> 00:20:02.370 align:middle line:84%
Because he's up there
somewhere, and everybody else

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:03.400 align:middle line:90%
is down here.

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.320 align:middle line:90%
And I'm somewhere in the middle.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:10.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm a writer by trade, so I can
make his very difficult stuff

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:11.590 align:middle line:90%
comprehensible.

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:13.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I'm not ashamed
to admit that in the 1990s

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.240 align:middle line:84%
I had a couple Schwaller
de Lubicz books.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.710 align:middle line:84%
They were translated
into English,

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:19.730 align:middle line:90%
so I at least had that.

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:22.580 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, the
pictures were interesting.

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: Yeah.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Actually, you will see if
you go back to Schwaller

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:30.890 align:middle line:84%
at some point-- because
even my book is not

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:33.027 align:middle line:84%
bedtime reading,
"Serpent in the Sky."

00:20:33.027 --> 00:20:35.360 align:middle line:84%
But people come to me sometimes
and say, I got your book

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.510 align:middle line:84%
and I got lost in
the number symbolism,

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:40.510 align:middle line:84%
and I put the book down and I
picked it up six years later

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:42.850 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't see what was
so difficult about it.

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:44.890 align:middle line:90%
You'll see.

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:46.777 align:middle line:90%
By osmosis you'll get it.

00:20:46.777 --> 00:20:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I probably would
get a lot more out of it

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:50.590 align:middle line:84%
now that I've done so
much more research.

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:52.340 align:middle line:84%
The one thing that
really stood out for me

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:57.370 align:middle line:84%
that I remember was a
diagram of him showing

00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:00.980 align:middle line:84%
that these-- I guess it
was like three temples,

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.500 align:middle line:84%
were arranged in such
a way as to create

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.560 align:middle line:90%
an outline of a human form.

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.337 align:middle line:84%
>>WEST: Oh, that's
the Temple of Luxor.

00:21:07.337 --> 00:21:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And so it has like the
chakras in it, and it has--

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:12.790 align:middle line:90%
it's a very interesting--

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:14.380 align:middle line:84%
>>WEST: The harmonic
scale is in it.

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:16.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And I think there
was another monument that

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:20.890 align:middle line:84%
had tiles on the floor that
made like a stylized human face.

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:22.260 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: The brain.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:26.880 align:middle line:84%
That's one, actually, everybody
makes mistakes, including God.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.300 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, look at us.

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:36.030 align:middle line:84%
That's one I don't-- I think
Schwaller's wrong about.

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:38.950 align:middle line:84%
For reasons too complex
to go into here.

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:40.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It's just
what my meager memory--

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:41.150 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: No, no.

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:41.650 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:42.950 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:45.810 align:middle line:84%
But with Egypt-- this is to
get back to it-- as I said,

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:49.060 align:middle line:84%
I digress and get
back to my point.

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:53.110 align:middle line:84%
It's only by being
in Egypt that--

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:55.535 align:middle line:84%
and going through it
that you understand,

00:21:55.535 --> 00:21:57.160 align:middle line:84%
after a couple of
weeks, the difference

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:01.740 align:middle line:84%
between a real civilization
and what we call progress.

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:03.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it really
drives it home.

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:05.523 align:middle line:84%
And there's nowhere else on
Earth where you can do that.

00:22:05.523 --> 00:22:07.650 align:middle line:84%
It's almost certain,
particularly the work

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:12.620 align:middle line:84%
of Laird Scranton shows that
coherent advanced cosmology

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:14.269 align:middle line:84%
existed globally--
and then we get

00:22:14.269 --> 00:22:16.435 align:middle line:84%
into Atlantis and all of
these subjects-- at a very,

00:22:16.435 --> 00:22:20.440 align:middle line:84%
very-- in the very,
very distant past.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:25.530 align:middle line:84%
But you can't experience
it much anywhere.

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:27.310 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there's
no China that you

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:30.370 align:middle line:84%
can visit that's 3,000 to
4,000 BC and still older,

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:34.060 align:middle line:84%
and no India, and
no Mesoamerica.

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:37.370 align:middle line:84%
All of those traditions
almost certainly

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:42.280 align:middle line:84%
were, if not identical to the
Egyptian, very, very similar.

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:47.500 align:middle line:84%
They were all speaking the same
symbolic, mathematical, sacred

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.290 align:middle line:90%
science language.

00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:51.450 align:middle line:84%
But it's only in
Egypt where you can

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:54.780 align:middle line:84%
go where day after day
after day after day

00:22:54.780 --> 00:23:00.020 align:middle line:84%
you're walking through these
titanic symphonies in stone.

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
a couple of weeks

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:04.630 align:middle line:84%
you've really come
back-- generally

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:07.170 align:middle line:84%
speaking on the trips,
people come back and say,

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:10.200 align:middle line:84%
you know, this is the best
thing I've ever done in my life.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I want to get into the
water-weathering on the Sphinx.

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:16.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, de Lubicz
actually mentioned that

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:18.080 align:middle line:84%
in his books just sort
of off-handedly, right?

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:18.530 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: Exactly.

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:19.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: He just tossed it in.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WEST: A single
line where he was

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:24.900 align:middle line:84%
looking into the Egyptian
belief-- let's call it belief.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.310 align:middle line:90%
I call it knowledge.

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Nobody ever says,
the Egyptians knew.

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.369 align:middle line:84%
The quackademics say the
Egyptians believed this,

00:23:32.369 --> 00:23:33.660 align:middle line:90%
or the Egyptians believed that.

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:37.089 align:middle line:84%
But uh uh, wink-wink
nod-nod, we know better.

00:23:37.089 --> 00:23:38.505 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, the Egyptians
have-- there

00:23:38.505 --> 00:23:43.040 align:middle line:84%
are a couple of texts or
things where the Egyptians talk

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:47.430 align:middle line:84%
about long rains when Egypt is
ruled by the gods themselves.

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And another long set
of semi-divine kings.

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:55.240 align:middle line:84%
The Shemsu Hor, the
companions of Horus.

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:58.270 align:middle line:90%
And these exist.

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:01.270 align:middle line:90%
But the academics dismiss it.

00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:03.290 align:middle line:84%
Schwaller at one point,
there's a long chapter

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:06.020 align:middle line:84%
on putting all of this together
as a scholarly argument,

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:07.970 align:middle line:84%
and then throws away a
line, "and of course,

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:11.050 align:middle line:84%
the Great Sphinx of Giza
shows unmistakable signs

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:12.270 align:middle line:90%
of water weathering."

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And when I read that line,
that was an epiphany for me.

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Because I realized if
you could prove that,

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:23.870 align:middle line:84%
you would destroy the
entire reigning paradigm

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:28.140 align:middle line:84%
of the origins of
human civilization.

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:32.890 align:middle line:84%
Because the Sphinx is the most
spectacular sculpture on earth.

00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:36.070 align:middle line:84%
The temples around it, which
don't get a lot of press,

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:38.140 align:middle line:84%
are built with blocks
of stone half the size

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:41.920 align:middle line:84%
of this room, put together
like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.577 align:middle line:90%
We couldn't do it today.

00:24:43.577 --> 00:24:45.910 align:middle line:84%
So if you could prove the
Sphinx was weathered by water,

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:49.700 align:middle line:84%
then the stones for the temples
come from the Sphinx enclosure.

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:53.180 align:middle line:84%
They had to be cut, quarried
out, and placed where they are.

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.960 align:middle line:84%
It would mean that not only was
the most spectacular sculpture

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.880 align:middle line:84%
on earth carved at a time
when there's not supposed

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.420 align:middle line:84%
to be any civilization at
all, but they were also

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:06.850 align:middle line:84%
in possession of a technology
that we can't reproduce today.

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:08.070 align:middle line:90%
So this upsets everything.

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:11.570 align:middle line:84%
The Church of Progress is
destroyed at its foundations

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:14.290 align:middle line:90%
by this simple, single act.

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And so it took a
long time before I

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:20.240 align:middle line:84%
found Robert Schoch, who had
the credentials to back this up.

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And then it went to the meeting
at the GSA, Geological Society

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:28.300 align:middle line:84%
of America, meeting, where it
was international press in '91.

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Let me
just review quickly.

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:33.120 align:middle line:84%
The back end of the
Sphinx, the rear, and you

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.800 align:middle line:84%
were able to take a
photograph of this.

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And what you see is
this sensuous curve

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:43.020 align:middle line:84%
that clearly shows
long-term water erosion.

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:43.870 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: Yes.

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And the
skeptical argument

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:48.969 align:middle line:84%
that I've seen on Wikipedia,
which is really compromised.

00:25:48.969 --> 00:25:50.260 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: Wicked-pedia I call it.

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:51.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:54.210 align:middle line:84%
They say, well, there's mud
brick walls that have only

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:56.210 align:middle line:84%
been built 100 years ago
that are showing signs

00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:57.750 align:middle line:84%
of water weathering
near the Sphinx.

00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:58.291 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: Yeah.

00:25:58.291 --> 00:26:00.250 align:middle line:90%
This is absolute stupidity.

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And Schoch and I are planning
to write a big book between us

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.390 align:middle line:90%
about the whole Sphinx saga.

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:11.250 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not just this
water weather question.

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:12.790 align:middle line:90%
Other things come into play.

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:14.730 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole
bunch of new evidence

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:18.120 align:middle line:84%
that demonstrates the
existence of that great ancient

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:20.120 align:middle line:90%
sophisticated society.

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:28.100 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, all of this led to the
groundbreaking NBC documentary

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:30.880 align:middle line:84%
with Charlton Heston as host,
"Mystery of the Sphinx,"

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.987 align:middle line:84%
which had this huge
audience all over the world.

00:26:33.987 --> 00:26:39.815 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:26:39.815 --> 00:26:41.690 align:middle line:84%
CHARLTON HESTON (VOICEOVER):
The Great Sphinx

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:47.660 align:middle line:84%
of Egypt, keeper of
the ancient mysteries.

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:50.040 align:middle line:90%
Guardian of the ancient secrets.

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WEST: And it actually
set the whole--

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:53.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's based upon
the work of Schwaller.

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And his work is based upon
people who came before him.

00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:00.050 align:middle line:84%
You can trace the lineage
right back, really,

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:01.870 align:middle line:90%
to ancient Egypt itself.

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:06.776 align:middle line:84%
But the single
geological proof-- and I

00:27:06.776 --> 00:27:09.120 align:middle line:84%
call it proof and
not just theory--

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:12.410 align:middle line:84%
the single geological proof
that the Sphinx is much, much,

00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:16.160 align:middle line:84%
much older than it's
supposed to be sort of set

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.570 align:middle line:84%
off what's now a cottage
industry of really

00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:22.780 align:middle line:84%
serious and interesting
scholarship, some of it being

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:28.020 align:middle line:84%
aired here at this Paradigm
Symposium, that effectively

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:30.940 align:middle line:84%
sounds the death knell of
the Church of Progress.

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And my conviction is that if
we're to survive as a race

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:40.310 align:middle line:84%
and produce a civilization,
that civilization

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:44.230 align:middle line:84%
must be based not upon
technology and entertainment,

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:48.530 align:middle line:84%
like the idiots at
TED think, but rather

00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:51.730 align:middle line:84%
upon the quest for
immortality, which

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:57.600 align:middle line:84%
is what fueled Egypt, the
Egyptian doctrine, for 3,000

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:02.290 align:middle line:84%
years of, let's say,
of provable history.

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:06.220 align:middle line:84%
But probably tens of
thousands of years

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:09.400 align:middle line:84%
dating from tens of
thousands of years earlier.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.495 align:middle line:84%
Probably, almost
certainly actually.

00:28:11.495 --> 00:28:14.540 align:middle line:90%


00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it's that
symbolist point of view.

00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:20.260 align:middle line:84%
Florence Nightingale was an
absolutely brilliant woman

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:22.510 align:middle line:90%
and was in Egypt in 1850.

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And if she had stuck
with Egyptology,

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:27.500 align:middle line:84%
she had-- she was
right on the money.

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:32.080 align:middle line:84%
But she went off and saved lots
of lives by inventing nursing.

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.729 align:middle line:84%
Had she stuck with
Egyptology, we

00:28:33.729 --> 00:28:35.270 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't have had
to wait another 100

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:37.180 align:middle line:90%
years for Schwaller de Lubicz.

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:40.260 align:middle line:84%
But she wrote home
letters to her parents.

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:43.730 align:middle line:84%
She said, "one wonders that
people can come back from Egypt

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:46.340 align:middle line:84%
and live lives the way
they lived them before."

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:47.950 align:middle line:84%
It has that-- it
really does have

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:52.310 align:middle line:90%
that transformational quality.

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And my own line for it
is, if you don't see Egypt

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:58.160 align:middle line:84%
through symbolist eyes,
you don't see Egypt at all.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:04.660 align:middle line:84%
So this is the reason that
I do the trips, actually,

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:08.170 align:middle line:84%
is to make that experience
available to anyone

00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:11.840 align:middle line:84%
with the interest and
the money to do it.

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:14.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, it's a real
honor to have you here.

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very
appreciative of the work

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:19.320 align:middle line:84%
that you've done in
bringing this out.

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:23.570 align:middle line:84%
Because I do believe the water
weathering is the smoking gun

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:26.020 align:middle line:84%
that everything else
is built off of.

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:30.760 align:middle line:84%
It really shows you just
can't have that type of degree

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:34.250 align:middle line:84%
of erosion from water unless
it's at least 10,000 years old,

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:35.490 align:middle line:90%
maybe even a lot older.

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:37.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WEST: We think
actually now-- even

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:41.270 align:middle line:84%
Schoch has come to the-- openly
acknowledge that it's probably

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:43.940 align:middle line:90%
a lot older than that.

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:46.780 align:middle line:84%
It upsets the entire--
the apple cart.

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:49.500 align:middle line:84%
But the smoking gun really
isn't even the Sphinx.

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:50.830 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's the ammunition.

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:54.490 align:middle line:84%
The smoking gun is now
Gobekli Tepe in Turkey.

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:57.600 align:middle line:84%
Because that proves--
because the academics

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:02.470 align:middle line:84%
themselves don't argue that it
dates from at least 10,000 BC.

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:05.110 align:middle line:84%
It's all supposed to be
hunter-gatherers back then.

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they were
hunter-gatherers.

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:08.800 align:middle line:84%
But while they were at
it, they took time out

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:14.090 align:middle line:84%
to erect 24 or 23
mini Stonehenges built

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:16.730 align:middle line:84%
of blocks of stone that
weigh 10 and 15 tons,

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:21.681 align:middle line:84%
intricately carved with probably
cosmological astronomical

00:30:21.681 --> 00:30:22.180 align:middle line:90%
figures.

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:25.710 align:middle line:84%
That's Laird's department,
actually, primarily.

00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And so we feel
actually that we are

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:31.440 align:middle line:84%
right on the cusp--
I mean all of us,

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.570 align:middle line:84%
practically everyone
at the symposium

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:36.620 align:middle line:84%
here-- we're right on
the cusp of nailing--

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:39.790 align:middle line:84%
putting the final
nails into the coffin

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:41.330 align:middle line:90%
of the Church of Progress.

00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:42.245 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: All right.

00:30:42.245 --> 00:30:43.540 align:middle line:90%
Well, John, thank you so much.

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:44.390 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: Thank you, David.

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:45.181 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: All right.

00:30:45.181 --> 00:30:47.030 align:middle line:90%
>>WEST: Thanks

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:49.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It's really
amazing to consider

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:55.610 align:middle line:84%
23 or 24 different
Stonehenge-type circles made

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:59.350 align:middle line:84%
of blocks of stone
10 to 15 tons each,

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:03.030 align:middle line:84%
that it's all been
dug underground,

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:07.920 align:middle line:84%
and they've carbon dated the
soil around these monuments.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
it had to have been

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:12.780 align:middle line:84%
buried at least
10,000 years ago.

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:15.280 align:middle line:84%
That is absolutely
groundbreaking.

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:18.860 align:middle line:84%
That is something that
fundamentally alters who we are

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:20.530 align:middle line:90%
and what we believe.

00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:22.340 align:middle line:90%
It changes everything.

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:25.180 align:middle line:84%
So the Sphinx
water-weathering argument--

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:27.340 align:middle line:84%
as I said in our
interview, there's

00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:30.570 align:middle line:84%
been some spurious attempts
to try to debunk that,

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:35.770 align:middle line:84%
but Gobekli Tepe isn't even
being denied by the mainstream

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:37.110 align:middle line:90%
archaeologists.

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:38.990 align:middle line:84%
That means we have
to rewrite everything

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:41.580 align:middle line:84%
we think we know about
human civilization.

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:44.020 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very interesting,
and this is only

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:47.730 align:middle line:84%
the beginning of what John
Anthony West has to tell us.

00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:49.760 align:middle line:84%
Coming up next, we're
going to be hearing

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:54.090 align:middle line:84%
from another one of the
great pioneers in the field

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:56.550 align:middle line:84%
of ancient civilizations
research, none

00:31:56.550 --> 00:31:58.780 align:middle line:90%
other than Robert Bauval.

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:02.820 align:middle line:84%
His book came out in
1994, "The Orion Mystery,"

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:05.650 align:middle line:84%
and it had a tremendous
impact on me.

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:08.670 align:middle line:84%
Because in that book,
he was the equivalent

00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:11.560 align:middle line:84%
of Martin Luther
banging the edicts

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:14.710 align:middle line:84%
on the walls of
the church, saying

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:19.590 align:middle line:84%
that the Orion Correlation
Theory was fact.

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, nobody had
even come up with it before,

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:26.340 align:middle line:84%
the idea that the
three pyramids in Egypt

00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:28.670 align:middle line:84%
correspond very
precisely to the three

00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:31.620 align:middle line:84%
stars in the belt of
the constellation Orion.

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:33.100 align:middle line:90%
And it's not just that.

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:36.400 align:middle line:84%
There is literally
a complete mirror

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:39.290 align:middle line:84%
of what we have up
in the sky down there

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:41.410 align:middle line:90%
on the plateau in Egypt.

00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't believe
that, if you're a skeptic,

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:45.730 align:middle line:90%
you've got to hear him out.

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And also interesting
is how much resistance

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:51.024 align:middle line:90%
he got from the mainstream.

00:32:51.024 --> 00:32:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And we're going
to talk about that

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:56.250 align:middle line:84%
as well, coming up next
time here on "Disclosure."

00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:59.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, David Wilcock,
and I thank you for watching.
