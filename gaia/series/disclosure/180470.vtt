00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.680 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID WILCOCK: Hello, and
welcome to "Disclosure."

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.110 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, David Wilcock,
and I am here with none

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.820 align:middle line:10%
other than Dr. Pete Peterson.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.369 align:middle line:10%
He has been very valuable to
me as a scientific educator,

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.030 align:middle line:10%
and was also quite
instrumental in vetting out

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.410 align:middle line:10%
much of the science that
I put into my first book,

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.770 align:middle line:10%
"The Source Field
Investigations," in which

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.600 align:middle line:10%
the first half of it goes into
great detail about the science

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.900 align:middle line:10%
of DNA, the science
of biological life,

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.490 align:middle line:10%
consciousness, how
it all interfaces,

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.910 align:middle line:10%
and that's part of
what Pete independently

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.930 align:middle line:10%
found in his research
on what he calls,

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.037 align:middle line:10%
"the informational field."

00:00:59.037 --> 00:01:01.620 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we're going to
be getting into in this episode,

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.790 align:middle line:90%
and maybe more.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.480 align:middle line:84%
So Pete, welcome
back to the show.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>>PETE PETERSON:
Thank you much, David.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: This is, obviously,
a tremendous huge subject

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.260 align:middle line:84%
for us to get into here, because
this was what you finally

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.960 align:middle line:90%
wrote a PhD thesis for.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, could anybody just
go and look up your thesis

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.880 align:middle line:90%
on the informational field?

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.490 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: No, I'm afraid
that it was classified,

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.025 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to review
it, in my understanding,

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:37.530 align:middle line:84%
in the year 3050 to see if
they want to release it.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.570 align:middle line:84%
Part of it is that what makes
a good curative device also

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.570 align:middle line:90%
makes a good weapons system.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And it was their
opinion, and my opinion,

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.240 align:middle line:84%
that man wasn't really
ready for an ultimate weapon

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.910 align:middle line:90%
along with an ultimate cure.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, I
remember reading Dr. Tom

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.710 align:middle line:84%
Bearden about his
Excalibur Briefing,

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.940 align:middle line:84%
and I know you have certain
opinions about Bearden.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.150 align:middle line:90%
You said that he--

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.740 align:middle line:90%
let me just start out with this.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.050 align:middle line:84%
Bearden has material about these
so-called scalar technologies

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.970 align:middle line:84%
or scalar weapons,
which he said could

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.070 align:middle line:84%
be so destructive
that they would

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.319 align:middle line:84%
dwarf the nuclear bomb in terms
of their destructive potential.

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.360 align:middle line:84%
Would you agree that there
are weapons like that?

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.047 align:middle line:90%
Let's just start with that.

00:02:29.047 --> 00:02:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Both there
are weapons like that

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.810 align:middle line:84%
and they're even bigger
and better weapons

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.560 align:middle line:90%
that we can build.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And you
mentioned one time

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.080 align:middle line:84%
that Bearden, who was
very instrumental in some

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.401 align:middle line:84%
of Richard Hoagland's
physics, had actually

00:02:43.401 --> 00:02:45.400 align:middle line:84%
been present at a meeting
where you were talking

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.220 align:middle line:84%
about a lot of this stuff
before he ever started

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.540 align:middle line:90%
talking about it himself.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I was told that
he was sergeant of the guard

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.680 align:middle line:84%
at that time, and was dealing
with just the people that

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.230 align:middle line:84%
were there, who was
allowed to be there,

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.700 align:middle line:84%
and keeping the wrong people
out and the right people in.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: At this meeting
that you were at?

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.750 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: At this meeting.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Howard Curtin
gave quite an exposure

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.220 align:middle line:90%
of informational fields.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.980 align:middle line:84%
It was the first time
that a lot of people

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.070 align:middle line:84%
had heard of scalar
technology, and he

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.460 align:middle line:84%
was and is a brilliant
expert in scalar technology.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Could you give us
the dirt simple explanation

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.410 align:middle line:90%
of what is a scalar wave?

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, dirt
simple, it's when you--

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.710 align:middle line:84%
let's say that we have a rope
stretched across the studio

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.160 align:middle line:84%
here, and you have one end
of it, I have one end of it.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And I start moving
the rope up and down,

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.630 align:middle line:84%
and I shake waves
into that rope.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And if we pull the rope,
we get longitudinal waves,

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.490 align:middle line:84%
and if we move it like this,
we'll get scalar waves.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And there are things in
nature called solitons.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.110 align:middle line:90%
Solitons are scaler in nature.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.820 align:middle line:84%
They were noticed first by
a ship's captain, and all

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:23.300 align:middle line:84%
of the shipping waves that
were inland in England.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And he'd see these waves coming
down through a shipping lane,

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.350 align:middle line:84%
and the wave was
up and down, and it

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.210 align:middle line:90%
would seem never to diminish.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.200 align:middle line:84%
It would just go, and go, and
go, and go, and go and not

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.000 align:middle line:90%
diminish.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.530 align:middle line:90%


00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.010 align:middle line:84%
So there came a mathematics
out of Oxford for this,

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.090 align:middle line:84%
and that became the beginning
of scalar waves and scalar

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.170 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:54.836 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: On my show,
"Wisdom Teachings,"

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:56.800 align:middle line:90%
I've had many episodes--

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.100 align:middle line:84%
I got really deeply into
Dr. Nikolai Kozyrev,

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.779 align:middle line:84%
the Russian scientist,
who did research

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:05.320 align:middle line:84%
into what he called
"torsion fields,"

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.170 align:middle line:90%
but it's a very similar concept.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, what was weird
about Kozyrev--

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.370 align:middle line:84%
and I want to just
throw this out there

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.800 align:middle line:90%
and see how you respond to it--

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.540 align:middle line:84%
was that, first of all, Kozyrev
was studying the possibility

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.380 align:middle line:84%
that you have all these
binary star systems.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And one star flickers,
and the other star

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.100 align:middle line:84%
flickers at the same way, but
the speed at which they're

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.780 align:middle line:84%
communicating to
each other, in order

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.960 align:middle line:84%
to both flicker like that, is
much faster than light speed,

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.530 align:middle line:84%
sometimes five or six times
faster based on their distance.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.500 align:middle line:84%
So he believed that
there had to be

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.070 align:middle line:84%
some sort of faster
than light wave

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.490 align:middle line:84%
that could be causing them to
mirror each other's behavior

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:49.390 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:50.930 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well,
in recent years,

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.100 align:middle line:84%
we've had the French,
and the Italians,

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.330 align:middle line:84%
and some others actually
show the speed of light

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.390 align:middle line:90%
being 660,000 miles per second.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:02.921 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:06:02.921 --> 00:06:05.045 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And they've
demonstrated it very amply.

00:06:05.045 --> 00:06:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the main
flaws in Einstein's theory

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.220 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that
light is limited

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.270 align:middle line:84%
to 186,000 miles per second,
because it's not at all.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.690 align:middle line:84%
It travels at different
speeds at different times.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And then there
also are phenomena

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:30.011 align:middle line:84%
that can travel
instantly with no delay.

00:06:30.011 --> 00:06:31.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, the
analogy that I've

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.090 align:middle line:84%
seen by some of these Russian
scientists I found really

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.000 align:middle line:84%
amazing, if you looked
at the top of this table

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.520 align:middle line:84%
as if it were a
sponge, lightspeed

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.520 align:middle line:84%
could be like water
soaking through the sponge

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.077 align:middle line:84%
by capillary action,
and it's going

00:06:44.077 --> 00:06:46.660 align:middle line:84%
to have to soak through one hole
into the next, into the next,

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.170 align:middle line:90%
as it goes along.

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:50.680 align:middle line:84%
But what if I just
push the whole table?

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.759 align:middle line:84%
There's no difference in the
speed of the impulse from one

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:56.050 align:middle line:90%
side of the table to the other.

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.390 align:middle line:90%
It moves as if it were a solid.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.240 align:middle line:84%
So are you saying that some of
the universe behaves that way?

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.240 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: All universe
behaves that way

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.900 align:middle line:84%
to the proper
phenomena or stimulus.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What is the role of
consciousness in all of this?

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.580 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, it's a huge subject.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: The consciousness
that I play with travels

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.860 align:middle line:90%
instantaneously.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:23.470 align:middle line:84%
There is no delay at all, and
you can communicate across

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.220 align:middle line:84%
great, great, great
distances with no delay

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.005 align:middle line:90%
if you do it properly.

00:07:29.005 --> 00:07:31.720 align:middle line:84%
There are a number
of theses out there.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.820 align:middle line:84%
Some of them
Einstein was involved

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:39.510 align:middle line:84%
in, and Bell, Bell's theorem,
and Posen, and a few other.

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:42.320 align:middle line:84%
They're a number
of other people.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And so most of what
we have for physics,

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:53.680 align:middle line:84%
I found out, was wrong,
both mathematically,

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:59.350 align:middle line:84%
and philosophically, and
theoretically, and so forth.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And I have a friend coming
out with a book that's

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.600 align:middle line:84%
going to expose all the
mathematics of that very,

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.410 align:middle line:90%
very soon.

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:09.520 align:middle line:84%
They're doing final
drawings and things

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:15.700 align:middle line:84%
now showing that the greater
part of mathematics is wrong,

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:19.120 align:middle line:84%
and that we need to have a
mathematics that we count

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:25.360 align:middle line:84%
in threes, for various reasons,
and that will soon come out,

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to change just
about everything, especially

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.760 align:middle line:84%
the speed of things
happening, and a lot

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.789 align:middle line:84%
of thoughts about physics
are going to change.

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:38.742 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Let's start
with some simpler stuff

00:08:38.742 --> 00:08:41.200 align:middle line:84%
first, because we did talk
about that a little bit already,

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.430 align:middle line:84%
but I wanted to start
with some simpler things.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Could you get into
some of the research

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.170 align:middle line:84%
that you might be aware of
that's less commonly known,

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:56.950 align:middle line:84%
showing that there
is a consciousness

00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:59.800 align:middle line:90%
outside the biological body.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well,
actually we've seen

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.950 align:middle line:84%
results that come from
that throughout history

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:10.760 align:middle line:90%
for a long, long time.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.300 align:middle line:84%
I've been privy
to some books that

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:18.300 align:middle line:84%
were written 6,700 years
ago, and one of them

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:23.640 align:middle line:84%
about 7,200 years ago, where
a lot of this was outlined.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.370 align:middle line:84%
That information
I'm pretty certain

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:29.250 align:middle line:84%
came here from
alien life, what we

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:31.980 align:middle line:84%
would call alien
life, where they

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:37.320 align:middle line:90%
had many, many centuries on us.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: These books are
obviously not public domain,

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:40.500 align:middle line:90%
you're saying?

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: The ones I saw were
books from the Vatican Library,

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:48.120 align:middle line:84%
and the Vatican
Library, that I know of,

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:55.370 align:middle line:84%
holds a lot of books that didn't
burn during the great fire

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:57.230 align:middle line:84%
at The Great Library
of Alexandria.

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.045 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot
of things saved,

00:09:59.045 --> 00:10:01.225 align:middle line:90%
a small percentage burned.

00:10:01.225 --> 00:10:03.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And you were
allowed to read some of them?

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:05.570 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I was allowed to
look at some of them, yes.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:07.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Did they take them
out of the library or did you

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:08.150 align:middle line:90%
go to the library?

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.525 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: No, they were
never taken out of the library.

00:10:10.525 --> 00:10:13.422 align:middle line:84%
They never are taken out of
the library, that I know of.

00:10:13.422 --> 00:10:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: How did you
possibly get the right

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.420 align:middle line:90%
to be in the Vatican Library.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't think anybody's
allowed in there.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:22.880 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: That's not
for discussion right now,

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.660 align:middle line:84%
but it was necessary for some
things that I was working

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:32.360 align:middle line:84%
on due to what appeared
to be attacks from outside

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:37.940 align:middle line:84%
of our known boundaries of
things that we know intimately

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.260 align:middle line:90%
of--

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:43.694 align:middle line:84%
different solar systems,
different galaxies.

00:10:43.694 --> 00:10:45.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Were these
books believed

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.450 align:middle line:84%
to be extraterrestrial
in nature?

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:48.690 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Oh, yes.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.540 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they were some
of the early languages,

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:52.010 align:middle line:90%
a lot of our early languages.

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:55.070 align:middle line:84%
I think we've had,
probably that I know of,

00:10:55.070 --> 00:11:01.550 align:middle line:84%
about five different
buildups of intellect

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:03.920 align:middle line:90%
and humanity on Earth.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Five
different buildups?

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:07.010 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Right.

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:09.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What happens
after it builds up?

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.927 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: It destroys itself.

00:11:11.927 --> 00:11:13.760 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to do it
really hard right now.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.544 align:middle line:84%
It's something very
hard for people to do.

00:11:16.544 --> 00:11:17.960 align:middle line:84%
If you want to
read about it, it's

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:21.355 align:middle line:84%
written about in every
religious text I know of.

00:11:21.355 --> 00:11:23.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I seem to remember
you saying at one point

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.180 align:middle line:84%
that it was your belief, or
people who you spoke to's

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:29.300 align:middle line:84%
belief, that there at one
time had been humans on Earth

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.927 align:middle line:90%
with three fingers?

00:11:30.927 --> 00:11:31.760 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Oh, yes.

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.630 align:middle line:90%
Yes, a lot of reason for that.

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:39.860 align:middle line:90%
I did a study one time.

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:47.960 align:middle line:84%
I was paid to do this by a
group that was interested in it.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And the assumption that I had
made, and they agreed with,

00:11:50.780 --> 00:12:01.080 align:middle line:84%
was that the things that
happened when we were confused

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:05.250 align:middle line:84%
at the Tower of
Babel, let's say,

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:10.710 align:middle line:84%
that story was really we were
confused mathematically rather

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:11.970 align:middle line:90%
than in language.

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So the idea that
there had been, at one time,

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:19.844 align:middle line:84%
one mother tongue on Earth that
then became distributed so that

00:12:19.844 --> 00:12:22.260 align:middle line:84%
people have different languages,
that they can't all speak

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:23.880 align:middle line:90%
to each other, are you saying--

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, that
was what we were told.

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:27.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, that's what
the Bible seems to be saying--

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: That's what
the Bible says, yes.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:29.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: --based on
conventional theology.

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:30.570 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Right.

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:32.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You're saying there was
a mathematical interpretation?

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: What I saw that
happened, and I went back in--

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:38.001 align:middle line:84%
and that's why I
was at the library.

00:12:38.001 --> 00:12:39.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: At the Vatican?

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.770 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Right.

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:46.140 align:middle line:84%
Was what was confused was that
we need to count in base three

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:49.140 align:middle line:90%
rather than in base 10.

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And the change that
happened was that--

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:57.660 align:middle line:84%
and I never did find out
whether we had three fingers

00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:03.870 align:middle line:84%
and got two more, or
whether we had 13 fingers

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.070 align:middle line:90%
and got three less.

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:07.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You mean 12 fingers
total, six on each hand?

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:09.450 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Right.

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And so I never did
determine which.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:17.070 align:middle line:84%
But I did determine that
the confusing was probably

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:18.830 align:middle line:84%
in both things,
but mainly it was

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:21.300 align:middle line:84%
in getting us down
to where we didn't

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.580 align:middle line:90%
look at things in threes.

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:26.340 align:middle line:84%
If you look at anything
in mathematics in threes,

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:29.260 align:middle line:90%
it changes the whole universe.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: We are always
going back and looking

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.350 align:middle line:84%
at all kinds of
ancient writings,

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.320 align:middle line:84%
and it seems like
everything you look at

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.320 align:middle line:84%
is an extraterrestrial
contact that started it.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'm hearing
from what you're telling me,

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:45.720 align:middle line:84%
is that perhaps the government
had the same attitude

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.454 align:middle line:84%
much earlier than
ancient aliens,

00:13:47.454 --> 00:13:49.620 align:middle line:84%
that you've got to go back
and look at these things.

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And what really was the
Tower of Babel story?

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.060 align:middle line:90%
What was that about?

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:55.612 align:middle line:84%
Was that what was
going on there?

00:13:55.612 --> 00:13:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, that's
what I was looking at,

00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:59.310 align:middle line:84%
because it was
something that I knew

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:01.560 align:middle line:84%
that in the Vatican
Library there

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:05.430 align:middle line:90%
was a lot of reference data.

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:07.980 align:middle line:84%
It was a story, but it was
a story all over Earth,

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:11.010 align:middle line:84%
and all different-- not
all-- but most different

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:12.960 align:middle line:84%
peoples, most
different languages,

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.450 align:middle line:90%
most different mathematics.

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:16.330 align:middle line:90%
It was a story.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: If the
Vatican Library is

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:21.240 align:middle line:84%
the remnant of the
Library of Alexandria

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:26.550 align:middle line:84%
that was then moved to
Rome, how did the Egyptians

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:28.540 align:middle line:84%
get these books in
the first place?

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:32.100 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: I have no idea.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:35.820 align:middle line:84%
I know that there are places
there that go back 7,200 years

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:38.897 align:middle line:90%
with written text.

00:14:38.897 --> 00:14:40.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: In the Vatican Library?

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:41.970 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: In the
Vatican Library.

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:44.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, I've heard
from other insiders,

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:47.160 align:middle line:84%
not specifically you,
that there was once

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:51.430 align:middle line:84%
a massive civilization in what
is now the Sahara Desert that

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:52.230 align:middle line:90%
was wiped out.

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And if you go 40 to 400
feet below the surface

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:58.590 align:middle line:84%
down there, that you'll
find all kinds of artifacts,

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:03.210 align:middle line:84%
and that others have also
said that there were books

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:04.442 align:middle line:90%
found down there as well.

00:15:04.442 --> 00:15:06.150 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well,
there were books found.

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:10.510 align:middle line:84%
There were mathematical
mechanical instruments,

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:19.620 align:middle line:84%
things similar to a surveyor's
trench, or similar to a sextant

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:23.340 align:middle line:84%
for measuring where
your location was

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.450 align:middle line:90%
on Earth from stars.

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And there were a lot
of things like that

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:36.840 align:middle line:84%
found in coal deposits that
were millions of years old.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And there were words
about it in textbooks

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:45.330 align:middle line:90%
that were very, very old.

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of that, then
we get the stories or myths

00:15:52.800 --> 00:16:03.630 align:middle line:84%
of Noah's Ark, and of
the various civilizations

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:09.480 align:middle line:84%
that were submerged under water,
or were radiated atomically

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:13.560 align:middle line:90%
and dissolved or disappeared.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, since
we're on the subject,

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:20.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure that everybody
is dying to know,

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:24.330 align:middle line:84%
do these books
look like something

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:25.950 align:middle line:90%
really weird and futuristic?

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:28.290 align:middle line:84%
Do they have like a
chrome-polished surface?

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:30.870 align:middle line:90%
Or what do we actually see?

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:34.374 align:middle line:84%
What did you see with
some of these books?

00:16:34.374 --> 00:16:36.790 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: To me they look
like something I would expect.

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:39.750 align:middle line:84%
But the ones that
I've seen were books

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:46.070 align:middle line:84%
that were written by pressing
in lead, or copper, or gold.

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:47.945 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Like metallic
plates, you're saying?

00:16:47.945 --> 00:16:53.910 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Metallic plates that
were bound in leather bindings,

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:56.350 align:middle line:84%
and some were bound
in papyrus bindings,

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:59.650 align:middle line:84%
and some were bound in, for
all intents and purposes, what

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:03.580 align:middle line:90%
I'd say were plastic bindings.

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What did the covers
of the books look like?

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:07.681 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: A book
cover made from plastic,

00:17:07.681 --> 00:17:10.030 align:middle line:84%
or a book cover made from
some fabric material.

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:15.079 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Were there
pictures on them or text?

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:17.980 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Most had
some kind of explanation

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:24.670 align:middle line:84%
as to what the book was, like a
book today, would be in a text.

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:27.880 align:middle line:84%
Some of the texts, I could
understand a little bit,

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:32.260 align:middle line:84%
see where they came from, and
then have them translated.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And there are very good
translators in the world

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:40.930 align:middle line:84%
these days, including
electronic ones.

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Did these
books have any colors

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.430 align:middle line:90%
to the covers of them?

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well,
yeah, some had colors,

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:50.890 align:middle line:84%
and some didn't have colors,
or they had a natural color.

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:53.295 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What were some of
the colors that you saw?

00:17:53.295 --> 00:17:54.670 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well,
natural colors.

00:17:54.670 --> 00:18:00.540 align:middle line:84%
There were fabrics that were
yellowish-green, typical--

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:06.280 align:middle line:84%
what we would call--
ancient fabric dye colors.

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.100 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them had
leather covers,

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:12.130 align:middle line:84%
and leather takes an
acid type of dye as

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:16.330 align:middle line:84%
compared to an alkaline
dye to really do it.

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:21.640 align:middle line:84%
Some of the colors on the inside
were intense, and beautiful,

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:26.920 align:middle line:84%
beautiful things that
were hand-illuminated,

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:31.720 align:middle line:84%
and some appeared
to me to be printed.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:36.220 align:middle line:84%
You could see the same
character with the same

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:39.685 align:middle line:84%
either imperfection
or perfection.

00:18:39.685 --> 00:18:42.520 align:middle line:84%
It looked like maybe a little
imperfection, like something

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:46.540 align:middle line:84%
had cracked off,
broken off, whatever,

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:49.790 align:middle line:84%
but it was repeated
time after time.

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:57.340 align:middle line:84%
So it might have been a type
of ink block or something

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:59.390 align:middle line:84%
like that, that a little
piece came off of,

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:03.730 align:middle line:84%
and it didn't make any
difference to the overall text.

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:05.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I remember
asking you before,

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:09.280 align:middle line:84%
but I want to do it on camera,
were these books made out

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:10.950 align:middle line:90%
of paper in some cases?

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:12.670 align:middle line:84%
Did they have
regular-looking pages?

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, yeah, there
are paper books, papyrus books,

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:27.580 align:middle line:84%
and things like that, but not as
many as there were metal books.

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:30.010 align:middle line:84%
It seemed that metal was
the way to preserve books,

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:33.340 align:middle line:84%
and they liked gold,
but lead would do.

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:36.880 align:middle line:90%
But lead is almost like a fluid.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.050 align:middle line:90%
Glass is a fluid.

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:41.590 align:middle line:84%
It's just a very thick one,
and it takes a long time.

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:46.930 align:middle line:84%
You'll see old windows from
the 1600's, the window's

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:53.380 align:middle line:84%
larger at the bottom because
the glass has kind of slid down.

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:57.030 align:middle line:90%
But lead is very soft.

00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:01.360 align:middle line:84%
But right now, in fact,
there's a tremendous number

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:06.370 align:middle line:84%
of leather-bound lead books
going through translation

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:10.000 align:middle line:84%
in Oxford that
were found in caves

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.640 align:middle line:84%
of biblical times,
a lot of books

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.870 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of the
biblical stories in them

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:23.240 align:middle line:84%
a little bit different than
they were re-translated

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:28.610 align:middle line:84%
by various churches or
various religious groups.

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:30.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Did you
ever see any pages

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:34.790 align:middle line:84%
that were made of a very
unusual or indestructible type

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:35.810 align:middle line:90%
of material?

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:36.950 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Well, I--

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:38.582 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Or nearly
indestructible?

00:20:38.582 --> 00:20:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I'd
have been destroyed

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:44.740 align:middle line:84%
if I'd have destroyed any
part of a page to find out,

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:48.900 align:middle line:84%
because these books are
of great prime importance,

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.260 align:middle line:90%
and so you're not allowed to.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:55.370 align:middle line:84%
There are places where they
have let people take pieces

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:59.740 align:middle line:84%
that they could see were not
written on and do tests on.

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:01.940 align:middle line:84%
As an example of one
of the things like that

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:04.310 align:middle line:84%
is the Shroud of
Turin, where they

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:07.210 align:middle line:84%
were able to do destructive
testing on it to see

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:09.920 align:middle line:84%
various things in
places where it

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:14.490 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't make much difference or
not a whole lot of difference.

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:18.920 align:middle line:84%
But there were a lot of books
that were very obviously

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:25.620 align:middle line:84%
handmade, one-on-one,
very brilliant in color,

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:31.280 align:middle line:84%
and they were done in some type
of archival process meant to be

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:34.617 align:middle line:90%
saved for later on or future.

00:21:34.617 --> 00:21:36.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, I'm remembering
you telling me about this

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:40.010 align:middle line:84%
before and saying that there
were certain books that

00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:43.400 align:middle line:84%
had very unusual pages
made out of a material

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.200 align:middle line:90%
almost like Kevlar.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:49.520 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: They appeared
to be yesterday's books,

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:53.000 align:middle line:84%
and yet the dates that were on
them and the type of material

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.440 align:middle line:84%
that was there, matched up with
things that were literally back

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.480 align:middle line:90%
one or two--

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:06.890 align:middle line:84%
there's a short and a long
solar cycle that we know of.

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:09.630 align:middle line:84%
Radio amateurs know of
a 12-year solar cycle,

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:14.210 align:middle line:84%
but there's a 23,000-year
plus or minus solar cycle that

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:20.070 align:middle line:84%
we're at the end and then
beginning of right now.

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:23.515 align:middle line:84%
And each one of
those solar cycles,

00:22:23.515 --> 00:22:25.940 align:middle line:84%
a lot of radiation
from the sun became

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:31.670 align:middle line:84%
prominent, a lot of animals,
plant life, human life,

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:33.950 align:middle line:90%
and so forth died off.

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:35.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, you
said 23,000, and I'm

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:38.870 align:middle line:84%
wondering if, maybe since it's
been so many years since you

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:41.350 align:middle line:90%
heard this, is it 26,000?

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:43.100 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
my research has shown,

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:44.790 align:middle line:90%
is a 26,000-year cycle.

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:46.637 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: There are
a number of cycles.

00:22:46.637 --> 00:22:48.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So 23 you're
saying is one of them?

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:50.870 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And some of
them are near together.

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:54.770 align:middle line:84%
Like maybe a 23,000
and a 28,000,

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:58.820 align:middle line:84%
and then a balance out at
26,000, and that type of thing,

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.590 align:middle line:90%
and some of them are different.

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:04.120 align:middle line:84%
Some are because of
things that wander

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:08.160 align:middle line:84%
through the solar
system, and some

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.640 align:middle line:84%
are things that wander
near the solar system,

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:17.130 align:middle line:84%
and then some are things that
are intimately time related.

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And so right now, we
have a lot of radiation.

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:24.320 align:middle line:84%
You can take a very
sensitive Geiger counter,

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.310 align:middle line:84%
and take a trip by
airplane, and find out

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:29.360 align:middle line:84%
you're getting a lot more
than the legal amount

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.199 align:middle line:90%
of X-ray dosage.

00:23:32.199 --> 00:23:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, as
are you, Pete, I've

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:36.050 align:middle line:84%
done more research
than anybody else

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:38.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm aware of in terms of
this interplanetary climate

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:44.990 align:middle line:84%
change demonstrating that there
is a noticeable brightening

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:49.310 align:middle line:84%
and increase in energetic
activity, magnetic activity

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:51.490 align:middle line:84%
on the sun and
throughout the planets.

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:54.920 align:middle line:84%
That they're all having
very discontinuous changes

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:57.496 align:middle line:84%
in their appearance and in
their energetic properties.

00:23:57.496 --> 00:23:59.120 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well,
right now is the time

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:02.780 align:middle line:84%
that's been talked
about for centuries.

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:05.840 align:middle line:84%
You go back and look, and
every so often there's

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.570 align:middle line:90%
a change in the people.

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:11.800 align:middle line:84%
There's a change
in the government.

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:14.450 align:middle line:90%


00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:17.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's ever
gotten to no people on Earth,

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:22.220 align:middle line:84%
but there are things that look
like a whole new people moved

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:26.420 align:middle line:84%
in from somewhere else after
the previous people being nearly

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:29.450 align:middle line:90%
destroyed, if not destroyed.

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, let's go
into that for just a second.

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:36.144 align:middle line:84%
Are you aware of or have you
heard rumors-- obviously,

00:24:36.144 --> 00:24:38.060 align:middle line:84%
you can't confirm this,
you can't prove this--

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:41.510 align:middle line:84%
but did you hear any accounts
of there being people

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:43.160 align:middle line:84%
that looked different
than us that

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:43.340 align:middle line:90%
lived on Earth in the past?

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:44.464 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Oh, absolutely.

00:24:44.464 --> 00:24:46.910 align:middle line:90%
We have pictures of it.

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:53.570 align:middle line:84%
But when you start looking
at some of the drawings that

00:24:53.570 --> 00:25:02.390 align:middle line:84%
have survived floods, and
then being basically cast

00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:05.810 align:middle line:84%
into the mud, if you
would, and then the mud

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:09.290 align:middle line:84%
turning to rock
and stone, things

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:12.960 align:middle line:84%
that are dug up in very,
very deep coal mines,

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:16.110 align:middle line:84%
where there are things
dug up that were obviously

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:19.710 align:middle line:84%
at one time cave drawings
or wall drawings,

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:23.940 align:middle line:84%
and you find difference in
animals as well as differences,

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:25.920 align:middle line:90%
in some cases, peoples.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:28.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So, Pete, you
mentioned in these old,

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:34.860 align:middle line:84%
old books that there was
information in there that you

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:37.770 align:middle line:84%
saw that seemed to validate
some of your research

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:41.440 align:middle line:84%
into the informational
field, consciousness, or--

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.010 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: There were a lot
of things that were obviously

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:47.700 align:middle line:84%
written about
consciousness itself,

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.710 align:middle line:84%
how consciousness
can change what we

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:53.850 align:middle line:90%
consider the physical universe.

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:57.720 align:middle line:84%
When the physical
universe changes,

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:01.290 align:middle line:84%
it appears to be because
our consciousness changes.

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:07.030 align:middle line:84%
We appear to be aware of more
truths than we were before.

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And you can go back and then
base scientific principles--

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:12.900 align:middle line:84%
you can find scientific
principles that

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:17.700 align:middle line:84%
are based on that information
rather than information that's

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:20.430 align:middle line:84%
come out thousands
of years later,

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:25.080 align:middle line:84%
where we learn more and more of
the mathematical field itself.

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:30.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Do you think that
the hominid form in some way

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:34.800 align:middle line:84%
is a blueprint in consciousness
that just emanates into matter?

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.020 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well,
it seems that there

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:40.920 align:middle line:84%
are such forms
within the universe,

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:42.630 align:middle line:84%
that the universe
finds it easier

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:45.870 align:middle line:84%
to remember things
than to make things up

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:48.360 align:middle line:90%
or to come up with new things.

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:51.570 align:middle line:84%
So it appears
that, from to time,

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:55.290 align:middle line:84%
it appears there are different
civilizations entirely,

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:58.260 align:middle line:84%
but there are things that
are very much parallel,

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:02.430 align:middle line:84%
or it's the same, as
previous civilizations

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:04.890 align:middle line:90%
or civilizations yet to come.

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:08.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What were some
of the different species?

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:10.650 align:middle line:84%
What did they look like,
that you're aware of,

00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:12.900 align:middle line:84%
or that you heard had
been on Earth before us?

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:15.270 align:middle line:90%
Did they look different?

00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:16.950 align:middle line:90%
And if so, how?

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:18.510 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: We
have to decide what

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:19.800 align:middle line:90%
we're going to call a species.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:24.045 align:middle line:84%
But we had birds,
and then we had--

00:27:24.045 --> 00:27:26.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Birds, meaning
hominid-looking birds,

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:28.080 align:middle line:90%
like human type?

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.070 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: No.

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:33.900 align:middle line:84%
We had a species that were built
like birds, various species

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:34.740 align:middle line:90%
built like birds.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:36.266 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But they
were intelligent?

00:27:36.266 --> 00:27:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: They may have been
or they may not have been.

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.490 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, there
appear to be some

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:43.200 align:middle line:90%
that were fairly intelligent.

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:46.860 align:middle line:84%
We have remnants of
their brains in us.

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:50.160 align:middle line:84%
We have a avian brain
and a reptilian brain

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:54.120 align:middle line:84%
before we get to
our bicameral brain.

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:58.830 align:middle line:84%
So it appears that they
were each advances.

00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:05.100 align:middle line:84%
It appears that they waxed and
waned based on climate change.

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:10.620 align:middle line:84%
The climate change was because
of various solar changes,

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:13.020 align:middle line:90%
if you would.

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And like I say, it
appears that our sun is

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:21.750 align:middle line:90%
on at least a couple of cycles.

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:25.320 align:middle line:84%
The 12-year cycle seems to
be quite well established,

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:28.920 align:middle line:84%
and that's known
mainly by people

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:31.530 align:middle line:84%
that are involved in
radio transmission,

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:33.799 align:middle line:84%
like all the radio
amateurs will study it.

00:28:33.799 --> 00:28:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, sure, and the
amount of sunspot activity

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:39.240 align:middle line:84%
is very noticeably
different across the cycle.

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:41.790 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And
then also, there's

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:48.040 align:middle line:84%
other sunspot activity that's
just now kind of in its change.

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:50.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Do you think
that these solar changes

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:54.030 align:middle line:84%
at the end of these big
cycles are also causing

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:56.424 align:middle line:90%
changes in consciousness?

00:28:56.424 --> 00:28:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I'm
sure they must be,

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:01.230 align:middle line:84%
because they're
changing structure

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:04.230 align:middle line:84%
of the animals that
are here, and I'm

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:06.060 align:middle line:90%
including the human animal.

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:08.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So when you say
"informational field,"

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:14.340 align:middle line:84%
are you talking about
biological life being composed

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:17.310 align:middle line:84%
of the same things as
what we would think

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:19.050 align:middle line:84%
of as inanimate
matter, and that there

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:23.130 align:middle line:84%
is all some kind of intelligent
information behind all that?

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I see
very definite fields

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:33.690 align:middle line:84%
and a field that is a
mathematical thing or a physics

00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:34.950 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:39.780 align:middle line:84%
I see that changing from time
to time rather dramatically.

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:43.080 align:middle line:84%
And when it changes, it appears
that the life present changes

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.790 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And it appears that the innate
intellect of that life changes.

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:56.340 align:middle line:84%
I have always raised
cats, and cats, to me,

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:57.780 align:middle line:90%
have a certain intellect.

00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:00.810 align:middle line:90%
They're not just random.

00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:04.012 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they think
that they're something

00:30:04.012 --> 00:30:05.470 align:middle line:84%
and they think
they're the leaders,

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:07.880 align:middle line:90%
but that's a different story.

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:13.900 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, so how
much brain you have,

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:19.460 align:middle line:84%
and how it's put together,
and what it thinks

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:23.540 align:middle line:84%
seems to change between
actual-- just even societies.

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:26.120 align:middle line:90%


00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:30.020 align:middle line:84%
We talk about Atlantis, but
that was a very different

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:31.760 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:34.370 align:middle line:84%
Even Egypt was a very
different civilization.

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:37.670 align:middle line:84%
The Mayans were a very
different civilization.

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:39.710 align:middle line:84%
The Incas were a
different civilization.

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:42.950 align:middle line:84%
The Toltecs were a
different civilization.

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:45.860 align:middle line:84%
Their basic thinking
was different from what

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:47.540 align:middle line:90%
our thinking is.

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:50.420 align:middle line:90%
Some things maintain.

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Civilization usually thinks
that, if it gets really hot,

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:55.310 align:middle line:90%
it gets burned.

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:58.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, yes, that's
a physical thing,

00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:00.290 align:middle line:84%
and so those things
tend to stay.

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:04.730 align:middle line:84%
But how you think about
your relationship,

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:08.030 align:middle line:84%
either spiritual or physical,
compared to someone else,

00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:13.800 align:middle line:84%
either spiritual or
physical, is very different.

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Why do you
think these books are

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.440 align:middle line:84%
being held in the Vatican
and that we're not

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.080 align:middle line:90%
being told that they exist?

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:23.180 align:middle line:84%
This information would change
humanity so dramatically.

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:26.435 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: The problem, it
would change the religion.

00:31:26.435 --> 00:31:28.100 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Why would that be bad?

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:30.440 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I didn't
say it was bad.

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:34.250 align:middle line:84%
But if you got all your
power from that religion

00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:37.280 align:middle line:84%
you would think it
was bad to change it,

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:40.940 align:middle line:84%
because you'd have to give
up control, a lot of control,

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:46.260 align:middle line:84%
a lot of ritual, a lot
of exchange of wealth.

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:51.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Do some of these books
have images of, let's say,

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:54.140 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial spacecraft
or extraterrestrial space

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:55.014 align:middle line:90%
stations?

00:31:55.014 --> 00:31:56.930 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I don't know
about space stations,

00:31:56.930 --> 00:32:00.260 align:middle line:84%
but I would say some
type of craft, yes.

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:04.000 align:middle line:84%
Whether they were spacecraft
or bound to the Earth,

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.266 align:middle line:90%
I'd have to make a guess.

00:32:06.266 --> 00:32:08.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Did they appear
to be advanced technology,

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:09.782 align:middle line:90%
from what you were looking at?

00:32:09.782 --> 00:32:11.990 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: They certainly
were different technology.

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:14.600 align:middle line:84%
Some of those technologies
are very simple,

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.310 align:middle line:84%
and there have been
experiments to show

00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:18.720 align:middle line:90%
that they would have worked.

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:21.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, why that hasn't
gone on probably

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:24.950 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the
vast control power

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:33.300 align:middle line:84%
of the various technologies
and various corporations.

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.090 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays they'd be
corporations, but they

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:36.298 align:middle line:90%
might have been gilds before.

00:32:36.298 --> 00:32:38.772 align:middle line:90%


00:32:38.772 --> 00:32:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: People are going
to want to know this.

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:42.604 align:middle line:84%
So I need to ask you,
even though I know this

00:32:42.604 --> 00:32:45.560 align:middle line:90%
from talking to you before.

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:49.640 align:middle line:84%
How could you read books
that are 7,200 years old?

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:51.890 align:middle line:84%
Were they translated
in some way?

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:56.360 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Yes, you go find
experts that can read it,

00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:00.980 align:middle line:84%
and a good source of those
is at Oxford University, who

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:06.920 align:middle line:84%
are now translating some
biblical or pre-biblical texts.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:09.230 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them now are
coming out of Jordan.

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Right now, there's
about I think 900--

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:13.850 align:middle line:90%
maybe there's double that--

00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:18.080 align:middle line:90%
books, mostly on lead plates.

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:20.990 align:middle line:84%
I believe there's some gold
and some other metal plates--

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:22.130 align:middle line:90%
copper.

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And you're saying that
some of these Oxford professors

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:27.380 align:middle line:84%
are knowledgeable enough
about ancient languages

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:29.195 align:middle line:84%
that they could be in
a position to translate

00:33:29.195 --> 00:33:29.510 align:middle line:90%
these ancient documents?

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:31.030 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Oh, yeah, they
seem to be translating them

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:31.830 align:middle line:90%
very easily.

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:34.671 align:middle line:90%
These are rather modern.

00:33:34.671 --> 00:33:43.237 align:middle line:84%
These came probably the time
just before and after Christ.

00:33:43.237 --> 00:33:45.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What about the
Egyptian priesthood?

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:46.752 align:middle line:84%
Did they have the
ability to translate

00:33:46.752 --> 00:33:48.710 align:middle line:84%
some of these old books
that they were finding?

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:49.765 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I have
no idea at all.

00:33:49.765 --> 00:33:51.931 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, I thought I
remembered you telling me

00:33:51.931 --> 00:33:56.182 align:middle line:84%
before that some of the books
had Egyptian painted marks

00:33:56.182 --> 00:33:57.765 align:middle line:84%
on them, like certain
collections that

00:33:57.765 --> 00:33:58.040 align:middle line:90%
were found in certain places.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:58.570 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well,
if they did, they

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:00.590 align:middle line:84%
were then written by
Egyptians, and so they

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:04.010 align:middle line:84%
would have definitely known
how to translate them.

00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:06.440 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot
of Egyptian books.

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.389 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot of
Egyptian books written

00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:14.120 align:middle line:84%
about Christian times and some
of the later Egyptian things.

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:15.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Did any
of these books have

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.949 align:middle line:84%
pictures of what you would think
of as extraterrestrial beings,

00:34:18.949 --> 00:34:20.900 align:middle line:90%
like portraits?

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Some did, and
the way they were done,

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:30.399 align:middle line:84%
you're never to know whether it
was a fancy of their thought.

00:34:30.399 --> 00:34:32.900 align:middle line:90%


00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:34.670 align:middle line:90%
Remember, they deified animals.

00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:37.880 align:middle line:90%
The Egyptians deified animals.

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:40.639 align:middle line:84%
So the question was,
were they defying animals

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:44.719 align:middle line:84%
or were the animals maybe
ancient remnants of people

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:45.710 align:middle line:90%
that were here before?

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:51.240 align:middle line:90%


00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:52.040 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.914 align:middle line:84%
I was just thinking
about this the other day,

00:34:53.914 --> 00:34:58.910 align:middle line:84%
as a matter of fact, how many of
the things that we have appear

00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:03.950 align:middle line:90%
to be two-legged, two-armed.

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:05.990 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
five-fingered people,

00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:09.370 align:middle line:84%
but there are a lot of
three-fingered people.

00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:13.800 align:middle line:84%
The five-fingered thing
came in about the time

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:20.190 align:middle line:84%
that we had the Tower
of Babel, the confusing.

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:23.080 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately now, if we
look at our science,

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:27.310 align:middle line:84%
we record our science
usually in mathematics.

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And so the mathematics
would probably

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:32.700 align:middle line:84%
be based on how
many fingers we had.

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:35.250 align:middle line:90%
It is certainly for us.

00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of stuff you can't

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:40.470 align:middle line:90%
do with base 10 mathematics.

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:43.690 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of things you can
do if you had three fingers.

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:45.894 align:middle line:84%
Our mathematics would
be light years ahead.

00:35:45.894 --> 00:35:47.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well,
when you're talking

00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:50.490 align:middle line:84%
about an informational
field, what

00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:56.010 align:middle line:84%
are some of the practical
things that you saw that would

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:58.710 align:middle line:90%
help to prove its existence?

00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:02.160 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, I saw that
it had a field-like structure,

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:06.720 align:middle line:84%
and I saw that when you
used, rather than a base 10

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:10.320 align:middle line:84%
mathematical structure,
but a field three

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:16.560 align:middle line:84%
structure, many things
that we had no answers for,

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.420 align:middle line:90%
the answers just popped up.

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, this
looks more natural to me.

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:23.550 align:middle line:84%
But it looked like
all of that took place

00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:28.770 align:middle line:84%
at about the same time as
the Tower of Babel stories,

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:31.590 align:middle line:84%
and that's why I was
interested in it,

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:33.310 align:middle line:90%
to see if something happened.

00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm adventurous
enough to think

00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:47.100 align:middle line:84%
maybe some outside group of
beings came to our planet

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:52.140 align:middle line:84%
and had relations
with us, and we

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:55.650 align:middle line:84%
took on some of their
genetic characteristics.

00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:58.530 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps was it that
they came and they

00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:03.330 align:middle line:84%
wanted us to be workers,
so they either genetically

00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:04.700 align:middle line:90%
added or took off.

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:07.230 align:middle line:84%
We're genetically
adding and subtracting

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:10.830 align:middle line:84%
from the genetic field right
now in the things we're

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:11.640 align:middle line:90%
talking about.

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about,
is it good or bad?

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:17.790 align:middle line:90%
Can we help or not help mankind?

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:20.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, let me ask
you one specific one here,

00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:23.220 align:middle line:84%
which I'm curious to
get your reaction on.

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:26.370 align:middle line:84%
I researched and wrote about in
Source Field something called

00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:30.660 align:middle line:84%
"the multiples effect," in
which independently different

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:35.040 align:middle line:84%
scientists publish
discoveries that are identical

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:39.180 align:middle line:84%
or nearly identical at
almost the exact same time.

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And it would appear that
as the cognitive mind,

00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:47.670 align:middle line:84%
as the intellect, is trying
to solve a particular problem,

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:52.050 align:middle line:84%
that may be in fact uploading
to some sort of group mind

00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:53.457 align:middle line:90%
that we all share.

00:37:53.457 --> 00:37:54.540 align:middle line:90%
Would you agree with that?

00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:55.870 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Very much so.

00:37:55.870 --> 00:38:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And in some ways it's
very obvious, from science

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:07.410 align:middle line:84%
that I'm aware of, that we
are able to transmit thoughts

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:12.690 align:middle line:84%
without use of mechanical, or
chemical, or physical things.

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:18.030 align:middle line:84%
We transmit them maybe as
an electromagnetic wave,

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:21.450 align:middle line:84%
but there's not really
a lot of basis for that,

00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:24.300 align:middle line:84%
but they are
transmitted somehow.

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:26.640 align:middle line:84%
In The 100th, monkey
theory comes out

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:31.890 align:middle line:90%
of that, a number of things.

00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:34.890 align:middle line:84%
We knew what the formula
for natural aspirin,

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:38.610 align:middle line:90%
from Salix or willow plant--

00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:42.390 align:middle line:84%
we knew what the formula was,
but we couldn't synthesize it.

00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
within a week's time

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:47.520 align:middle line:84%
it was synthesized in
America, in Germany,

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:50.830 align:middle line:84%
and France, and very
soon after that,

00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:53.700 align:middle line:90%
in India, and other places.

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And so why would that
all come as a cluster?

00:38:56.910 --> 00:39:00.210 align:middle line:90%
And we find out that--

00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:02.520 align:middle line:84%
I worked with a plant
scientist one time,

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:05.190 align:middle line:84%
that I kicked
myself in the fanny

00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:08.520 align:middle line:84%
for not continuing on with
him, because he was brilliant.

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:11.910 align:middle line:84%
I was right in the middle of
something else at the time.

00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:14.550 align:middle line:84%
But he found out that
plants would send signals

00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:18.750 align:middle line:84%
as much as 40, or 50,
or maybe even more miles

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:23.400 align:middle line:84%
to bring certain minerals
and foods to the plants

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:26.160 align:middle line:90%
across space and time.

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And it was a field
that was-- obviously,

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:33.030 align:middle line:84%
you could use field
equations to write about it,

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:37.410 align:middle line:84%
and to measure it, and to
check what power it was going

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:41.230 align:middle line:84%
to have, what effect
it was going to have,

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:47.670 align:middle line:84%
but it wasn't an electric field
and it wasn't a magnetic field.

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:51.690 align:middle line:84%
So I called them
informational fields,

00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:55.590 align:middle line:84%
because the information
was what was transmitted.

00:39:55.590 --> 00:40:00.390 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of
that, I got to see

00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:03.030 align:middle line:84%
that there were ways of
generating those fields, ways

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:05.580 align:middle line:84%
of transmitting them,
ways of receiving them,

00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:09.620 align:middle line:84%
ways of utilizing them
for good or bad purposes.

00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, this
is really interesting,

00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:15.540 align:middle line:84%
because what I'm hearing
is validation, even

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:18.510 align:middle line:84%
more than before,
that consciousness

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:20.940 align:middle line:84%
is the builder of reality,
as these great world

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:23.880 align:middle line:84%
religions have told us,
and spiritual traditions,

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:28.660 align:middle line:84%
and that even these
extraterrestrial beings, who

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:30.750 align:middle line:84%
apparently left books
behind that they still

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:35.910 align:middle line:84%
have in the Vatican, were
aware of this 7,200 years ago.

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:37.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, that is a
fascinating discussion,

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:39.150 align:middle line:84%
and I really want to thank
you for bringing that

00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:40.170 align:middle line:90%
to our awareness.

00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:44.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, David Wilcock,
and we'll see you next time.

00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:47.420 align:middle line:90%
