>>DAVID WILCOCK:
Sperry, welcome.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.600 align:middle line:10%
We are happy to
have you on my show.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And I see you is a very
integral piece of the puzzle.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:32.780 align:middle line:84%
We are confronting the idea of a
government that is actually not

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.780 align:middle line:84%
working in our best
interest, to put it mildly.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.760 align:middle line:84%
What is your perspective on the
situation that we're seeing now

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.880 align:middle line:84%
with this shadowy
government that's

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.930 align:middle line:84%
in place and the things
that are happening there?

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.545 align:middle line:90%
How do you see that?

00:00:47.545 --> 00:00:50.170 align:middle line:10%
>>SPERRY ANDREWS: Well, I think
a positive way of looking at it

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.280 align:middle line:10%
is that we individually have
been ruled in the same way

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.350 align:middle line:10%
by our so-called conscious mind,
which comprises only about 3%

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.550 align:middle line:10%
to 5% of our moment-to-moment
neurophysiological psychology.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.300 align:middle line:10%
And that has enslaved or
dominated or controlled

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.780 align:middle line:10%
the other 95% of us,
which we in science

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.910 align:middle line:10%
call the cognitive
unconscious, which

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.870 align:middle line:10%
is about 4,000 billion bits
of information per second,

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.880 align:middle line:10%
compared to the
so-called conscious mind

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.900 align:middle line:10%
that some say is about 2000
bits of information per second.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.050 align:middle line:84%
So as we wake up, and as
the universe expands--

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.480 align:middle line:90%
and all life does this.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.560 align:middle line:84%
Plants, even, will
metabolize its environment

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.170 align:middle line:84%
through paying
attention biologically

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.310 align:middle line:84%
and bring in the energy and
information in the environment

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.090 align:middle line:84%
and build the plant or the
human being from a baby

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.090 align:middle line:84%
until an adult or a society from
a tribe to seven billion people

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.960 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And so if we look at
it in a holistic way,

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.930 align:middle line:84%
as you suggested, as
a hologram, and where

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.950 align:middle line:84%
every point in a hologram is
mapped to every other point,

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.500 align:middle line:84%
it's really an
indivisible geometry.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.639 align:middle line:84%
So there's an instantaneous
rapport between all the parts.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.550 align:middle line:84%
But in the evolution of the
so-called conscious mind

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.400 align:middle line:84%
and this ability to
conceptualize what we've

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.030 align:middle line:84%
been experiencing as
reptiles and as mammals,

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.970 align:middle line:84%
as a sensory motor reptilian
brain and the limbic system,

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.300 align:middle line:84%
which is the mammalian brain,
which is more concerned

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.930 align:middle line:84%
with emotion, the
development of the neocortex,

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.800 align:middle line:84%
by some estimates, has
ballooned in size five times

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.870 align:middle line:90%
in the last 40,000 years.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And so it's like
an ostrich egg kind

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.620 align:middle line:84%
of laid inside of our
heads, each of our heads.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And we call that the neocortex,
the new part of our brain.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's trying to make a
conceptual map of everything

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.060 align:middle line:84%
and it really behaves like a
child, asking mother and father

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.110 align:middle line:90%
like, what's this mommy?

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.740 align:middle line:90%
What's that, Daddy?

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's just
constantly nagging at us

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.490 align:middle line:84%
to try to create a
conceptual equivalent of what

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.830 align:middle line:90%
we've been sensing and feeling.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And so when that happens
at a global scale,

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.110 align:middle line:84%
the same thing's happening
in us as individuals.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.870 align:middle line:84%
We're been developing
this conceptual mind

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.730 align:middle line:90%
that is trying to control--

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.930 align:middle line:84%
like a child tries to
control their parents.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.880 align:middle line:90%
There's a power struggle there.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And so there's
resistance on the part

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.780 align:middle line:84%
of the parents, which in this
case are the 99%, if you will.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And the global elite
are really attempting

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:39.530 align:middle line:84%
to be this very sort of
disconnected, uneducated, very

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.910 align:middle line:84%
control-fixated, very
secure sector of society

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.650 align:middle line:84%
that are grasping at control
over the greater body, heart,

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.399 align:middle line:90%
and mind of the Earth.

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, that's
an interesting angle.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.210 align:middle line:84%
You're suggesting, if I
think I heard you correctly,

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.950 align:middle line:84%
that the 99%, the
bulk of humanity

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.850 align:middle line:84%
is actually the parents because
we elect these people to be

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.750 align:middle line:84%
our leaders, quote unquote,
and that in a sense

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.270 align:middle line:84%
the leaders are behaving
like the children,

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.170 align:middle line:84%
though we wouldn't normally
think of it that way.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.770 align:middle line:90%
Is that your hypothesis?

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:17.570 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Yes.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.760 align:middle line:84%
The leaders are perhaps the
most psychotic or sociopathic,

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.360 align:middle line:84%
the most cut off from the
greater body, heart, and mind,

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.960 align:middle line:84%
in the same way that our
so-called conscious mind gets

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.310 align:middle line:90%
us in a lot of trouble.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Who we think we are, what
we think we're doing often

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.420 align:middle line:84%
gets us into this
state where we feel

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.900 align:middle line:84%
like we're at a dead end
alley, which is how humanity

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.820 align:middle line:90%
is kind of stuck right now.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.990 align:middle line:84%
We have to kind of wake up
and give equal attention

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:53.290 align:middle line:84%
to this more ancient
aspect of our sensory motor

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.000 align:middle line:90%
and emotional system.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And we need to do that
together, not just individually.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.100 align:middle line:84%
We need to do it as a
society, as a species.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.050 align:middle line:84%
And the global leader are more
in that controlling position,

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.310 align:middle line:84%
trying to hang on to
who they think they are

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.820 align:middle line:84%
and what they think
they're doing,

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.500 align:middle line:84%
and what they want us to
do, just in the same way

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.520 align:middle line:84%
that our so-called conscious
mind has been trying to control

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.420 align:middle line:84%
us individually, like our
egos, for example, to get us

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:25.210 align:middle line:84%
to be a certain person and play
a certain role, which often

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.750 align:middle line:90%
is really just an ego trip.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:32.460 align:middle line:90%


00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: The model
that you're presenting

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:40.370 align:middle line:84%
would be a holographic view
of what we see collectively

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:45.590 align:middle line:84%
on Earth as a mirror projection
of a psychodynamic issue

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.990 align:middle line:84%
within each individual, in which
the power elite would represent

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:59.040 align:middle line:84%
the ego and the conscious mind,
in a sense, the part of us that

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.780 align:middle line:84%
tries to dominate the flow
of energy and thought.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: The collective,
the 99% of humanity,

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.180 align:middle line:84%
has this tremendous potential
in the so-called conscious mind.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:17.530 align:middle line:84%
The power elite, in this case,
is terrified of just waking up.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:18.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.413 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: But we've been
dominating and enslaving

00:06:20.413 --> 00:06:22.470 align:middle line:84%
our bodies and utilizing
them for whatever

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.990 align:middle line:84%
we want to do with them,
fulfilling our desires

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.000 align:middle line:84%
and avoiding threats
and pain as creatures.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And we've been doing that on a
social scale through creating

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.960 align:middle line:84%
peace through war, and very
conflict-laden, contentious way

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.060 align:middle line:90%
of being.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And so once we wake
up, we're actually

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.060 align:middle line:90%
noticing more every moment.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.760 align:middle line:84%
Even plants grow
by noticing more

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.340 align:middle line:84%
per unit area of space
time, where actually

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.270 align:middle line:84%
the whole universe
is expanding because

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.800 align:middle line:84%
at the quantum mechanical
level, space-time

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.830 align:middle line:84%
is actually part
of the architecture

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.180 align:middle line:90%
of universal consciousness.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And it is uniting the
universe over and over again.

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And every moment
it's reuniting it,

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.970 align:middle line:84%
it's expanding and
creating the complexity

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:09.440 align:middle line:90%
that we're experiencing.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.380 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense we actually feel
that we're never the same way

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:14.180 align:middle line:90%
twice.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.194 align:middle line:84%
We're total strangers to
ourselves every moment.

00:07:17.194 --> 00:07:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And so that's sort
of scary unless we're

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:24.710 align:middle line:84%
aware of this unchangeless
awareness which is imageless.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's what meditation
and the ancient arts

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.000 align:middle line:84%
of conscious awareness that
come to us from the East,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.270 align:middle line:84%
largely, is about,
is becoming aware

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.020 align:middle line:84%
of that which in
us does not suffer

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:42.620 align:middle line:84%
and is never divided by
space or time or personality.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What do you
think consciousness is?

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Well,
to reflect on some

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:52.115 align:middle line:84%
of the foremost neuroscientists,
people like Eben Alexander

00:07:52.115 --> 00:07:56.630 align:middle line:84%
or Jill Bolte Taylor, who is
one of the most popular videos

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:02.060 align:middle line:90%
on the Ted Talks online.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:06.290 align:middle line:84%
They've had this experience of
either a near-death experience

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:08.810 align:middle line:84%
or a collapse of
their left brain,

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:12.560 align:middle line:84%
where their verbal analytic
brain couldn't process and chop

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:17.180 align:middle line:84%
everything up and label it,
and have a direct, seamless,

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.580 align:middle line:84%
non-linear experience
of existence,

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:23.740 align:middle line:84%
and been in this blissful
state of either being--

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:26.450 align:middle line:84%
as with Eben
Alexander, this sense

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.970 align:middle line:84%
of just having
total connectedness,

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:32.659 align:middle line:84%
and experience throughout
all of their life

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:34.880 align:middle line:84%
coming together
as a single whole,

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.324 align:middle line:84%
and completely being enlightened
to who and what they are.

00:08:37.324 --> 00:08:38.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: This is while
they're allegedly

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:40.079 align:middle line:90%
dead in a clinical sense.

00:08:40.079 --> 00:08:41.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Yeah, exactly.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: They have no
respiration, no heart rate,

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:43.270 align:middle line:90%
and no brainwaves.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:46.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Well, there's some
very strictly satisfying cases

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:50.690 align:middle line:84%
in which people were being
monitored that were--

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.900 align:middle line:84%
actually, their body
was frozen, virtually,

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.470 align:middle line:84%
so that there was no possibility
of any brain activity.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And their brain was
being operated on,

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.870 align:middle line:90%
so it had to be flat-lining.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:04.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
they had the most

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:09.890 align:middle line:84%
activity of these out-of-body
full cognitive experiences.

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:13.870 align:middle line:84%
So over and over again now,
for the last 20, 30 years,

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:19.060 align:middle line:84%
the evidence is
outstanding that the brain

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:20.710 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have to be
active for there

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:25.960 align:middle line:84%
to be consciousness, self-aware
consciousness beyond the brain.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And people go out
of their bodies,

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.570 align:middle line:84%
they go up through several
floors in a hospital,

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:35.290 align:middle line:84%
they can see-- this one woman
saw a red sneaker on the roof

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:37.990 align:middle line:84%
and was able to report that,
able to hear what people were

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:41.260 align:middle line:84%
talking about down the hallway
and be able to repeat it back

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:42.450 align:middle line:90%
with tremendous accuracy.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:47.860 align:middle line:84%
The doctors are aghast at the
clarity with which this person

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:51.850 align:middle line:84%
was able to know what was going
on when they were supposedly

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:55.990 align:middle line:90%
dead or completely unconscious.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: How often are
these near death experiences

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:58.960 align:middle line:90%
happening?

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.830 align:middle line:84%
Is this actually just
a statistical anomaly,

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:05.350 align:middle line:84%
or is it something
that is standardizable

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:09.940 align:middle line:90%
across a large body of data?

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:11.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Well,
since it really became

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:15.910 align:middle line:84%
a subject of scientific
investigation decades ago,

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:19.810 align:middle line:84%
starting really with Raymond
Moody and Kenneth Ring,

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:23.440 align:middle line:84%
there have been literally
reported tens of millions

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.047 align:middle line:90%
of near-death experiences.

00:10:25.047 --> 00:10:26.130 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Tens of millions?

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:26.930 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Yes.

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:28.210 align:middle line:90%
It's really that prevalent.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:28.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: I didn't know that.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:29.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Yeah.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And so then a certain
percentage of those people

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:37.790 align:middle line:90%
have full recall of that.

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.840 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit like
Abraham Maslow's work, where

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:45.010 align:middle line:84%
he thought that he would,
in researching these higher

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:53.640 align:middle line:84%
optimum states of flow and
transcendent consciousness,

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.590 align:middle line:84%
that maybe 5% of
the population would

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:56.870 align:middle line:90%
have had these experiences.

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:59.730 align:middle line:84%
But when he started
studying people--

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:03.510 align:middle line:84%
and he's passed now, his
whole life was doing this--

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:07.470 align:middle line:84%
he found that 100% of people
had had these experience of what

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:09.060 align:middle line:84%
he called peak
experiences, where

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.100 align:middle line:84%
they transcended
their separateness

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.660 align:middle line:84%
and experienced
this indivisibility

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:13.870 align:middle line:90%
with the whole of nature.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:15.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now this
is the Maslow who--

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:20.820 align:middle line:84%
like I had psychology
bachelor's degree in college--

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:24.750 align:middle line:84%
so he's talking about a pyramid
of needs, a hierarchy of needs.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.660 align:middle line:84%
We have needs for
food and shelter.

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:28.650 align:middle line:84%
We have needs for
love and nurturance.

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:30.750 align:middle line:84%
But then the highest
level of Maslow's pyramid

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:33.060 align:middle line:84%
was what he called
self-realization.

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And he said that that was where
we feel a greater transpersonal

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.500 align:middle line:84%
identity supersedes
this physical self

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.580 align:middle line:84%
and is a greater
connectedness to the universe.

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:43.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Yes.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.338 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now you're saying
that Maslow was only

00:11:45.338 --> 00:11:48.270 align:middle line:84%
expecting that a small
percentage of the population

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:49.710 align:middle line:90%
would actually experience that?

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:50.790 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: That's right.

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:52.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: And it wasn't that way.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.080 align:middle line:90%
What did he actually find?

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Well, he
found that it was--

00:11:56.670 --> 00:12:00.240 align:middle line:84%
100% of people have had this
transcendent experience.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.170 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: 100%.

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:05.190 align:middle line:84%
100% as far as he could
tell, but only maybe 20%

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:08.730 align:middle line:84%
of those people really had
allowed themselves to be

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:10.140 align:middle line:90%
changed by that experience.

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:12.300 align:middle line:84%
Some of them just
wanted to shut it away

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.070 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't want
to think about it.

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:15.569 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know
what to do with it.

00:12:15.569 --> 00:12:17.250 align:middle line:84%
They didn't really
know what it meant.

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And so they didn't know how to
integrate it into their lives.

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And so they-- in fact,
there was a study

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:25.830 align:middle line:84%
done with something like
over 40 cultures where

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:27.720 align:middle line:90%
they asked people about this.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And something like, I think
it was about 68% of people,

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:38.380 align:middle line:84%
had reported having had this
or were admitting to it.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:43.320 align:middle line:84%
But only 23% had ever spoken
about it to anybody else.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:47.520 align:middle line:84%
So there's this sense of this
tremendous innate resource

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.354 align:middle line:90%
that we have to work with.

00:12:49.354 --> 00:12:50.520 align:middle line:90%
But people were embarrassed.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.724 align:middle line:84%
They don't feel--
they just feel shy.

00:12:52.724 --> 00:12:54.390 align:middle line:84%
They feel that people
will think they're

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:56.490 align:middle line:90%
crazy to talk about this.

00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:59.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What in
their life happened

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:02.160 align:middle line:84%
that what you're saying is
this transpersonal awareness?

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.100 align:middle line:84%
What could they identify
in their experience

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:08.650 align:middle line:84%
that would actually have been
that event happening to them?

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: You know, as children
we reach delta wave brain wave

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:15.720 align:middle line:84%
consciousness several
times a night.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.530 align:middle line:90%
That's normal.

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:17.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: And in that
state there is no thought.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.670 align:middle line:84%
We're actually restoring
ourselves by sleeping,

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:26.730 align:middle line:84%
by entering into this
thoughtless awareness, which

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:28.470 align:middle line:84%
when you experience
it consciously,

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:30.660 align:middle line:90%
is actually sublime.

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:34.910 align:middle line:84%
You feel completely
connected to everything,

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:38.800 align:middle line:84%
as though everything is part of
your own body, heart, and mind.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Are you saying that
people show the delta wave

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:43.960 align:middle line:84%
on the EKG when they're in that
state of awareness consciously?

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: As children, and
as we grow into adulthood,

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:50.070 align:middle line:84%
we spend less time there
except for yogis and people

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:51.360 align:middle line:90%
that are meditators.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And they can actually go into
predominant delta and theta

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.620 align:middle line:84%
brain wave dominance during
waking consciousness .

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.710 align:middle line:84%
It was said that Einstein,
with his eyes open,

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:05.010 align:middle line:84%
was in dominant theta,
which is a very deep state.

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:09.150 align:middle line:84%
It's actually below
thinking or imaging.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And so you're in this state
of undivided attention

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:15.550 align:middle line:84%
where you feel undivided
from everyone and everything.

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And it allows you to
access a much more

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:21.010 align:middle line:84%
comprehensive and complex
level of information.

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:23.370 align:middle line:84%
That's what made
him such a genius.

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:25.632 align:middle line:84%
And so the whole society
can actually access this.

00:14:25.632 --> 00:14:27.090 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
things that I've

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:31.380 align:middle line:84%
been working on, global
consciousness, how

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:33.960 align:middle line:84%
we can collectively be
enlightened as a species,

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.970 align:middle line:84%
and how nature has
actually designed

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:38.610 align:middle line:84%
us to share undivided
attention, which is

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:40.410 align:middle line:90%
the same as unconditional love.

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:44.280 align:middle line:84%
When you hold a child or
your lover to your heart

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.850 align:middle line:84%
and you feel together, you sense
what you're feeling together.

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:50.580 align:middle line:84%
It feels like
unconditional, eternal love.

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:55.290 align:middle line:84%
You want to be in that sense of
belonging as one heart, body,

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:56.550 align:middle line:90%
and mind.

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And you can easily do that
by just paying attention

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:02.040 align:middle line:84%
together and noticing that
your attention and my attention

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.650 align:middle line:90%
are actually always undivided.

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:06.409 align:middle line:84%
We just weren't
noticing it because we

00:15:06.409 --> 00:15:07.950 align:middle line:84%
were giving our
attention to thoughts

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:11.580 align:middle line:84%
and things and activities
almost exclusively as a habit.

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And that habit is an
addictive formation.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And as long as we're paying
attention slideshow style

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.630 align:middle line:84%
to things and thoughts
and activities,

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:28.080 align:middle line:84%
we feel separate from each
other and from our greater self.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And that shows up in
the brain wave analysis

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:32.580 align:middle line:90%
when we do sleep analysis.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And we see that even adults
who don't sleep well,

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:43.490 align:middle line:84%
they hardly get into deep
theta or much less delta,

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:47.510 align:middle line:84%
and they stay in high alpha
or even in beta conscious.

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:49.260 align:middle line:84%
They don't really
sleep very much,

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.490 align:middle line:84%
and so they become exhausted
and burn out very quickly.

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And our society is really
suffering from that.

00:15:54.740 --> 00:16:00.100 align:middle line:90%


00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: There is an intrinsic
narcissism in everyone.

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And some of us have more of it
and some of us have less of it.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:12.820 align:middle line:84%
It appears to come from
frustrated impulses

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.290 align:middle line:90%
in childhood.

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:16.000 align:middle line:84%
We talked about
birth trauma before.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.300 align:middle line:90%
But I want to talk again about--

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:22.780 align:middle line:84%
let's explore that
moment in childhood

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.730 align:middle line:84%
when you first
start hearing "no,"

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:26.560 align:middle line:90%
because it might be awhile.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.252 align:middle line:84%
Would you agree that in
the early early childhood

00:16:29.252 --> 00:16:31.210 align:middle line:84%
when you're just a baby,
and they're giving you

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:33.852 align:middle line:84%
a little yellow rattle,
that it's all bliss

00:16:33.852 --> 00:16:34.810 align:middle line:90%
and it's all happiness.

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And then at some point,
there's that decisive moment

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:40.300 align:middle line:84%
when you want something
and you're told no,

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.097 align:middle line:84%
and it's like your whole
world just falls apart.

00:16:43.097 --> 00:16:44.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: When we're
infants, I mean,

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:48.220 align:middle line:84%
we feel like we are our
parents, we are the world.

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:50.560 align:middle line:90%
There's no divisions.

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And that unity is
extremely beautiful.

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:57.430 align:middle line:84%
We're basking in this
totally protected place where

00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:00.520 align:middle line:84%
we can experience
that indivisible being

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.150 align:middle line:90%
that we actually are.

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And there's such a thing
as healthy narcissism.

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't get our
healthy narcissistic needs met

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:14.410 align:middle line:84%
as children, then later on we
have these unhealthy narcissism

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:17.859 align:middle line:84%
where we're trying to get the
unconditional love, trying

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:24.920 align:middle line:84%
to get the promise of consumer
culture for ourselves,

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:29.620 align:middle line:84%
to have the best car, the best
place, and the greatest house

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:33.850 align:middle line:84%
and everything else, and the
best friends, 5,000 friends

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:36.600 align:middle line:90%
on Facebook or whatever.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:40.390 align:middle line:84%
You know, the sign that
we've made it or whatever.

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:42.700 align:middle line:90%
And it's all empty, really.

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:46.937 align:middle line:84%
Momentarily we feel good, but
actually it doesn't pan out.

00:17:46.937 --> 00:17:48.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: An unawakened
person is going

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.820 align:middle line:84%
to say, well, there's no
value in anybody being afraid.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:53.800 align:middle line:84%
The power elite wouldn't
want us to be afraid

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:57.610 align:middle line:84%
because then we're going
to spend more time at work.

00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:59.590 align:middle line:84%
We're going to pay
our taxes instead

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:01.311 align:middle line:90%
of not paying our taxes.

00:18:01.311 --> 00:18:03.560 align:middle line:84%
If we're afraid, we're going
to worry about our money,

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.768 align:middle line:90%
we're not going to pay taxes.

00:18:04.768 --> 00:18:11.410 align:middle line:84%
So why wouldn't we be better off
for these corrupt power elite

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:12.740 align:middle line:90%
if we were not in fear?

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Why does it seem like they
want us to be in fear?

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:20.110 align:middle line:84%
What benefit do they
get out of that.?

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:22.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Well,
there are many ways

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:26.400 align:middle line:84%
to look at that that all
important, I would say.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.160 align:middle line:84%
For example, when we're in
the presence of violence

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.560 align:middle line:84%
but it's not being
done upon us, we

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.750 align:middle line:84%
are doused with
these endorphins,

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:37.980 align:middle line:84%
which are 10,000 times
as powerful as morphine.

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:40.140 align:middle line:90%
It's like getting a heroin fix.

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:42.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: 10,000 times?

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Yes, 10,000 times.

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Say that again.

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:47.970 align:middle line:84%
So we're seeing violence
in front of us--

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:49.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Right, on the TV.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And we're
getting high from that?

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:52.851 align:middle line:90%
10,000 times more than heroin?

00:18:52.851 --> 00:18:53.850 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: That's right.

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:55.609 align:middle line:90%
Well, than--

00:18:55.609 --> 00:18:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Morphine, which
is a heroin derivative--

00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:58.691 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Morphine, yes.

00:18:58.691 --> 00:18:59.564 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: An opiate.

00:18:59.564 --> 00:19:00.540 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Yeah.

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Where did
this come from?

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:03.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Well, we get
very small amounts of it

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:07.410 align:middle line:84%
that are created by
our bodies in order

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:15.480 align:middle line:84%
to numb us so that we can
deal with the fear better.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.510 align:middle line:90%
And so we get--

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:17.310 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: I'm sorry.

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:19.410 align:middle line:84%
Just tell me where
did you hear this?

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:20.612 align:middle line:90%
Is this a scientific study?

00:19:20.612 --> 00:19:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Because I know with
you it's all science.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Oh, yes.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:26.640 align:middle line:84%
This is common
medical knowledge.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.760 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have to have
a lot of something that

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.430 align:middle line:84%
is 10,000 times as
powerful as morphine

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:35.479 align:middle line:84%
in order to tranquilize
the body and numb it.

00:19:35.479 --> 00:19:37.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You're
saying gram for gram,

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:41.280 align:middle line:84%
this neurochemical is 10,000
times more potent than morphine

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.860 align:middle line:84%
in the brain, its existence
in the brain drop for drop.

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Neurologically,
the docking sites in the cell

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.840 align:middle line:90%
structure of the body.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:52.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: There's opiate
receptors, so-called.

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:56.380 align:middle line:84%
This is generic throughout
the whole body and heart.

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:59.400 align:middle line:90%
It's very general.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So we're watching a
scary movie or a movie that

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:02.800 align:middle line:90%
has violence in it.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:03.831 align:middle line:90%
We see graphic violence.

00:20:03.831 --> 00:20:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
things here at Gaiam

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.290 align:middle line:84%
is we do not have violent
programming on the network

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:09.090 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:11.010 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
take in a movie that's

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:13.770 align:middle line:90%
got graphic violence, period.

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:16.830 align:middle line:84%
But let's say that
you are watching that,

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:19.360 align:middle line:90%
even if it's a movie.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.910 align:middle line:84%
You're saying, we're getting
high from that similar

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:23.147 align:middle line:90%
to drugs.

00:20:23.147 --> 00:20:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Well, we
get the same thing

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:27.280 align:middle line:84%
from eating a meat
and potatoes diet.

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:30.760 align:middle line:84%
The two starch and
protein cancel out

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.280 align:middle line:84%
with the type of
digestive juices

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:37.440 align:middle line:84%
that that would otherwise
help them to be assimilated.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.610 align:middle line:90%
And it drugs us.

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:42.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's like having a couple of
beers or something like that.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:47.320 align:middle line:84%
We're actually-- by being
exposed to gratuitous violence

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:51.580 align:middle line:84%
in the media and
everywhere we look--

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:54.280 align:middle line:84%
being told that there's all
these terrible things going on

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:55.420 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And "The Iron Mountain
Report," these top people

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:04.030 align:middle line:84%
came up with the idea of
can we live without war?

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And they said, no, you've
got to keep making wars

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:07.570 align:middle line:90%
so people are traumatized.

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:10.870 align:middle line:84%
That's part of the
Tavistock Institute studies.

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:14.270 align:middle line:84%
They say it's
operant conditioning.

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:15.640 align:middle line:90%
So you have wars.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.210 align:middle line:90%
People are traumatized.

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:18.160 align:middle line:90%
They shut down.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And they just think
about, I just want peace.

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:27.670 align:middle line:84%
So I think about how for me and
my family-- or of nobody else,

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:28.840 align:middle line:90%
just me--

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:29.980 align:middle line:90%
I want peace.

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:32.800 align:middle line:84%
I want to not have to deal
with all this conflict

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.630 align:middle line:90%
and terror and everything else.

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:38.800 align:middle line:84%
So by creating fear
systematically,

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:42.040 align:middle line:84%
the society is essentially
addicted to heroin,

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:43.270 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:46.060 align:middle line:90%
So now if you expose somebody--

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:52.210 align:middle line:84%
like if violence is
being done to one of us,

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:54.850 align:middle line:84%
we're doused with
what's called naloxone.

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:57.656 align:middle line:84%
We become paralyzed
with fear and terror.

00:21:57.656 --> 00:21:59.406 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: If it's being
done to us, instead

00:21:59.406 --> 00:22:00.370 align:middle line:90%
of if we're seeing it.

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Right.

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:02.927 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: And so of course--

00:22:02.927 --> 00:22:04.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And naloxone
is a neurotransmitter?

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:05.830 align:middle line:90%
It's part of our body?

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: It's another
essential neurotransmitter.

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:14.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's like when a cat
gets a mouse finally,

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:18.100 align:middle line:90%
and the mouse freezes up.

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:20.710 align:middle line:84%
It's a predator
prey thing, often.

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Or we have terrible hiking
or mountaineering accident

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:27.850 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:29.740 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise we would be
in tremendous pain,

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:33.040 align:middle line:84%
but instead we get doused
with these neurochemicals,

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:37.780 align:middle line:84%
and we can, in this case,
have more endorphins

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:40.270 align:middle line:84%
and feel no pain so that
we can have the strength

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:42.920 align:middle line:84%
to get ourselves out
of that situation.

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.240 align:middle line:84%
But if you're going to be eaten
alive, like a gazelle has been

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.850 align:middle line:84%
captured by a lion or
something like that,

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:52.020 align:middle line:84%
it's natural to want
to numb the body

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:54.510 align:middle line:84%
in that terror and
that paralysis,

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:57.570 align:middle line:84%
and naloxone serves
that purpose also.

00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:00.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So this is where
the concept of animals

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.010 align:middle line:84%
that are being slaughtered
by another animal

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:05.510 align:middle line:84%
are in sort of an ecstatic
state as it happens.

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:08.300 align:middle line:84%
They get in almost like
a psychedelic trance.

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:09.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Exactly.

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:09.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:11.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And the notion
I've used in my show,

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:15.990 align:middle line:84%
Wisdom Teachings, of the
snake, that it actually--

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:20.030 align:middle line:84%
that the mouse ultimately
is hypnotized by the fear

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:23.620 align:middle line:84%
to such a degree that it just
drops over and it just lets

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:26.080 align:middle line:84%
the snake eat it, and it doesn't
appear to be feeling pain

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.039 align:middle line:90%
once that happens.

00:23:27.039 --> 00:23:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: And there are
many dimensions of that.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Nature photographers have
seen fish actually leap

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:34.600 align:middle line:84%
into the talons of
eagles and hawks.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:35.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.997 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Imagine if you've
been swimming around as a fish

00:23:37.997 --> 00:23:39.580 align:middle line:84%
and you're really
not afraid of death.

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:41.830 align:middle line:84%
You don't really
know what it is.

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:43.600 align:middle line:84%
You haven't remembered
that maybe you've

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:47.590 align:middle line:84%
been living and dying as
a fish for many lifetimes.

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:49.090 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:51.670 align:middle line:10%
But you see this
thing flying around

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:54.280 align:middle line:10%
above the surface of the
water, you figure, hey,

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.890 align:middle line:10%
if I let that thing
eat me, maybe I

00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:58.990 align:middle line:10%
could become an eagle too.

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:00.250 align:middle line:90%
I mean, who knows?

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:02.230 align:middle line:10%
People talk about
coral, the psychology

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:05.800 align:middle line:10%
of coral in the ocean that
way, that every generation

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:09.710 align:middle line:10%
dies and becomes the foundation
for the next generation.

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:13.110 align:middle line:10%
And so death and birth, that's
the myth of the Phoenix,

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:15.370 align:middle line:10%
for she is herself
and not herself

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:18.490 align:middle line:10%
having gained eternal life
by the blessing of death.

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:22.840 align:middle line:84%
For she is her own father
and mother and heir, sister,

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.490 align:middle line:90%
and brother.

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And so we have this
transpersonal level where we're

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:31.420 align:middle line:90%
really not separate entities.

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And by living and dying, and
being consumed by nature,

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.920 align:middle line:84%
the universe is actually
giving birth to us

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.900 align:middle line:90%
and then it's killing us.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.780 align:middle line:84%
Our nervous systems
wear out and we die back

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:47.470 align:middle line:84%
into the substrate
from which we arose.

00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:51.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Why do you think people
are so distraught about death?

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:57.970 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting to note
that if a group of people

00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:02.660 align:middle line:84%
die in a creative way,
like an airplane crash,

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:04.940 align:middle line:90%
that captures our attention.

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:08.210 align:middle line:84%
But people are dying in
automobile crashes all the time

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:10.340 align:middle line:90%
and that number is much greater.

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:14.660 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think we're
drawn to creative deaths?

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:17.150 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think we're
so afraid of death?

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:20.487 align:middle line:84%
Why is it so
objectionable to us?

00:25:20.487 --> 00:25:22.195 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Well, if
we're in this context

00:25:22.195 --> 00:25:27.110 align:middle line:84%
that we've been talking about
in the last series, this context

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:31.760 align:middle line:84%
of pure consciousness that is
imageless, it doesn't suffer.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.200 align:middle line:90%
It's constant.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:36.950 align:middle line:84%
It's the one thing
that seems to persist.

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And in my near death
experience at age four,

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:41.990 align:middle line:84%
I existed without a
body, heart, or mind.

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:46.250 align:middle line:84%
My human, mortal body,
heart, and mind fell away,

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:48.140 align:middle line:84%
and I was just
formless consciousness,

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:50.180 align:middle line:90%
objectless consciousness.

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:52.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I want to talk to
you about that a lot more.

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: And so
what I experienced,

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:57.290 align:middle line:84%
and many thousands of
other children and adults

00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:59.150 align:middle line:84%
have experienced now--
millions of people

00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:03.050 align:middle line:84%
have reported-- there is
this sense that death is not

00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:06.790 align:middle line:84%
the end, that instead death
is formless consciousness.

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:09.740 align:middle line:84%
It's just where all the
objects and contentiousness

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:12.830 align:middle line:84%
of life, all the
imagination that we

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:16.980 align:middle line:84%
have identified with as who we
are and what we're here about--

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:20.990 align:middle line:84%
all of that just falls away, and
there's this constant context

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:23.270 align:middle line:90%
which cannot die.

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:26.390 align:middle line:84%
They say it's called
deathless consciousness.

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And we're able to share
that consciousness while

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:32.750 align:middle line:84%
in these bodies in a completely
joyful and liberated way

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:34.580 align:middle line:90%
by just noticing it.

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And your 50 trillion
cells and mine,

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:38.570 align:middle line:84%
when they notice it
together, or of you've

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:41.450 align:middle line:84%
got a group of
eight to 50 people

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:46.190 align:middle line:84%
noticing that, we're each
leveraged into that magnitude

00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:50.300 align:middle line:84%
of multiple
consciousnesses noticing

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.670 align:middle line:84%
this essential nature
of consciousness itself

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:54.740 align:middle line:90%
that we all are made out of.

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And we are lifted
into the consciousness

00:26:56.990 --> 00:27:01.700 align:middle line:84%
of that multiples of this
one mortal consciousness

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.430 align:middle line:84%
that we're used to
as 50 trillion cells.

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:06.862 align:middle line:84%
So we're 100
trillion cells here.

00:27:06.862 --> 00:27:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And by really paying attention,
and people paying attention

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:11.900 align:middle line:84%
to us in the viewing
audience, they're

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:13.760 align:middle line:84%
linking up with our
100 trillion cells

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.220 align:middle line:90%
with their 50 trillion cells.

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:19.412 align:middle line:84%
And so there are 150 trillion
cells with us right now,

00:27:19.412 --> 00:27:20.870 align:middle line:84%
and there's a sense
of being lifted

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:23.960 align:middle line:84%
into a higher intelligence,
more heightened level

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:24.987 align:middle line:90%
of sensitivity.

00:27:24.987 --> 00:27:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's why people
are watching us,

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:30.050 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, because there's more
wisdom, more insightfulness,

00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:34.430 align:middle line:84%
more feeling, more
to be known here

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:37.670 align:middle line:90%
in our combined consciousness.

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:39.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Sperry, I
want to thank you.

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.255 align:middle line:84%
We'll have another episode
coming up right away here.

00:27:42.255 --> 00:27:43.130 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Wonderful.

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:44.800 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, David.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.950 align:middle line:90%
