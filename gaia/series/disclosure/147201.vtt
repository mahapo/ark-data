00:00:15.246 --> 00:00:16.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID WILCOCK:
Welcome to Disclosure.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, David Wilcock.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And boy, do we have a
show for you this time.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.220 align:middle line:84%
The really cool thing
about Rich Dolan,

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.380 align:middle line:84%
who I'm interviewing
in this episode,

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.080 align:middle line:84%
is that he was at a very
groundbreaking event called

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.210 align:middle line:84%
The Citizens' Hearing
for Disclosure,

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.220 align:middle line:84%
or CHD, organized by the
attorney Stephen Bassett.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.850 align:middle line:84%
At that hearing,
probably the star witness

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.770 align:middle line:84%
was the former Canadian
Defense Minister Paul Hellyer.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And he's openly
coming out and saying

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.790 align:middle line:84%
that multiple groups
of extraterrestrials

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.230 align:middle line:84%
are interacting with the
Earth, that some of them

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.590 align:middle line:84%
have actually been allowed
to walk around on Earth.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.290 align:middle line:84%
They look basically like us
but they're a little taller

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.540 align:middle line:90%
and they have paler skin.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And Rich Dolan published
a video interview

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.680 align:middle line:84%
that is also discussed
in the citizens' hearing

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.010 align:middle line:84%
with an insider
who was apparently

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.920 align:middle line:84%
given the task of
potentially doing

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.920 align:middle line:84%
a military invasion of Area 51
by the President of the United

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.330 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.300 align:middle line:84%
If that doesn't get you
excited, nothing will.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.150 align:middle line:84%
Now you can go watch that
original video interview

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.270 align:middle line:84%
online, and we'll give you the
instructions in the interview

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.750 align:middle line:90%
of how to do that.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.010 align:middle line:84%
But here we're discussing the
information that was given

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.260 align:middle line:90%
and the greater implications.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.620 align:middle line:84%
This is very, very
interesting UFO information.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And because of these
high level appearances,

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.950 align:middle line:84%
Rich Dolan has now risen
right to the top of the crop

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.140 align:middle line:90%
in the field of ufology.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.060 align:middle line:90%
So check it out.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.790 align:middle line:90%
All right, Rich, welcome back.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.250 align:middle line:84%
The gods have granted us
another episode, so here we are.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.208 align:middle line:90%
>>RICH DOLAN: Fabulous.

00:01:58.208 --> 00:02:02.260 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: So I was really
interested by the reference

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.050 align:middle line:10%
that you made to a
breakaway civilization.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.729 align:middle line:84%
Up until now, what
we've discussed

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.870 align:middle line:84%
is, just to go through it
in chronological sequence,

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.780 align:middle line:84%
we had three months after the
US is thrown into World War II,

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.360 align:middle line:84%
and we've got all these
tensions on the west coast

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.400 align:middle line:84%
because a major military base in
Hawaii has been blown to hell.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.090 align:middle line:84%
There's Japanese
boats off the coast.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And then this gigantic
craft comes in,

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.860 align:middle line:84%
seems to have a bubble
force field around it,

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.080 align:middle line:84%
and they're shooting these
massive artillery rounds at it.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.930 align:middle line:90%
You said it was 1,000--

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.444 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: 1,430.

00:02:42.444 --> 00:02:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: That's a lot.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yeah.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And those are
not quiet when they shoot.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.400 align:middle line:90%
It's a very loud--

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.720 align:middle line:84%
and so everybody's
going outside.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.470 align:middle line:84%
A whole entire city
of millions of people,

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.270 align:middle line:84%
going outside saying,
what the heck is going on?

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.470 align:middle line:90%
And people are seeing what?

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.210 align:middle line:10%
>>DOLAN: Well, they're seeing--

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.340 align:middle line:10%
many of them are
seeing an object.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.040 align:middle line:10%
That's the whole point
of this, that they're

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.110 align:middle line:10%
trying to shoot down.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And it's a
flying craft in the sky.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Yes, it's an
object of some sort.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.349 align:middle line:90%
And it was of substantial size.

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:16.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: How big, do you think?

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.098 align:middle line:10%
>>DOLAN: Well, I'm
trying to recall

00:03:18.098 --> 00:03:21.477 align:middle line:10%
what the estimate
would be, maybe 30 feet

00:03:21.477 --> 00:03:22.810 align:middle line:10%
diameter or something like that.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.900 align:middle line:10%
I recall there was
analysis done by, I think,

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.050 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Bruce Maccabee.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm getting
my facts straight,

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.310 align:middle line:84%
I think he estimated it might've
been about 30 feet in diameter.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.222 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Decent size.

00:03:34.222 --> 00:03:35.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So that
shows that there's

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.860 align:middle line:84%
defensive locations for this
phenomenon that was really just

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.170 align:middle line:90%
getting started at the time.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And then we didn't
talk about this,

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.980 align:middle line:84%
but of course, the infamous
Kenneth Arnold sightings, 1947.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.980 align:middle line:84%
So why don't you briefly
go through that for us?

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, Kennedy Arnold
is a big part of what kicked off

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.240 align:middle line:90%
the whole flying saucer mania.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And our awareness
of flying saucers

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.510 align:middle line:90%
comes from Kenneth Arnold.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.790 align:middle line:10%
He was a private pilot
living in the state of Idaho.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.490 align:middle line:10%
He later, by the way,
became a candidate

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.110 align:middle line:10%
for lieutenant
governor of Idaho.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.360 align:middle line:84%
He was actually a very
respectable businessman.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.920 align:middle line:90%
People liked him.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.610 align:middle line:84%
He was flying an aircraft
in search of-- an airplane

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.620 align:middle line:84%
had gone down in the mountainous
region, the Yakima Mountains,

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.120 align:middle line:90%
and he was looking for a reward.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.600 align:middle line:84%
He was looking
for them and there

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.290 align:middle line:90%
was a reward to find them.

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:35.050 align:middle line:84%
So while he was out there, he
sees nine bright, reflective

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:41.110 align:middle line:84%
objects moving at a very high
rate of speed in that region.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, they looked
unlike anything-- they

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.750 align:middle line:84%
looked almost, he said, like
a kind of a crescent-shaped

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.190 align:middle line:90%
is what he could detect.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.790 align:middle line:84%
They didn't look like
anything that we were making.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.150 align:middle line:84%
His thought might be that
this is an experimental type

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.017 align:middle line:90%
of aircraft.

00:04:56.017 --> 00:04:57.850 align:middle line:84%
They're moving at a
very high rate of speed,

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:58.849 align:middle line:90%
as far as he could tell.

00:04:58.849 --> 00:04:59.730 align:middle line:90%
He tried calculating.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.820 align:middle line:84%
He gauged it on the basis
of two known landmarks

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.190 align:middle line:84%
that he knew were
50 miles apart.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And his conservative
calculation, he said,

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.140 align:middle line:84%
was that they were moving
at 1,200 miles per hour.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.270 align:middle line:84%
The less conservative
calculation

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.990 align:middle line:84%
moved it closer to
2,000, like 1,700.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.697 align:middle line:90%
So he lands, he talks about it.

00:05:18.697 --> 00:05:19.530 align:middle line:90%
There's press there.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.070 align:middle line:84%
He talks to the press,
and it gets out.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And he said that they
looked like saucers

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.860 align:middle line:90%
skipping along the water.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.090 align:middle line:90%
That was their motion.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And they became known
as flying saucers.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.360 align:middle line:90%
That's how that phrase--

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.390 align:middle line:90%
So Arnold kicked it off.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Actually, there was a
separate witness that same day

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.610 align:middle line:84%
to what appears to be
probably the same phenomenon,

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.150 align:middle line:90%
a guy named Fred Johnson.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.820 align:middle line:90%
He was interviewed by the FBI.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.250 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, that kicks off the
whole flying saucer mania.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And what you have
is for weeks, people

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.880 align:middle line:90%
are seeing these objects.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.130 align:middle line:84%
Now one skeptical
way to look at it

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.290 align:middle line:84%
would be that,
well, you know, it

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.820 align:middle line:84%
becomes this media hysteria and
everyone's now hallucinating.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.690 align:middle line:84%
But actually it's not
the case, because we

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.140 align:middle line:84%
have a number of military
sightings of these objects

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.980 align:middle line:84%
very, very well attested
to, including of what later

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.420 align:middle line:90%
became Edwards Air Force Base.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.097 align:middle line:84%
At the time it was
called Muroc Airfield.

00:06:19.097 --> 00:06:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And that was around the
time of the Roswell crash.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.670 align:middle line:84%
It was this major
sighting at Muroc seen

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.356 align:middle line:90%
by a lot of military witnesses.

00:06:26.356 --> 00:06:27.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: What did they see?

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.896 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well,
there were actually

00:06:28.896 --> 00:06:31.530 align:middle line:84%
four separate
sightings on that day.

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:38.640 align:middle line:10%
It was July 8th, 1947
throughout the late morning,

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.360 align:middle line:10%
early afternoon.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So this is the day
after the Roswell crash.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.198 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Yeah, I have to wonder
if there is a relationship.

00:06:45.198 --> 00:06:47.820 align:middle line:84%
There were many, many sightings
in the American Southwest

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.992 align:middle line:90%
and out in the west.

00:06:50.992 --> 00:06:53.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Because Kenneth
Arnold's happened late June,

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.770 align:middle line:84%
and then you got Roswell
just a couple weeks later.

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: All very condensed.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:59.640 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, the
sightings never stopped.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:06.161 align:middle line:84%
You know, they've
continued in waves.

00:07:06.161 --> 00:07:08.160 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you get more,
sometimes you get fewer.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.040 align:middle line:84%
But this has just been
something that's been with us.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And by the way,
before Kenneth Arnold,

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.610 align:middle line:84%
we now know there were
a number of really

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.269 align:middle line:84%
excellent, well-documented
UFO sightings.

00:07:17.269 --> 00:07:18.810 align:middle line:84%
In Europe the year
before, there were

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.280 align:middle line:90%
what were called ghost rockets.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.655 align:middle line:84%
That was the name
they gave them.

00:07:21.655 --> 00:07:25.010 align:middle line:84%
But these were essentially
UFOs over Scandinavia

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.220 align:middle line:90%
and going into a lot of Europe.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.244 align:middle line:84%
This is something that's
just been with us.

00:07:29.244 --> 00:07:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And then the farther
back you go--

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.710 align:middle line:84%
I was in the Canadian National
Archives a few years ago,

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:38.850 align:middle line:84%
and I found an
unbelievable case from 1936

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:43.249 align:middle line:84%
by an elderly man writing in the
1980s about his event from all

00:07:43.249 --> 00:07:44.790 align:middle line:84%
these years before,
when he was doing

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.910 align:middle line:84%
aerial mapping for the Canadian
government in the Northwest

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:49.040 align:middle line:90%
Territories.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.420 align:middle line:84%
Now in 1936, this is
like the first time

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.601 align:middle line:84%
you could actually
get aerial topography

00:07:53.601 --> 00:07:54.600 align:middle line:90%
over that remote region.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.450 align:middle line:84%
So his job-- cool job
when you're 25 years old--

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:01.380 align:middle line:84%
fly over this region with
camera, take pictures.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And he had an aircraft
that could land on water.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:09.210 align:middle line:84%
So he said you know, I was
performing a preflight check

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:11.640 align:middle line:84%
of my aircraft when,
for whatever reason,

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.070 align:middle line:90%
I happened to look up--

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:15.180 align:middle line:84%
and he saw it-- and
there I saw the most

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.610 align:middle line:84%
magnificent configuration of
an airship one could imagine.

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:20.640 align:middle line:90%
It was slightly elongated.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.020 align:middle line:90%
It made no sound.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:26.520 align:middle line:84%
Turned from north south, to
east west and just instantly

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.380 align:middle line:90%
accelerated, was gone.

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.415 align:middle line:90%
No sound.

00:08:30.415 --> 00:08:32.789 align:middle line:84%
The man submitted his military
records to the government.

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:36.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was on level, and it
was a really remarkable thing.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.710 align:middle line:84%
Now this is truly the
middle of nowhere.

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:43.155 align:middle line:84%
Where this guy was was so remote
no one lives there to this day.

00:08:43.155 --> 00:08:44.280 align:middle line:90%
There's just nothing there.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.446 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of fish there.

00:08:45.446 --> 00:08:47.460 align:middle line:84%
If you're a hardy soul
you can go up and fish,

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.730 align:middle line:90%
but there's no cities, nothing.

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:52.532 align:middle line:84%
And yet there was
something there.

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
to me about that--

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean to
get too off track

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.268 align:middle line:84%
here, but it's just
a fascinating thing--

00:08:57.268 --> 00:08:59.759 align:middle line:90%


00:08:59.759 --> 00:09:01.800 align:middle line:84%
you know, he's all alone,
and there's this thing.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.950 align:middle line:90%
It's right there with him.

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:08.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, can we not assume
that it was observing him?

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And can we also wonder if there
was a mind-to-mind connection

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:12.930 align:middle line:90%
here?

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.393 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
new things about--

00:09:15.393 --> 00:09:16.193 align:middle line:90%
not new.

00:09:16.193 --> 00:09:18.609 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the things that,
in the last several years,

00:09:18.609 --> 00:09:20.850 align:middle line:84%
has really, engaged
me in this phenomenon,

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:24.630 align:middle line:90%
is this mind aspect to it.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:28.710 align:middle line:84%
You know something made him
look up, and there it was.

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And one finds in the
research over and over again.

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:34.920 align:middle line:84%
Someone will have an urge
to get up in bed at 2:00

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.628 align:middle line:84%
in the morning and
look out their window,

00:09:36.628 --> 00:09:38.160 align:middle line:84%
and they see an
orange glowing orb.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.360 align:middle line:90%
What's up with that?

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.860 align:middle line:84%
Clearly there's
something happening.

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.930 align:middle line:90%
They can get into our heads.

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:45.990 align:middle line:84%
We can communicate in some
way or another with it.

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very important
part of the phenomenon as well.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So kids who have
been raised on the internet

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:57.920 align:middle line:84%
probably don't have
the history of damage

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.530 align:middle line:84%
of what appears to have been
a psychological operation

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:06.150 align:middle line:84%
to instantly
demonize, de-humanize,

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:09.570 align:middle line:84%
and ridicule anyone
who is a believer.

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:11.204 align:middle line:90%
So do you think that--

00:10:11.204 --> 00:10:12.870 align:middle line:84%
because we were talking
about last time,

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:14.130 align:middle line:84%
you started to
mention the concept

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:15.330 align:middle line:90%
of breakaway civilizations.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:15.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Oh, yeah.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:16.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Do you think there's
a psychological operation that

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:19.490 align:middle line:90%
was done?

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:21.950 align:middle line:84%
Is there any evidence of that
in the documents you saw?

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:23.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Well, right.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:27.170 align:middle line:84%
So there is definitely a
psychological operation

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:30.290 align:middle line:84%
that's being done in every
level of our society.

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:32.976 align:middle line:84%
Look, when you have this many
people owning this much stuff,

00:10:32.976 --> 00:10:34.850 align:middle line:84%
they're going to want
to keep things that way

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:37.400 align:middle line:84%
for as long as possible,
and that means PSYOPS.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:41.035 align:middle line:84%
That means through control
of propaganda media.

00:10:41.035 --> 00:10:43.160 align:middle line:84%
That means through distractions
and mindless public

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.760 align:middle line:84%
entertainment and everything
else that goes along with that.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.190 align:middle line:84%
So now relating to
the UFO phenomenon,

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.380 align:middle line:84%
absolutely there's been a
psychological operation.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.779 align:middle line:90%


00:10:53.779 --> 00:10:55.070 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we know this is a fact.

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:57.530 align:middle line:10%
We know that back
even in the 1970s,

00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:00.500 align:middle line:10%
Carl Bernstein, the
journalist of Watergate fame,

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:05.900 align:middle line:10%
made the scoop that there were
hundreds of CIA connections

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:10.250 align:middle line:10%
within US mainstream journalism,
and he laid this out.

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And then the CIA
quickly said, well,

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.970 align:middle line:84%
we don't do that anymore in
their very legalistic fashion.

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:15.770 align:middle line:90%
Of course they do.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And of course journalists
jump over each other

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:19.550 align:middle line:84%
to have a relationship
with the CIA.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:23.000 align:middle line:84%
The fact is that there's
been an agenda since forever

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.550 align:middle line:84%
on this phenomenon, since
they became interested

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:29.030 align:middle line:84%
in it, to disable it to
the maximum extent possible

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:32.840 align:middle line:84%
because they don't want
people taking this seriously.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.450 align:middle line:84%
The problem is we're
now in an era--

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:39.830 align:middle line:84%
we're in an internet era, and
what's become clearly evident

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:42.650 align:middle line:84%
is that people are fascinated
by this phenomenon,

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:46.750 align:middle line:84%
and they've never truly
accepted the statements that

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:47.750 align:middle line:90%
are coming down to them.

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:50.240 align:middle line:84%
So we have this whole
alternate culture now

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.319 align:middle line:84%
that has been developing
over the past 20 years,

00:11:52.319 --> 00:11:54.110 align:middle line:84%
where people are more
and more free to talk

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:56.540 align:middle line:90%
to each other about this.

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:58.580 align:middle line:84%
So what we have are
really-- we have what

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:00.290 align:middle line:84%
I sometimes call
official culture.

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:01.899 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
supposed to believe.

00:12:01.899 --> 00:12:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
unofficial culture,

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.484 align:middle line:84%
which is what people really
believe and talk about.

00:12:06.484 --> 00:12:08.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, you
were right there next

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.024 align:middle line:84%
to the former Canadian
Minister of Defense

00:12:10.024 --> 00:12:11.690 align:middle line:84%
at the Citizens'
Hearing for Disclosure.

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:12.801 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Oh, indeed.

00:12:12.801 --> 00:12:14.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Tell us
about Paul Hellyer.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.330 align:middle line:10%
What's his deal?

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.800 align:middle line:10%
This is a high-level
government official, right?

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.420 align:middle line:10%
>>DOLAN: He's a fascinating man.

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.676 align:middle line:10%
He's in his 90s now,
and you talk to him

00:12:22.676 --> 00:12:24.140 align:middle line:10%
and he sounds like he's 65.

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:25.590 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he's a remarkable guy.

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:26.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: He's in his 90s.

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:27.140 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:28.460 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yeah, just past 90.

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:29.750 align:middle line:90%
It's just amazing.

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:31.760 align:middle line:84%
Paul Hellyer was the
Minister of Defense

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:36.584 align:middle line:84%
of Canada during the 1960s,
and in addition to that,

00:12:36.584 --> 00:12:38.750 align:middle line:84%
was just a very prominent
politician for many years,

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:40.340 align:middle line:90%
member of parliament.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And I was actually
on at the event

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:48.170 align:middle line:84%
where, in 2005, Paul Hellyer
came out, as it were,

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:51.920 align:middle line:84%
to talk about his
conviction and his knowledge

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.380 align:middle line:84%
that the UFO
phenomenon was real.

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And now for the
past decade, he's

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.500 align:middle line:84%
been out there
talking about this.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:01.880 align:middle line:84%
I was with Paul at the Citizen
Hearing on Disclosure in 2013

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:05.390 align:middle line:84%
in Washington, DC, where
we gave a week of testimony

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:09.200 align:middle line:84%
to retired members of Congress
about this phenomenon, which

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.110 align:middle line:84%
was-- that was a great
moment in my life

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:13.820 align:middle line:90%
personally to be part of that.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:16.960 align:middle line:90%
But Paul Hellyer is a man who--

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So he was the
defense minister, right?

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:22.165 align:middle line:84%
He's responsible
for keeping Canada

00:13:22.165 --> 00:13:26.167 align:middle line:84%
safe from any enemy, the number
one guy for defense in Canada.

00:13:26.167 --> 00:13:28.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, what I
learned--this is interesting

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:31.400 align:middle line:84%
you say this, because that
was always my assumption.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And what a Canadian
explained to me

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:36.720 align:middle line:84%
is that during
that period of time

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.817 align:middle line:84%
there were actually
two true ministers

00:13:39.817 --> 00:13:40.900 align:middle line:90%
of defense of the country.

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:42.066 align:middle line:90%
They actually split the job.

00:13:42.066 --> 00:13:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And Paul Hellyer-- the
impression that I get--it's not

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:47.450 align:middle line:84%
that he was totally
out of all the loops.

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:48.680 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:53.930 align:middle line:84%
But he was more of the public
face of minister of defense.

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And there actually
was another gentleman,

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:59.470 align:middle line:84%
whose name I cannot remember
off the top of my head,

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:02.480 align:middle line:84%
who was doing a lot of the nuts
and bolts defense of Canada.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.740 align:middle line:90%
Kind of a weird situation.

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:05.960 align:middle line:84%
But no, it is true,
Paul Hellyer was

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:09.440 align:middle line:84%
Minister of Defense of Canada
and was absolutely privy

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.940 align:middle line:84%
to a tremendous
amount of information.

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So he's not out
there, starting in 2005,

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.440 align:middle line:84%
he's not saying, gee, I
wonder if they're real,

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.270 align:middle line:84%
or some UFO sightings
might be real.

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:23.630 align:middle line:84%
He's saying, look, I've
got absolute confirmation.

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:26.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, it's
interesting, because he's always

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:28.130 align:middle line:84%
claimed that while
in his capacity

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:31.250 align:middle line:84%
as minister of defense, that
UFO data did not really come

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:35.360 align:middle line:84%
across his desk, which I find
a little odd because there was

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.000 align:middle line:84%
a lot of very
interesting UFO cases

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.500 align:middle line:90%
that Canada had at that time.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.600 align:middle line:84%
But what he has said,
has always maintained,

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:46.220 align:middle line:84%
is that in his retirement
he used his position

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:50.215 align:middle line:84%
to speak with high level
US defense officials.

00:14:50.215 --> 00:14:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And actually the thing that
triggered him, he says,

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.790 align:middle line:84%
is reading Philip Corso's
book, "The Day After Roswell."

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:59.060 align:middle line:10%
And Corso, for people
watching may not know,

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:04.130 align:middle line:10%
was a retired US
colonel who stated

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:07.220 align:middle line:10%
that he was part of the team
that segway Roswell technology

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:08.720 align:middle line:10%
to private defense.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And Hellyer read this
book and basically

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.070 align:middle line:84%
had this oh my
god moment, I need

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:14.880 align:middle line:84%
to know more, made
some phone calls,

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.880 align:middle line:84%
talked to a number of
prominent people who said,

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.170 align:middle line:90%
yes, that is true.

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:20.670 align:middle line:84%
So that's actually where
Paul Hellyer is coming from.

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:22.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Corso has
this cardboard box

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:25.340 align:middle line:84%
filled with things in
it like little wafers

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.560 align:middle line:84%
the size of a quarter
that are actually

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.500 align:middle line:84%
integrated circuits, computer
chips, before we ever had them.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And he starts farming it out to
companies like Monsanto and IBM

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.857 align:middle line:84%
and says, hey, it's
foreign technology.

00:15:35.857 --> 00:15:37.190 align:middle line:90%
We got it from France, you know.

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:38.369 align:middle line:90%
Just go have fun.

00:15:38.369 --> 00:15:40.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: I guess we
could say more or less.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:43.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It was a big
story at the time.

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:45.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I remember I got
"The Day After Roswell"

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:46.940 align:middle line:90%
as soon as it came out.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:50.930 align:middle line:10%
>>DOLAN: As did I. You know, the
original version of that book

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:53.440 align:middle line:10%
had the forward by US
Senator Strom Thurmond.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:53.820 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: I've got that version.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:54.620 align:middle line:10%
>>DOLAN: Yeah.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:55.500 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, exactly.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.420 align:middle line:10%
And it was kind of a
funny thing because Corso

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:02.640 align:middle line:10%
had been Thurman's military
liaison to the Pentagon.

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:05.670 align:middle line:90%
And I mean, Thurman loved him.

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:07.730 align:middle line:84%
So Corso writes this
book, doesn't tell Thurman

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:09.110 align:middle line:90%
that it's a UFO book.

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:11.060 align:middle line:84%
He says, hey, would
your write my foreword?

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And Thurman's like, sure,
I'll do that for you.

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:16.220 align:middle line:84%
Then here comes the media,
and Strom Thurmond's desk is--

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:19.010 align:middle line:84%
how old he is, maybe 123
years old at the time.

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:21.581 align:middle line:84%
And he has to say I don't
know nothing about no UFOs.

00:16:21.581 --> 00:16:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And they pulled that
foreword immediately.

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:24.663 align:middle line:90%
It was an embarrassment for him.

00:16:24.663 --> 00:16:26.390 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, he did,
and he said Corso's

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:28.700 align:middle line:90%
an American hero, stand up guy.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:32.170 align:middle line:84%
Which Corso had a lot of respect
from people in the military

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.170 align:middle line:84%
from everything that
they've been able to learn.

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:37.320 align:middle line:84%
He writes this book about
segwaying Roswell technology

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.320 align:middle line:90%
to the defense industry.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And seeing
the bodies from Roswell

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:43.400 align:middle line:90%
in these tubes with blue liquid.

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Yes, he claimed
that he saw one alien cadaver

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:50.630 align:middle line:84%
at Fort Riley, Kansas
back in 1947 on its way

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:53.030 align:middle line:84%
to, presumably,
Wright Patterson.

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:56.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you and I both know,
you read that book or you see

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.040 align:middle line:84%
some of the video
testimonials of Corso--

00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:02.120 align:middle line:84%
he's now deceased-- there's
very little doubt in your mind

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.099 align:middle line:84%
that this guy is
telling the truth.

00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:06.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: I would to say
that's my assessment.

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:08.450 align:middle line:90%
I never got to meet Corso.

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:12.710 align:middle line:84%
I have spoken to a number
of people who knew him.

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:17.760 align:middle line:84%
All but one, and that one being
John Alexander, said oh yeah,

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.040 align:middle line:90%
Corso's totally on the level.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.770 align:middle line:10%
They believed him.

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:24.530 align:middle line:10%
John Alexander is someone
that I've locked horns

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:26.660 align:middle line:10%
with for many years.

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.660 align:middle line:84%
I did a three-hour radio
debate with him one time,

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:32.210 align:middle line:84%
and I will say I
cleaned his clock.

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And if John is listening,
you know it's true.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:38.390 align:middle line:84%
But John Alexander
has always maintained

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:42.740 align:middle line:84%
Corso was either deluded
or mistaken or just

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:43.580 align:middle line:90%
fibbing or whatever.

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, let me
just toss in briefly

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:51.470 align:middle line:84%
that the way I got into all this
was that a close friend of mine

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:54.230 align:middle line:84%
got a disclosure from the
head of the physics department

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:56.250 align:middle line:90%
at his university.

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And this guy had worked for
NASA throughout the 1970s

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:00.500 align:middle line:90%
at the high levels.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And this friend comes back to
my room-- this was in 1990--

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:12.230 align:middle line:90%
it was early 1993--

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:15.770 align:middle line:84%
comes in, and he's just white
as a ghost, has me sit down,

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:18.480 align:middle line:90%
tells me UFOs are real.

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.280 align:middle line:90%
They crashed.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.270 align:middle line:90%
Roswell was real.

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:21.765 align:middle line:84%
We back engineered
the technology.

00:18:21.765 --> 00:18:23.426 align:middle line:90%
And I'm hearing this in '93.

00:18:23.426 --> 00:18:24.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Now who
is this guy now?

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.147 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: This is a friend of
mine when I was in college,

00:18:27.147 --> 00:18:28.730 align:middle line:84%
and the head of the
Physics department

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:30.884 align:middle line:84%
told him all this stuff
in a private meeting.

00:18:30.884 --> 00:18:32.300 align:middle line:84%
The head of the
Physics department

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:37.370 align:middle line:84%
openly says to the class,
yep, Roswell really happened,

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:39.290 align:middle line:84%
and the United
States government did

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:42.300 align:middle line:84%
a study that said that because
of "War of the Worlds,"

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.090 align:middle line:84%
the movie, that
there was a panic,

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:47.160 align:middle line:84%
that people would freak out if
they think there's an invasion,

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.087 align:middle line:84%
and that society
would break down.

00:18:49.087 --> 00:18:51.170 align:middle line:84%
So we concluded that we
have to protect the public

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:52.850 align:middle line:90%
and not tell them the truth.

00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And he just drops
this out there.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And in the levels of
NASA that I worked in,

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:58.790 align:middle line:90%
everybody knows it's true.

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:00.725 align:middle line:90%
And my buddy was the star pupil.

00:19:00.725 --> 00:19:01.600 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Fascinating.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So he gets a two-hour
teacher student conference

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:07.850 align:middle line:84%
afterwards and gets this
whole download, which was

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:09.710 align:middle line:90%
exactly what Corso had said.

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And I've got probably
at least 50 people

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:16.460 align:middle line:84%
I could tap as witnesses who
I told this story to years

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:17.670 align:middle line:90%
before Corso's book came out.

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:18.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Oh yeah.

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:19.270 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:22.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And Corso's book
did exactly the same thing.

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:24.380 align:middle line:84%
Even right down to the
types of technology.

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:31.310 align:middle line:84%
Lasers, LEDs, fiber
optics, Teflon, Kevlar,

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:34.350 align:middle line:84%
infrared night vision,
computer chips, of course.

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:35.150 align:middle line:90%
It's huge.

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:36.470 align:middle line:84%
It's like the whole basis--
so much of our technology.

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:38.469 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Our modern
civilization, so much of it.

00:19:38.469 --> 00:19:39.467 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:19:39.467 --> 00:19:40.550 align:middle line:90%
No, it's just fascinating.

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:43.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it just feels like we
live in this upside down kind

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:45.657 align:middle line:90%
of reality where--

00:19:45.657 --> 00:19:47.240 align:middle line:84%
you remember in
"Alice in Wonderland,"

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.539 align:middle line:90%
Alice goes down a little hole.

00:19:48.539 --> 00:19:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And she falls and falls
and falls and boom,

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:55.100 align:middle line:84%
and she's in this crazy
world, Wonderland.

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:56.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think that we
live in Wonderland,

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:58.420 align:middle line:84%
like when we turn
on our television

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:01.310 align:middle line:84%
or we listen to our
mainstream propaganda.

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:03.530 align:middle line:84%
That's the illusion
that we're given,

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:06.500 align:middle line:84%
when in reality, the real
world that we live in

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.600 align:middle line:84%
is the world they're
trying to tell us is fake.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:12.140 align:middle line:84%
The real world we live in has
these things that we call UFOs,

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:14.120 align:middle line:84%
and it has a lot of
other things as well

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.950 align:middle line:84%
that are officially being
denied over and over again.

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think it causes kind
of a cultural disease,

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:23.960 align:middle line:84%
almost, like a mental
disease, when you're

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.793 align:middle line:84%
living in the state of
denial where you have

00:20:25.793 --> 00:20:28.589 align:middle line:84%
to lie to yourself, because then
you don't trust your own eyes,

00:20:28.589 --> 00:20:29.630 align:middle line:90%
you don't trust evidence.

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:34.190 align:middle line:84%
You only trust what
you're being told.

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And that can't be
good for society.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, you got a guy
like Paul Hellyer, a star

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:42.590 align:middle line:90%
player in government coming out.

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And you're there with
him at this--now what is

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.040 align:middle line:90%
the disclosure hearing?

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.119 align:middle line:90%
What was happening?

00:20:47.119 --> 00:20:49.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Yeah, the Citizen
Hearing on Disclosure.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.890 align:middle line:10%
This was organized by
my colleague and friend

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:55.640 align:middle line:10%
Steven Bassett, who's been very
active in this type of issue

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.080 align:middle line:10%
for many years.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:01.630 align:middle line:84%
And Steve put together
a week-long series.

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:03.610 align:middle line:90%
It was like a week-long hearing.

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:05.540 align:middle line:84%
It was like a mock
Congressional hearing.

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And we had six retired
members of Congress,

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:09.792 align:middle line:90%
one senator who presided.

00:21:09.792 --> 00:21:11.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Were they
believers when this started?

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:12.874 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: No, they were not.

00:21:12.874 --> 00:21:14.450 align:middle line:90%
I think one might have been.

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:16.057 align:middle line:90%
That's the sense that I had.

00:21:16.057 --> 00:21:18.140 align:middle line:84%
The other five were
absolutely either on the fence

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:19.264 align:middle line:90%
or on the other side of it.

00:21:19.264 --> 00:21:22.940 align:middle line:84%
But they did it because they
got paid enough money to do it,

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:24.710 align:middle line:84%
you know, like all
right, we'll do this.

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:29.462 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happened was I
think I actually gave more--

00:21:29.462 --> 00:21:31.295 align:middle line:84%
I think I gave the most
testimony that week.

00:21:31.295 --> 00:21:35.580 align:middle line:84%
I gave six pieces of testimony,
and I led it off, in fact.

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And I was with Paul
during all of that.

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And our role was to present
as much compelling evidence

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.120 align:middle line:84%
on this phenomenon
as we were able to.

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.460 align:middle line:90%


00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And by the end of
that week, I mean,

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.940 align:middle line:84%
one of the fascinating things
about this-- and people

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:54.189 align:middle line:90%
could see this all on YouTube.

00:21:54.189 --> 00:21:56.690 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing thing.

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:59.510 align:middle line:84%
These members of Congress
were absolutely--

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:00.650 align:middle line:90%
not a little bit--

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:04.640 align:middle line:84%
they were totally won over
to the seriousness of this.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.657 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't
willing publicly

00:22:07.657 --> 00:22:09.740 align:middle line:84%
to state, oh yes, well,
it looks extraterrestrial.

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:12.470 align:middle line:84%
But all of them were
absolutely saying

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:14.690 align:middle line:84%
that this is serious
stuff and this

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:17.420 align:middle line:84%
needs to be part of
our public discourse.

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:19.160 align:middle line:90%
This is really important.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:23.150 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I mean, watching their
transformation was honestly--

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:25.587 align:middle line:84%
that was the real drama
of the entire week.

00:22:25.587 --> 00:22:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And now that we've
got the Snowden disclosures,

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:32.060 align:middle line:84%
of course, it is
possible for the public

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:37.310 align:middle line:84%
not to know a very big secret,
and to have that secret kept

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:38.240 align:middle line:90%
from the public.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.940 align:middle line:84%
Everybody would
say-- guys like you

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:42.860 align:middle line:84%
and me used to get shot
at by people saying, well,

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:44.960 align:middle line:84%
government can't even
find a piece of paper

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:45.800 align:middle line:90%
in a file cabinet.

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.699 align:middle line:84%
How are they going
to keep that secret?

00:22:47.699 --> 00:22:49.490 align:middle line:84%
You know, you ask them
for these documents,

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:50.760 align:middle line:90%
they say, oh, we lost it.

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.740 align:middle line:84%
So how could they
keep the secret?

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, the
answer is that secrets

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:56.630 align:middle line:90%
are kept in plain sight.

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:59.270 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, it is
impossible to keep something

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:00.680 align:middle line:90%
this big totally secret.

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And in fact what's happened,
you have releases of documents,

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:07.730 align:middle line:84%
you have leaks, sometimes
unauthorized leaks,

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:09.830 align:middle line:90%
but they come out nonetheless.

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:11.990 align:middle line:84%
But what they've
learned that they can do

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:17.510 align:middle line:84%
is ignore or deny
or simply obfuscate

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:20.210 align:middle line:84%
in one way or another, or
put their own spin on there,

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:24.290 align:middle line:84%
or engage, when need be, in
active disinformation, which

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:26.870 align:middle line:84%
the US intelligence
community has done relating

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:28.710 align:middle line:90%
to UFOs from time to time.

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:30.600 align:middle line:84%
So all of those are
effective enough

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:35.290 align:middle line:84%
at keeping this thin veil
that's still in place.

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:38.130 align:middle line:84%
Now how long it will be there is
a really interesting question,

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:40.940 align:middle line:84%
and that's the
disclosure question.

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:43.430 align:middle line:84%
You know, it reminds
me of the parable

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:46.730 align:middle line:90%
of the emperor and no clothes.

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:49.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, he wants
the finest fabric,

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.220 align:middle line:84%
so this great con
man says, oh yeah,

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:53.870 align:middle line:90%
I'll take care of you, buddy.

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And he has nothing, and he's
stitching invisible things.

00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:00.650 align:middle line:84%
But everyone is convinced, oh my
god, this is the finest fabric.

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And the emperor is parading in
his new clothing totally naked

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.210 align:middle line:84%
down the street, and everyone's
afraid to say anything

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:11.010 align:middle line:84%
except one little kid who says,
but he's not wearing anything.

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's actually
where we're at right now.

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:20.990 align:middle line:84%
We have such an
overt pack of lies

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:25.740 align:middle line:84%
that have encrusted
our official discourse.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:27.890 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just waiting
for the right breeze

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:29.774 align:middle line:84%
just to blow it
all away, and we're

00:24:29.774 --> 00:24:31.190 align:middle line:84%
going to realize
we've been living

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:36.420 align:middle line:84%
in a completely illusory,
manipulated kind of reality.

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:39.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So if Roswell happens
all the way back in 1947--

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:42.830 align:middle line:84%
we're talking almost
70 years ago now--

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:47.030 align:middle line:84%
the military comes in
contact with technology only

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:49.800 align:middle line:84%
some of which has
ever been made public,

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.489 align:middle line:90%
and they've had it for 70 years.

00:24:51.489 --> 00:24:53.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: It's quite possible
there was a retrieval back

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:56.357 align:middle line:90%
in 1941, actually.

00:24:56.357 --> 00:24:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that researchers often

00:24:58.190 --> 00:24:58.890 align:middle line:90%
kind of ignore.

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:01.223 align:middle line:84%
But the more I look at it,
the more I think it happened.

00:25:01.223 --> 00:25:03.650 align:middle line:84%
This is not far from
St. Louis, in the middle

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:07.674 align:middle line:84%
of the US in Missouri at Cape
Saint Gerard, it's called.

00:25:07.674 --> 00:25:09.590 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, so your point
is that they've held

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:11.166 align:middle line:90%
onto this for yes, 70 years.

00:25:11.166 --> 00:25:13.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And it would
make sense that if they

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.350 align:middle line:84%
got the propulsion
system working,

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:17.000 align:middle line:90%
they would go into space.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yes.

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:18.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:19.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes again.

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So that's
a huge subjects.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.367 align:middle line:84%
And when I talk about a
breakaway civilization,

00:25:23.367 --> 00:25:24.200 align:middle line:90%
this is what I mean.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.792 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what is a
civilization anyway?

00:25:26.792 --> 00:25:28.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how do you
characterize it?

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:31.910 align:middle line:84%
I would say the
level of technology

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:33.420 align:middle line:90%
would be significant.

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:35.686 align:middle line:84%
The social
interactions that they

00:25:35.686 --> 00:25:37.310 align:middle line:84%
have amongst themselves
and with others

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:39.320 align:middle line:84%
would be a significant
defining characteristics.

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.501 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe
cosmology, you know,

00:25:41.501 --> 00:25:43.250 align:middle line:84%
their idea of their
place in the universe.

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:46.450 align:middle line:84%
All of these would help
to define a civilization.

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And I would suggest that
what actually happened

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:56.090 align:middle line:84%
in the classified world is that
this secret became something

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:58.720 align:middle line:84%
that they ran away with,
as we were talking before.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.220 align:middle line:90%
Classified patents.

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, whereas the
rest of the world

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:05.370 align:middle line:84%
is not permitted to
continue along those lines,

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:06.830 align:middle line:90%
this group is.

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the way
scientific progress works,

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:11.570 align:middle line:84%
one breakthrough
can lead to another,

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:13.486 align:middle line:84%
which can lead to another
and lead to another.

00:26:13.486 --> 00:26:15.800 align:middle line:84%
The next thing you know,
these guys are way out there.

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And are they going off
world with their own disks,

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.370 align:middle line:90%
with their own objects?

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:22.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, why not?

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:23.357 align:middle line:90%
Why wouldn't they?

00:26:23.357 --> 00:26:25.190 align:middle line:84%
But it wouldn't be
something they could ever

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:26.305 align:middle line:90%
tell the public.

00:26:26.305 --> 00:26:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, and they'd want
to build bases, of course.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.430 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
just go out there alone

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:32.417 align:middle line:90%
in one little tiny cold ship.

00:26:32.417 --> 00:26:35.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Oh, I mean, David, when
I first broke into this field

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.374 align:middle line:84%
years ago, I was
so conservative,

00:26:36.374 --> 00:26:38.000 align:middle line:84%
and I thought bases
on the far side

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.800 align:middle line:90%
of the moon, that's impossible.

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it's impossible.

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.180 align:middle line:84%
I've had a number of very
detailed, deep conversations

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:46.550 align:middle line:84%
with some individuals who
have made this clear to me

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:47.810 align:middle line:90%
that this is so.

00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:53.180 align:middle line:10%
I had a conversation with the
scientist Russell Targ, who

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:54.130 align:middle line:10%
was one of them.

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:54.450 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: Yeah, I've met him.

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:56.241 align:middle line:10%
>>DOLAN: Yeah, Russell's
a fascinating man.

00:26:56.241 --> 00:26:58.160 align:middle line:10%
He helped develop the
remote viewing program.

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And Russell once
said to me, he said,

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:04.010 align:middle line:84%
Richard, back in the early
1980s, one of my assignments

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:07.280 align:middle line:84%
was to train remote viewers
at Fort Meade, Maryland,

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:10.970 align:middle line:84%
whose job was to remote view
the far side of the moon.

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:11.780 align:middle line:90%
Long pause.

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:14.510 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, Russell,
why would they do that?

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:15.510 align:middle line:90%
Trying to act innocent.

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:16.843 align:middle line:90%
He said, well, why do you think?

00:27:16.843 --> 00:27:19.310 align:middle line:84%
He just throws it
right back out at me.

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:20.310 align:middle line:90%
So I said OK, I'll bite.

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:22.640 align:middle line:90%
Well, was it to look for ET?

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And he said yes, it
was to look for ET.

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.310 align:middle line:90%
I asked, did they find ET?

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:30.140 align:middle line:90%
And he said, ah.

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:33.830 align:middle line:84%
Didn't say that I knew that
that wasn't part of my job,

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:36.230 align:middle line:84%
so he really wouldn't tell me
whether they did or didn't.

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:37.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But the
whole point is you

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.040 align:middle line:84%
can't judge the accuracy
of remote viewing

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:42.860 align:middle line:84%
unless you know that what
they're looking at is real

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:45.080 align:middle line:84%
and that they're reporting
back to you what they saw.

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Unless they
had very good reason

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:49.106 align:middle line:84%
to think that there was an
extraterrestrial presence

00:27:49.106 --> 00:27:51.350 align:middle line:84%
on the far side of the
moon in the early 1980s.

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:54.470 align:middle line:84%
If that's the case, would
we have our own motivation

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:55.270 align:middle line:90%
for going there?

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:57.080 align:middle line:90%
I think we would.

00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:00.320 align:middle line:84%
There are a number of
fascinating and compelling,

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:03.710 align:middle line:84%
again, leaked accounts
dealing with what

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:06.410 align:middle line:84%
is known as the alien
reproduction vehicle, that

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:09.496 align:middle line:84%
is, our own attempt to
reproduce what they've gotten.

00:28:09.496 --> 00:28:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to me that we've
had some success with that,

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:14.010 align:middle line:90%
and that's back in the 80s.

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:18.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So it's entirely
possible that we have a whole

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.830 align:middle line:84%
division of the US military,
and militaries, potentially,

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:23.220 align:middle line:90%
of other countries--

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:24.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Right.

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:25.540 align:middle line:84%
The question is,
who's in charge?

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:26.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: That is
compartmentalized.

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:27.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Exactly.

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:29.560 align:middle line:90%


00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:32.190 align:middle line:84%
Is it a formally part
of the US military

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:33.720 align:middle line:90%
is a question that I ask myself.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:36.980 align:middle line:84%
And it could be, but
it also might not be.

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:40.190 align:middle line:84%
When we deal with black budget
economics and the black budget

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:43.190 align:middle line:84%
in general, one thing
that we find more and more

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:44.970 align:middle line:84%
is that it's
increasingly privatized.

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:47.600 align:middle line:84%
That is, the real power
is not necessarily

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.000 align:middle line:90%
with the US Defense Department.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.350 align:middle line:84%
The real power is
with the contractors,

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:54.110 align:middle line:84%
Lockheed and Boeing, and
General Dynamics and those guys.

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:55.460 align:middle line:90%
And they're international.

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:56.918 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they may
be American based,

00:28:56.918 --> 00:28:58.890 align:middle line:90%
but they are international.

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And so the question
is, who's really

00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:03.740 align:middle line:84%
running this black budget
technology and this what

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:05.410 align:middle line:90%
I call breakaway civilization?

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:08.097 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I'm
still on the road here.

00:29:08.097 --> 00:29:10.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've been on this
journey for a number of years.

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:13.670 align:middle line:84%
But I darn well better
keep going because I don't

00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:15.650 align:middle line:90%
have all of my own answers yet.

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that I really

00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:24.650 align:middle line:84%
want to get a better handle on
is who exactly are these guys?

00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:28.130 align:middle line:84%
Who exactly is the true
structure of power?

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:30.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can assume
it's financial power.

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:34.730 align:middle line:84%
We can assume it's
related to what I jokingly

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:36.110 align:middle line:84%
call the masters
of our universe,

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:38.690 align:middle line:84%
the financial banksters
and those Bilderberg

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:42.590 align:middle line:84%
Group, Bohemian Grove
people and the like.

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:44.090 align:middle line:90%
But who specifically are they?

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that I think

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:47.500 align:middle line:90%
is still worth looking into.

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:49.984 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, and we've got
Eisenhower's infamous warning.

00:29:49.984 --> 00:29:50.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: That's right.

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:52.483 align:middle line:84%
A little too little
too late, but yes,

00:29:52.483 --> 00:29:55.070 align:middle line:84%
he did, warning about the growth
of the military industrial

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:56.180 align:middle line:90%
complex.

00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:59.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have a lot of sympathy
for Eisenhower at that time.

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:02.150 align:middle line:84%
I think what happened is
he clearly realized that he

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:03.950 align:middle line:90%
lost control of his military.

00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:08.600 align:middle line:84%
He was a five star general,
ran the Normandy invasion.

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.250 align:middle line:90%
I mean, a revered president.

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:15.927 align:middle line:84%
And if he-- and he really lost
control of the US military.

00:30:15.927 --> 00:30:18.260 align:middle line:84%
Quick story, and I know we're
probably pressed for time.

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:20.060 align:middle line:84%
But right at the end
of his presidency,

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:22.780 align:middle line:84%
Eisenhower, for several years,
had been trying to get a plan,

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:24.810 align:middle line:84%
trying to understand
what the plan was

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:26.606 align:middle line:90%
for nuclear retaliation.

00:30:26.606 --> 00:30:28.230 align:middle line:84%
So he would go to
Strategic Air Command

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:30.030 align:middle line:90%
and say, what's our plan?

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:31.540 align:middle line:90%
What are we doing?

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And he finally, after
repeated requests,

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:38.070 align:middle line:84%
got an audience at the
very end of his presidency.

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And what he learned terrified
him, because what he realized

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:45.870 align:middle line:84%
is that they were going to blow
the entire northern hemisphere

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:48.450 align:middle line:90%
into smithereens.

00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And Eisenhower thought,
my god, what has happened?

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And if I, the
president, can't get

00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:58.194 align:middle line:84%
control of our nuclear
policy, then we are hosed.

00:30:58.194 --> 00:30:59.610 align:middle line:84%
I think that was
one aspect of it.

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You have a video
of interviewing this guy who

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:06.140 align:middle line:84%
apparently was tasked
by Eisenhower to invade

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:07.479 align:middle line:90%
Area 51 militarily.

00:31:07.479 --> 00:31:08.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Let's talk about this.

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:11.489 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, I was asked--

00:31:11.489 --> 00:31:13.780 align:middle line:84%
this is right before the
Citizen Hearing on Disclosure,

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:17.850 align:middle line:84%
so early 2013 I was requested--
in fact by Stephen Bassett,

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:19.492 align:middle line:90%
who knew about this guy--

00:31:19.492 --> 00:31:21.450 align:middle line:84%
and there was a video
team that knew about him.

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And there was one researcher
who had cultivated

00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:26.900 align:middle line:90%
this man for some years.

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:29.106 align:middle line:84%
And I was told this
man is very, very ill.

00:31:29.106 --> 00:31:30.480 align:middle line:84%
He may not be
around much longer.

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.979 align:middle line:84%
He's got some
explosive information,

00:31:31.979 --> 00:31:33.466 align:middle line:90%
potentially explosive.

00:31:33.466 --> 00:31:34.590 align:middle line:90%
Would you do the interview?

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And I eventually
agreed to do it.

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:40.560 align:middle line:84%
We went up to
northern Minnesota.

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:43.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're shooting
this here in Minnesota.

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:46.770 align:middle line:84%
He is a bit north
of where we are.

00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:49.177 align:middle line:84%
Drove up there in a lot
of snow not even knowing

00:31:49.177 --> 00:31:50.760 align:middle line:84%
if we'd be able to
get this interview,

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.340 align:middle line:84%
because it was unsure
if he or his family

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:54.480 align:middle line:90%
would finally agree to it.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:58.200 align:middle line:90%
We went up on a gamble.

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:01.050 align:middle line:84%
I met him in a motel room,
and he comes in wheeled in.

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:02.900 align:middle line:90%
His health was terrible.

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:04.740 align:middle line:84%
But his basic
story is that yes--

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:07.335 align:middle line:84%
I do have his DD 214,
his military record

00:32:07.335 --> 00:32:11.790 align:middle line:84%
of being in the army in the
late '50s, when he said he was.

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:14.410 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't say CIA, but
it probably wouldn't.

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, he was
never formally CIA.

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.920 align:middle line:84%
His boss, he said, was
a CIA station chief.

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And essentially what happened
was his job was doing signals

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:28.810 align:middle line:84%
intelligence receiving UFO
data primarily from Europe

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:33.930 align:middle line:84%
that then would be processed by
the CIA for their own purposes.

00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And in that capacity,
he said, you know, I

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.220 align:middle line:84%
looked at various
interesting photographs, one

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:41.580 align:middle line:84%
of a blended craft in Italy
with an apparent being.

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:42.979 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, he described this.

00:32:42.979 --> 00:32:44.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if that
made the camera.

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:46.634 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was on
YouTube, but maybe not.

00:32:46.634 --> 00:32:48.300 align:middle line:84%
But then the explosive
thing that he did

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:51.510 align:middle line:90%
say to me was that he--

00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:54.090 align:middle line:84%
his boss, primarily, but he
was brought in with him--

00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:57.150 align:middle line:84%
and was tasked by
President Eisenhower,

00:32:57.150 --> 00:33:02.370 align:middle line:84%
he said, to go to Area 51,
where Eisenhower said to them,

00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:05.430 align:middle line:84%
I had been unable to get any
kind of sufficient information

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:08.490 align:middle line:84%
about the status of
basically the ET technology

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:10.504 align:middle line:90%
program there.

00:33:10.504 --> 00:33:12.420 align:middle line:84%
You guys are going to
get me some information.

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And if I don't get
what I'm looking

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:17.940 align:middle line:84%
for, this man said
to me, Eisenhower

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:20.500 align:middle line:90%
threatened to invade Area 51--

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:21.300 align:middle line:90%
his words.

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:22.100 align:middle line:90%


00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:25.600 align:middle line:10%
>> To get in they have
this week, coming week,

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:30.120 align:middle line:10%
get into Washington
and to report to me.

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't, I'm
going to get the First

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Army from Colorado and
we're gonna go over,

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:39.780 align:middle line:90%
we're gonna take the base over.

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:44.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what kind of
classified material you got.

00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:47.190 align:middle line:84%
We're gonna rip
this thing apart.

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Eisenhower was
going to invade--

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:51.086 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, Area 51.

00:33:51.086 --> 00:33:51.886 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:51.886 --> 00:33:52.735 align:middle line:90%


00:33:52.735 --> 00:33:53.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: That's huge.

00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:55.435 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: You know,
it's incredible.

00:33:55.435 --> 00:33:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And there were a
number of other things

00:33:57.060 --> 00:34:00.570 align:middle line:84%
this man said which
were quite remarkable.

00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:02.040 align:middle line:90%
I will say this about this man.

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.740 align:middle line:90%
I really loved this guy.

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:06.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I got to
know him fairly well,

00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:08.610 align:middle line:84%
spoke with him for
a number of hours.

00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:14.112 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that he was an
honest and a very sweet man who

00:34:14.112 --> 00:34:15.570 align:middle line:84%
just decided at
the end of his life

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:18.270 align:middle line:84%
that he wanted to
tell this story.

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:22.739 align:middle line:84%
I will say, though, that
I don't know entirely 100%

00:34:22.739 --> 00:34:24.780 align:middle line:84%
how reliable all of
what he said is only

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:26.699 align:middle line:90%
because I know he was on meds.

00:34:26.699 --> 00:34:29.219 align:middle line:84%
I know his physical
situation was bad.

00:34:29.219 --> 00:34:31.874 align:middle line:84%
And his memory did
seem very kind of foggy

00:34:31.874 --> 00:34:32.790 align:middle line:90%
about a lot of things.

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:34.590 align:middle line:84%
Like he couldn't
remember the name of J.

00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:39.155 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Hoover, a lot
of basic things.

00:34:39.155 --> 00:34:40.530 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
his son-in-law

00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:42.870 align:middle line:84%
was with us during
this interview,

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:45.210 align:middle line:84%
and I got to talk to the
son-in-law quite a bit.

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:48.179 align:middle line:84%
Son-in-law, in my opinion,
was an absolutely rigorously

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:51.420 align:middle line:84%
honest individual who
was deeply familiar

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:53.610 align:middle line:84%
with his father-in-law's
story and stood by it.

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:57.810 align:middle line:84%
These are churchgoing
people, very, very upright.

00:34:57.810 --> 00:35:00.120 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really see
deception in this man.

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:03.120 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, my feeling is I
think that I believe him.

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:07.410 align:middle line:84%
The problem that I have is how
does one vet a story like this?

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:10.710 align:middle line:84%
How does one confirm
whether or not

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:14.307 align:middle line:84%
the president made
such a plan or not?

00:35:14.307 --> 00:35:16.890 align:middle line:84%
According to this man's story,
they got enough information out

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:21.060 align:middle line:84%
of Area 51, including he claims
he saw an alien being and got

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:24.610 align:middle line:84%
a telepathic message from it,
which--this is on the YouTube

00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:25.410 align:middle line:90%
video.

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:29.850 align:middle line:84%
The message was, we
mean you no harm.

00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:32.740 align:middle line:84%
That was what he claims to
have gotten telepathically

00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:33.540 align:middle line:90%
from this being.

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:34.340 align:middle line:90%


00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:38.821 align:middle line:10%
>> The colonel said,
what we've got in here is

00:35:38.821 --> 00:35:43.230 align:middle line:10%
we're interviewing a gray alien.

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:44.580 align:middle line:90%
>> All right, right there.

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:48.500 align:middle line:90%
How did you feel at that moment?

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:52.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I thought, boy, we had
no idea we were going to see

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:54.260 align:middle line:90%
the real thing.

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:55.545 align:middle line:90%
All we saw was film.

00:35:55.545 --> 00:35:56.690 align:middle line:90%


00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So how do you
see disclosure happening?

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.790 align:middle line:90%
I mean, is it going to happen--

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:04.310 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people have
like a disclosure-gasm model,

00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:06.330 align:middle line:84%
like everything
just kind of-- it's

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:08.240 align:middle line:84%
this jubilant,
wonderful celebration.

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:11.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: No, I've
never felt this way.

00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:14.630 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of times I
get lumped into that camp

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:16.550 align:middle line:84%
because I wrote a
book on disclosure.

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And there are a number
of people who are

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:20.870 align:middle line:90%
cheerleaders for disclosure.

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:23.630 align:middle line:84%
I would characterize myself
as a believer in disclosure.

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:24.630 align:middle line:10%
I think we need it.

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:25.430 align:middle line:90%
I think we need it.

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:27.305 align:middle line:84%
If we're going to go
into a more mature phase

00:36:27.305 --> 00:36:30.110 align:middle line:84%
of our civilization, we
have to burst this bubble.

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:33.250 align:middle line:90%
We have to lance this boil.

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:35.730 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's going to
be a very messy procedure.

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think it'll
happen by accident.

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:41.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's going
to be a planned event.

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:43.370 align:middle line:84%
If it's a truly
planned event, I'm

00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:46.160 align:middle line:84%
going to have my own distrust
about the whole process.

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:49.194 align:middle line:84%
But what's happened
in our society--

00:36:49.194 --> 00:36:50.360 align:middle line:90%
well, let's put it this way.

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:52.280 align:middle line:84%
I look at disclosure
as a paradox,

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.270 align:middle line:84%
as something that's
impossible but inevitable

00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:55.520 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.800 align:middle line:84%
It's impossible because
those people who've

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.050 align:middle line:90%
got access to this secret--

00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:02.690 align:middle line:84%
in my view, they have
no incentive ever

00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:03.500 align:middle line:90%
for giving this up.

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:05.200 align:middle line:90%
They have too much to lose.

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:09.410 align:middle line:84%
Too many people
can go to prison.

00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:11.024 align:middle line:84%
Too much disruption
will be perceived,

00:37:11.024 --> 00:37:12.440 align:middle line:84%
and they just won't
want to do it.

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:14.273 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to happen
because they're not

00:37:14.273 --> 00:37:15.560 align:middle line:90%
the only part of the equation.

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:17.530 align:middle line:84%
Another part of
the equation is us,

00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:19.470 align:middle line:84%
a show like what
you're doing here,

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:22.310 align:middle line:84%
and so many other researchers
and so many other people who

00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:24.650 align:middle line:90%
are ferreting out information.

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:27.110 align:middle line:84%
We're in a completely
new era now.

00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And as I see it, the
real issue of disclosure

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:33.790 align:middle line:84%
is going to be
something is forced out.

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:35.960 align:middle line:10%
A president makes a statement.

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.559 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's come
to my attention

00:37:37.559 --> 00:37:39.350 align:middle line:84%
after conferring with
the national security

00:37:39.350 --> 00:37:42.650 align:middle line:84%
advisers that some of
this UFO phenomenon

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:45.466 align:middle line:84%
is legitimate and is not
ours, or something like that,

00:37:45.466 --> 00:37:46.340 align:middle line:90%
words to that effect.

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:49.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, once that's
out, I mean, my god.

00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:52.460 align:middle line:90%


00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:55.970 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you've got
the fear factor and people

00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:59.795 align:middle line:84%
wondering, are these
beings hostile or not.

00:37:59.795 --> 00:38:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And at the moment of
disclosure, you probably

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:04.160 align:middle line:84%
won't have the luxury of
having a little gray alien

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:05.799 align:middle line:90%
on the podium with him, either.

00:38:05.799 --> 00:38:07.340 align:middle line:84%
Just because we
figure it out doesn't

00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:09.320 align:middle line:84%
mean that they're going
to be cooperative.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:11.736 align:middle line:84%
So there's going to be all
these arguments over what we're

00:38:11.736 --> 00:38:14.150 align:middle line:84%
dealing with, friend or foe,
all the questions that they

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:16.250 align:middle line:84%
wondered about,
probably, in the 40s.

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And then you're going
have the blowback,

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:20.942 align:middle line:90%
a lot of angry citizens.

00:38:20.942 --> 00:38:22.400 align:middle line:84%
You know, there
are some people who

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.205 align:middle line:84%
have a total
obedience to authority

00:38:24.205 --> 00:38:25.580 align:middle line:84%
and they'll just
accept anything.

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:27.410 align:middle line:90%
But not everyone is this way.

00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And there will be
people who are going

00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:31.400 align:middle line:90%
to say, hey, you know what?

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:34.070 align:middle line:84%
You've corrupted our
institutions for 70 years.

00:38:34.070 --> 00:38:35.570 align:middle line:90%
You've lied to us.

00:38:35.570 --> 00:38:38.030 align:middle line:84%
I've lived my entire
lifetime in this lie

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:39.710 align:middle line:84%
and I'm a little bit
annoyed about it,

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:41.300 align:middle line:84%
and I want to know
who's responsible.

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And furthermore I'd
like to know how

00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:45.700 align:middle line:84%
did you manage and manipulate
our political institutions

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:48.200 align:middle line:84%
and our academic
institutions and our media

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:49.610 align:middle line:90%
to keep this lie going?

00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:51.230 align:middle line:84%
So that moment of
disclosure is going

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:53.900 align:middle line:84%
to trigger a massive
re-evaluation

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:56.450 align:middle line:90%
of our whole power structure.

00:38:56.450 --> 00:38:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
the energy paradigm.

00:38:58.310 --> 00:39:00.020 align:middle line:90%
My god.

00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:02.630 align:middle line:84%
You know, a child seeing
the instant acceleration

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:04.160 align:middle line:84%
of an object is
going to realize,

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:07.400 align:middle line:90%
intuit it's not gasoline.

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, it's
better than gasoline.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.790 align:middle line:84%
So the UFO phenomenon
implicit in that

00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:16.260 align:middle line:90%
is a post-petroleum future.

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And that is probably
the most massive thing

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:23.430 align:middle line:90%
that I can imagine.

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, we need a
post-petroleum future, clearly.

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:30.320 align:middle line:84%
But it's also a
little bit scary.

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.240 align:middle line:84%
You know, what
would the world look

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:34.490 align:middle line:90%
like if we all had free energy?

00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Let's say that there's a
free energy solution to this.

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:39.140 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's a wonderful thing.

00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:40.140 align:middle line:90%
I would like to have it.

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:41.810 align:middle line:90%
You would like to have it.

00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:46.310 align:middle line:84%
One thing I do wonder is how
would it change our world?

00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And the danger-- and again,
not wanting to create

00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:52.280 align:middle line:84%
fear-- but what if
free energy could

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:54.290 align:middle line:84%
allow you to create
a really nifty bomb

00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:57.770 align:middle line:84%
that could blow up the
whole Pacific Ocean?

00:39:57.770 --> 00:40:01.910 align:middle line:84%
Not everyone's a team
player here on planet Earth,

00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:05.450 align:middle line:84%
and there are people who maybe
would do something like that.

00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:09.560 align:middle line:84%
There are all kinds of
variables here that my guess

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:11.210 align:middle line:84%
is that those people
with the secret

00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:13.970 align:middle line:84%
are probably pondering
and thinking,

00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:16.924 align:middle line:84%
oh no, no, we can't trust
the people with this.

00:40:16.924 --> 00:40:17.840 align:middle line:90%
They may have a point.

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:19.756 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, we
have to remind ourselves

00:40:19.756 --> 00:40:21.950 align:middle line:84%
that people who keep
secrets typically

00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:26.210 align:middle line:84%
do it for reasons of
selfishness and self-promotion

00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:28.230 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:30.290 align:middle line:84%
I believe that
ultimately we need

00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:32.930 align:middle line:84%
to have something
like free energy,

00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:35.810 align:middle line:84%
or cheaper and cleaner
energy, if we're really

00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:38.340 align:middle line:84%
going to move on to a better
phase of our civilization.

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:40.430 align:middle line:90%
And I believe we can do it.

00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:41.420 align:middle line:90%
I believe we can.

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:43.211 align:middle line:84%
It would allow us to
feed ourselves better.

00:40:43.211 --> 00:40:47.240 align:middle line:84%
It would allow us, I think,
to provide better care

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:50.070 align:middle line:84%
for this precious
planet we live on.

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And if there's
anything that's going

00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:55.080 align:middle line:84%
to help us turn
around this planet

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:59.910 align:middle line:84%
into moving into a
better world, then I

00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:02.940 align:middle line:84%
think a better form of
energy is going to be key.

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:04.860 align:middle line:84%
Maybe what Tesla
envisioned, and what

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:07.820 align:middle line:84%
is in evidence of
the UFO phenomenon

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, Rich, I
really want to thank you.

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:11.430 align:middle line:84%
This has been a
wonderful interview.

00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: I've enjoyed it.

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:12.360 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, David.

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:14.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Thank you for being
part of this disclosure

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:14.790 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:15.210 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Appreciate it.

00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:16.010 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:17.310 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Thanks

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:19.500 align:middle line:84%
I think Rich is
absolutely right.

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:23.940 align:middle line:84%
A better form of energy is
the key to a better world.

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:26.130 align:middle line:84%
Once we stop
polluting the Earth,

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:28.770 align:middle line:84%
once we can rid
ourselves of corruption,

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:34.260 align:middle line:84%
we have the opportunity for
such a vastly expanded area.

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:36.210 align:middle line:84%
Now Rich Dolan has
also spoken about

00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:37.440 align:middle line:90%
the breakaway civilization.

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:39.360 align:middle line:90%
We got into that a little bit.

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:42.030 align:middle line:84%
But he doesn't
really have that much

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:44.220 align:middle line:84%
in the way of factual
information, the kind that he

00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:46.290 align:middle line:84%
likes in documents,
because this has

00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:49.881 align:middle line:84%
been kept very compartmentalized
and very secretive.

00:41:49.881 --> 00:41:51.255 align:middle line:84%
But if somebody
like Russell Targ

00:41:51.255 --> 00:41:54.150 align:middle line:84%
is saying that they used
the dark side of the moon

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:57.270 align:middle line:84%
as a target for remote
viewers and openly admits

00:41:57.270 --> 00:42:00.840 align:middle line:84%
that you will find ET
when you look out there,

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:03.060 align:middle line:90%
something is going on here.

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:06.720 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we have
just seen a little bit

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:11.400 align:middle line:84%
of the truth of what there
is to know about UFOs.

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:15.090 align:middle line:84%
Rich Dolan has way,
way, way more to offer

00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:16.860 align:middle line:90%
than what we got through here.

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:18.870 align:middle line:84%
This was just some
hors d'oeuvres.

00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:20.970 align:middle line:90%
There's so much of this data.

00:42:20.970 --> 00:42:23.010 align:middle line:90%
The proof has been satisfied.

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:25.680 align:middle line:84%
What we've already given
you in these episodes,

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:28.830 align:middle line:84%
in my view, is more
than enough to establish

00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:32.880 align:middle line:84%
the initial premise, which is
that UFOs definitely do exist,

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:36.150 align:middle line:84%
they definitely have visited
us, they did crash here,

00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:38.910 align:middle line:84%
our government did back
engineer their technology.

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:39.960 align:middle line:90%
And think about it.

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:42.750 align:middle line:84%
If they have the ability
to fly into space,

00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:44.550 align:middle line:90%
that becomes common for them.

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:47.640 align:middle line:84%
They establish bases,
they establish outposts,

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:49.680 align:middle line:84%
they have people
working out there.

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:51.390 align:middle line:90%
And it's not so far fetched.

00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:54.780 align:middle line:84%
It seems far fetched, because
we've lived in this lie

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:55.909 align:middle line:90%
for so long.

00:42:55.909 --> 00:42:58.200 align:middle line:84%
But there are whistle blowers
starting to come forward,

00:42:58.200 --> 00:42:59.940 align:middle line:84%
and we're getting
more and more of them

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:02.760 align:middle line:84%
who have spoken about
the Secret Space Program.

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:05.820 align:middle line:84%
All of this information
for me is very fascinating

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:07.470 align:middle line:84%
because it suggests
that we could

00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:11.640 align:middle line:84%
be right on the threshold of
breaking into the Star Trek

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:12.720 align:middle line:90%
age.

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:16.740 align:middle line:84%
The transportation beams,
the faster than light speed,

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:19.650 align:middle line:84%
portals, meeting
all different types

00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:23.010 align:middle line:84%
of human or human-like
extraterrestrials, all of that

00:43:23.010 --> 00:43:26.040 align:middle line:84%
is so much closer to
us right now than we

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:27.510 align:middle line:90%
could have ever believed.

00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And we just have to get
through this last little push

00:43:30.210 --> 00:43:33.810 align:middle line:84%
of the birthing pains to get
to that new reality that,

00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:38.160 align:middle line:84%
in ancient prophesies, has
been called the Golden Age.

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:41.070 align:middle line:84%
So there's much more to
come here on Disclosure.

00:43:41.070 --> 00:43:45.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, David Wilcock,
speaking truth to power

00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:49.250 align:middle line:90%
and giving power to the truth.

00:43:49.250 --> 00:44:05.974 align:middle line:90%
