00:00:15.352 --> 00:00:16.810 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID WILCOCK:
I'm David Wilcock,

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.810 align:middle line:10%
and welcome to another
episode of "Disclosure."

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.020 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we get to the
beating heart of the question

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.810 align:middle line:10%
that we're all wanting to ask
when we learn about the Federal

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:26.940 align:middle line:10%
Reserve.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Does this banking cartel
have a vulnerability?

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.109 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything that
can actually be done?

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:36.900 align:middle line:10%
If there's anybody
who's in a good position

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.290 align:middle line:10%
to answer that question,
it's G. Edward Griffin,

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.160 align:middle line:10%
because remember, his book, "The
Creature from Jekyll Island,"

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.670 align:middle line:10%
was almost single handedly
responsible for educating

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.150 align:middle line:10%
representative Ron Paul on
the secrets of the Federal

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.530 align:middle line:10%
Reserve, which led to a
Federal Reserve audit.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.550 align:middle line:84%
So once we start to explore
what's actually happened,

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.740 align:middle line:84%
we see that when
information is intelligently

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.770 align:middle line:84%
provided to the right people,
they will take action on it.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:07.820 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is true.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.230 align:middle line:84%
The Cabal is using surveillance,
blackmail, bribery,

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.610 align:middle line:84%
and lethal threats and lethal
force to impose their agenda,

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.650 align:middle line:84%
but that can only work when
a small number of people

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.490 align:middle line:84%
know about the truth,
and everybody else

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.780 align:middle line:90%
is kept in the dark.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.260 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening
now is that knowledge

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.070 align:middle line:90%
is reaching a critical mass.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.830 align:middle line:84%
People are waking up
like never before.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.490 align:middle line:84%
We are learning
what's really going

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.670 align:middle line:84%
on in the world in our
governments, with the media,

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.270 align:middle line:84%
and all of these
related subjects.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.039 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the groups that
is the most politically active

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:45.080 align:middle line:84%
turns out to be the right
wingers, the people who

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.580 align:middle line:90%
watch Fox.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.510 align:middle line:90%
They're more apt to go and vote.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.690 align:middle line:84%
They're more apt to want
to get out in the streets.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.120 align:middle line:84%
They're more apt to get angry
and shout about politics.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.280 align:middle line:84%
Well G. Edward Griffin
would be somebody

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.010 align:middle line:84%
who, because he was
the brain for Ron Paul,

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.409 align:middle line:84%
should be the darling
of the right wing,

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.200 align:middle line:84%
so there's some very
interesting discussion

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.760 align:middle line:84%
we have in this episode about
Fox News and the right wing

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.070 align:middle line:90%
attack media.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm sure you're
thinking, the idea here

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.910 align:middle line:84%
is that you've got one octopus,
and this idea of right wing

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.020 align:middle line:84%
and left wing, of
conservative and liberal,

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.980 align:middle line:90%
it's all part of the game.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.380 align:middle line:84%
It's all part of the war
between country and town,

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.850 align:middle line:84%
where the country
people tend to be more

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.200 align:middle line:84%
in the traditional mindset,
and the town people

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.970 align:middle line:84%
tend to have more of
the all-inclusive view

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.330 align:middle line:84%
where they're not
apt to be racist,

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.760 align:middle line:84%
and they're apt to want
to work together more,

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.270 align:middle line:84%
and that may sound as if I'm
left wing bias, but come on.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.925 align:middle line:84%
I was raised in
upstate New York.

00:02:41.925 --> 00:02:43.050 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, let's check it out.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.430 align:middle line:84%
This is G. Edward
Griffin rounding it

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.850 align:middle line:84%
out with the vulnerability
of the cartel.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.710 align:middle line:90%
Check it out.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.110 align:middle line:84%
Many people who are researching
the subject that you've

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.190 align:middle line:84%
literally been
writing about for 50

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.490 align:middle line:84%
years, this shadowy
international cartel,

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.820 align:middle line:84%
end up actually inadvertently
worshipping the cartel

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.130 align:middle line:90%
with their fear.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.830 align:middle line:84%
They ascribe supernatural
properties to it.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:18.140 align:middle line:84%
They believe that it is somehow
beyond any type of consequences

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.960 align:middle line:90%
that could come its way.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.860 align:middle line:84%
They think that any opposition
that shows up to the cartel

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.370 align:middle line:84%
must actually be financed and
owned by the cartel secretly,

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.300 align:middle line:84%
and yet if we look at
the tapestry of history,

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.550 align:middle line:84%
we see things like
the Watergate trial

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.690 align:middle line:84%
that almost led to the
impeachment of President

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:36.970 align:middle line:90%
Richard Nixon.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.630 align:middle line:84%
Now we're seeing things breaking
open like the Libor scandal,

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:50.000 align:middle line:84%
and the gold fixing, and the NSA
being another great example--

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.280 align:middle line:90%
the NSA surveillance.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.320 align:middle line:84%
So is this group truly
invulnerable, or in fact,

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.780 align:middle line:84%
are we seeing
chinks in the armor

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.907 align:middle line:84%
that can be used ultimately
to end this tyranny?

00:04:04.907 --> 00:04:06.490 align:middle line:10%
>>G. EDWARD GRIFFIN:
Well, I certainly

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.050 align:middle line:10%
don't think that this Cabal
that we're talking about

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.720 align:middle line:10%
is undefeatable,
or else I wouldn't

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.900 align:middle line:10%
be doing what I'm doing.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.940 align:middle line:10%
I would be hiding up
in the hills somewhere,

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.190 align:middle line:10%
not concerning myself about it.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.220 align:middle line:90%
Sure, they are vulnerable.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.950 align:middle line:84%
They have many points
of vulnerability,

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.420 align:middle line:84%
and the most vulnerable
point, I think,

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.300 align:middle line:84%
is the degree to which
the average person is

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.850 align:middle line:90%
willing to question authority.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And you mentioned that
people have been conditioned

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.110 align:middle line:84%
to accept authority,
almost to worship it

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.660 align:middle line:84%
but certainly to
not question it.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:45.900 align:middle line:90%
You just accept authority.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.419 align:middle line:90%
We're taught that in school.

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.710 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the prime
directives of the public school

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.740 align:middle line:84%
system-- is to teach people
how to be team players,

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.770 align:middle line:84%
and how to go along
with the group,

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.690 align:middle line:84%
and to take directions
and not make waves.

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And you're graded
on your ability

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.390 align:middle line:84%
to be a good citizen and
all that sort of thing.

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.860 align:middle line:84%
It's hammered into us in
the public school system

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:17.050 align:middle line:84%
so that we accept authority as
almost on a religious level.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.750 align:middle line:90%


00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.620 align:middle line:10%
>>Rules for living together.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.175 align:middle line:84%
We have hall guards to remind
us of our traffic rules

00:05:28.175 --> 00:05:28.965 align:middle line:90%
in the hall.

00:05:28.965 --> 00:05:31.350 align:middle line:84%
Our teachers are always
glad to answer questions

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.330 align:middle line:90%
about the rules.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>>Alvin, whose job is it to
see that you know the rules?

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>>What could I say?

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.035 align:middle line:84%
How do you convince people
that they must learn the rules?

00:05:43.035 --> 00:05:45.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: We don't
question authority anymore

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.410 align:middle line:90%
than we would question god.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, some
of these people

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.600 align:middle line:84%
who are advocates
of collectivism

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.390 align:middle line:84%
are very clear on
that, and they believe

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:57.680 align:middle line:84%
that the state should become the
new religion-- that we should

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.690 align:middle line:84%
view the so-called greater
good of the greater number

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.210 align:middle line:84%
or the greater good of society
as the ultimate good works

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.810 align:middle line:90%
for our salvation.

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.380 align:middle line:84%
It's something that we
can relate to as one

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.690 align:middle line:84%
would relate to going
to heaven, and they

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.640 align:middle line:84%
talk about this--
that religion to a god

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.230 align:middle line:84%
has to be replaced, they
say, by worship of the state,

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.000 align:middle line:84%
and indirectly, that
means by worship

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.950 align:middle line:84%
of the leaders of the
state who have now

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:30.890 align:middle line:84%
become beatific symbols in
this new religion called

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.490 align:middle line:90%
collectivism.

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.390 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I think
that the problem

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.390 align:middle line:84%
is that that education
has been very effective,

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:41.690 align:middle line:84%
and in today's world,
most kids come out

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.970 align:middle line:84%
of school totally programmed
to accept authority,

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:47.950 align:middle line:84%
and if you question
authority, it's

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:51.060 align:middle line:90%
somehow considered to be wrong.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.620 align:middle line:84%
You're a bad person if
you question authority.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.550 align:middle line:84%
With that mentality
and that programming

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.300 align:middle line:84%
people believe that,
once a person who

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.430 align:middle line:84%
could be totally
corruptible-- they know

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.080 align:middle line:84%
it's a corruptible human being--
might even be their next door

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.146 align:middle line:84%
neighbor, and they know that
he's a drunken so and so,

00:07:09.146 --> 00:07:14.200 align:middle line:84%
and he beats his wife, but
once he's elected to office,

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.550 align:middle line:90%
now he is purified.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:21.790 align:middle line:84%
He's ready to be accepted
without question.

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.890 align:middle line:84%
He's now a good person, and
you must respect everything

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:26.820 align:middle line:84%
he thinks and
everything he says,

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.460 align:middle line:90%
otherwise you're a bad person.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.640 align:middle line:84%
It's overstated, but that
is really what's happening.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.980 align:middle line:84%
So if we're going to turn our
society around and produce

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.360 align:middle line:84%
something other than
programmed robots,

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.815 align:middle line:84%
we have to recognize what
the problem is at first.

00:07:40.815 --> 00:07:42.190 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
have to break away

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:45.390 align:middle line:84%
from this school system
that is programmed

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:46.800 align:middle line:90%
to indoctrinate students.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.560 align:middle line:84%
We have to question
even that authority.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.310 align:middle line:84%
If you want students to
question the authority,

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:55.160 align:middle line:84%
you've got the question
the authority that

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.750 align:middle line:84%
says no they mustn't
question the authority,

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:59.550 align:middle line:90%
and so that's where we start.

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:01.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a long uphill
battle, but I think

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:03.740 align:middle line:90%
the climb has already begun.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.130 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Terrific.

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:10.125 align:middle line:84%
How do you see the
right wing media

00:08:10.125 --> 00:08:12.990 align:middle line:90%
of Fox News playing into this?

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:17.270 align:middle line:84%
To me, it seems
very clear that they

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:22.120 align:middle line:84%
are trying to marry a political
right wing ideology that

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.850 align:middle line:84%
benefits the politicians
and this cartel

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:32.390 align:middle line:84%
to the people's idea of the
Christian religious faith.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:34.309 align:middle line:84%
It appears that the
Christians are essentially

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:38.530 align:middle line:84%
being duped by Fox News,
that their beliefs are

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.840 align:middle line:84%
being used for
political purposes

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.870 align:middle line:90%
to advance a particular agenda.

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.500 align:middle line:10%
So I'm interested in how
you see the relationship

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:52.130 align:middle line:10%
between right wing media,
Fox News, Christianity,

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:55.590 align:middle line:10%
and the cartel-- is there
some defining connection that

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:58.120 align:middle line:10%
unifies all of these
elements together?

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.225 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: What I think the
connecting thread is the fact

00:09:01.225 --> 00:09:04.250 align:middle line:84%
that we've addressed earlier,
which is that there's really

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:07.310 align:middle line:84%
not an awful lot of difference
between the right wing

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:08.750 align:middle line:90%
and the left wing.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:12.940 align:middle line:84%
It's just more for
strategic purposes

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:15.990 align:middle line:84%
to keep the American people
and people in other countries

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:22.160 align:middle line:84%
as well-- to keep them
pacified, content with the idea

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.070 align:middle line:84%
that they're participating in
their own political destiny

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:27.457 align:middle line:90%
because they get to choose.

00:09:27.457 --> 00:09:29.540 align:middle line:84%
They get to choose between
the left and the right.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:32.130 align:middle line:84%
They get to choose between
Republican and Democrat,

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:35.540 align:middle line:84%
and we got Fox News, which
promotes the one side,

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.440 align:middle line:84%
and we've got CNN or
somebody else that

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.690 align:middle line:84%
promotes the other side,
and you get to choose.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And therefore since
you go to the poll

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:44.560 align:middle line:84%
once every two years
and you get to choose,

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.620 align:middle line:84%
put an X-- that
act of putting an X

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.370 align:middle line:84%
or punching a hole--
that not only makes

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:52.780 align:middle line:84%
you feel good because
now you have participated

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:55.530 align:middle line:84%
in your own political destiny,
but you have sanctified

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.670 align:middle line:84%
the candidate that you voted
for because you voted for him.

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:02.115 align:middle line:84%
And you wouldn't vote
for a bad person.

00:10:02.115 --> 00:10:02.990 align:middle line:90%
Nobody would do that.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:06.160 align:middle line:84%
So if you voted for this person,
that makes him a good person.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.270 align:middle line:84%
That's the thinking
in the background.

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:10.740 align:middle line:84%
So that's the connection--
is that the Fox News

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:14.390 align:middle line:84%
phenomenon and the right and
the left phenomenon in the media

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:19.230 align:middle line:84%
are merely ploys to keep
us content with the false

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:22.540 align:middle line:84%
impression that this is
the best world possible,

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.590 align:middle line:84%
and we don't even
think about going

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.640 align:middle line:84%
outside of those
parameters, which

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.960 align:middle line:90%
is exactly where they want us.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.390 align:middle line:84%
They want us in
those parameters.

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.306 align:middle line:84%
We don't go outside of
the box, and everything

00:10:31.306 --> 00:10:35.750 align:middle line:84%
will continue to go exactly as
it has been going up until now.

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You've been
researching this cartel

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.910 align:middle line:84%
and these complicated subjects
for literally half a century

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:46.280 align:middle line:84%
now, and what we've
discussed is corruption

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.460 align:middle line:84%
that goes all the way back
to the American Revolution

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.750 align:middle line:84%
and possibly much
farther back than that.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:55.300 align:middle line:84%
Let's say at some
point that there

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:59.230 align:middle line:84%
is a defining moment of truth
where this cartel has been

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:02.910 align:middle line:84%
weakened enough that they
are now publicly exposed

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:05.430 align:middle line:90%
on a widespread mass level.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:07.930 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps there's some sort
of South African Truth

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:11.490 align:middle line:84%
and Reconciliation
Committee that's occurring.

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:14.740 align:middle line:84%
Based on your experience
and your pedigree,

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:19.920 align:middle line:84%
how would you go in there
and actually resolve

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.400 align:middle line:84%
the intrinsic systemic
problems that we

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.510 align:middle line:84%
have in the fields of politics,
in the fields of finance,

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:29.720 align:middle line:84%
in the fields of
business and bring us

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:35.210 align:middle line:84%
to a more equitable system
where everyone can be happy?

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: I think that that
question is so important

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.760 align:middle line:84%
that it needs to be broken
down a little bit, at least

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.200 align:middle line:90%
into two categories.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:49.250 align:middle line:84%
The first category is having to
do with what needs to be done.

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.490 align:middle line:84%
When people say how do you
solve this problem, what

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:55.850 align:middle line:84%
they're usually thinking
of is, well, what do we do?

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:58.940 align:middle line:84%
We need, for example--
of what needs to be done,

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:04.060 align:middle line:84%
we need to restore the nation
to a sound monetary system.

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.900 align:middle line:84%
We need to abolish
the Federal Reserve.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:10.840 align:middle line:84%
We need to do a lot
of things, and nobody

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.430 align:middle line:84%
will disagree on
most of these things,

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:middle line:90%
but that's the first category.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.820 align:middle line:84%
The second category
is, well, how?

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.070 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to say we need
to do this, this, and this.

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:22.070 align:middle line:84%
We get letters to the
editor all the time

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:23.806 align:middle line:84%
from pundits saying,
well, don't you

00:12:23.806 --> 00:12:25.500 align:middle line:84%
know we need to do
this, this, and this?

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And I have to laugh because,
yeah, I do know that,

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:30.640 align:middle line:84%
but how are we going to do
that when the power to do

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.850 align:middle line:84%
this is in the
hands of our enemy?

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:38.540 align:middle line:84%
So the next part of
that question is, how?

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:44.310 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
the answer to that

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:48.310 align:middle line:84%
question-- I might approach it
from a hilarious point of view

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:51.120 align:middle line:90%
and say, well, very slowly.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.010 align:middle line:90%
And that is true.

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:55.580 align:middle line:84%
It can't all be done at once,
but that's not the real issue.

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:56.960 align:middle line:90%
How do we do it?

00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:03.500 align:middle line:84%
We have to do it with that
dreaded thing called power.

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:10.660 align:middle line:84%
One of my greatest mistakes,
I think, in my early awareness

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.460 align:middle line:84%
of this movement
is that I thought

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:16.910 align:middle line:84%
power, especially governmental
power, was the problem.

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:19.210 align:middle line:84%
Power of the state
was the problem,

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:25.322 align:middle line:84%
and so I would speak eloquently,
I hope, against power--

00:13:25.322 --> 00:13:27.280 align:middle line:84%
that we've got to avoid
concentration of power,

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.610 align:middle line:84%
and we've got to work to
eliminate power, reduce power

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:34.810 align:middle line:84%
everywhere we find it to allow
individuals to have the freedom

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:39.100 align:middle line:84%
to do what they want
without being coerced.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And then one morning
I woke up, literally.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.630 align:middle line:84%
I guess I'd been thinking
about it or dreaming about it,

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:47.010 align:middle line:90%
and I remember I woke up.

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:49.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember if I
actually sat up or not,

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:54.600 align:middle line:84%
but I felt like I did, and
I said, oh, we reject power.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.200 align:middle line:90%
We lose.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.200 align:middle line:84%
That was a hard thing
for me to grapple with,

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:05.840 align:middle line:84%
because I'd always been thinking
that power was the problem,

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.740 align:middle line:84%
and then I finally
realized that power

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:11.300 align:middle line:84%
is not the problem anymore
than guns are the problem.

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:12.970 align:middle line:90%
Guns don't kill people.

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:16.920 align:middle line:84%
People kill people with
guns, and the only thing

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:21.150 align:middle line:84%
more dangerous than having
guns is not having guns.

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I made the analogy
that the question with guns

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:32.840 align:middle line:84%
is not guns themselves, but the
conditions of gun ownership,

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:38.170 align:middle line:84%
and the freedom to have guns
versus regimenting society

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:40.150 align:middle line:90%
to eliminate guns, and so forth.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.750 align:middle line:84%
I recognize that if we
got rid of all guns,

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:45.160 align:middle line:84%
and it was only in the
hands of criminals, well,

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.550 align:middle line:84%
we'd know that the
criminal rules society.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:48.790 align:middle line:90%
So I made the analogy.

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:50.540 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, power
is not the problem,

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:53.750 align:middle line:84%
because if we don't
have the power

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:58.440 align:middle line:84%
to dislodge our enemy from these
positions of power that he has,

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.920 align:middle line:84%
he's going to stay
in those positions.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:06.780 align:middle line:84%
You cannot overcome power
without equal or greater power,

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:09.410 align:middle line:84%
and that was a
frightening thought to me,

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:13.520 align:middle line:84%
but it has mellowed well, and
I realize now after quite a few

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:16.790 align:middle line:84%
years of living with that
thought that it is true.

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:18.900 align:middle line:84%
The question then
is, well, how do

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:22.520 align:middle line:84%
we prevent-- if we strive
for power ourselves,

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:26.872 align:middle line:84%
we must reach out and acquire
the very political power,

00:15:26.872 --> 00:15:28.580 align:middle line:84%
and the power in the
media and everywhere

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.310 align:middle line:84%
else-- the very power that
our opponents now have

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:34.870 align:middle line:90%
if we want to succeed.

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:38.300 align:middle line:84%
That being the case,
how can we do that?

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And assuming we succeed,
how can we be sure

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:44.420 align:middle line:84%
that we ourselves now that we're
in control of this power don't

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:48.420 align:middle line:84%
become just as corrupt and evil
as the people we're opposing?

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:52.194 align:middle line:84%
And therein lies the
answer to your question.

00:15:52.194 --> 00:15:54.110 align:middle line:84%
Can it be done, first
of all, is the question,

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:56.860 align:middle line:84%
and I am very firmly
convinced that it

00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:00.000 align:middle line:84%
can be done if we go
about it intelligently.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And then the question is,
well, how do we bring it about?

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:07.760 align:middle line:84%
It can be done if we're very
clear on what our goals are.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:11.710 align:middle line:84%
If everybody enlisted in this
movement has a very clear

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:15.350 align:middle line:84%
mental picture of what
we're trying to achieve,

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:18.880 align:middle line:84%
if we have a creed, for
example-- this we believe--

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:22.390 align:middle line:84%
and we really are
all on the same page,

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:25.190 align:middle line:84%
and we agree to a certain
statement of principles,

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:28.940 align:middle line:84%
and one of those principles is
that we cannot and must never

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:34.280 align:middle line:84%
use political power or the
legalized force of coercion

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:38.930 align:middle line:84%
to deny any person their freedom
unless it's to protect life,

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:40.370 align:middle line:90%
liberty, and property.

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:42.540 align:middle line:84%
If we are clear on
that, that those

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:46.240 align:middle line:84%
are the limits of coercion,
of legalized coercion,

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:51.040 align:middle line:84%
then the risk of fraud and
corruption is greatly reduced.

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Never completely
reduced, of course.

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And to fill in the
remainder of that risk

00:16:56.430 --> 00:17:00.420 align:middle line:84%
that people in our movement
could become just as

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:08.050 align:middle line:84%
guilty of oppression
as our present leaders,

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:10.280 align:middle line:84%
then we need a
watchdog committee.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:14.440 align:middle line:84%
We need a group of people
who are really aware, keenly

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.479 align:middle line:84%
aware of this problem
and who have dedicated

00:17:16.479 --> 00:17:20.940 align:middle line:84%
a major portion of their
lives to just become watchdogs

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.230 align:middle line:84%
over this whole thing,
and who will make sure

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:26.140 align:middle line:84%
that if anybody
steps out of line

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:29.080 align:middle line:84%
who is part of the movement and
they violate those principles,

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:31.430 align:middle line:84%
that they're called
immediately on it.

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:33.480 align:middle line:90%
I think it can be done.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.880 align:middle line:84%
I think it can be done,
and that's the reason

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:40.610 align:middle line:84%
that back in 2002, I
created an organization

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:41.620 align:middle line:90%
to bring all that about.

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:44.250 align:middle line:10%
It's called Freedom
Force International,

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:46.840 align:middle line:10%
and there's a lot to talk
about on that, but anybody

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:50.300 align:middle line:10%
that wants to know about
that and how what I just

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:53.840 align:middle line:10%
spoke about relates
to it, our website is

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:57.260 align:middle line:10%
freedomforceinternational.org,
O-R-G,

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:58.840 align:middle line:10%
standing for organization.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And our website
explains all about this,

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:07.180 align:middle line:84%
and basically what it is is that
we've created an organization--

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:12.310 align:middle line:84%
basically an organization
for non-joiners, people who

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:15.280 align:middle line:90%
recognize what the problem is.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.890 align:middle line:84%
History is full of
examples of people

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:22.290 align:middle line:84%
joining together and rising
up against a tyranny,

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:24.800 align:middle line:84%
and at great cost in
treasure and blood,

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.190 align:middle line:84%
they finally
overthrow the tyrant.

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.970 align:middle line:90%
And what happens?

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:30.410 align:middle line:84%
They replace him
with another one just

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:32.487 align:middle line:84%
like the one they
overthrew, maybe even worse.

00:18:32.487 --> 00:18:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And it maybe takes a
generation, and they've

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.600 align:middle line:84%
got to go through the
whole thing again.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.500 align:middle line:84%
So that's why people
in our movement

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.800 align:middle line:84%
understand why they're
overthrowing or trying

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.170 align:middle line:90%
to replace the tyrant.

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:48.470 align:middle line:84%
It's not because
he is a bad person.

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:53.130 align:middle line:84%
It's not his personality or the
kind of man or woman he may be

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:54.180 align:middle line:90%
or she may be.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.480 align:middle line:90%
It's what they believe in.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.580 align:middle line:84%
It's the structure, the system
that they're putting in place.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:02.540 align:middle line:84%
It's the system that
they defend and advocate.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:05.930 align:middle line:84%
So once we're clear on
that, then the replacements

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:08.960 align:middle line:84%
come along, and they
put in their place

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.550 align:middle line:84%
a different system, a
different system based

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:17.140 align:middle line:84%
not on collectivism, which is
the superiority of the group,

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:19.930 align:middle line:84%
but a system based
on individualism,

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:23.510 align:middle line:84%
which recognizes that the
individual is the core

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:25.920 align:middle line:90%
of society, not the group.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And more-- there's much
more to it than that,

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.570 align:middle line:84%
but I'm telling you about
this only as an example

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:34.680 align:middle line:84%
that these issues have
been thought about.

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.160 align:middle line:84%
They have been worked
on, and I believe

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:40.370 align:middle line:84%
the challenges have
been solved, and anybody

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:43.030 align:middle line:84%
that wants to become
part of this movement--

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:47.520 align:middle line:84%
I urge them to come to
freedomforceinternational.org

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.840 align:middle line:90%
and read about it.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think they'll be
very impressed by what

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:52.495 align:middle line:90%
we got started.

00:19:52.495 --> 00:19:53.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well,
thank you so much.

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:54.964 align:middle line:90%
It's been a real honor.

00:19:54.964 --> 00:19:56.130 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Thank you, David.

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:58.180 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for inviting me.

00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:01.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So we're hearing some
very good suggestions here.

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:04.260 align:middle line:84%
I totally agree with the idea
that a watchdog committee

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:06.140 align:middle line:90%
needs to be created.

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:09.420 align:middle line:84%
However, I think at that
non-linear nature of the way

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:12.990 align:middle line:84%
consciousness really works
is solving the problem.

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:14.870 align:middle line:90%
You are the watchdog.

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:16.230 align:middle line:10%
I am the watchdog.

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:19.700 align:middle line:10%
We are the watchdogs,
and as we awaken,

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:22.530 align:middle line:10%
we put the information
out on the internet,

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:24.440 align:middle line:10%
and we need to fight
back against all

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:27.450 align:middle line:10%
the lousy crappy stuff
where people haven't done

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:30.089 align:middle line:10%
their homework, and they're
alarmist, or they're racist,

00:20:30.089 --> 00:20:32.380 align:middle line:10%
and they make statements that
are anti-Semitic-- things

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:33.370 align:middle line:10%
like this.

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:36.510 align:middle line:84%
We need to focus on the
real nature of the problem.

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:41.450 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about a worldwide
organized crime cartel.

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:44.270 align:middle line:84%
Once we can dispense
with the labeling,

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:45.900 align:middle line:84%
we're not dealing
with a race war.

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:48.120 align:middle line:84%
We're not dealing
with a religious war.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.050 align:middle line:84%
It's not even
really a war at all.

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:54.600 align:middle line:84%
This is ultimately a vehicle
for human conscious evolution.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.540 align:middle line:84%
As we see what's
going on in the world,

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:59.570 align:middle line:84%
we start to get the
idea that the world may

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:03.450 align:middle line:84%
be a vast illusion, and that
so many of the things that we

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:08.240 align:middle line:84%
took for granted as being
reality are just a construct.

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.710 align:middle line:84%
So there's one level of this
where the construct is being

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:14.310 align:middle line:84%
generated by a secretive power
elite who are controlling

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:17.720 align:middle line:84%
the media, the government,
the judiciary, the military,

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:20.800 align:middle line:84%
the financial
system, but there's

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.930 align:middle line:84%
another level in which there is
an even greater illusion going

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:26.500 align:middle line:84%
on, and that's
the whole illusion

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:29.240 align:middle line:84%
of the physical
universe and the idea

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.280 align:middle line:84%
that there are, in
fact, divine beings who

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:35.490 align:middle line:84%
are orchestrating this and are
managing it behind the scenes.

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:39.750 align:middle line:84%
So there's lots more to discuss
about the secretive nature

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:43.600 align:middle line:84%
of the illusion and who's
hiding behind the curtain,

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.940 align:middle line:84%
so we're going to have a
lot more for you coming up

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:48.260 align:middle line:84%
in the next episode
of "Disclosure."

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:52.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, David Wilcock,
speaking truth to power

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:55.050 align:middle line:90%
and giving power to the truth.

00:21:55.050 --> 00:22:04.437 align:middle line:90%
