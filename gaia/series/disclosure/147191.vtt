>>DAVID WILCOCK:
Welcome to Disclosure.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, David Wilcock.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And in this episode, I'm going
to be interviewing Rich Dolan.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, Rich Dolan
has built a legacy.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.030 align:middle line:84%
He is actually a very
well-known author.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.830 align:middle line:90%
And he's been on television.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.070 align:middle line:84%
His books have been endorsed
by none other than the NASA

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.480 align:middle line:84%
astronaut and hero Edgar
Mitchell, Dr. Edgar Mitchell.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.370 align:middle line:84%
So Rich Dolan has built
a long-term program

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.300 align:middle line:90%
of getting the truth out.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is really the
core of disclosure.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.670 align:middle line:84%
When people hear
the word disclosure

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.930 align:middle line:90%
they usually think UFOs.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.460 align:middle line:84%
So Rich Dolan,
probably more than just

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.890 align:middle line:84%
about any other researcher
out there today,

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.560 align:middle line:84%
has really done what
for a lot of people

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.930 align:middle line:84%
would be the boring,
boring homework

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.630 align:middle line:84%
of poring through
all of the evidence

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.970 align:middle line:90%
that we actually do have.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.560 align:middle line:90%
What do I mean by that evidence?

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about reading the
staggeringly boring government

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.080 align:middle line:84%
documents that are just
all these blackout areas.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.870 align:middle line:84%
The Freedom of Information
Act that Jimmy Carter rammed

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.050 align:middle line:84%
through that we talk
about, forced the cabal

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.480 align:middle line:84%
to start releasing
documents that

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.150 align:middle line:90%
have very intense information.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.430 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, Rich
Dolan is a UFO historian.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And really we're
not going through

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:40.970 align:middle line:90%
the ancient alien stuff.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.380 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't get into that.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.280 align:middle line:84%
We're primarily now talking
about the dawning of the UFO

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.960 align:middle line:84%
era in the 20th century, which
is actually before Roswell--

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.400 align:middle line:90%
we get into that--

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.670 align:middle line:84%
and the government cover
up of the phenomenon.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.370 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot
of really cool data

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.960 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to be
getting into in this episode.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.399 align:middle line:90%
So I hope you enjoy it.

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, Rich, it's
great to have you here.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.510 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being on my show.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.010 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD M. DOLAN:
Thank you, David.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: All right.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.060 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Glad to be here.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: So this is Disclosure.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.670 align:middle line:10%
We are bringing the
ball onto the court.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.390 align:middle line:10%
And I am ready to kick.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.190 align:middle line:10%
>>DOLAN: All right.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.530 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: So let's have
some fun with this.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.400 align:middle line:10%
Now, you have really
distinguished yourself

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.050 align:middle line:10%
in several respects.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.420 align:middle line:84%
Because let me just play the
devil's advocate for a second.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Let's say I'm a skeptic,
and I've got you.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think that I'm going to
intimidate you, make fun of you

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.910 align:middle line:90%
on camera.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.520 align:middle line:90%
You don't have any evidence.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.720 align:middle line:90%
There is no evidence.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.520 align:middle line:90%
You're a UFO freak.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.440 align:middle line:90%
Ufologist?

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.650 align:middle line:90%
TV personality?

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.080 align:middle line:90%
Give me a break, dude.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.100 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: I know, right?

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Cut your hair.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.259 align:middle line:90%
Shave the beard.

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:54.300 align:middle line:84%
Back to the old days, what
you used to look like.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: What's
goin' on with Dolan?

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.600 align:middle line:90%
What's happening to that guy?

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What has
happened to you, dude?

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.470 align:middle line:10%
>>DOLAN: Well, let's
start with evidence.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.540 align:middle line:10%
You know, what is evidence?

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.390 align:middle line:10%
One thing that I would
always come back to

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.510 align:middle line:10%
is we have to understand
what kind of evidence

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.200 align:middle line:10%
are we talking about.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.156 align:middle line:90%
So there's--

00:03:11.156 --> 00:03:12.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But
there's no evidence!

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, there's at least
we have documentary evidence.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.050 align:middle line:10%
And by that, I simply mean that
in the history of our nation

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.740 align:middle line:10%
of the United States, we have
this thing called the Freedom

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.040 align:middle line:10%
of Information Act, which
has its ups and downs over

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.750 align:middle line:10%
the years, but had I guess,
I would say relatively an up

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.330 align:middle line:10%
period during the late 1970s--
thank you, Jimmy Carter--

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.550 align:middle line:10%
when it would be possible
to shake that tree a bit

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.270 align:middle line:10%
and get some documents out.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.070 align:middle line:10%
Documents--

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.660 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: How would
somebody do that?

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.670 align:middle line:10%
>>DOLAN: Well, you
file a FOIA request.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:41.470 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.570 align:middle line:10%
>>DOLAN: So you petition
various branches

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.230 align:middle line:10%
of the government
of the military,

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.440 align:middle line:10%
whether it's CIA or
Air Force Intelligence

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.440 align:middle line:10%
or any other specific
departments for documents

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.950 align:middle line:10%
relevant to the subject of UFOs.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:53.750 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So who's got
the gun that's pointed

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:56.780 align:middle line:90%
at these government agencies?

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:57.580 align:middle line:90%
Why do they care?

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.050 align:middle line:84%
Why would they answer
your FOIA request?

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Well, often they don't.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.926 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Often, they do not.

00:04:02.926 --> 00:04:05.990 align:middle line:84%
But as I was saying, in the
'70s, Jimmy Carter issued

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:11.840 align:middle line:84%
an executive order that
mandated federal agencies to--

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the exact
wording, but fairly

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.550 align:middle line:84%
to comply with FOIA
requests as long as they

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:19.050 align:middle line:84%
weren't really going to, like,
impinge on national security.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.850 align:middle line:90%
But the--

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So they could
potentially get defunded

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.396 align:middle line:84%
by the executive branch if
they didn't comply with these

00:04:25.396 --> 00:04:27.020 align:middle line:84%
requests, because
it's a presidential--

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Well, in theory, yes.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.170 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: You know,
Carter had his own issues

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.580 align:middle line:84%
with various branches of
the federal government.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.830 align:middle line:84%
He had his own battles
that he fought.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
lot of resistance.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.100 align:middle line:84%
But my basic point is that
we've gotten, I think,

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.230 align:middle line:84%
probably about 20,000
pages worth of documents

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.965 align:middle line:90%
related to UFOs over the years.

00:04:47.965 --> 00:04:49.340 align:middle line:84%
More than half of
those have come

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.631 align:middle line:90%
from the Carter Administration.

00:04:50.631 --> 00:04:52.069 align:middle line:84%
So that's great
for Jimmy Carter,

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:53.360 align:middle line:90%
not so great for everyone else.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: But--

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.096 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: That was
when it started?

00:04:56.096 --> 00:04:58.820 align:middle line:84%
Or there's some from
before then, obviously?

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, the first version
of the Freedom of Information

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:02.940 align:middle line:90%
Act actually was from 1966.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:03.740 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:04.850 align:middle line:10%
>>DOLAN: That was during
the Johnson years.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.308 align:middle line:84%
But it really didn't
have any teeth

00:05:06.308 --> 00:05:07.850 align:middle line:90%
in terms of public policy.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.700 align:middle line:10%
So you could petition things
for your own personal records

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:11.850 align:middle line:10%
and so forth.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:12.650 align:middle line:90%
During--

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.941 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But also, some of
these declassified documents

00:05:14.941 --> 00:05:17.590 align:middle line:84%
that leaked during the
Carter Administration

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.514 align:middle line:84%
were, obviously, old by
the time they leaked.

00:05:20.514 --> 00:05:21.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: That's right.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: They're
not necessarily new.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:23.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Most of them were old.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:24.890 align:middle line:90%
A few were new at the time--

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:25.275 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:05:25.275 --> 00:05:26.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: --significantly.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.150 align:middle line:90%
But, no, you're right.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.714 align:middle line:84%
But the significance
of those documents,

00:05:30.714 --> 00:05:33.130 align:middle line:84%
this is what really drew me
into the field to begin with--

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.794 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: --was the existence
of a documentary record

00:05:36.794 --> 00:05:38.710 align:middle line:84%
that did not prove UFOs
were extraterrestrial.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.770 align:middle line:84%
It did not prove that they
were alien, necessarily.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:42.790 align:middle line:90%
But it did prove--

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.980 align:middle line:84%
didn't hint, it didn't
suggest, but it proved--

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.280 align:middle line:84%
that there was a phenomenon that
was occurring that the United

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.780 align:middle line:84%
States military was very
concerned about that,

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.850 align:middle line:84%
officially speaking,
wasn't supposed to exist.

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:56.530 align:middle line:10%
And this phenomenon
involved objects

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.030 align:middle line:10%
that were seen and
tracked sometimes

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.210 align:middle line:10%
on radar that appeared
to be disk shaped,

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.400 align:middle line:10%
that had performance
capabilities that were simply

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.400 align:middle line:10%
not supposed to be,
incredible speeds,

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.850 align:middle line:10%
incredible maneuverability.

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And furthermore, these
objects-- and this is all

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.860 align:middle line:90%
in the documentary record--

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:16.810 align:middle line:84%
showed an inordinate interest
in very sensitive installations.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.702 align:middle line:90%
So we're talking Los Alamos.

00:06:18.702 --> 00:06:20.410 align:middle line:84%
We're talking Oak
Ridge Nuclear Facility.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.990 align:middle line:84%
We're talking the Hanford
Nuclear Facility in Washington

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.340 align:middle line:84%
and many others, which
especially in the 1940s

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.260 align:middle line:84%
and '50s, were very,
very, very sensitive.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.430 align:middle line:84%
You just didn't fly
over these places.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.090 align:middle line:90%
This is nuclear technology.

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:35.230 align:middle line:90%
And yet, objects were.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I actually
met a skeptic recently.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.310 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know they
still existed.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:39.940 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:40.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: They're out there.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: --some people still
don't believe this stuff.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:42.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Right.

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:44.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So let's
give them the benefit

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.180 align:middle line:90%
of the doubt for a second.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Project Blue Book said
it's all swamp gas.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.970 align:middle line:84%
It's all flocks of
geese, and clouds,

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.300 align:middle line:84%
and people having mass
hysteria and hallucinations.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.617 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, this is
why a good understanding

00:06:57.617 --> 00:06:59.450 align:middle line:84%
of the history is
important in understanding

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.122 align:middle line:90%
Blue Book and everything else.

00:07:02.122 --> 00:07:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Let's get to Blue
Book in a second.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:04.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: I think the
key point that I--

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You're saying there
are real documents that show--

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:09.535 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Yeah, these are
officially declassified

00:07:09.535 --> 00:07:10.535 align:middle line:90%
US government documents.

00:07:10.535 --> 00:07:12.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: --flying
saucers that are

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.650 align:middle line:84%
targeting our nuclear facilities
and military installations.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:16.450 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yes.

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:17.449 align:middle line:90%
That is what I'm saying.

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And furthermore, that
a number of these

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.450 align:middle line:84%
were seen visually by
qualified Air Force pilots,

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.850 align:middle line:90%
Navy pilots describing them.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And on a few occasions,
you get simultaneous radar

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:28.150 align:middle line:90%
plus visual tracking.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:29.352 align:middle line:90%
So these things were real.

00:07:29.352 --> 00:07:30.560 align:middle line:90%
And they were treated a real.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.860 align:middle line:84%
When you read the
documents themselves,

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.500 align:middle line:84%
it's obvious to anyone
with a brain in their head

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.410 align:middle line:84%
that the tone of these
documents is such

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.540 align:middle line:84%
that these were
considered quite serious.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:40.720 align:middle line:90%
My--

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.094 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you
could potentially

00:07:42.094 --> 00:07:46.390 align:middle line:84%
have a guy on the ground, a guy
who's a pilot in an airplane,

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:50.860 align:middle line:84%
and a radar operator all getting
simultaneous confirmation

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:55.090 align:middle line:84%
of a massive object in the sky
that's doing unconventional

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:56.080 align:middle line:90%
acrobatics.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: I would say
that's about right.

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:01.120 align:middle line:84%
There are a few cases
where you get that type

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.412 align:middle line:90%
of a triangulation, let's say--

00:08:02.412 --> 00:08:03.211 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:08:03.211 --> 00:08:04.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: --of a
really good sighting.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.910 align:middle line:90%
As a matter of fact, during 19--

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:08.500 align:middle line:84%
I think it was--
'51, the Air Force

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:13.870 align:middle line:84%
was engaged in a triangulation
project of very, very unusual

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.950 align:middle line:90%
phenomenon over Los Alamos.

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: And the thing is, like,
from late '40s into the '50s,

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:20.388 align:middle line:90%
there was a phenomenon.

00:08:20.388 --> 00:08:22.630 align:middle line:90%
They call them green fireballs.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:25.150 align:middle line:84%
They weren't meteorological
in any way, though.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And you'd find these
low horizontal green

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:32.320 align:middle line:84%
glowing things that were
delocalized over Los Alamos

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.090 align:middle line:84%
and going into Western
Texas, all of which

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:38.140 align:middle line:84%
there was highly technical US
military installations there.

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:38.940 align:middle line:90%
So the question--

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Are these like
grapefruit size, or basketball,

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.049 align:middle line:90%
or bigger?

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:43.294 align:middle line:90%
What's the estimated size?

00:08:43.294 --> 00:08:47.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: I would say larger,
larger, 20, 30, 40, 50

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.910 align:middle line:90%
feet diameter sometimes.

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:49.150 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:49.400 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: And they
were highly localized.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And this caused-- this
is no argument anywhere,

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.470 align:middle line:84%
we have the documentary
record of it--

00:08:56.470 --> 00:09:00.550 align:middle line:84%
a series of very, very high
level meetings among the power

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:02.980 align:middle line:84%
scientists and military
people of that era,

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.530 align:middle line:84%
including FBI, Air
Force, Intelligence.

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:07.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we don't have
are all the details of it.

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:11.099 align:middle line:84%
But we do know that this was a
real head-scratcher for them.

00:09:11.099 --> 00:09:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And as a result,
the Air Force set up

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.070 align:middle line:84%
something called
Project Twinkle--

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:16.450 align:middle line:90%
interesting name.

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:19.120 align:middle line:10%
And what's
interesting about that

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.600 align:middle line:10%
is the official conclusion
of Project Twinkle was,

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.120 align:middle line:10%
nah, no real results
were obtained.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.890 align:middle line:10%
When you read the
Project Twinkle report,

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:29.430 align:middle line:10%
though, you find it's
exactly the opposite.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And on at least
one occasion, there

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:33.880 align:middle line:84%
was a triangulation of an
object 30 feet in diameter,

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.060 align:middle line:84%
100,000 feet
altitude, 100,000 feet

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:40.390 align:middle line:84%
altitude, moving at some
ridiculously fast speed,

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.310 align:middle line:84%
in multiple thousands
of miles per hour.

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:46.540 align:middle line:10%
And this was triangulated
by Air Force instruments

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.435 align:middle line:10%
called cinetheodolites.

00:09:48.435 --> 00:09:51.520 align:middle line:10%
So they're like telescopes
with measuring instrumentation

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.510 align:middle line:10%
on them to measure the altitude
and angle and so forth.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:56.930 align:middle line:90%
The point is that they got it.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's just one
example of many.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:09:58.990 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:00.114 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: But wasn't there--

00:10:00.114 --> 00:10:01.404 align:middle line:90%
there was a dark night.

00:10:01.404 --> 00:10:02.320 align:middle line:90%
What did they call it?

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.920 align:middle line:84%
There was a satellite
object orbiting the Earth

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.544 align:middle line:90%
before we had satellites.

00:10:07.544 --> 00:10:09.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: That seems
to be correct, yeah.

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:10.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:11.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: That seems
to be the case.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:13.987 align:middle line:84%
Getting official documentary
evidence of that,

00:10:13.987 --> 00:10:15.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm not aware of
that being out there.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:16.370 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:19.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: But we can say
that a number of people

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.650 align:middle line:84%
within the military were
talking about this in the '50s.

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is before
Sputnik, so, yeah.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.115 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Is the green
fireball similar in appearance

00:10:27.115 --> 00:10:29.490 align:middle line:84%
to what people were calling
foo fighters in World War II,

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:31.110 align:middle line:90%
or is this something different?

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Good question.

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:36.180 align:middle line:84%
What we call the foo
fighters would be,

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.000 align:middle line:84%
typically, they were kind
of a bright white type

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.040 align:middle line:90%
of glowing thing.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.550 align:middle line:90%
The behavior would be different.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:44.790 align:middle line:84%
So like if you were on a
bomber mission over Europe

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:46.710 align:middle line:84%
in the Second World
War, an object

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:50.620 align:middle line:84%
would sometimes descend
to where you are,

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.880 align:middle line:84%
follow you for a certain period
of time, and then zoom off.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.362 align:middle line:84%
And so the behavior
would be different.

00:10:56.362 --> 00:10:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And they never
took any hostile action

00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.982 align:middle line:90%
towards our pilots?

00:10:59.982 --> 00:11:02.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: On one or two
occasions, it may be the case.

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:04.356 align:middle line:84%
I was looking at the research
of Dr. Joseph Farrell.

00:11:04.356 --> 00:11:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Who really looked
into this a lot.

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And he made me aware at
least one instance where--

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:13.280 align:middle line:84%
a couple of instances
where they seemed

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:18.930 align:middle line:84%
to cause a little bit of engine
sputtering and malfunction.

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:22.711 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, there's
nothing overtly hostile

00:11:22.711 --> 00:11:24.210 align:middle line:84%
that I think we can
really point to.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:24.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.483 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: But the
thing about evidence,

00:11:26.483 --> 00:11:28.320 align:middle line:84%
I think it's important
to show that.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And this was always
the key for me.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.680 align:middle line:84%
You have an overwhelming
documentary trail

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.500 align:middle line:84%
showing that on a
number of occasions

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.720 align:middle line:84%
you have high levels
of concern over objects

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.880 align:middle line:84%
that, again, were doing
things that were not

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:42.880 align:middle line:90%
supposed to be possible.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.463 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
the government's

00:11:44.463 --> 00:11:46.588 align:middle line:84%
saying nothing to it, as
Blue Book would be saying.

00:11:46.588 --> 00:11:47.387 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:11:47.387 --> 00:11:49.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: We've got
it all figured out,

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:50.430 align:middle line:90%
nothing to see here.

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:52.860 align:middle line:84%
My favorite of the
declassified documents

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:54.520 align:middle line:84%
doesn't deal with
sightings, per se.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:58.866 align:middle line:84%
But it's a memo to the
director of the CIA in 1952.

00:11:58.866 --> 00:12:00.240 align:middle line:10%
The director of
the CIA was a guy

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.870 align:middle line:10%
named Walter Bedell
Smith, who kind of famous

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:05.130 align:middle line:10%
in his own right.

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:07.920 align:middle line:10%
The Director of Scientific
Intelligence of the CIA

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:11.400 align:middle line:10%
sends him a memo in December
of '52 right toward the end

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.800 align:middle line:10%
of the Truman Administration.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And the memo has a paragraph
where it says-- this is,

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:18.690 align:middle line:90%
I think, a verbatim quote--

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:21.960 align:middle line:84%
at this time, reports of unknown
objects at high altitudes

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.770 align:middle line:84%
in the vicinity of sensitive
US defense installations

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:27.990 align:middle line:84%
are of such nature
that they are not

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:30.510 align:middle line:84%
attributable to natural
phenomena or known

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.400 align:middle line:90%
types of aerial vehicles--

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.080 align:middle line:90%
pretty straightforward.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I
would love to know

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.370 align:middle line:84%
what would have happened
if that memo had gotten out

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:41.380 align:middle line:90%
to the public in 1952.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, 1952's
a very important year.

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:44.460 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to talk about it more.

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:45.334 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yes, indeed.

00:12:45.334 --> 00:12:46.410 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:50.325 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I'm sure you're aware
there were all kinds of--

00:12:50.325 --> 00:12:53.381 align:middle line:84%
a cluster of sightings started
to occur around Washington DC.

00:12:53.381 --> 00:12:54.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: It's a very big year.

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:56.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So why don't
you tell us about that?

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Well, sure.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:03.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, 1952 in the
history of the old days

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.310 align:middle line:84%
of Project Blue
Book from the 1950s

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:09.000 align:middle line:84%
and '60s, basically, was
the biggest year they had.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.580 align:middle line:84%
I think they had something
over 1,500 sightings.

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And something like a third
of them were unknown.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.624 align:middle line:90%
And many of them were military.

00:13:17.624 --> 00:13:18.790 align:middle line:90%
I guess you could say that--

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You mean
witnesses were military?

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:21.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Quite a few, yeah.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:21.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:21.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: A lot of civilian--

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So there
could a lot of people

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.245 align:middle line:84%
that didn't report
things, because they

00:13:24.245 --> 00:13:27.315 align:middle line:84%
don't want to be intimidated, or
they don't want to be harassed.

00:13:27.315 --> 00:13:29.954 align:middle line:84%
But these are just
documented reports.

00:13:29.954 --> 00:13:30.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: That's right.

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:31.670 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:33.224 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: 1,500.

00:13:33.224 --> 00:13:34.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: That's right.

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Not all of those were
military, but many were.

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And many of them involve
violations of airspace

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:41.290 align:middle line:84%
over installations,
so kind of a big deal.

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:44.190 align:middle line:84%
For two weekends in a
row in July of that year,

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:49.830 align:middle line:84%
there were significant
sightings of unknown things

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:51.910 align:middle line:84%
over the Capitol
in Washington DC--

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:52.710 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: --such that it made
the front page of The New York

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:55.770 align:middle line:90%
Times.

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And it actually bumped the
Democratic National Convention

00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.830 align:middle line:90%
off the front page.

00:13:58.830 --> 00:13:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:00.664 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: It was
a very big thing.

00:14:00.664 --> 00:14:03.780 align:middle line:84%
We know that President Truman
was getting information

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.100 align:middle line:90%
about this as it was happening.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.350 align:middle line:90%
It was of interest to him.

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And then, of
course, what we know

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:12.307 align:middle line:84%
is that the Air Force held their
very large press conference

00:14:12.307 --> 00:14:13.140 align:middle line:90%
as a result of this.

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And they said, basically, to
put the whole matter to sleep,

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.540 align:middle line:90%
they said, well, it's true.

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.080 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
all of these are.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.450 align:middle line:84%
But we do feel with
more information,

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:22.410 align:middle line:90%
we could identify them all.

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:24.670 align:middle line:84%
We do not feel this is a
matter of national security.

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:26.730 align:middle line:84%
The sightings of the past
weekends, we believe,

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.550 align:middle line:84%
had to do with
weather phenomenon,

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:33.060 align:middle line:84%
basically, screwing up the
radar and causing false visuals.

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:34.570 align:middle line:90%
No one believed it.

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:36.550 align:middle line:84%
None of the traffic
controllers accepted it,

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:38.520 align:middle line:84%
but they weren't
allowed to talk.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And what we find in the
classified documentation

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.570 align:middle line:84%
that we have is that no
one in the classified world

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:43.370 align:middle line:90%
accepted that.

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:45.890 align:middle line:84%
They all knew it was just
for public consumption.

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:47.280 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Well, but there was--

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.988 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one of the
things that did happen

00:14:48.988 --> 00:14:53.029 align:middle line:84%
was you have a fleet that
goes over the US Capitol.

00:14:53.029 --> 00:14:54.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, you
might be referring

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:59.856 align:middle line:84%
to a very famous photograph of
a large number of light objects

00:14:59.856 --> 00:15:01.230 align:middle line:84%
that seem to be
over the Capitol.

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:01.440 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: That's been debated,
and debated, and debated.

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:03.750 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:07.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Is it a
photographic effect?

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:11.070 align:middle line:84%
One argument is that those were
the photographic reflection

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:13.200 align:middle line:84%
of the streetlights
that were below.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.410 align:middle line:90%
You could make that argument.

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:15.659 align:middle line:90%
I don't know that that's true.

00:15:15.659 --> 00:15:18.930 align:middle line:84%
But even if it was, the point
is that there were multiple--

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:22.260 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say a fleet-- but
multiple unknowns over DC

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:23.220 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:26.190 align:middle line:84%
There were attempts to
intercept them and investigate.

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:27.780 align:middle line:84%
Some of those pilots
were able to get

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.160 align:middle line:90%
visuals, fleeting visuals.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.870 align:middle line:84%
There was definitely
something there--

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:33.340 align:middle line:84%
very enigmatic
phenomenon, for sure.

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:35.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And then the
Air Force actually tells

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:37.770 align:middle line:84%
the American public a few days
after that press conference,

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.930 align:middle line:84%
please stop asking
us about UFOs,

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:42.534 align:middle line:84%
because you're
messing up our work.

00:15:42.534 --> 00:15:44.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Basically, yes, I
would say that's probably

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:46.860 align:middle line:90%
about what they were doing.

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:48.580 align:middle line:84%
In the classified
world, as a result--

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:49.920 align:middle line:90%
this is all fascinating history.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.545 align:middle line:84%
So in the classified
world, as a result

00:15:51.545 --> 00:15:55.620 align:middle line:84%
of this huge upsurge
in sightings,

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:57.450 align:middle line:84%
one of the things
they wanted to do is,

00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:58.950 align:middle line:90%
again, put this to sleep.

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:02.250 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want the public
to get worked up over this.

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And one of the official
arguments they gave

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.939 align:middle line:84%
is, well, it will clog military
communication channels.

00:16:07.939 --> 00:16:10.230 align:middle line:84%
You know, what if the Russians
were to cause an attack,

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:12.261 align:middle line:84%
and people are talking
about all these UFOs?

00:16:12.261 --> 00:16:14.635 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get all messed
up with our communications.

00:16:14.635 --> 00:16:17.400 align:middle line:84%
It's just a really
ridiculous argument.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.400 align:middle line:84%
The memo that I referred
to, the CIA memo,

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.040 align:middle line:84%
really came in the
whole aftermath of this

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:27.180 align:middle line:84%
as the CIA was planning,
really the last bit

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:29.730 align:middle line:84%
of housecleaning of the
Truman Administration

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:31.272 align:middle line:90%
was related to UFOs.

00:16:31.272 --> 00:16:33.480 align:middle line:84%
It was the last weekend of
the Truman Administration,

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.160 align:middle line:90%
January of 1953.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:38.190 align:middle line:84%
The hold was called the
Robertson Panel, kind of famous

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:39.540 align:middle line:90%
among the researchers.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:42.050 align:middle line:84%
It was a CIA organized
scientific study

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:45.552 align:middle line:90%
of UFOs in the classified world.

00:16:45.552 --> 00:16:47.760 align:middle line:10%
What we know about it is
that the conclusions of that

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.830 align:middle line:10%
were written before
they even convened.

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:52.090 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: That's a
very convenient.

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:54.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Why bring
these guys in?

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:56.010 align:middle line:90%
They're all Nobel caliber guys.

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:58.650 align:middle line:90%


00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:00.300 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, there was an agenda.

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And the agenda was to keep
this at a more tightly

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:08.099 align:middle line:84%
classified level, and also
to debunk this to the public.

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And that was actually one of
the official recommendations.

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:11.330 align:middle line:90%
Work with Disney.

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:16.470 align:middle line:84%
Work with major media to educate
and debunk the matter relating

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:17.970 align:middle line:90%
to UFOs for the general public.

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:20.490 align:middle line:84%
Because they did not want
people to start getting

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:21.359 align:middle line:90%
worked up over this.

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:23.069 align:middle line:84%
As far as they were
concerned, this

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:27.210 align:middle line:84%
was a matter for us to worry
about, not the general public.

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:30.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: If you want to maintain
power and somebody shows up

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:33.360 align:middle line:84%
with better power
than you have in terms

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.780 align:middle line:84%
of their hardware, in terms
of their capabilities,

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:40.500 align:middle line:84%
in terms of their ability to
deceive and to have remained

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:45.030 align:middle line:84%
concealed for this long,
there would be, obviously,

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:46.765 align:middle line:90%
some public concern.

00:17:46.765 --> 00:17:48.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Well, absolutely.

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:49.284 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:17:49.284 --> 00:17:50.325 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: So I think now--

00:17:50.325 --> 00:17:50.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: You know, for sure.

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.218 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: --because we've had
this acclimation program going

00:17:53.218 --> 00:17:56.460 align:middle line:84%
on for the public, people
get angry at the government

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:59.130 align:middle line:84%
and say, these
sons of-- you know.

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:02.454 align:middle line:84%
But if they had
told the public, it

00:18:02.454 --> 00:18:03.870 align:middle line:84%
would have been
messy at the time.

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:05.786 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Oh, they have
my total sympathy here.

00:18:05.786 --> 00:18:07.380 align:middle line:10%
I mean, think about
what Harry Truman

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:08.650 align:middle line:10%
had to be thinking about.

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:09.940 align:middle line:10%
Let's say Roswell happened.

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:10.740 align:middle line:10%
I think it did.

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:11.590 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:13.800 align:middle line:10%
>>DOLAN: I think there
was the retrieval and not

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.180 align:middle line:10%
simply Roswell, but
let's just focus on that.

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:20.025 align:middle line:84%
So you have the retrieval
of highly exotic technology

00:18:20.025 --> 00:18:21.900 align:middle line:84%
that was not manufactured
by human hands that

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.490 align:middle line:90%
comes from elsewhere.

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And you have, almost certainly,
bodies and, very possibly,

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:27.700 align:middle line:90%
one live creature.

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:28.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:29.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: I think there's a
good reason to believe this.

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:31.123 align:middle line:90%
So let's just say that happened.

00:18:31.123 --> 00:18:32.070 align:middle line:90%
So you're Truman.

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:33.736 align:middle line:84%
And this has now been
put onto your lab.

00:18:33.736 --> 00:18:35.025 align:middle line:90%
And it's 1947.

00:18:35.025 --> 00:18:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And you've got this whole
crazy world to deal with.

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:38.190 align:middle line:90%
We've just ended World War II.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:39.815 align:middle line:84%
You've got millions
of homeless people,

00:18:39.815 --> 00:18:42.930 align:middle line:84%
millions on the brink of
starvation, a new Cold War

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:47.649 align:middle line:84%
erupting, spies trying to
get your nuclear secrets out.

00:18:47.649 --> 00:18:48.690 align:middle line:90%
And now, you've got this.

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, how
do you tell the world

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:56.280 align:middle line:84%
that this is the case
when you yourself

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.480 align:middle line:84%
don't know what you're dealing
with, all of these unknowns?

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.910 align:middle line:84%
So I think what one would do,
which is I think what happened,

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:04.840 align:middle line:84%
you would get your
top people around you.

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And you would say, we have to
figure out a game plan here,

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:07.770 align:middle line:90%
guys.

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:11.852 align:middle line:84%
And your job will be to have
the technology analyzed.

00:19:11.852 --> 00:19:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And your job will be
to manage the media,

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.510 align:middle line:84%
so they don't get too
worked up over this.

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:18.135 align:middle line:84%
And your job will be to find out
how bad public panic might be,

00:19:18.135 --> 00:19:19.895 align:middle line:90%
and all of the logical things.

00:19:19.895 --> 00:19:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what they did.

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:23.353 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Let's rewind the
tape even before Roswell

00:19:23.353 --> 00:19:25.230 align:middle line:90%
to the Battle of Los Angeles.

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:26.130 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Oh, indeed.

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:27.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Let's talk about that.

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:28.065 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Well, it's fascinating.

00:19:28.065 --> 00:19:28.865 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:19:28.865 --> 00:19:30.000 align:middle line:90%
So what happened there?

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.434 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: So now, the
whole US West Coast

00:19:32.434 --> 00:19:33.600 align:middle line:90%
is in a state of high alarm.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.933 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we're at war with Japan.

00:19:34.933 --> 00:19:36.875 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And it,
basically, just started.

00:19:36.875 --> 00:19:39.000 align:middle line:84%
So there could be an invasion
coming in from Japan.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:39.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: That's right.

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:40.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Everybody's
freaking out.

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.030 align:middle line:84%
It's worse than
9/11 for the time.

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:44.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: February 1942 is when
this happened, late February.

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.968 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You've got this
world villain, Hitler, who's

00:19:46.968 --> 00:19:48.310 align:middle line:90%
just become totally terrifying.

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:49.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Oh, yeah.

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:51.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: He invaded
Poland in 1939.

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:52.830 align:middle line:84%
It's been two years
of fear and buildup

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:55.030 align:middle line:84%
as we're just watching
him eat Europe alive.

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:55.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Exactly.

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:57.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Finally, the
Americans get thrown in.

00:19:57.850 --> 00:19:59.670 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want
to be in this war.

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:02.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, they have to, because
they could get rammed right up

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:04.740 align:middle line:90%
the backside by Japan.

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:05.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Right, exactly.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:09.210 align:middle line:84%
So what happened in Los Angeles
on the night of February 25,

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:10.350 align:middle line:90%
1942--

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:14.180 align:middle line:84%
this is all brand
new stuff here.

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:17.150 align:middle line:84%
You have small batteries
of military sort

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:18.600 align:middle line:90%
of doing coastal defense.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:19.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:23.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: There were Japanese
vessels not right on the coast,

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:26.770 align:middle line:84%
but, you know, a couple
of hundred miles off.

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And there were
engagements there.

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:31.130 align:middle line:84%
From time to time, they
would get a little closer.

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:34.550 align:middle line:84%
So there was a concern that the
Japanese would do something.

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:36.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in terms
of the invasion,

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:37.860 align:middle line:84%
it was really never
going to happen.

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:40.270 align:middle line:84%
But there was this
heightened concern for sure.

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:43.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Anti-aircraft guns went into
action against unidentified

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:47.290 align:middle line:84%
aircraft in the Los Angeles area
shortly after 3:00 AM Pacific

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:49.510 align:middle line:90%
War Time this morning.

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:51.560 align:middle line:84%
The anti-aircraft
guns began barking

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:55.170 align:middle line:84%
during a blackout ordered by
the fourth intercepted command

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:58.130 align:middle line:90%
at 2:25 AM.

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:00.650 align:middle line:84%
The unidentified object,
which some sources thought

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:03.890 align:middle line:84%
might be a blimp, moved
slowly down the Pacific Coast

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:05.750 align:middle line:90%
from Santa Monica.

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:07.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Alarms went off.

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:11.990 align:middle line:84%
You have an object
that was seen visually

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:13.700 align:middle line:90%
by quite a lot of people.

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And you had 1,430
rounds of artillery

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.360 align:middle line:84%
that were fired that night
at this object, which

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:23.090 align:middle line:84%
was photographed
rather well, which

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:25.500 align:middle line:84%
resulted in the deaths of
six residents of Los Angeles,

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:26.300 align:middle line:90%
by the way--

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: --three from the
shelling and three others

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:30.110 align:middle line:84%
attributed to heart
attacks from that.

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:31.737 align:middle line:90%
So this is a serious matter.

00:21:31.737 --> 00:21:33.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I had a
lady at my conference

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:34.970 align:middle line:90%
who went through this.

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And she said the
noise was so extreme.

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:40.130 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Exactly.

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:41.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: The kids woke up
in the middle of the night.

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:43.130 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't possibly
have slept through this.

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:44.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: No, no, exactly.

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:46.200 align:middle line:84%
An old deceased friend
of mine was a child

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.370 align:middle line:90%
who witnessed it as well.

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:48.690 align:middle line:90%
He was a great guy.

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:49.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:50.740 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was just deafening.

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:52.040 align:middle line:90%
It was, I mean, exciting.

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:53.030 align:middle line:90%
It was frightening.

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And it
wasn't like anything

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:56.224 align:middle line:84%
is having an effect
on this object.

00:21:56.224 --> 00:21:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, you had military
people watching this thing

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:05.150 align:middle line:84%
through binoculars and seeing
shells go off all around it.

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:07.700 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't come down.

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, there's
always skeptical arguments

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:12.930 align:middle line:84%
on the so-called
Battle of Los Angeles.

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:14.180 align:middle line:90%
I've reviewed them personally.

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just not
persuaded by them, one

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:19.700 align:middle line:84%
being that it was
jittery war nerves.

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And someone, they did light
a balloon, lighted balloons.

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And this was necessary to gauge
the direction of the wind,

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:30.890 align:middle line:84%
so that you could then, you
know, calibrate your artillery

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:31.910 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And someone suggested,
well, maybe they saw that.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.850 align:middle line:84%
But that's not it,
for a whole bunch

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:40.007 align:middle line:84%
of reasons in terms of the
time that it was aloft.

00:22:40.007 --> 00:22:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't account for the
radar tracking of the object.

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And it also doesn't
account for the visuals

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:46.340 align:middle line:90%
that people were getting.

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.180 align:middle line:84%
The great photograph
that we have of this

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.120 align:middle line:90%
is really a decent quality one.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I don't
know how obstinate one

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.380 align:middle line:84%
has to be to say that that does
not look like a flying saucer.

00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:01.070 align:middle line:84%
You've got these
bright lights focused

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:04.862 align:middle line:84%
on an object, which has been
picked apart and analyzed.

00:23:04.862 --> 00:23:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And it shows what looks to
me like a disk-shaped type

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:07.520 align:middle line:90%
of object.

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:07.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: And you see artillery
shells going off all around it.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:10.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: That's right.

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:12.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: But this
thing never came down.

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:14.321 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, I think it's
a fascinating thing.

00:23:14.321 --> 00:23:17.047 align:middle line:84%
And in the aftermath of that,
the US Secretary of the Navy,

00:23:17.047 --> 00:23:19.130 align:middle line:84%
a guy named Frank Knox,
goes and makes a statement

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:22.320 align:middle line:84%
and says, eh, nah, it
was all just war nerves,

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.710 align:middle line:84%
and basically trying to
attribute it to hysteria.

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:25.690 align:middle line:90%
No one bought it.

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:27.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: A few people actually
died of heart attacks,

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:28.830 align:middle line:84%
because it was so terrifying
to hear the sound.

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:29.390 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Correct, yeah.

00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:30.350 align:middle line:90%
That's right, a few.

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:33.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And I've also heard
that Hollywood producers, movie

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.750 align:middle line:84%
producers, got a really
good visual of it

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:39.350 align:middle line:84%
and that the craft you
see in "War of the Worlds"

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:40.300 align:middle line:90%
is that craft.

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:43.050 align:middle line:84%
It's just they stuck a
little periscope on top.

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:44.936 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Oh, that's
an interesting element

00:23:44.936 --> 00:23:45.810 align:middle line:90%
that I had not heard.

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:45.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: So that's interesting.

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:48.919 align:middle line:90%
That's very interesting.

00:23:48.919 --> 00:23:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: So this scared people.

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:51.043 align:middle line:90%
This was terrifying.

00:23:51.043 --> 00:23:51.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Oh, yeah.

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:55.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And the
woman who I spoke to--

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:58.132 align:middle line:84%
you know, it was
a massive shock.

00:23:58.132 --> 00:24:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, I think what we
can say as a result of this,

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:02.930 align:middle line:84%
at the very least, is that
the US military learned

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:06.110 align:middle line:84%
to clamp down on UFOs
a good five years

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:07.340 align:middle line:90%
or more before Roswell.

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:08.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: So it's
not that they had

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:11.657 align:middle line:90%
necessarily all the answers.

00:24:11.657 --> 00:24:14.240 align:middle line:84%
But this was not something that
they were going to talk about.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Because, again, how do you
talk about this to the world?

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:22.100 align:middle line:84%
Again, back to Harry
Truman's poor situation.

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:25.430 align:middle line:84%
He's confronted with
this reality, presumably.

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I could
see him thinking,

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:31.590 align:middle line:84%
it would be nice
to tell the world.

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:34.370 align:middle line:84%
But this is way too
disruptive for now.

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:37.850 align:middle line:84%
So maybe what we can
do is understand it.

00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And we can reconvene and decide
in a few years down the road

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.900 align:middle line:90%
if we want to reveal the secret.

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.000 align:middle line:84%
The problem with the
secrecy is that it develops

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.030 align:middle line:84%
its own momentum, its own
power, its own bureaucracy,

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:50.602 align:middle line:84%
its own profitability,
so that the incentive

00:24:50.602 --> 00:24:52.310 align:middle line:84%
for revealing this
secret eventually just

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:53.840 align:middle line:90%
goes down to nil.

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, now you have
expressed a personal belief

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:58.520 align:middle line:90%
that Roswell really happened.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And, again, for somebody who
hasn't been familiar with this,

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.800 align:middle line:84%
this is actual
hardware being dropped

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:10.190 align:middle line:84%
into the hands of the
United States military,

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:12.200 align:middle line:84%
hardware that is
far more advanced

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.440 align:middle line:84%
than the currently available
technology of the time.

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.280 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Exactly.

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:18.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So based on
your exhaustive records

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:20.620 align:middle line:84%
and all the documentation,
because you've

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:23.500 align:middle line:84%
been willing to pore through
all these Freedom of Information

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.900 align:middle line:84%
requests and all
these documents,

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.690 align:middle line:84%
do you think there
is probable cause

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:33.280 align:middle line:84%
to believe that our government
or the military industrial

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:37.840 align:middle line:84%
complex inherited
technology that maybe still

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:40.310 align:middle line:84%
isn't being given to us,
even though it's been, what,

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:41.110 align:middle line:90%
70 years later?

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:42.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Oh, I do
believe that, yes.

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.660 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:46.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: I think
that let's say you've

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:48.310 align:middle line:84%
got this magical piece
of the future right

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:52.750 align:middle line:84%
here in your hands, and you
don't yet understand it.

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:54.250 align:middle line:84%
It's very possible
that they still

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:56.320 align:middle line:84%
can't really replicate
some of the things

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.790 align:middle line:90%
that they've acquired.

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:00.100 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't mean that
these pieces of technology

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.680 align:middle line:90%
can't give them very good ideas.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Now some of these ideas
can be moneymakers,

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:09.302 align:middle line:84%
maybe integrated circuits or
improved maybe fiber optics

00:26:09.302 --> 00:26:10.135 align:middle line:90%
has been theorized--

00:26:10.135 --> 00:26:10.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:11.878 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: --and
high-tensile fibers,

00:26:11.878 --> 00:26:14.540 align:middle line:84%
a number of other
things, lasers maybe.

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And those are great ground
floor investment opportunities.

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:18.250 align:middle line:90%
So that's nice, right?

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:21.130 align:middle line:84%
You retire from your job
as a general in the Army,

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:24.334 align:middle line:84%
and you get a nice little senior
VP job with a General Electric

00:26:24.334 --> 00:26:25.750 align:middle line:84%
or some of these
other places that

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:27.200 align:middle line:90%
are working on the technology.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:27.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:29.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: But let's
go a little further.

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And this gets into
an idea that I've

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:33.280 align:middle line:84%
been developing, which is
called a breakaway civilization.

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:36.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think that this
is all part of the mix.

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:40.960 align:middle line:84%
So let's say some of these
breakthroughs are truly exotic.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.000 align:middle line:10%
Let's say they come up
with a breakthrough that

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.240 align:middle line:10%
deals with electrogravitics,
what we might call anti-gravity

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.200 align:middle line:10%
in one form or another.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:47.980 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:49.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: If you come up with
a breakthrough like that,

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:51.100 align:middle line:84%
that's a little more
of a game changer

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:55.090 align:middle line:84%
than you might be permitted to
segway into the private market.

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Because that might take
down the oil industry.

00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:58.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And we're driving around a
century old technology that's

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:02.050 align:middle line:90%
barely changed.

00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:02.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Oh, yes.

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: --steering
wheel, rubber tires,

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:04.300 align:middle line:90%
and gasoline. engine.

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Absolutely.

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:06.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: We can't do
better in 100 years?

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:07.429 align:middle line:90%
I mean, give me a break.

00:27:07.429 --> 00:27:09.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, I think
that we have done better.

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:11.382 align:middle line:90%
But the problem would be--

00:27:11.382 --> 00:27:13.340 align:middle line:84%
let's say, like, we're
in the classified world.

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:14.881 align:middle line:84%
So we're scientists
working on these.

00:27:14.881 --> 00:27:16.570 align:middle line:90%
And we've come up with it.

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:19.930 align:middle line:84%
We realize you don't need
petroleum to go from point A

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:24.460 align:middle line:84%
to point B. But at that
point, probably, our bosses

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:26.646 align:middle line:90%
would say, good job.

00:27:26.646 --> 00:27:28.270 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
let this one go out.

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:29.231 align:middle line:90%
Keep working on it.

00:27:29.231 --> 00:27:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And we'll continue to develop
classified applications.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens is
that the patent on that

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:34.390 align:middle line:90%
becomes classified.

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:36.160 align:middle line:84%
So that smart people
in the outside world

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:38.247 align:middle line:84%
who may come up with these
ideas are not legally

00:27:38.247 --> 00:27:39.830 align:middle line:84%
permitted to pursue
them, because it's

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:41.440 align:middle line:90%
classified technology.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.450 align:middle line:84%
So their future is
being held hostage.

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:45.010 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, we in
the classified world

00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:48.130 align:middle line:84%
continue to develop
this and work on, well,

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:50.860 align:middle line:84%
our own version of flying
saucers, which, of course, has

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:53.960 align:middle line:84%
been discussed and rumored and
leaked for many, many years,

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:55.630 align:middle line:90%
and I think is the case.

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:58.900 align:middle line:84%
So that what you have is
that science over there

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:03.156 align:middle line:84%
is being held hostage,
while we break away.

00:28:03.156 --> 00:28:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, and
you also know that--

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:05.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: And we move far ahead.

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:07.910 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: --the Federation of
American Scientists, FAS--

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:10.540 align:middle line:10%
fas.org is the website--

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:14.020 align:middle line:10%
found over 5,000 patents
have been classified

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:15.560 align:middle line:10%
for national security reasons.

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:16.360 align:middle line:10%
>>DOLAN: Oh, 5,000?

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.420 align:middle line:10%
I knew there was a large number.

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:17.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Over, 5,000.

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:18.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:18.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yeah.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And that
includes anything

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:24.080 align:middle line:84%
that has a better than 70%
ability to convert into energy.

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:29.560 align:middle line:84%
So a solar power system that
can take 80% of the sun's energy

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:33.056 align:middle line:84%
and turn into energy is
automatically classified.

00:28:33.056 --> 00:28:34.180 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: There you have it.

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's as much
proof as anyone might need--

00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:37.570 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:39.153 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: --that the
classified world's

00:28:39.153 --> 00:28:41.260 align:middle line:90%
holding our future hostage.

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And I would only add to that
that some of that knowledge

00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:49.870 align:middle line:84%
derives from acquired
technology, exotic technology

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:51.257 align:middle line:90%
from non-human sources.

00:28:51.257 --> 00:28:52.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Absolutely.

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:53.506 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Certainly,
not all of it.

00:28:53.506 --> 00:28:55.900 align:middle line:84%
But, again, you know, the
key about scientific progress

00:28:55.900 --> 00:29:00.370 align:middle line:84%
is that the first and biggest
step is simply knowing

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:01.691 align:middle line:90%
that such a thing is possible.

00:29:01.691 --> 00:29:03.190 align:middle line:84%
Once you know
something is possible,

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:04.730 align:middle line:90%
you'll find a way to do it.

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And once they realized
it's possible to get

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:09.220 align:middle line:84%
that type of lift, to get
that type of propulsion,

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:10.195 align:middle line:90%
they'll figure it out.

00:29:10.195 --> 00:29:12.070 align:middle line:84%
Even if they can't
replicate the exact method

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:15.670 align:middle line:84%
that these other guys are doing,
we figure our own way out.

00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, now, Edgar
Mitchell, obviously,

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:20.167 align:middle line:84%
one of the Apollo astronauts,
has given your book

00:29:20.167 --> 00:29:21.375 align:middle line:90%
some glowing recommendations.

00:29:21.375 --> 00:29:22.958 align:middle line:10%
>>DOLAN: I was very
lucky to get that.

00:29:22.958 --> 00:29:25.210 align:middle line:10%
He was actually
the first big name

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:26.520 align:middle line:10%
who endorsed any of my work.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:28.160 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: What did
he actually say?

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, he called it
"thorough and monumental."

00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's a quote that I'll
use for the rest of my life.

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:34.330 align:middle line:84%
When I get an Apollo
moon-walking astronaut

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:35.800 align:middle line:84%
who calls anything
I do monumental,

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy to repeat that.

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And he
also said that there

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:42.370 align:middle line:84%
is evidence from your books that
some of these extraterrestrials

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:44.907 align:middle line:84%
may be walking here on
Earth, or actually here?

00:29:44.907 --> 00:29:46.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Oh, did Edgar say that?

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:46.600 align:middle line:90%
Well--

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:47.599 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah, a quote--

00:29:47.599 --> 00:29:50.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: --it's something that
I think is a real likelihood,

00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:51.010 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:51.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: In my own
private research,

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.460 align:middle line:90%
I mean, people come to me.

00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:58.780 align:middle line:90%
I get all kinds of stories.

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:00.280 align:middle line:90%
As obviously, I know you do.

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:01.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: A number of individuals
have very compellingly told me

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:08.920 align:middle line:84%
of their own encounters with
very human looking beings who

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:09.730 align:middle line:90%
do not--

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:11.870 align:middle line:90%
they're not like you and me.

00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:13.860 align:middle line:84%
We're talking
intensely telepathic--

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:14.660 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:18.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: --and just
very, very different.

00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:19.440 align:middle line:90%
They're fascinating stories.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And when you get enough of
them, you really start to--

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.920 align:middle line:84%
you have to think,
you know, there's

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:28.760 align:middle line:84%
a presence of these other
people, other beings.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:31.390 align:middle line:84%
But they're not like us,
but they're in our society.

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:32.570 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:34.236 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: You know,
for whatever purpose.

00:30:34.236 --> 00:30:39.940 align:middle line:84%
If I were an alien here visiting
Earth looking at humanity,

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:43.650 align:middle line:84%
I would be thinking, these
people are quite interesting.

00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:46.520 align:middle line:84%
They've reinvented
themselves in a dramatic way

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:48.500 align:middle line:90%
in the last century or so.

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:51.400 align:middle line:10%
You know, from a world of
horses pulling wooden carts,

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:55.040 align:middle line:10%
they've developed locomotives,
and cars, and airplanes,

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:59.510 align:middle line:10%
and nuclear weapons, and
computers, and iPods,

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:02.690 align:middle line:10%
and nanotech, and quantum
computing down the road,

00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:04.340 align:middle line:10%
and everything else.

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:06.860 align:middle line:84%
We've reinvented ourselves
like this, so rapidly.

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:08.720 align:middle line:90%
And they must be aware of this.

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.650 align:middle line:84%
So if I were them,
I'd be thinking,

00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:12.900 align:middle line:90%
well, they're kind of violent.

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:14.440 align:middle line:90%
They're a little unstable.

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:18.080 align:middle line:84%
I might want to monitor
and maybe manage them.

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:21.714 align:middle line:84%
And I might be thinking,
we'll work our way in there.

00:31:21.714 --> 00:31:23.630 align:middle line:84%
If it hadn't been done
thousands of years ago,

00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:24.500 align:middle line:90%
I mean, who knows?

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:25.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: But certainly,
at this point,

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:30.230 align:middle line:84%
it would be more critical
than ever to make sure

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:33.900 align:middle line:84%
that they've got their fingers
in us in some way or another.

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:35.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to be
a fearmongerer here.

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:36.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: No,

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: But if I were to do
my own counterintelligence,

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.533 align:middle line:90%
that's what I would be thinking.

00:31:40.533 --> 00:31:41.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Sure.

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, this has been a
fascinating discussion.

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:46.956 align:middle line:84%
That's all the time we
have for this episode.

00:31:46.956 --> 00:31:48.330 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, we can
do another one.

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:49.190 align:middle line:90%
So, thank you, Rich.

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: My pleasure.

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:50.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: All right.

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:52.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Thanks, David.

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:57.560 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: So you can go
yourself to fas.org, Federation

00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:59.480 align:middle line:10%
of American Scientists.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And if you poke around
in there long enough,

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:04.260 align:middle line:84%
you'll start to see things
that the cabal doesn't

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:05.060 align:middle line:90%
want you to see.

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:08.540 align:middle line:84%
In fact, some of the top level
insiders I've spoken to have

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:10.670 align:middle line:84%
said that their
jobs specifically

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:14.630 align:middle line:84%
forbid them from visiting
that website at all.

00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:16.220 align:middle line:84%
They have bugs in
their computers.

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:17.900 align:middle line:90%
They have cookies and trackers.

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And if they're caught even
going to the website once,

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:23.640 align:middle line:90%
they'll lose their jobs.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:26.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Federation
of American Scientists

00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:29.930 align:middle line:84%
shows that there's
over 5,000 patents that

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:32.860 align:middle line:84%
have been classified
for national security.

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And this includes
anything that would even

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:38.640 align:middle line:84%
begin to get us towards a clean
renewable source of energy.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:42.484 align:middle line:84%
So this group, the cabal,
that's keeping the UFOs secret,

00:32:42.484 --> 00:32:44.150 align:middle line:84%
they don't want us
to have anti-gravity.

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:48.020 align:middle line:84%
They don't want us to have free
energy, because it interrupts

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:49.310 align:middle line:90%
their business.

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And when new competitors
can come out,

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:56.180 align:middle line:90%
their monopoly is threatened.

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:58.880 align:middle line:84%
So this is just the
beginning of the discussions

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:03.860 align:middle line:84%
that I've had with Rich Dolan on
the history of the UFO subject.

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And in the next
episode, we're going

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:07.910 align:middle line:84%
to go even deeper
down the rabbit hole

00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:11.510 align:middle line:84%
and discuss a whole lot of
very interesting things.

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:14.420 align:middle line:84%
So coming up next
time on Disclosure,

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:17.120 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
speaking truth to power

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:20.420 align:middle line:84%
and giving even more
power to the truth.

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:24.370 align:middle line:90%
