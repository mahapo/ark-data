>>DAVID WILCOCK: All right.

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:23.315 align:middle line:10%
Welcome to another
episode of "Disclosure."

00:00:23.315 --> 00:00:25.192 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, David Wilcock.

00:00:25.192 --> 00:00:27.861 align:middle line:10%
And I am here with
Dr. Pete Peterson.

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:29.529 align:middle line:10%
And in this episode,
we are going

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.201 align:middle line:10%
to get into some of the most
remarkable technology that he

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:37.621 align:middle line:10%
has developed, which takes
either of the human senses

00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:42.417 align:middle line:10%
as they exist or perhaps some
of the extrasensory perceptions

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:45.545 align:middle line:10%
of the human being and
actually brings those

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:47.923 align:middle line:10%
into a technological context.

00:00:47.923 --> 00:00:49.591 align:middle line:84%
So Pete, welcome
back to the show.

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:50.467 align:middle line:84%
>>PETE PETERSON:
Thank you, David.

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:52.928 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So I wanted to open
up the show today and talk

00:00:52.928 --> 00:00:58.850 align:middle line:84%
about your discoveries regarding
acupuncture points on the body.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.772 align:middle line:84%
Now, I just want to set this up
by saying that in "Source Field

00:01:03.772 --> 00:01:06.275 align:middle line:84%
Investigations," which I
had written a lot of it

00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:09.528 align:middle line:84%
before I ever met you, one
of the things I quoted from

00:01:09.528 --> 00:01:13.031 align:middle line:84%
was research by Dr. Robert
Becker in which he looked

00:01:13.031 --> 00:01:16.576 align:middle line:84%
at the electrical
activity on the skin

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:19.663 align:middle line:84%
and found that the most
electrically active points

00:01:19.663 --> 00:01:24.126 align:middle line:84%
on the body corresponded
precisely with what

00:01:24.126 --> 00:01:27.629 align:middle line:84%
Chinese acupuncture
texts already said

00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:30.299 align:middle line:90%
would be these meridian points.

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.887 align:middle line:84%
So how could these Chinese folks
have gotten that information

00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:38.140 align:middle line:84%
about the most electrically
active points in the body

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.515 align:middle line:90%
thousands of years ago?

00:01:39.515 --> 00:01:41.643 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well,
you're entering an area

00:01:41.643 --> 00:01:45.646 align:middle line:84%
that I've spent about
close to 40 years on.

00:01:45.646 --> 00:01:49.151 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very familiar
with that area.

00:01:49.151 --> 00:01:53.572 align:middle line:84%
And in the very beginning,
both Dr. Becker,

00:01:53.572 --> 00:01:57.075 align:middle line:84%
who was a brilliant, brilliant
researcher in my mind

00:01:57.075 --> 00:02:04.041 align:middle line:84%
and did a lot of things
that assisted me in learning

00:02:04.041 --> 00:02:04.875 align:middle line:90%
the very beginning--

00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:05.334 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, wow.

00:02:05.334 --> 00:02:06.209 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:08.252 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: It was
interesting that neither of us

00:02:08.252 --> 00:02:10.172 align:middle line:84%
knew anything about
acupuncture points.

00:02:10.172 --> 00:02:15.344 align:middle line:84%
And yet we each independently
and independently

00:02:15.344 --> 00:02:18.680 align:middle line:84%
from the Chinese
discovered these points.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.933 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until
actually I had a machine out

00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:25.187 align:middle line:84%
and being used by doctors
that one of them said, hey,

00:02:25.187 --> 00:02:26.855 align:middle line:84%
I just took a course
in acupuncture.

00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:29.649 align:middle line:84%
And these points you used
are all acupuncture points.

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:34.071 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what the heck
are acupuncture points?

00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:36.156 align:middle line:84%
All I knew was they
were energetic points

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:40.494 align:middle line:84%
that had to contain information
about internal organs

00:02:40.494 --> 00:02:41.411 align:middle line:90%
to the body.

00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:43.997 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, let me just say
this, Pete, just to kind of set

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:46.249 align:middle line:84%
this up, because
it's so bizarre.

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:49.878 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it strange that
acupuncture is now

00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:51.546 align:middle line:90%
FDA approved?

00:02:51.546 --> 00:02:55.091 align:middle line:84%
And yet the idea of sticking
a needle in somebody's body

00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:58.762 align:middle line:84%
and then it activating healing
in another part of the body

00:02:58.762 --> 00:03:02.808 align:middle line:84%
is completely foreign to any
other type of medical science

00:03:02.808 --> 00:03:03.600 align:middle line:90%
that we're using.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.437 align:middle line:84%
And yet because it works,
they just allow it to happen.

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:10.440 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, when you
get into medical science,

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.901 align:middle line:84%
you find out that medical
science used to be--

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:19.950 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion, and
I could probably

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.536 align:middle line:84%
find myself damaged
for saying this,

00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:29.584 align:middle line:84%
but doctors have no
idea how to diagnose.

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:35.215 align:middle line:84%
And I say that from finding
out how diagnosis takes place

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:39.177 align:middle line:84%
if you want real,
accurate diagnosis.

00:03:39.177 --> 00:03:43.598 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have
the sensitivity

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:47.102 align:middle line:90%
without a lot of training.

00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:50.522 align:middle line:84%
The human body doesn't have
enough sensitivity to do that.

00:03:50.522 --> 00:03:53.066 align:middle line:90%
We can't see inside the body.

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:58.321 align:middle line:84%
We can't see that there are
tumors growing here or there.

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:05.912 align:middle line:84%
We can't tell without laboratory
analysis whether it's cancer

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:09.458 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's a growth of
some kind, a different type

00:04:09.458 --> 00:04:10.500 align:middle line:90%
of growth.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.836 align:middle line:84%
We can't tell
whether it's benign

00:04:12.836 --> 00:04:17.923 align:middle line:90%
or whether it's destroying it.

00:04:17.923 --> 00:04:21.553 align:middle line:84%
And so we rely on
external instrumentation.

00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:23.138 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Like an
MRI or an X-ray?

00:04:23.138 --> 00:04:26.641 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Yeah, well, an
MRI or an X-ray or biochemical

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:29.060 align:middle line:90%
analysis.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.314 align:middle line:84%
A lot of things are done by
taking cells from the body,

00:04:32.314 --> 00:04:34.983 align:middle line:84%
isolating them, cloning
them, growing them,

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:36.401 align:middle line:84%
and seeing what
we get and saying,

00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:39.988 align:middle line:84%
oh, that person's got
cancer because I cloned

00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:41.239 align:middle line:90%
the cells that he had in him.

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:42.574 align:middle line:90%
And now he's got cancer cells.

00:04:42.574 --> 00:04:44.826 align:middle line:90%
What type of cancer?

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:47.120 align:middle line:84%
Can we treat it
with chemotherapy?

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.623 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But why do
you think the FDA would

00:04:49.623 --> 00:04:52.292 align:middle line:90%
make acupuncture legal?

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:54.503 align:middle line:84%
Nobody ever talks about
the fact that the science

00:04:54.503 --> 00:04:56.129 align:middle line:84%
is totally different
than anything else

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:57.797 align:middle line:90%
that they approve of.

00:04:57.797 --> 00:04:59.382 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Basically,
what they found

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:01.384 align:middle line:84%
was when they called
it bad, they found out

00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:03.762 align:middle line:90%
that they were wrong in court.

00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:07.557 align:middle line:90%
And acupuncture is very simple.

00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:11.353 align:middle line:84%
And it's very easy to
verify or not verify.

00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:17.192 align:middle line:84%
And when they find out that the
American Medical Association,

00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:21.071 align:middle line:84%
which up until the '50s was
called the American Medical

00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:26.368 align:middle line:84%
Association, a trade
union for doctors,

00:05:26.368 --> 00:05:34.918 align:middle line:84%
they found out that the doctor
who was a member of the AMA--

00:05:34.918 --> 00:05:37.796 align:middle line:84%
they printed yearly
what percentage

00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:41.841 align:middle line:84%
of clinical diagnoses
were correct.

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:45.971 align:middle line:84%
And rarely did it
go more than 5%.

00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:47.806 align:middle line:84%
Well, I say if 5%
of the diagnoses

00:05:47.806 --> 00:05:50.100 align:middle line:84%
are correct, what
percent of the treatments

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.186 align:middle line:90%
were having an effect?

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:55.772 align:middle line:84%
And they never would
like that to be said.

00:05:55.772 --> 00:05:57.274 align:middle line:90%
But it's just the way it was.

00:05:57.274 --> 00:06:00.819 align:middle line:84%
There was a brilliant
student at, I believe,

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:04.656 align:middle line:84%
McGill University in Canada
that wrote a master's thesis

00:06:04.656 --> 00:06:08.034 align:middle line:84%
on the history of the
AMA and what the AMA did.

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:11.162 align:middle line:84%
Probably better not
say some of the things

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:12.872 align:middle line:84%
that have happened
with me in that realm.

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:20.213 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, I found out that the
average doctor makes his money

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:23.258 align:middle line:84%
from 168 patients during
his medical career.

00:06:23.258 --> 00:06:24.050 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.843 align:middle line:90%
That's not very many.

00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:25.844 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: That's
not very many.

00:06:25.844 --> 00:06:27.429 align:middle line:84%
So what that means
is that he has

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:29.764 align:middle line:84%
to have a lot of
people who are kept

00:06:29.764 --> 00:06:34.978 align:middle line:90%
in type of critical problem.

00:06:34.978 --> 00:06:37.355 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, let's get back
to this for a second, Pete,

00:06:37.355 --> 00:06:40.066 align:middle line:84%
because you laid out some
provocative stuff here.

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:41.610 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned Robert Becker.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.778 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize you had
even worked with him.

00:06:43.778 --> 00:06:46.531 align:middle line:84%
He's the guy who had discovered
that there were electrically

00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:49.784 align:middle line:84%
active points on the skin that
were more electrically active

00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:50.619 align:middle line:90%
than others.

00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:52.829 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: About six
years after I taught him.

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:54.539 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, OK.

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:59.169 align:middle line:84%
Well, but what specifically was
the research that you guys were

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:02.339 align:middle line:84%
doing before somebody
came in and said,

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:04.174 align:middle line:84%
hey, these are the
acupuncture points?

00:07:04.174 --> 00:07:05.592 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: The
way it all started

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:12.766 align:middle line:84%
for me was there was a German
doctor, Reinhard Voll, who

00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:15.894 align:middle line:84%
had been a electronics
repairman in World War

00:07:15.894 --> 00:07:20.899 align:middle line:90%
II in the German army.

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:24.069 align:middle line:90%
And he had spare time.

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:26.196 align:middle line:84%
And he discovered
that there were

00:07:26.196 --> 00:07:29.783 align:middle line:84%
various points on the body
that acted electrically

00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:32.827 align:middle line:84%
different than other
points on the body.

00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:35.246 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they all
acted much the same.

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:39.125 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes some of
them acted differently.

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And when he got
out, I'm assuming

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:47.008 align:middle line:84%
that the Germans said
something like the plan we have

00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:49.719 align:middle line:84%
for the people that had
been in the military

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:53.890 align:middle line:84%
could get a GI Bill
passed through college.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:08:00.021 align:middle line:84%
And he went through college
as a heilpraktiker, I believe.

00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:01.731 align:middle line:84%
We don't have anything
quite equivalent

00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:05.485 align:middle line:84%
to that, except
maybe an osteopath.

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:08.655 align:middle line:84%
An osteopath takes every
class that a doctor, an MD,

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:12.992 align:middle line:84%
takes and then actually
takes a year of nutrition,

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:14.577 align:middle line:90%
for gosh sake.

00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:17.914 align:middle line:84%
Being as the entire body
is made from nutrition,

00:08:17.914 --> 00:08:21.710 align:middle line:84%
one might think that there
would be a relationship there.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.964 align:middle line:84%
The average MD, I think, gets
one semester of nutrition.

00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:32.010 align:middle line:84%
But the heilpraktiker gets
nutrition and a lot of other.

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:36.599 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So Voll was noticing
that there was certain times

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:38.351 align:middle line:84%
that electrical activity
would synchronize

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:39.811 align:middle line:84%
across different
parts of the body?

00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:40.979 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: No, no, no.

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:44.899 align:middle line:84%
He found that at times, it
was of a higher voltage,

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:47.444 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes of
a lower voltage.

00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:52.615 align:middle line:84%
He found out that there
were certain voltage

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:55.535 align:middle line:90%
bands that were useful.

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:59.706 align:middle line:84%
If you had a meter that
would detect in microvolts,

00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:01.124 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't really useful.

00:09:01.124 --> 00:09:02.625 align:middle line:84%
But if you had a
detector that would

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:08.506 align:middle line:84%
detect in millivolts,
which is 1,000 microvolts,

00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:12.093 align:middle line:90%
then it was useful.

00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:12.886 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:14.095 align:middle line:84%
That's a pretty
significant difference.

00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:15.722 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And then
we found out later

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:18.892 align:middle line:84%
that there's a little
narrow band of voltage where

00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:20.268 align:middle line:90%
you want to look.

00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And in that band of
voltage, you find

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:31.029 align:middle line:84%
that there are circuits in the
body that relate themselves

00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:33.990 align:middle line:84%
to what's going
on in each organ.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:38.203 align:middle line:84%
These circuits are driven
by piezoelectricity

00:09:38.203 --> 00:09:41.623 align:middle line:90%
that's generated by the teeth.

00:09:41.623 --> 00:09:44.375 align:middle line:84%
And I think that probably
90% of the people that

00:09:44.375 --> 00:09:47.378 align:middle line:84%
work in the field in
medicine don't know that.

00:09:47.378 --> 00:09:50.465 align:middle line:84%
So that's the new
pronouncement I'm making--

00:09:50.465 --> 00:09:54.135 align:middle line:84%
that voltage come from
piezoelectric in the teeth.

00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:57.722 align:middle line:84%
You can trace that circuit
very easily many ways,

00:09:57.722 --> 00:10:01.601 align:middle line:84%
from the exact tooth down
to a particular organ

00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:02.477 align:middle line:90%
or part of an organ.

00:10:02.477 --> 00:10:04.479 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, let me
just stop you for a second

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:06.564 align:middle line:84%
and help some people
understand this.

00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:09.108 align:middle line:84%
Because I understand
piezoelectricity, but not

00:10:09.108 --> 00:10:10.151 align:middle line:90%
everybody might.

00:10:10.151 --> 00:10:12.320 align:middle line:84%
A piezoelectric
crystal is a crystal

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:16.908 align:middle line:84%
in which a charge
of light, a spark,

00:10:16.908 --> 00:10:19.536 align:middle line:84%
could come out if you
push down on the crystal.

00:10:19.536 --> 00:10:21.704 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying that
the enamel of the teeth

00:10:21.704 --> 00:10:24.541 align:middle line:84%
or maybe something inside
the tooth is doing that?

00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:29.254 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: The various
layers of the tooth--

00:10:29.254 --> 00:10:32.715 align:middle line:84%
when you compress them, when
you put physical pressure

00:10:32.715 --> 00:10:33.842 align:middle line:90%
on the outside--

00:10:33.842 --> 00:10:36.553 align:middle line:84%
generate an electrical
current on the inside.

00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:38.888 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So an example of
a piezoelectric crystal

00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:41.349 align:middle line:84%
would be these
lighters that don't

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:43.601 align:middle line:84%
have a flint, where
you turn the wheel

00:10:43.601 --> 00:10:45.270 align:middle line:84%
but where you just
push down on a button.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:46.145 align:middle line:90%
Then you hear, click.

00:10:46.145 --> 00:10:48.231 align:middle line:84%
And there's a little crystal
that gets compressed.

00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:49.607 align:middle line:90%
And then the spark shoots out.

00:10:49.607 --> 00:10:50.692 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Exactly.

00:10:50.692 --> 00:10:53.194 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you're saying that
some kind of actual sparks

00:10:53.194 --> 00:10:53.987 align:middle line:90%
are being made?

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:56.990 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: No, not sparks,
just electrical pulses--

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.617 align:middle line:90%
not enough to make a spark.

00:10:59.617 --> 00:11:02.203 align:middle line:84%
But pulses of
electricity are made.

00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:04.330 align:middle line:90%
And they run from the tooth.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:07.750 align:middle line:90%
And they terminate in an organ.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:12.380 align:middle line:84%
They terminate
along in the hands

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:20.597 align:middle line:84%
about 45 degrees around,
actually, on each joint.

00:11:20.597 --> 00:11:23.266 align:middle line:84%
And believe it or not,
we have a set of joints

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:25.143 align:middle line:84%
just like the
knuckles down here.

00:11:25.143 --> 00:11:27.687 align:middle line:90%
And they're all inside.

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:32.191 align:middle line:84%
But just above and
below that joint,

00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:35.111 align:middle line:84%
there's a little
area here that is

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:40.241 align:middle line:84%
sensitive to
informational pulses that

00:11:40.241 --> 00:11:43.620 align:middle line:90%
travel along these--

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.122 align:middle line:84%
some of what were called
"acupuncture meridians."

00:11:46.122 --> 00:11:48.833 align:middle line:84%
We find some points
not on meridians.

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:51.210 align:middle line:84%
We find some points
on meridians that

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:54.130 align:middle line:84%
didn't exist in Chinese
medicine but do exist

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.842 align:middle line:90%
in electroacupuncture medicine.

00:11:57.842 --> 00:12:02.889 align:middle line:84%
And you have the same
things on your toes.

00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:07.644 align:middle line:84%
And so you can come across the
body and information that's

00:12:07.644 --> 00:12:11.314 align:middle line:84%
above and below in
about 45 degrees

00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:15.318 align:middle line:84%
from the flat on the
outside of the thumb.

00:12:15.318 --> 00:12:19.155 align:middle line:84%
This corresponds to
the lymphatic system.

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:21.366 align:middle line:84%
Now, the lymphatic
system is always

00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:23.785 align:middle line:90%
trying to get rid of toxins.

00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:28.915 align:middle line:84%
So you can pretty much
expect, as research went on,

00:12:28.915 --> 00:12:33.753 align:middle line:84%
that anything bad or going wrong
with the body biochemically

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:36.547 align:middle line:84%
is going to affect
the lymphatic system.

00:12:36.547 --> 00:12:39.467 align:middle line:84%
So it's most interesting
to look here first

00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:41.552 align:middle line:90%
to see if there are problems.

00:12:41.552 --> 00:12:43.888 align:middle line:84%
Then you can go look
elsewhere to see

00:12:43.888 --> 00:12:45.598 align:middle line:90%
if there are specific problems.

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:47.976 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I don't know
what you mean by "look."

00:12:47.976 --> 00:12:53.231 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: We have a
machine that has a electrode

00:12:53.231 --> 00:12:56.234 align:middle line:90%
that you hold in one hand.

00:12:56.234 --> 00:13:00.363 align:middle line:84%
And then we have a
probe, an electrode,

00:13:00.363 --> 00:13:03.533 align:middle line:84%
that's like the tip
of a ballpoint pen.

00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:07.286 align:middle line:84%
And we touch various
points on the body.

00:13:07.286 --> 00:13:13.793 align:middle line:84%
And those points have certain
electrical characteristics,

00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:15.837 align:middle line:84%
some that are the same
all the way across.

00:13:15.837 --> 00:13:21.759 align:middle line:84%
In other words, unless
there's a missing part

00:13:21.759 --> 00:13:24.846 align:middle line:84%
of your hand or a missing
point, then the points

00:13:24.846 --> 00:13:27.932 align:middle line:90%
appear all up the meridian.

00:13:27.932 --> 00:13:30.810 align:middle line:84%
The meridian runs from
the internal organ

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:34.272 align:middle line:84%
all the way to a point on
one of the fingers or toes.

00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:35.857 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So some
people are going

00:13:35.857 --> 00:13:39.402 align:middle line:84%
to say that you don't have
any scientific proof for this.

00:13:39.402 --> 00:13:40.862 align:middle line:90%
You have confirmation bias.

00:13:40.862 --> 00:13:42.238 align:middle line:90%
You know what you want to find.

00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:45.742 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, your bias is to
confirm your assumptions.

00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:47.493 align:middle line:84%
So do you have any
scientific proof

00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:49.495 align:middle line:84%
that surmounts that
confirmation bias?

00:13:49.495 --> 00:13:50.496 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Well, we do.

00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:53.999 align:middle line:84%
And first off, no, we
didn't have any idea

00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:56.169 align:middle line:90%
what we wanted to find.

00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:58.963 align:middle line:84%
We found things and
then correlated it.

00:13:58.963 --> 00:14:00.631 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What's an
example of the proof?

00:14:00.631 --> 00:14:03.176 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: What we did was to--

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:09.849 align:middle line:84%
it started out that there
was a Korean doctor,

00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:11.851 align:middle line:90%
a medical doctor.

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:15.271 align:middle line:90%
Bong-Han was his name.

00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:21.569 align:middle line:84%
And he said that he had found
these acupuncture meridians

00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:22.653 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:14:22.653 --> 00:14:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And they were like
little blood veins.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:27.909 align:middle line:84%
He later committed
suicide, saying

00:14:27.909 --> 00:14:30.286 align:middle line:90%
that he lied all about it.

00:14:30.286 --> 00:14:32.288 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Little blood
veins, meaning like they--

00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:33.915 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: They were like
little veins in the body.

00:14:33.915 --> 00:14:34.957 align:middle line:90%
He found these meridians.

00:14:34.957 --> 00:14:36.876 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Like they
could communicate?

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:39.212 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: You can easily
find the acupuncture points.

00:14:41.964 --> 00:14:45.468 align:middle line:84%
I can find them
with the back part

00:14:45.468 --> 00:14:47.512 align:middle line:84%
that you press on
a ballpoint pen.

00:14:47.512 --> 00:14:50.389 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you
what you'll find there

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:51.390 align:middle line:90%
by rubbing them along.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:52.517 align:middle line:90%
And you can find them, too.

00:14:52.517 --> 00:14:55.186 align:middle line:84%
Whoever I'm doing
it to will say, yes,

00:14:55.186 --> 00:14:58.689 align:middle line:84%
what you tell me is there is
there because I can feel it.

00:14:58.689 --> 00:15:01.567 align:middle line:84%
I can feel you probing
it under the skin.

00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:05.404 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So this
Korean doctor thinks--

00:15:05.404 --> 00:15:08.157 align:middle line:84%
he found some kind of
actual circulatory system.

00:15:08.157 --> 00:15:09.742 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: No, he
didn't find a thing.

00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:10.743 align:middle line:90%
He lied about it.

00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:14.455 align:middle line:84%
But he said that he did because
everybody was asking exactly

00:15:14.455 --> 00:15:17.792 align:middle line:84%
the question well, how can you
prove that there were meridians

00:15:17.792 --> 00:15:19.335 align:middle line:90%
there?

00:15:19.335 --> 00:15:25.007 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can locate these
points electrically very easily.

00:15:25.007 --> 00:15:28.302 align:middle line:84%
Like I say, you can
go to RadioShack

00:15:28.302 --> 00:15:30.221 align:middle line:84%
if there's still a
store open near you.

00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:33.307 align:middle line:90%
Or you can go to Harbor Freight.

00:15:33.307 --> 00:15:35.643 align:middle line:84%
And you can buy
a $4 or $5 meter.

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And you can measure
quantitatively

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.440 align:middle line:84%
and qualitatively those
points on the body.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.026 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, that was the data
that I had gotten from Becker

00:15:44.026 --> 00:15:46.112 align:middle line:84%
in my book-- was that there
is more electrical charge

00:15:46.112 --> 00:15:46.904 align:middle line:90%
in those areas.

00:15:46.904 --> 00:15:48.072 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Exactly.

00:15:48.072 --> 00:15:50.783 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: How could you
scientifically prove

00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:53.536 align:middle line:84%
that there is a connection
between those points

00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:54.328 align:middle line:90%
and the organs?

00:15:54.328 --> 00:15:55.746 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: What we did--

00:15:55.746 --> 00:15:58.915 align:middle line:84%
we did this at the French
Academy of Sciences.

00:15:58.915 --> 00:16:03.963 align:middle line:84%
There were two doctors that
were both mentors and coworkers

00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:05.673 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:16:05.673 --> 00:16:09.844 align:middle line:84%
One was the head
acupuncturist in the world.

00:16:09.844 --> 00:16:13.306 align:middle line:84%
And one was the head homeopathic
physician in the world.

00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:14.223 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: No kidding.

00:16:14.223 --> 00:16:15.850 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And I
discovered that there

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:20.021 align:middle line:84%
was an electrical relationship
between all the elements

00:16:20.021 --> 00:16:24.233 align:middle line:84%
of homeopathy, which hadn't
to that point been proven,

00:16:24.233 --> 00:16:27.695 align:middle line:84%
and all the relationship
to acupuncture.

00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:29.739 align:middle line:84%
There are electrical
relationships

00:16:29.739 --> 00:16:33.701 align:middle line:84%
that we could measure
with quality, quantity.

00:16:33.701 --> 00:16:37.038 align:middle line:84%
And then we learned that
there were waveforms and wave

00:16:37.038 --> 00:16:39.373 align:middle line:84%
shapes that were
generated by them

00:16:39.373 --> 00:16:44.462 align:middle line:84%
that would allow us to
select any compound in nature

00:16:44.462 --> 00:16:49.175 align:middle line:84%
or man-made compound, any
chemical combination that

00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:50.509 align:middle line:90%
was stable.

00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:52.386 align:middle line:84%
And we could check
to see if that

00:16:52.386 --> 00:16:56.224 align:middle line:84%
would have an effect on any
disease process in the body.

00:16:56.224 --> 00:16:57.099 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:16:57.099 --> 00:16:58.684 align:middle line:84%
But the question I
had asked-- and I'm

00:16:58.684 --> 00:17:03.522 align:middle line:84%
looking for a specific answer
now or a simple answer--

00:17:03.522 --> 00:17:06.858 align:middle line:84%
is, were you able to
scientifically prove

00:17:06.858 --> 00:17:09.111 align:middle line:84%
a direct link between
an acupuncture point

00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:12.031 align:middle line:84%
on the hand and a particular
organ system in the body?

00:17:12.031 --> 00:17:12.823 align:middle line:90%
And if so, how?

00:17:12.823 --> 00:17:15.201 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: What we did at
the French Academy of Sciences

00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:18.412 align:middle line:84%
is very slowly and
patiently, in each

00:17:18.412 --> 00:17:21.540 align:middle line:84%
of the points that we used
externally on the body,

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:24.335 align:middle line:84%
we would inject
radioactive potassium.

00:17:24.335 --> 00:17:25.544 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: And what is that?

00:17:25.544 --> 00:17:27.964 align:middle line:90%
What does that do for us?

00:17:27.964 --> 00:17:29.632 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: What it
does is it gives you

00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:33.135 align:middle line:84%
something in a small
amount that you can go in

00:17:33.135 --> 00:17:41.477 align:middle line:84%
with a micro-radiation meter and
measure a quantity of material.

00:17:41.477 --> 00:17:43.896 align:middle line:84%
And you can measure the
movement of the material.

00:17:43.896 --> 00:17:47.775 align:middle line:84%
The material always moved
from the end acupuncture point

00:17:47.775 --> 00:17:50.820 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the
terminus of the digits.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.698 align:middle line:84%
It would move slowly
down the meridian

00:17:53.698 --> 00:17:56.909 align:middle line:84%
and come clear down to the
internal part of the organ,

00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:58.369 align:middle line:90%
where then it would show up.

00:17:58.369 --> 00:18:00.204 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:18:00.204 --> 00:18:01.038 align:middle line:90%
So wait a minute--

00:18:01.038 --> 00:18:03.291 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Then we put
markers in that material

00:18:03.291 --> 00:18:08.337 align:middle line:84%
so we could show that that we
injected in this point actually

00:18:08.337 --> 00:18:13.217 align:middle line:84%
showed up all along the
points along this meridian

00:18:13.217 --> 00:18:15.594 align:middle line:90%
and down to the actual organ.

00:18:15.594 --> 00:18:17.805 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you're
saying that this worked

00:18:17.805 --> 00:18:19.557 align:middle line:90%
for each acupuncture point?

00:18:19.557 --> 00:18:21.392 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Each
acupuncture point.

00:18:21.392 --> 00:18:23.561 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And it would go
to the corresponding organ.

00:18:23.561 --> 00:18:24.729 align:middle line:90%
The potassium would show up?

00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:29.025 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Now, we never
found Kim Bong-Han little veins

00:18:29.025 --> 00:18:30.776 align:middle line:90%
or anything in between--

00:18:30.776 --> 00:18:33.904 align:middle line:84%
when that happened, he
committed suicide and admitted

00:18:33.904 --> 00:18:35.740 align:middle line:90%
that he just made that up--

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:37.575 align:middle line:84%
but that there was
a relationship.

00:18:37.575 --> 00:18:39.827 align:middle line:84%
Well, we had seen, yes,
there is a relationship.

00:18:39.827 --> 00:18:40.619 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:18:40.619 --> 00:18:43.164 align:middle line:84%
My next question would be, how
is the potassium getting there

00:18:43.164 --> 00:18:44.123 align:middle line:90%
exactly?

00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:47.418 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, we
had to find that out.

00:18:47.418 --> 00:18:50.546 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
that there's not

00:18:50.546 --> 00:18:56.927 align:middle line:84%
a neural tissue like a
pipe that brought things

00:18:56.927 --> 00:19:00.056 align:middle line:84%
down, either brought electric
current or brought chemicals

00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:01.265 align:middle line:90%
down.

00:19:01.265 --> 00:19:03.601 align:middle line:84%
We found that the
chemicals we injected

00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:08.689 align:middle line:84%
weren't ever meant to be part
of the acupuncture system.

00:19:08.689 --> 00:19:12.318 align:middle line:84%
It was a system that
conveyed electrical pulses.

00:19:12.318 --> 00:19:16.113 align:middle line:84%
Now, an electrical pulse
means that you have a charge.

00:19:16.113 --> 00:19:19.158 align:middle line:84%
It's either a positive
charge or a negative charge.

00:19:19.158 --> 00:19:23.496 align:middle line:84%
If you have an atom or a
molecule of some compound,

00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:25.790 align:middle line:84%
that's going to have
a predominant charge,

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:27.208 align:middle line:90%
positive or negative.

00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:28.709 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: In the
nervous system, we

00:19:28.709 --> 00:19:32.046 align:middle line:84%
have nerves in which
electrical impulses are

00:19:32.046 --> 00:19:36.133 align:middle line:84%
conveyed by this flipping effect
between potassium and sodium.

00:19:36.133 --> 00:19:37.927 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: They go
like a snake crawls.

00:19:37.927 --> 00:19:40.388 align:middle line:90%
They go by peristalsis.

00:19:40.388 --> 00:19:41.764 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: In the nerves?

00:19:41.764 --> 00:19:42.848 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: In the nerve.

00:19:42.848 --> 00:19:45.017 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So there's something
similar going on here?

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:47.186 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: There's something
similar going on here.

00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:51.232 align:middle line:84%
But instead of going
through the round neural

00:19:51.232 --> 00:19:56.946 align:middle line:84%
tissue or a veinish-type tissue
or capillary-type tissue,

00:19:56.946 --> 00:20:02.243 align:middle line:84%
it goes through the flat tissues
that you find in the body.

00:20:02.243 --> 00:20:06.831 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever cleaned a
wild animal or a chicken

00:20:06.831 --> 00:20:09.250 align:middle line:84%
or you see chicken
meat, you see that there

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:14.547 align:middle line:84%
are flat, white tissues
that separate the organs.

00:20:14.547 --> 00:20:15.756 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: You mean the fascia?

00:20:15.756 --> 00:20:17.216 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: The fascia.

00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:21.554 align:middle line:90%
And it's built like a baklava.

00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:23.431 align:middle line:90%
It's built in layers.

00:20:23.431 --> 00:20:27.810 align:middle line:84%
So you have many layers
over a broad web of things

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:30.938 align:middle line:84%
rather than a small
pipe bringing it in.

00:20:30.938 --> 00:20:33.566 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, I know a
lot of massage therapists.

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:35.609 align:middle line:84%
And massage therapists
are particularly concerned

00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:39.613 align:middle line:84%
with that because when your
muscles are normally healthy,

00:20:39.613 --> 00:20:41.699 align:middle line:84%
they're in long
spaghetti strands.

00:20:41.699 --> 00:20:44.660 align:middle line:84%
But then when you
exert the muscles,

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.287 align:middle line:84%
the strands will
tear a little bit.

00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:49.832 align:middle line:84%
And the glue sometimes
can glue in funny ways.

00:20:49.832 --> 00:20:51.584 align:middle line:84%
And the strands are
no longer straight.

00:20:51.584 --> 00:20:53.043 align:middle line:90%
They create knots.

00:20:53.043 --> 00:20:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And those knots
attach to the fascia.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.882 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Exactly.

00:20:57.882 --> 00:20:59.717 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So the fascia
is not just something

00:20:59.717 --> 00:21:02.178 align:middle line:84%
that keeps the muscle
intact or the organs intact.

00:21:02.178 --> 00:21:04.638 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: No, it's actually
a very, very complicated

00:21:04.638 --> 00:21:06.807 align:middle line:90%
communication system.

00:21:06.807 --> 00:21:10.811 align:middle line:84%
And it will actually separate
certain things out and route

00:21:10.811 --> 00:21:12.980 align:middle line:90%
them to where they need to go.

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.274 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I get that you're
saying that the potassium

00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:17.526 align:middle line:90%
traveled through the fascia.

00:21:17.526 --> 00:21:20.029 align:middle line:84%
But how did it travel
through the fascia?

00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:21.489 align:middle line:84%
Did they have little
tubes in them?

00:21:21.489 --> 00:21:22.364 align:middle line:90%
Or what's going on?

00:21:22.364 --> 00:21:23.157 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: No.

00:21:23.157 --> 00:21:24.867 align:middle line:84%
Those tubes are
there for a reason.

00:21:24.867 --> 00:21:27.203 align:middle line:84%
There to send
signals in the body.

00:21:27.203 --> 00:21:28.954 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So there are
tubes in the fascia?

00:21:28.954 --> 00:21:30.498 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Not tubes.

00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:34.168 align:middle line:84%
They're the layers
between the fascia.

00:21:34.168 --> 00:21:36.587 align:middle line:84%
And there are many, many,
many, many, layers built up,

00:21:36.587 --> 00:21:40.216 align:middle line:84%
like many layers of
dough in a baklava

00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:45.179 align:middle line:90%
or a similar baked good.

00:21:45.179 --> 00:21:48.682 align:middle line:84%
And that's the easiest
way I can describe it.

00:21:48.682 --> 00:21:50.267 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So the
potassium would--

00:21:50.267 --> 00:21:52.520 align:middle line:84%
it's like if you had
two pieces of glass,

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.438 align:middle line:84%
and you put a blue-colored
dye between them.

00:21:54.438 --> 00:21:56.440 align:middle line:84%
The dye would spread
through the glass.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.733 align:middle line:90%
It's doing something similar?

00:21:57.733 --> 00:21:58.526 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Right.

00:21:58.526 --> 00:22:03.072 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's say that the dye
was composed of little colored

00:22:03.072 --> 00:22:03.864 align:middle line:90%
magnets.

00:22:03.864 --> 00:22:05.658 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:22:05.658 --> 00:22:07.701 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And now you
want to send a signal.

00:22:07.701 --> 00:22:09.578 align:middle line:90%
The signal is electrical.

00:22:09.578 --> 00:22:11.664 align:middle line:84%
So the little magnets
are electrons,

00:22:11.664 --> 00:22:14.333 align:middle line:84%
which have an electric
charge around them.

00:22:14.333 --> 00:22:18.712 align:middle line:84%
So the electron is
sent down the pathway--

00:22:18.712 --> 00:22:21.882 align:middle line:84%
or series of electrons,
pulses of electrons,

00:22:21.882 --> 00:22:24.343 align:middle line:90%
patterns of electrons.

00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And as the pattern goes down,
the electron is negative.

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:31.850 align:middle line:84%
If you have a positive
ion, the positive ion

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:35.771 align:middle line:84%
will be attracted to that,
just like a positive magnet is

00:22:35.771 --> 00:22:37.731 align:middle line:90%
attracted to a negative magnet.

00:22:37.731 --> 00:22:40.025 align:middle line:84%
And it will drag
it along with it.

00:22:40.025 --> 00:22:43.529 align:middle line:84%
So in the system
that I was using,

00:22:43.529 --> 00:22:48.075 align:middle line:84%
the thought that there
were these negative flows--

00:22:48.075 --> 00:22:51.870 align:middle line:84%
but they would drag a chemical
along, which we could measure.

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:54.707 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't designed to drag
chemicals through the body.

00:22:54.707 --> 00:22:56.959 align:middle line:84%
It was designed to send
signals to the body.

00:22:56.959 --> 00:22:59.378 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So would this have
worked the same if you hadn't

00:22:59.378 --> 00:23:01.171 align:middle line:84%
have used a chemical
like potassium that

00:23:01.171 --> 00:23:02.172 align:middle line:90%
has a definite electric charge?

00:23:02.172 --> 00:23:02.965 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: It
wouldn't work at all.

00:23:02.965 --> 00:23:03.799 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:23:03.799 --> 00:23:05.342 align:middle line:84%
So the potassium
was important, then.

00:23:05.342 --> 00:23:07.511 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, it was
important to have something

00:23:07.511 --> 00:23:08.846 align:middle line:90%
with an electric charge.

00:23:08.846 --> 00:23:10.431 align:middle line:90%
Charges were moving.

00:23:10.431 --> 00:23:12.725 align:middle line:84%
I want something I can
attach to a charge.

00:23:12.725 --> 00:23:15.311 align:middle line:84%
They're negative
charges because they're

00:23:15.311 --> 00:23:20.107 align:middle line:84%
electrons, which will draw the
positive charge along with it.

00:23:20.107 --> 00:23:22.901 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What does it feel
like to get validation,

00:23:22.901 --> 00:23:25.112 align:middle line:84%
to see this potassium
going into these organs?

00:23:25.112 --> 00:23:26.447 align:middle line:90%
It must have been very exciting.

00:23:26.447 --> 00:23:28.532 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, it was
exceedingly exciting.

00:23:28.532 --> 00:23:31.619 align:middle line:84%
And there was very little
interest in this country.

00:23:31.619 --> 00:23:34.997 align:middle line:84%
So I was doing most of
this work in France,

00:23:34.997 --> 00:23:37.124 align:middle line:84%
where was there was
tremendous interest in it

00:23:37.124 --> 00:23:40.586 align:middle line:84%
because they understood
it far better than we did.

00:23:40.586 --> 00:23:46.050 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that
acupuncture in China--

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:47.885 align:middle line:90%
and I can't tell you the years.

00:23:47.885 --> 00:23:50.763 align:middle line:84%
But it was, I
think, in the '20s.

00:23:50.763 --> 00:23:55.684 align:middle line:84%
There was a tremendous amount
of rain there at that time.

00:23:55.684 --> 00:24:00.856 align:middle line:84%
The rain overflowed the
very shallow septic systems

00:24:00.856 --> 00:24:02.232 align:middle line:90%
they have.

00:24:02.232 --> 00:24:04.443 align:middle line:84%
And it spread all
kinds of disease

00:24:04.443 --> 00:24:07.488 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of the water.

00:24:07.488 --> 00:24:12.993 align:middle line:84%
And so you had huge, huge
epidemics going on in China.

00:24:12.993 --> 00:24:18.374 align:middle line:84%
Acupuncture didn't have anything
to cure that at the time.

00:24:18.374 --> 00:24:19.833 align:middle line:90%
So what did they bring in?

00:24:19.833 --> 00:24:24.630 align:middle line:84%
But the French brought in this
new stuff called "penicillin."

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:27.758 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
everybody got well.

00:24:27.758 --> 00:24:29.843 align:middle line:84%
So the government
said, oh, well, there

00:24:29.843 --> 00:24:32.262 align:middle line:84%
must be something wrong with
our acupuncture and something

00:24:32.262 --> 00:24:34.390 align:middle line:90%
good with penicillin.

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:36.433 align:middle line:84%
So they made the
acupuncture illegal.

00:24:36.433 --> 00:24:39.395 align:middle line:84%
And it was only practiced
down all the back alleys.

00:24:39.395 --> 00:24:42.731 align:middle line:84%
The fact that acupuncture
works about 90% of the time

00:24:42.731 --> 00:24:44.400 align:middle line:90%
was forgotten.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.568 align:middle line:84%
And then they went
through a very bad period

00:24:46.568 --> 00:24:48.612 align:middle line:90%
of very bad medicine.

00:24:48.612 --> 00:24:51.573 align:middle line:84%
And so the acupuncturist
ended up being things

00:24:51.573 --> 00:24:56.412 align:middle line:84%
that you found down alleys
and down holes in the ground

00:24:56.412 --> 00:25:00.040 align:middle line:84%
that people dug underneath and
had their clinics down below,

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.250 align:middle line:90%
where they couldn't be seen.

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:04.712 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: If this potassium
can travel on its own,

00:25:04.712 --> 00:25:06.630 align:middle line:84%
and it's just a
radioactive-- well,

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:07.923 align:middle line:90%
it's a radioactive chemical.

00:25:07.923 --> 00:25:08.298 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Right.

00:25:08.298 --> 00:25:09.174 align:middle line:90%
Period.

00:25:09.174 --> 00:25:10.092 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:25:10.092 --> 00:25:14.012 align:middle line:84%
Then could you create
acupuncture therapies

00:25:14.012 --> 00:25:17.266 align:middle line:84%
without a human being
holding the needle?

00:25:17.266 --> 00:25:21.145 align:middle line:84%
Or is the act of the human
and their energy field

00:25:21.145 --> 00:25:22.521 align:middle line:90%
somehow important to this?

00:25:22.521 --> 00:25:24.106 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Because
law is against it,

00:25:24.106 --> 00:25:25.566 align:middle line:90%
I didn't get into that.

00:25:25.566 --> 00:25:27.317 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:25:27.317 --> 00:25:29.820 align:middle line:84%
That's the way it
should be done.

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:31.155 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: With a human, you mean?

00:25:31.155 --> 00:25:32.740 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: But you
have to understand

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:35.743 align:middle line:84%
that we had the American
Medical Association, a trade

00:25:35.743 --> 00:25:39.163 align:middle line:84%
union for doctors,
getting rid of everything

00:25:39.163 --> 00:25:41.749 align:middle line:90%
they didn't know about.

00:25:41.749 --> 00:25:43.083 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:25:43.083 --> 00:25:48.338 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: So we don't
get the medicine we should.

00:25:48.338 --> 00:25:53.969 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Could there be a way
to, for example, use robotics

00:25:53.969 --> 00:25:56.722 align:middle line:84%
and have a robot do
the acupuncture points

00:25:56.722 --> 00:25:58.015 align:middle line:90%
and have it still heal someone?

00:25:58.015 --> 00:25:59.600 align:middle line:90%
Or does it require the human?

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.185 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: That's up for grabs.

00:26:01.185 --> 00:26:04.021 align:middle line:90%
I believe it requires the human.

00:26:04.021 --> 00:26:10.277 align:middle line:84%
I told people when we first
exposed this therapy--

00:26:10.277 --> 00:26:13.197 align:middle line:84%
and by the way,
the state of Nevada

00:26:13.197 --> 00:26:17.493 align:middle line:84%
has made this type of
therapy paramount in Nevada.

00:26:17.493 --> 00:26:21.622 align:middle line:84%
We have our own licensing laws
for this type of medicine.

00:26:21.622 --> 00:26:25.501 align:middle line:84%
We have our own
licensing organizations

00:26:25.501 --> 00:26:30.255 align:middle line:84%
that issue the licenses totally
outside of anything else.

00:26:30.255 --> 00:26:34.885 align:middle line:84%
And so we've had no
contest with this.

00:26:34.885 --> 00:26:38.013 align:middle line:84%
In the 30-some years I've
been involved in this,

00:26:38.013 --> 00:26:44.019 align:middle line:84%
I've had no one except one
group of people went to court

00:26:44.019 --> 00:26:47.439 align:middle line:84%
and were so thoroughly
embarrassed that they

00:26:47.439 --> 00:26:48.690 align:middle line:90%
ran off and left.

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:50.859 align:middle line:90%
They quit coming into the trial.

00:26:50.859 --> 00:26:53.237 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But you're saying
that your research concludes

00:26:53.237 --> 00:26:55.531 align:middle line:84%
that you do need a human
to really make this work.

00:26:55.531 --> 00:26:56.281 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: No, it doesn't.

00:26:56.281 --> 00:26:58.075 align:middle line:84%
It concludes that we
don't really need a human.

00:26:58.075 --> 00:26:58.909 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, you don't?

00:26:58.909 --> 00:26:59.743 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:59.743 --> 00:27:04.331 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: But if you want
to do it correctly and fast

00:27:04.331 --> 00:27:07.709 align:middle line:84%
and very accurately,
yes, you need now what

00:27:07.709 --> 00:27:09.962 align:middle line:84%
a human has that a
machine doesn't have.

00:27:09.962 --> 00:27:10.921 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Which is what?

00:27:10.921 --> 00:27:13.173 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Access to
the informational field.

00:27:13.173 --> 00:27:13.966 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:27:13.966 --> 00:27:14.883 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:27:14.883 --> 00:27:16.718 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And it is
an informational field

00:27:16.718 --> 00:27:18.220 align:middle line:90%
that we deal with in this.

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:21.390 align:middle line:84%
When I found that out,
it was from this work

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:27.688 align:middle line:84%
I did in medicine that that
work came and disclosed itself.

00:27:27.688 --> 00:27:33.151 align:middle line:84%
So we can build something that
could do similar things, yes.

00:27:33.151 --> 00:27:36.530 align:middle line:90%
How much similar, I don't know.

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:38.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, let
me ask you this.

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:41.326 align:middle line:84%
An acupuncturist in the
typical Chinese sense

00:27:41.326 --> 00:27:44.663 align:middle line:84%
is going to take certain needles
and put them in certain points.

00:27:44.663 --> 00:27:46.373 align:middle line:84%
And then the needles
will just stay there

00:27:46.373 --> 00:27:47.708 align:middle line:90%
for a period of time.

00:27:47.708 --> 00:27:50.377 align:middle line:84%
I've also had Japanese
Shinto acupuncture,

00:27:50.377 --> 00:27:53.213 align:middle line:84%
which is far more brutal,
in my opinion, in which you

00:27:53.213 --> 00:27:56.008 align:middle line:84%
are constantly being stuck
with a needle in the most

00:27:56.008 --> 00:27:58.093 align:middle line:90%
painful part of my body.

00:27:58.093 --> 00:28:00.053 align:middle line:84%
If the needle in
the Chinese sense

00:28:00.053 --> 00:28:04.725 align:middle line:84%
is just sitting there in
your skin, what is it doing?

00:28:04.725 --> 00:28:07.185 align:middle line:84%
Is it pulling in
static electricity

00:28:07.185 --> 00:28:08.687 align:middle line:90%
from the atmosphere?

00:28:08.687 --> 00:28:09.688 align:middle line:90%
Or is it something else?

00:28:09.688 --> 00:28:11.481 align:middle line:84%
What's actually happening
with that needle?

00:28:11.481 --> 00:28:13.358 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I'd have to
make conjecture there

00:28:13.358 --> 00:28:17.487 align:middle line:84%
because it just turns
out that where we found

00:28:17.487 --> 00:28:19.489 align:middle line:84%
electrical points
on the body is where

00:28:19.489 --> 00:28:21.241 align:middle line:90%
they found electrical points.

00:28:21.241 --> 00:28:24.119 align:middle line:84%
They use their equipment
and medicine there.

00:28:24.119 --> 00:28:29.666 align:middle line:84%
I use my electrical medicine and
chemical medicine there, also.

00:28:29.666 --> 00:28:33.253 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know that there is
any comparison between the two.

00:28:33.253 --> 00:28:35.672 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So Pete, could
you describe for us,

00:28:35.672 --> 00:28:38.675 align:middle line:90%
what is the machine?

00:28:38.675 --> 00:28:41.929 align:middle line:84%
How did you turn this
into a diagnostic tool

00:28:41.929 --> 00:28:43.138 align:middle line:90%
that's a technology?

00:28:43.138 --> 00:28:44.389 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:47.726 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: This Reinhard
Voll that I mentioned earlier

00:28:47.726 --> 00:28:51.772 align:middle line:84%
made a machine for doing
diagnosis by measuring

00:28:51.772 --> 00:28:53.523 align:middle line:90%
current fields at these points.

00:28:57.653 --> 00:29:01.073 align:middle line:84%
All he knew was
that at that point

00:29:01.073 --> 00:29:03.992 align:middle line:84%
typically in the
field of homeopathy,

00:29:03.992 --> 00:29:06.662 align:middle line:84%
which he also had
studied, that there

00:29:06.662 --> 00:29:09.581 align:middle line:84%
was a homeopathic medicine
that would cover problems

00:29:09.581 --> 00:29:10.958 align:middle line:90%
with those points.

00:29:10.958 --> 00:29:16.380 align:middle line:84%
He later tied the measurement of
these currents at these points

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:19.925 align:middle line:90%
to homeopathic medicines.

00:29:19.925 --> 00:29:22.260 align:middle line:84%
But you had to take the
homeopathic medicine

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:24.471 align:middle line:90%
and either hold it or inject it.

00:29:24.471 --> 00:29:27.391 align:middle line:84%
Homeopathic medicine--
you may have

00:29:27.391 --> 00:29:31.478 align:middle line:84%
500 medicines that are the same
thing but slightly different

00:29:31.478 --> 00:29:33.397 align:middle line:90%
dilutions.

00:29:33.397 --> 00:29:40.237 align:middle line:84%
And the dilution has as much
to do with an effective cure

00:29:40.237 --> 00:29:44.700 align:middle line:84%
as does the what,
the medicine itself.

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:48.578 align:middle line:84%
The medicines usually
come from natural things.

00:29:48.578 --> 00:29:51.081 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Let me just ask
a really stupid question.

00:29:51.081 --> 00:29:53.291 align:middle line:84%
How would the amount
of electrical charge

00:29:53.291 --> 00:29:57.921 align:middle line:84%
on a particular organ that's
got an acupuncture point-- how

00:29:57.921 --> 00:29:59.715 align:middle line:84%
would that amount
of electrical charge

00:29:59.715 --> 00:30:02.968 align:middle line:84%
correspond to whether the
organ is healthy or sick?

00:30:02.968 --> 00:30:05.387 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: That's very complex.

00:30:05.387 --> 00:30:08.306 align:middle line:84%
It's more than just the
amount of electricity.

00:30:08.306 --> 00:30:10.767 align:middle line:84%
It's the amount,
when it's there,

00:30:10.767 --> 00:30:13.812 align:middle line:90%
what waveform it may have.

00:30:13.812 --> 00:30:16.064 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is
that as we measure

00:30:16.064 --> 00:30:18.150 align:middle line:90%
these points on a machine--

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:20.360 align:middle line:84%
I built a machine
that correlates

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:25.032 align:middle line:84%
all the informational fields
from every kind of chemical

00:30:25.032 --> 00:30:26.825 align:middle line:90%
and medicine there is.

00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:32.414 align:middle line:84%
And then I tied that to
how it affects that point.

00:30:32.414 --> 00:30:35.584 align:middle line:90%
And it's not the charge.

00:30:35.584 --> 00:30:39.212 align:middle line:84%
It's the amount of charge, how
fast does the charge build,

00:30:39.212 --> 00:30:42.132 align:middle line:84%
how fast does the
charge discharge,

00:30:42.132 --> 00:30:45.469 align:middle line:84%
what wave shape
it takes on given

00:30:45.469 --> 00:30:47.679 align:middle line:90%
as it travels through the body.

00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:51.016 align:middle line:84%
All these things are
calculated together.

00:30:51.016 --> 00:30:53.226 align:middle line:84%
And a conclusion
is drawn from it.

00:30:53.226 --> 00:30:57.355 align:middle line:84%
And it makes a recommendation
for a treatment that

00:30:57.355 --> 00:31:01.568 align:middle line:84%
will bring that point
back to the charge you

00:31:01.568 --> 00:31:05.697 align:middle line:84%
would see if it was in
perfect health and normal.

00:31:05.697 --> 00:31:08.742 align:middle line:84%
What charge and what
waveforms and all

00:31:08.742 --> 00:31:10.952 align:middle line:90%
are there at that point?

00:31:10.952 --> 00:31:13.038 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Do you
have any examples

00:31:13.038 --> 00:31:15.665 align:middle line:84%
of people who have
successfully used your device

00:31:15.665 --> 00:31:17.167 align:middle line:90%
in practical application?

00:31:17.167 --> 00:31:19.503 align:middle line:84%
And if so, how many people
have been able to use this?

00:31:22.589 --> 00:31:25.884 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I taught, I think,
about 17 companies how to build

00:31:25.884 --> 00:31:29.638 align:middle line:84%
this equipment and turned
them loose with it--

00:31:29.638 --> 00:31:33.642 align:middle line:84%
taught them basic construction,
turned them loose.

00:31:33.642 --> 00:31:36.103 align:middle line:84%
Those doctors-- some of them
were exceedingly brilliant.

00:31:36.103 --> 00:31:38.605 align:middle line:84%
They've come up with
a lot of new things.

00:31:38.605 --> 00:31:43.777 align:middle line:84%
This has been going
on since 1981.

00:31:43.777 --> 00:31:45.862 align:middle line:90%
So it's gone on a long time.

00:31:45.862 --> 00:31:48.532 align:middle line:84%
There are organizations
involved with it.

00:31:48.532 --> 00:31:54.329 align:middle line:84%
There are going on continuing
education classes in it

00:31:54.329 --> 00:31:56.206 align:middle line:90%
done all over the world.

00:31:56.206 --> 00:32:00.335 align:middle line:84%
There are probably close to
40,000 instruments in the US

00:32:00.335 --> 00:32:03.713 align:middle line:84%
and probably three
times that overseas.

00:32:03.713 --> 00:32:07.634 align:middle line:84%
Britain was basically--
we were homeopathic here.

00:32:07.634 --> 00:32:11.388 align:middle line:90%
Harvard taught homeopathy.

00:32:11.388 --> 00:32:14.933 align:middle line:84%
Stanford taught
homeopathy, et cetera.

00:32:14.933 --> 00:32:17.602 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
homeopathic schools.

00:32:17.602 --> 00:32:20.564 align:middle line:84%
Now you'll hear that
that's a medicine that

00:32:20.564 --> 00:32:22.566 align:middle line:90%
has no background or no basis.

00:32:22.566 --> 00:32:25.402 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, we've established the
whole entire science for it

00:32:25.402 --> 00:32:27.154 align:middle line:84%
and why it works
and how it works.

00:32:27.154 --> 00:32:31.825 align:middle line:84%
That was never known because it
didn't work like electricity.

00:32:31.825 --> 00:32:34.119 align:middle line:90%
It didn't work like electronics.

00:32:34.119 --> 00:32:35.829 align:middle line:90%
It didn't work like medicine.

00:32:35.829 --> 00:32:37.664 align:middle line:90%
It didn't work like chemistry.

00:32:37.664 --> 00:32:39.833 align:middle line:90%
It worked on information.

00:32:39.833 --> 00:32:40.792 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:32:40.792 --> 00:32:42.085 align:middle line:90%
And I want to point out, Pete--

00:32:42.085 --> 00:32:44.045 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And information
is very complex.

00:32:44.045 --> 00:32:45.505 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I want to
point out, Pete,

00:32:45.505 --> 00:32:49.634 align:middle line:84%
that you gave me the names of
two different people in the Los

00:32:49.634 --> 00:32:52.554 align:middle line:84%
Angeles area who
had your device.

00:32:52.554 --> 00:32:56.057 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to go to them
and bring someone who they

00:32:56.057 --> 00:32:57.642 align:middle line:90%
didn't know anything about.

00:32:57.642 --> 00:33:00.562 align:middle line:84%
And we got incredibly
accurate diagnosis of things

00:33:00.562 --> 00:33:02.731 align:middle line:84%
that we already
knew were going on.

00:33:02.731 --> 00:33:04.608 align:middle line:84%
And we found out
other stuff that we

00:33:04.608 --> 00:33:06.443 align:middle line:90%
didn't know was going on.

00:33:06.443 --> 00:33:09.404 align:middle line:84%
So I guess that
you've managed to get

00:33:09.404 --> 00:33:11.531 align:middle line:84%
some pretty miraculous
results out of this,

00:33:11.531 --> 00:33:12.782 align:middle line:90%
including healings.

00:33:12.782 --> 00:33:17.120 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, I'll
say the doctors have.

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:19.539 align:middle line:90%
They've learned a lot.

00:33:19.539 --> 00:33:21.374 align:middle line:90%
Most of them are very famous.

00:33:21.374 --> 00:33:26.963 align:middle line:84%
I can say that the doctors
by and large have probably

00:33:26.963 --> 00:33:29.883 align:middle line:84%
offered their services
at lower rates

00:33:29.883 --> 00:33:32.510 align:middle line:84%
and have made more money
than the standard doctors

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:34.262 align:middle line:90%
in practice.

00:33:34.262 --> 00:33:37.724 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's an
overall thing that we see.

00:33:37.724 --> 00:33:44.397 align:middle line:84%
I got out of it about 25 years
ago to work on another area.

00:33:44.397 --> 00:33:46.566 align:middle line:90%
I saw that was going.

00:33:46.566 --> 00:33:50.695 align:middle line:90%
The doctors were replicating.

00:33:50.695 --> 00:33:54.074 align:middle line:84%
Most people started
with one doctor,

00:33:54.074 --> 00:33:55.242 align:middle line:90%
and he would build a clinic.

00:33:55.242 --> 00:33:57.827 align:middle line:84%
Most of them now have
seven or eight doctors that

00:33:57.827 --> 00:33:59.621 align:middle line:90%
are working at that clinic.

00:33:59.621 --> 00:34:04.834 align:middle line:84%
And they tell me, oh,
now I've got just the--

00:34:04.834 --> 00:34:06.503 align:middle line:90%
people call and book.

00:34:06.503 --> 00:34:08.463 align:middle line:84%
But I book three
years in advance.

00:34:08.463 --> 00:34:11.424 align:middle line:84%
Well, who calls a doctor to
book three years in advance?

00:34:11.424 --> 00:34:14.010 align:middle line:84%
You call a doctor
when you're ill.

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:16.471 align:middle line:84%
In China, when you're
an acupuncturist

00:34:16.471 --> 00:34:20.684 align:middle line:84%
or when you use this
electroacupuncture,

00:34:20.684 --> 00:34:22.768 align:middle line:84%
you book people four
years in advance

00:34:22.768 --> 00:34:24.896 align:middle line:84%
because you know that's
what's going to happen.

00:34:24.896 --> 00:34:27.440 align:middle line:84%
You can tell four years ahead
of time what's going to happen.

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.733 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Well, Pete, I'm sorry.

00:34:28.733 --> 00:34:30.652 align:middle line:84%
But that's all the
time we have right now.

00:34:30.652 --> 00:34:33.321 align:middle line:84%
This is a really
fascinating subject.

00:34:33.321 --> 00:34:35.782 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank you
for being here, Pete.

00:34:35.782 --> 00:34:38.994 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, David Wilcock,
here with Dr. Pete Peterson.

00:34:38.994 --> 00:34:40.786 align:middle line:90%
And we thank you for watching.

00:34:40.786 --> 00:34:43.873 align:middle line:90%
