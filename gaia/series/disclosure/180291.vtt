00:00:19.825 --> 00:00:21.700 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID WILCOCK: I'm
here with Pete Peterson,

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.390 align:middle line:10%
and we are exploring some
of the early influences that

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.450 align:middle line:10%
led to him being
able to have such

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.850 align:middle line:10%
an incredible
scientific knowledge.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.400 align:middle line:84%
Every subject that Pete
seems to talk about,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.890 align:middle line:84%
he has amazingly
technical details

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.830 align:middle line:84%
that go far beyond what
most people would ever do.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.527 align:middle line:84%
So Pete, welcome
back to the show.

00:00:40.527 --> 00:00:41.860 align:middle line:90%
>>PETE PETERSON: Thank you much.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: We've been talking
in the past about your work

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.920 align:middle line:84%
with what appears to
have been some highly

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.880 align:middle line:84%
classified, compartmentalized
program, which

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.650 align:middle line:84%
may have been run
by the government,

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.170 align:middle line:84%
that you were calling
White Star Ranch.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And you also said that they
were only kind of directing you,

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.490 align:middle line:84%
loosely, through a very
advanced, and very prolonged

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.666 align:middle line:90%
study program.

00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:09.790 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: That's correct.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You've also mentioned--
and this is some of the stuff

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.130 align:middle line:84%
that we've talked
about off camera--

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.640 align:middle line:84%
that you worked with some
really intense luminaries

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.790 align:middle line:90%
in the course of these--

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.250 align:middle line:84%
shall we say facilitated
study programs,

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.390 align:middle line:90%
that you were brought into?

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.440 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Absolutely.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So could you start
with some of the names that

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.450 align:middle line:84%
were earlier along of people who
you worked with, that we might

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.734 align:middle line:84%
be able to look up or
corroborate some of the details

00:01:36.734 --> 00:01:37.900 align:middle line:90%
that you're sharing with us?

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.410 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, some of
them were highly well known

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.110 align:middle line:84%
in the esoteric science
field, or mathematics,

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.040 align:middle line:90%
or other things.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were known
in the business field,

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.430 align:middle line:90%
but differently than they--

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.096 align:middle line:84%
definitely they were
different than they

00:01:53.096 --> 00:01:54.580 align:middle line:90%
were known about the public.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'll cover those
differences, and things

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.660 align:middle line:90%
like that, as we go along.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.980 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Some of them
are luminaries today

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.380 align:middle line:84%
in their fields, and they
were beginners in those days.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.699 align:middle line:84%
And there are some of
them I co-studied with,

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:15.820 align:middle line:84%
that were co-studiers
within this overall program.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And the White Star
Ranch thing was

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.420 align:middle line:84%
kind of a coordinating thing,
and it was all very highly--

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.800 align:middle line:84%
like, you never knew
who you were really--

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.030 align:middle line:90%
who was directing it.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.516 align:middle line:90%
You never knew who was doing it.

00:02:32.516 --> 00:02:33.640 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't White Star Ranch.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.250 align:middle line:84%
All White Ranch
was there for was

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.750 align:middle line:84%
to take care of the
paperwork, and the books,

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:39.550 align:middle line:90%
and the bookings.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And the transportation,
and then--

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.070 align:middle line:84%
I got my directions as to
where you'd be studying next,

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.730 align:middle line:84%
or who you'd be studying
with next from there,

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.090 align:middle line:84%
but it was like they were
just passing envelopes along.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.950 align:middle line:90%
So they weren't really--

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.890 align:middle line:84%
this was a very
top secret program,

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.162 align:middle line:84%
and they were really
compartmentalized.

00:03:01.162 --> 00:03:02.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Were you
aware that it was

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.869 align:middle line:84%
top secret from the beginning,
when you first started?

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:06.880 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I was--
my original briefing

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.230 align:middle line:84%
was one that made me
shiver for a couple years.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.974 align:middle line:84%
What about the briefing
made you shiver so much?

00:03:14.974 --> 00:03:17.140 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, the fact
that if I opened my mouth

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.170 align:middle line:84%
or said anything, I would
be summarily dismissed.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.590 align:middle line:90%
Permanently.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.440 align:middle line:90%
And that was made very clear.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.330 align:middle line:84%
And every once in
a while, somebody

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.190 align:middle line:84%
boo booed in the program,
that you might have known

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.850 align:middle line:84%
was in the program,
and they were no longer

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.010 align:middle line:84%
in the program, or
any other program.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.180 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Mm.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And
so-- you know, it's

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:48.040 align:middle line:84%
like during the Gulf
War one, the F-117 was

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.220 align:middle line:90%
introduced to the public.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.900 align:middle line:90%
The stealth fighter.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.420 align:middle line:90%
And everybody went, oh my god.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.730 align:middle line:84%
They never realized we had
anything this advanced.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.920 align:middle line:90%
What a wonderful craft.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.800 align:middle line:84%
It's just amazing, and et
cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.540 align:middle line:84%
Most of them had been in
mothballs for 20 years.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.370 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I mean, that
was-- that was an old thing.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.166 align:middle line:84%
And yet nobody had
ever heard about it.

00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:11.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Well, one of the--

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.890 align:middle line:84%
Pete, one of the ones I've used,
just for people who don't think

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.959 align:middle line:84%
that the government
ever keeps a secret,

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.779 align:middle line:90%
would be the Manhattan Project.

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:19.959 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Oh, absolutely.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It's documented
that there was 130,000 people

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.325 align:middle line:90%
working on it for many years.

00:04:25.325 --> 00:04:26.950 align:middle line:84%
Many of them-- most
of them didn't even

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.530 align:middle line:84%
know what they were working
on until the bomb actually

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.870 align:middle line:90%
went off.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.220 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, not even until
after the bomb went off.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.880 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Right

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So this
is something that

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.920 align:middle line:90%
was reinforced with threats?

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.130 align:middle line:84%
You were fearing
for your life if you

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.637 align:middle line:84%
were to ever talk to anyone
about what was going on?

00:04:44.637 --> 00:04:46.720 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Oh, I couldn't
talk to my sister I was

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.324 align:middle line:90%
very close to, and my parents.

00:04:48.324 --> 00:04:50.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But yet some of the
names that you're going to be

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.279 align:middle line:84%
sharing with us were essentially
celebrities, or at least--

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:55.570 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Times have changed.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.260 align:middle line:90%
Many of them have passed away.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.390 align:middle line:84%
Some of their-- very
few of their exploits

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.022 align:middle line:84%
are really known, yet they
were quite well known.

00:05:04.022 --> 00:05:05.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well I'm also
saying, though, it

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.530 align:middle line:84%
must have been difficult
for you at the time

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.309 align:middle line:84%
to know that you were working
with these big luminaries who

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:12.850 align:middle line:84%
were publicly known,
but you couldn't

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.287 align:middle line:84%
say a word about ever talking
to them at all, right?

00:05:15.287 --> 00:05:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, maybe
that's why I was selected.

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.210 align:middle line:84%
I didn't ever have
a problem with that.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.060 align:middle line:84%
I had-- had had a problem
learning about it.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I had
friends that were--

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.120 align:middle line:84%
admittedly was a
geek of the time.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.050 align:middle line:90%
A geek, you know?

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.230 align:middle line:90%
A total geek.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.030 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And had
no idea that women

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.700 align:middle line:84%
had any other role than
cooking, and that kind of thing.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.210 align:middle line:84%
I was interested in
science, and I loved

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.650 align:middle line:90%
spending my time in science.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And I was put into contact
with brilliant scientists.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.580 align:middle line:84%
I was put into laboratories
with brilliant scientists.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.579 align:middle line:84%
And I learned things
that I never would-- not

00:05:51.579 --> 00:05:53.620 align:middle line:84%
even today, a lot of the
things I'd have a chance

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.190 align:middle line:90%
to learn anywhere else.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well,
let's get started.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.430 align:middle line:84%
Could you tell us one
of the earlier names

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:01.990 align:middle line:84%
that we might be
able to look up?

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.180 align:middle line:90%
Like somebody you studied with?

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.430 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Start with
the earliest name.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:11.020 align:middle line:84%
The first contact I had
with one of my mentors

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.866 align:middle line:84%
was Edwin Land, who was the
head of Polaroid Corporation.

00:06:14.866 --> 00:06:15.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Hm.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.630 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And I remember
when I went out there--

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:25.915 align:middle line:84%
I was 13 years old, and went
out there on a DC6 airplane.

00:06:25.915 --> 00:06:28.130 align:middle line:84%
That gives you an idea
how long ago it was.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:28.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.300 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: That was the
most modern thing we had

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.700 align:middle line:90%
for hauling people.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And I got off the
plane, and he said,

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.380 align:middle line:84%
if you think we're going to talk
about the GD Polaroid camera,

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.120 align:middle line:84%
get back on the
plane and go home.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.910 align:middle line:84%
He was embarrassed
by it, because that

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.490 align:middle line:90%
wasn't his real field.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's something
that he did in order

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.480 align:middle line:84%
to make something
very new happen,

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.060 align:middle line:90%
which was the Polaroid camera.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, his expertise was in
the field of human sight,

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.306 align:middle line:90%
and how we actually see.

00:07:00.306 --> 00:07:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
the first comment,

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.130 align:middle line:84%
he said, now, the
first lesson is

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.731 align:middle line:90%
you don't see with your eyes.

00:07:05.731 --> 00:07:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to
think, well, yeah,

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.130 align:middle line:84%
I have heard there
are other organs that

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.670 align:middle line:84%
have light sensitivity,
but I don't see why

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.230 align:middle line:90%
we talk about the eyes so much.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:18.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, turns out that we do see
with our eyes, but only very

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:22.210 align:middle line:84%
primarily, and then the brain
converts those signals over

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:23.100 align:middle line:90%
to what we see.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.540 align:middle line:84%
For example, 8 feet
away from a wall--

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:32.030 align:middle line:84%
about the most sensitive,
or the smallest device

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:36.410 align:middle line:84%
we have in our system to
see is the end of a rod.

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:39.920 align:middle line:84%
The rod cells and
cone cells in the eye,

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.000 align:middle line:90%
and the end of the rod--

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.208 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: In the retina, yeah.

00:07:42.208 --> 00:07:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Is just
the tip of a pin.

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And he said, now, if you
take the diameter of that

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.520 align:middle line:84%
and multiply the
diameter backwards

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.170 align:middle line:84%
through the magnification of
the lens of an eye, at 8 feet

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:56.480 align:middle line:84%
the smallest thing you can
see on the wall over there,

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.600 align:middle line:90%
it's not a cockroach.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.310 align:middle line:84%
It's like, a 1/4 inch
diameter-- it's like,

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:06.130 align:middle line:84%
a ladybug, or about a 1/4
inch diameter type thing.

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at the wall,
and I saw an ant crawling.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.570 align:middle line:84%
So how am I seeing the
ant crawl up the wall?

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:14.300 align:middle line:84%
He says, that's exactly what
we're here to talk about.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.210 align:middle line:84%
He says, you don't see the
ant crawling up the wall.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:23.680 align:middle line:84%
What you see is it's a number
of sightings of this ant,

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.110 align:middle line:84%
and then you put that
together with the ants

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:29.030 align:middle line:84%
you've seen when you're
close up to the wall,

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.600 align:middle line:84%
and the mind is not
only looking at the ant,

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.869 align:middle line:84%
it's seeing how fast does
this thing go, how does it--

00:08:35.869 --> 00:08:38.450 align:middle line:90%
you know, how does it crawl?

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And all of that goes
together, and then

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:42.650 align:middle line:84%
that comes back and
says, oh, I remember

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:45.500 align:middle line:84%
this thing you saw when we were
right up, looking at the wall.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:46.632 align:middle line:90%
That's an ant.

00:08:46.632 --> 00:08:47.534 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Hm.

00:08:47.534 --> 00:08:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And
then from then on,

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:51.590 align:middle line:84%
that little ant up in your
brain is what you see.

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And then it warps itself
according to the movement

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:58.292 align:middle line:84%
that it sees on this thing,
and makes an ant out of it.

00:08:58.292 --> 00:08:59.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Do you
think that this may

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:03.650 align:middle line:84%
be part of why there's
that legend of the Mayans

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:06.860 align:middle line:84%
not being able to see the
ships of the conquistadors

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.360 align:middle line:90%
as they were sailing in?

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: It's learned.

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:10.780 align:middle line:90%
All vision is learned.

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.620 align:middle line:90%
You go into a new field--

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.190 align:middle line:84%
you go into a new field
and you see things--

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:17.420 align:middle line:90%
A, you see things differently.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:19.300 align:middle line:90%
B, you see other things.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.530 align:middle line:84%
It's like I-- taught
a lot of classes

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:24.260 align:middle line:84%
when I was in the Marine
Corps, in survival.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And I taught a lot of
classes in combat survival,

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.760 align:middle line:90%
which is very different.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And when people went
in, we had a huge--

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:36.950 align:middle line:84%
we had a canyon, and we
had bleachers on one side,

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:38.780 align:middle line:84%
and on the other side--
at Camp Pendleton

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.080 align:middle line:90%
in California-- jungle.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.610 align:middle line:90%
Or apparent jungle.

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And so you're looking out,
down through this canyon,

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:48.560 align:middle line:90%
and up the other side.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And then they said
now, look to see

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:56.090 align:middle line:84%
if you can see people behind
trees, in trees, behind bushes,

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:57.610 align:middle line:90%
on the ground.

00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:58.670 align:middle line:90%
Well, you're in combat.

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:00.080 align:middle line:84%
You want to know if
there's an enemy out there.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:00.170 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:01.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're trying to
see little traces of them.

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:02.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.670 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, now
you're trying to see them.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:08.270 align:middle line:84%
You want to know,
there's a sniper there.

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:12.410 align:middle line:90%
There is a mortar outfit here.

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And you're out looking
for very specific things.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:19.370 align:middle line:84%
This is your first day
on this training ground.

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:22.080 align:middle line:84%
You look out there,
and you see nothing.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And then a sergeant
major or a gunny

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.775 align:middle line:90%
walks out and says, attention!

00:10:27.775 --> 00:10:30.317 align:middle line:84%
And the whole damn field,
and the whole other side

00:10:30.317 --> 00:10:32.150 align:middle line:84%
of the thing, and all
the trees-- everything

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:33.920 align:middle line:90%
just come alive.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And you realize
everybody was there,

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.589 align:middle line:90%
but you didn't see a thing.

00:10:37.589 --> 00:10:39.380 align:middle line:84%
By the time you're done
with those classes,

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.450 align:middle line:84%
you walk out there and you
can say, there's a sniper.

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:42.650 align:middle line:84%
There's a guy with
a gun, there's

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:43.691 align:middle line:90%
a guy with hand grenades.

00:10:43.691 --> 00:10:45.860 align:middle line:84%
There's a guy-- and
you can see 'em all.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:49.730 align:middle line:84%
Because what's happened is
you've now made recordings

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:52.430 align:middle line:84%
in your mind of what
these things are,

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:55.070 align:middle line:84%
and you'll have one-- each
person get up individually

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:56.065 align:middle line:90%
and make movements.

00:10:56.065 --> 00:10:57.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I think
you've mentioned

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.360 align:middle line:84%
to me before something
called a ghillie suit.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.560 align:middle line:84%
Is that one of the
things that was--

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.435 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: One of the
things that we studied

00:11:02.435 --> 00:11:04.130 align:middle line:90%
there was the ghillie suit.

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:08.660 align:middle line:84%
It's a Scottish thing,
coming from way back when.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.535 align:middle line:84%
And it's taking a
little bit of fishnet--

00:11:11.535 --> 00:11:13.430 align:middle line:90%
that's what they did--

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.110 align:middle line:84%
and draping it
over your clothing.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:16.820 align:middle line:84%
Pinning it on, say,
with safety pins,

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.290 align:middle line:84%
or whatever they
had in those days.

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:19.370 align:middle line:90%
Buttons, probably.

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:20.170 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:21.650 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Or toggles.

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And pinning it on, and having
different colors of threads--

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:29.090 align:middle line:90%
yarns and threads hanging down--

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:32.910 align:middle line:84%
and different pieces of
foliage and leaves sewn on.

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:33.710 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And you know,
you can look like a tree,

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:39.530 align:middle line:90%
and part of a tree trunk.

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:42.560 align:middle line:84%
You know, things that in real
life out there are vertical,

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.060 align:middle line:90%
you have vertical on your suit.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Things that are horizontal, you
have horizontal on the suit.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll have some
tree branches stuck on there,

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:54.099 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, and all of a
sudden, when the mind sees you,

00:11:54.099 --> 00:11:55.640 align:middle line:84%
the mind sees
everything else around,

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:59.790 align:middle line:84%
because it's all the same shape,
and size, and orientation.

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you
mentioned Ed Land

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:04.660 align:middle line:84%
is saying that the eyes
aren't really seeing,

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:08.210 align:middle line:84%
and that there's some
sort of associative memory

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:13.280 align:middle line:84%
that has tracking of what
you already noticed before.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.980 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: You see through the
filters that are in your brain.

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:16.780 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Your
eye eyes a sensor,

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.760 align:middle line:84%
and it picks up-- it
picks up certain portions,

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.459 align:middle line:90%
certain colors.

00:12:25.459 --> 00:12:27.250 align:middle line:84%
Part of your eye picks
up color, part of it

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:28.910 align:middle line:90%
picks up black and white.

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:32.300 align:middle line:84%
Part of it increases more and
more as the sun goes down,

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.070 align:middle line:90%
or when the sun comes up.

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:35.260 align:middle line:90%
Dead, and it goes down.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, you know
something you remind me of?

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:37.840 align:middle line:90%
It's really funny.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.250 align:middle line:84%
There's this video
on the internet,

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:43.130 align:middle line:84%
and before you watch the
video, they tell you--

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:48.290 align:middle line:84%
watch the basketball,
and see how many people--

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:50.660 align:middle line:84%
how many times the basketball
bounces from one person

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:52.410 align:middle line:90%
to another.

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And you watch this
basketball going around--

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.360 align:middle line:90%
I did it myself--

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.930 align:middle line:84%
and I never saw that there is
this person who walks through,

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:01.130 align:middle line:90%
in a jet black gorilla suit.

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:04.340 align:middle line:84%
Very slowly, kind of
walks through the scene.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:06.247 align:middle line:90%
And you never see the gorilla.

00:13:06.247 --> 00:13:07.830 align:middle line:84%
But then when you
go back you're like,

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:10.160 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, there
was a gorilla there.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.285 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: This is the--

00:13:11.285 --> 00:13:14.480 align:middle line:84%
a good part of the
study of ninja.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.260 align:middle line:90%
Martial art, ninja art.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:22.310 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you don't ever
look at people in a scene,

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:25.460 align:middle line:84%
the people in the
scenes never see you.

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:27.110 align:middle line:90%
Many people, they never see.

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:29.450 align:middle line:84%
That's why you bump into
people in the street,

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:32.180 align:middle line:84%
and it's such a surprise
when you bump into someone.

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:35.620 align:middle line:84%
It's because they
weren't looking at you.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:38.150 align:middle line:84%
Or it's because they had the
right color-- a different color

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:39.727 align:middle line:90%
pattern on.

00:13:39.727 --> 00:13:41.060 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Well, let's also talk--

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:44.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure a lot of people
are thinking about this--

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:50.780 align:middle line:84%
when you are hypothetically
taking psychedelic drugs--

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:54.290 align:middle line:84%
not that any of us have ever
done that, but theoretically,

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:56.900 align:middle line:84%
I've heard that people
take psychedelic drugs.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And that your
peripheral vision--

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:02.510 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't work the
same way anymore.

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:04.952 align:middle line:84%
You start seeing things
that aren't really there.

00:14:04.952 --> 00:14:06.410 align:middle line:84%
You have these
bizarre experiences.

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well,
on the other hand,

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:09.360 align:middle line:84%
you may see things
that are there that you

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.670 align:middle line:90%
haven't seen before, too.

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:12.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.650 align:middle line:90%
So is this part of the--

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:15.530 align:middle line:90%
are hallucinations, and those--

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:16.890 align:middle line:90%
you don't have to be tripping--

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:18.515 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: They're
not hallucinations.

00:14:18.515 --> 00:14:20.170 align:middle line:90%
They're part of our life.

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And we can develop these skills,
just like develop the skill

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.300 align:middle line:84%
to see someone in
very good camouflage.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.310 align:middle line:84%
Good camouflages only
last in the military

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:31.809 align:middle line:90%
for four to five years.

00:14:31.809 --> 00:14:33.600 align:middle line:84%
Like four to five years
ago, we didn't have

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.940 align:middle line:90%
a camouflage called multi-cam.

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Now we've gone
almost all the way

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:39.295 align:middle line:90%
through the multi-cam saying.

00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:41.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm back to the thing that I
think olive drab is probably

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:44.310 align:middle line:84%
the best thing, because
then the mind can make up

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:46.630 align:middle line:90%
whatever it wants to.

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Instead of going down into
a narrow band of things

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:53.340 align:middle line:84%
that we want to train the
eye to see, or not to see,

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:57.780 align:middle line:84%
you ave a very broad band, which
the eye can decide what it is.

00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:00.840 align:middle line:84%
But you make it such that
it will decide that it is

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.622 align:middle line:90%
something that it isn't.

00:15:02.622 --> 00:15:04.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well,
since we're focusing

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.690 align:middle line:84%
on names in this episode,
let's talk a little bit more

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:10.920 align:middle line:84%
specifically about
Ed Land, and what

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.815 align:middle line:84%
was the exact nature
of this training?

00:15:12.815 --> 00:15:14.940 align:middle line:84%
He's starting to tell you
that the mind is seeing--

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.640 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: The idea
was to train me.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:21.090 align:middle line:84%
The end idea of my training,
my particular training

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:24.990 align:middle line:84%
within this group, was to
be able to bring me any--

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:29.375 align:middle line:84%
any type of problem, and have
me come up with a solution.

00:15:29.375 --> 00:15:33.360 align:middle line:84%
So I was trained in electronics,
and optics, and linguistics,

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.210 align:middle line:90%
and mechanics, and physics.

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And you know, et cetera,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:44.560 align:middle line:84%
Overall, jack of all trades,
master of maybe a couple.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And it was very handy because
there's so much out there

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.910 align:middle line:90%
that we haven't studied.

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:55.260 align:middle line:84%
For example, James
Clerk Maxwell, father

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:56.820 align:middle line:90%
of electromagnetic theory.

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:59.190 align:middle line:84%
In studying
electromagnetics, I realized

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:03.220 align:middle line:84%
that Maxwell, without the use
of all the modern equipment

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:04.020 align:middle line:90%
we have--

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:07.980 align:middle line:84%
laboratory
equipment-- he came up

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.530 align:middle line:84%
with electromagnetic
theory, which

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:14.740 align:middle line:84%
is the basis for all of
electronic sight, television,

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:15.820 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, et cetera.

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:19.710 align:middle line:84%
All the basis for all of
radio, all electromagnetic

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:22.980 align:middle line:90%
communication, et cetera.

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:27.930 align:middle line:84%
I was in England, and went to
whee-- his laboratory there.

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And they have everything
that he ever wrote.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.520 align:middle line:84%
All the notes, all the--
in those days, you know,

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:35.370 align:middle line:84%
we didn't have
electronic communication.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And all the notes, and
letters, and everything.

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:41.190 align:middle line:84%
They had gone around the world
and gathered up all this stuff.

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:44.910 align:middle line:84%
I got realizing that
of what he came up

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:49.170 align:middle line:84%
with that was earth-shaking,
only about 10% of it

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:51.900 align:middle line:90%
had ever been published.

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:55.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Yeah, I-- years
ago, years ago-- studied

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:59.640 align:middle line:84%
Oliver Heaviside taking all of
these different mathematical

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.650 align:middle line:84%
expressions that Maxwell
would come up with,

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:04.950 align:middle line:84%
called quaternions, and
then boiling all of it

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:06.930 align:middle line:90%
down to just four of them.

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:10.349 align:middle line:84%
And finding that most of the
stuff that we needed to do,

00:17:10.349 --> 00:17:12.540 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetics
that we were doing,

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.010 align:middle line:84%
could be done just
on these four,

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:16.218 align:middle line:84%
so why do you want to mess
with all this other stuff?

00:17:16.218 --> 00:17:17.109 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Exactly.

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the
stuff was not done.

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.859 align:middle line:84%
Each one of these things
was an invention as

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:26.304 align:middle line:84%
important to humanity
as electromagnetics,

00:17:26.304 --> 00:17:28.220 align:middle line:90%
and electromagnetic radiation.

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And yet nothing had ever
been done with it at all.

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:34.780 align:middle line:84%
He was only capable of so
much, and it was so exciting

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:35.580 align:middle line:90%
in those days.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:36.810 align:middle line:90%
They left off with it.

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Oh, here we can communicate
over a distance.

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:43.410 align:middle line:84%
Here we can-- and so there
was a lot of stuff there.

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:48.280 align:middle line:84%
So I bought a brand new Xerox
machine, and wore it out.

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And I have books, and
books, and books somewhere,

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:54.100 align:middle line:84%
if they haven't been
molded away in storage.

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:58.050 align:middle line:84%
But of different things that
I wanted to get back to,

00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:01.080 align:middle line:84%
but I've had such a busy
life, I've never done it.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So this
multi-disciplinary education

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:07.170 align:middle line:84%
you were given, as you
just said, had as its goal

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:09.630 align:middle line:84%
making you the
ultimate go to guy

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:11.466 align:middle line:84%
for fixing any type
of weird problem

00:18:11.466 --> 00:18:12.840 align:middle line:84%
that they might
have been facing.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.131 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, one of them,
because there were a number

00:18:15.131 --> 00:18:17.010 align:middle line:90%
of us that were made this way.

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:19.740 align:middle line:84%
Some you probably
know about was--

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Patrick Flanagan was in
that same training group.

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:24.510 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:26.040 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: He's the guy
who wrote the pyramid power

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.330 align:middle line:84%
book that was so
famous in the 1970s.

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:27.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:28.830 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yeah.

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:31.200 align:middle line:10%
I remember one time I
had dinner with him when

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.632 align:middle line:10%
he was visiting in Salt Lake.

00:18:33.632 --> 00:18:36.090 align:middle line:84%
I asked him about something
that he was doing, and he says,

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.130 align:middle line:90%
people don't want the truth.

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:41.040 align:middle line:84%
They want BS that sounds
exciting or familiar.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.560 align:middle line:84%
So I-- in my lab-- he
did it in his lab--

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:47.550 align:middle line:84%
he did brilliant,
brilliant, brilliant work.

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:49.680 align:middle line:84%
But you rarely saw that
come out in public,

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:53.070 align:middle line:84%
because the people weren't
sophisticated enough

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:54.270 align:middle line:90%
to know how good it was.

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And it completely overruled
the science of the day.

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:01.587 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So it sounds like this
was a very unusual education

00:19:01.587 --> 00:19:02.670 align:middle line:90%
that you were being given.

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:03.794 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Well, I would--

00:19:03.794 --> 00:19:07.020 align:middle line:84%
I would work with the
teacher for a period of time.

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:09.690 align:middle line:84%
Six months, usually, or
somewhere in that area.

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:12.490 align:middle line:84%
Then I would work within that
field for a period of time,

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:13.970 align:middle line:90%
where actual work was going on.

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:14.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:16.353 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And
they'd move me around.

00:19:16.353 --> 00:19:18.850 align:middle line:84%
If there were three things
going on, I'd move here,

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:20.650 align:middle line:84%
and I'd move here,
I'd move here.

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:24.050 align:middle line:84%
So I would get an
upgraded experience,

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:26.100 align:middle line:90%
plus I'd get hands on--

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:27.800 align:middle line:90%
hands on knowledge.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.844 align:middle line:84%
And I would devise experiments
later on, as I got smarter.

00:19:30.844 --> 00:19:33.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Can you give us
another example of somebody

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:35.865 align:middle line:84%
that we might be able to look
up, that you studied with?

00:19:35.865 --> 00:19:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: There
was a gentleman

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:43.250 align:middle line:84%
that was exceedingly famous,
but unfortunately his timing

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:45.560 align:middle line:90%
was off.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:49.550 align:middle line:84%
We called him Ed,
but Ewart Baldwin.

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And he's the gentleman that
built the first transistor.

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And then his teachers
at the time--

00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:03.510 align:middle line:84%
Bardeen, Brattain, and--
used to know the other one--

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:05.830 align:middle line:90%
took the credit for it.

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:07.570 align:middle line:84%
He formed the
first semiconductor

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:09.407 align:middle line:90%
company, which I think was--

00:20:09.407 --> 00:20:11.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Off camera you had
said National Semiconductor.

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:14.350 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: National
Semiconductor.

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:16.260 align:middle line:90%
And then he built--

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.610 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know exactly
which order, but he

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:22.240 align:middle line:84%
built Hughes Semiconductor,
Rheem Semiconductor--

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.854 align:middle line:90%
R-H-E-E-M.

00:20:23.854 --> 00:20:25.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.250 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Several others.

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:31.120 align:middle line:84%
And he had two right
hand scientists

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:34.000 align:middle line:84%
that worked with him
through all of this.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.970 align:middle line:84%
As he got older, they broke
off and formed a company

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:42.250 align:middle line:84%
that you'll know, that got
very famous by developing--

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:46.330 align:middle line:84%
they'd been developing
a device to make

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:49.030 align:middle line:90%
what's called a dumb terminal.

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:52.570 align:middle line:84%
In the early days of computers,
you had key switches.

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:57.310 align:middle line:84%
You'd put 1100101
enter, and you'd

00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:58.570 align:middle line:90%
do that for quite a while.

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And then you'd get the computer
to realize it was a computer,

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:04.120 align:middle line:84%
and it would come up with
a basic operating system.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And then you could program
it with a dumb terminal,

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:09.040 align:middle line:84%
and control it with a
dumb terminal phone.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.500 align:middle line:84%
If you push an a, the terminal
shows an A on the screen.

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.990 align:middle line:84%
If you push B, it shows
a B on the screen.

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:17.110 align:middle line:84%
If you push return, it sends
the A and the B to the computer,

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:18.880 align:middle line:84%
and they disappear
from the screen.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And it'll send you
something back.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And up until the mid
'80s, that's how all--

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:29.390 align:middle line:84%
we called them IBM personal
computers-- would work.

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:31.160 align:middle line:84%
That you had a dumb
terminal, and then you

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.290 align:middle line:84%
had a computer that
would take that.

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:37.580 align:middle line:84%
So you programmed
in a language called

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:41.090 align:middle line:84%
DOS, which was Disk
Operating System,

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:43.220 align:middle line:84%
and it would take the
data, put it into a disk,

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:44.640 align:middle line:90%
bring it off a disk, process it.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:45.440 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.170 align:middle line:84%
I had some corporate jobs
in the early '90s where

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:50.690 align:middle line:84%
you had to use
these LAN terminals,

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:52.520 align:middle line:84%
and the LAN was
local access network.

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.470 align:middle line:84%
It was all central
computer brain,

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:56.810 align:middle line:84%
and your dumb terminal didn't
have any computer in it.

00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:57.260 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Right.

00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:58.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And they
were horribly slow.

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:00.558 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And they
were horribly large.

00:22:00.558 --> 00:22:01.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:05.270 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And-- so
there was this company

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:08.660 align:middle line:90%
that was formed, called Intel.

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.120 align:middle line:84%
By Ed Baldwin's two
right hand people.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:16.520 align:middle line:84%
And they were to
make a chip that

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:19.570 align:middle line:84%
would replace a lot of
the individual components.

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:21.040 align:middle line:84%
You looked in that
dumb terminal,

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.000 align:middle line:84%
there were 10 times
more chips in there

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.570 align:middle line:84%
than there are on a typical
desktop computer today.

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:29.504 align:middle line:84%
And all they were doing
was just arranging

00:22:29.504 --> 00:22:30.920 align:middle line:84%
what you were
putting in, and what

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:34.717 align:middle line:84%
was coming out in a logical
sequence, so you could read it.

00:22:34.717 --> 00:22:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So what did Ed
Baldwin actually teach you

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.030 align:middle line:84%
when you started
to study with him?

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:41.690 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well again, he
was like Land, who said,

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:43.110 align:middle line:90%
let's not talk about the camera.

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:45.090 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about sight.

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:47.990 align:middle line:84%
Ed Baldwin said, let's
talk about quantum physics.

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:52.680 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And his thing
was quantum physics.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And he had made a lot of changes
in it, and hadn't told anybody.

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And he told me, and
he made it right,

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:01.050 align:middle line:90%
and made it very appealing.

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:02.310 align:middle line:90%
Very--

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Why wouldn't
he want to tell anybody?

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:06.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, for
the same reason

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:08.270 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to tell
people things today.

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:10.290 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you say
something, somebody else out

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:12.600 align:middle line:84%
there is either
brighter than you are,

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:15.120 align:middle line:84%
or they got more money involved
with them than you have,

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.860 align:middle line:84%
and they will take
your idea, and they

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:19.040 align:middle line:84%
will patent it before you
can even think about it.

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.660 align:middle line:90%


00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:23.580 align:middle line:90%
And or the government will--

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:27.120 align:middle line:84%
the government reviews
every patent application,

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.800 align:middle line:90%
and gets first pick.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And they've been,
as best I can tell,

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:35.900 align:middle line:84%
very fair with things, in that
they will come back and make

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:36.950 align:middle line:90%
a bargain with you.

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And turn it back to you when
it's no longer something

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:44.090 align:middle line:90%
secret, and a number of things.

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:47.090 align:middle line:84%
But you'll be paid
for your work.

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And an appropriate
amount of money.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:53.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I want to know
what Ed Baldwin discovered

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:55.880 align:middle line:84%
about quantum mechanics
that's not conventional.

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:59.600 align:middle line:84%
What did he see
that was so unique?

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, he saw
a little different way

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:05.600 align:middle line:84%
of structuring it, which
expanded its capabilities

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:08.060 align:middle line:90%
dramatically.

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:11.390 align:middle line:84%
Anything you learn about is
learned about in some area

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:15.430 align:middle line:84%
that you know something about,
and you've noticed an anomaly.

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And he decided,
what's that anomaly?

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:22.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, there might have been 500
anomalies in quantum physics,

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:26.240 align:middle line:84%
and so a few things
that he was also very

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:29.150 align:middle line:90%
good in semiconductor theory--

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:33.740 align:middle line:84%
and so he looked at it as
a semiconductor theorist,

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:38.230 align:middle line:84%
as well as from a quantum
physics type of person.

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:40.502 align:middle line:84%
So he could say,
well, this over here--

00:24:40.502 --> 00:24:42.210 align:middle line:84%
he'd say this I'd
really like to look at,

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:47.530 align:middle line:84%
because I know it will allow
us to do things with energy.

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:50.530 align:middle line:84%
We can increase heat,
or decrease heat.

00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:51.790 align:middle line:90%
So we can cool things.

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Always in science you're trying
to heat or cool something.

00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And like in an automobile
you have radiators,

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:02.720 align:middle line:90%
and radiating structures.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:06.350 align:middle line:84%
A certain amount of oil capacity
to cool the engine by airflow

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:09.920 align:middle line:90%
past the oil waves, and such.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And so he'd
discovered some things

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:17.480 align:middle line:84%
about semiconductors
that were very strange.

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And like, for
example, hole theory,

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:24.430 align:middle line:84%
which is used
there, making a hole

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:31.100 align:middle line:84%
in the normal atomic matrices,
and the molecular matrices.

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And moving holes instead
of electrons or protons.

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:42.590 align:middle line:84%
Later on I came to realize that
electrons and protons were very

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:44.420 align:middle line:84%
good theoretical
things that allowed

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:47.380 align:middle line:84%
you to do a lot of--
a lot of good work,

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:49.684 align:middle line:84%
but they had very little
to do with reality.

00:25:49.684 --> 00:25:52.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, let me just add
this in, because I know you

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:54.440 align:middle line:84%
and I have talked
about this before--

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:56.810 align:middle line:84%
I've studied this whole
area a lot myself,

00:25:56.810 --> 00:26:00.380 align:middle line:84%
and I know that most
of what people take for

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:03.410 align:middle line:90%
granted as being--

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:05.810 align:middle line:84%
what's going on at
the quantum level--

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:08.480 align:middle line:84%
is based on things
like certain elements

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.940 align:middle line:84%
give off a particular
color spectrum,

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:13.790 align:middle line:84%
And then they make assumptions
based on these particular lines

00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:15.860 align:middle line:84%
of color, or the
so-called black body

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:17.870 align:middle line:90%
radiation that it gives off.

00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:22.160 align:middle line:84%
Or they will shoot a
subatomic particle,

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:25.880 align:middle line:84%
if you want to call it that,
into a chamber of very highly

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:29.450 align:middle line:84%
compressed gas or liquid, and
it will squiggle a certain way

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:32.390 align:middle line:84%
in the chamber, and then they
make all these very, very

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:36.050 align:middle line:84%
elaborate equations
based off of the spiral

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:38.220 align:middle line:90%
calculations of these paths.

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And yet nobody's ever really
seen anything down there.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.880 align:middle line:84%
Nobody ever actually
knows what's down there.

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:44.690 align:middle line:90%
Would you agree?

00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:45.523 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Exactly.

00:26:45.523 --> 00:26:47.289 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:26:47.289 --> 00:26:48.830 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: You
know, you have things

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:50.960 align:middle line:84%
that you do this, and
you'll get this result.

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.670 align:middle line:84%
You have things you
do a different thing,

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:54.830 align:middle line:84%
and you'll get a different
result. You have things,

00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:57.720 align:middle line:84%
you do this, and you
get a same result.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.390 align:middle line:84%
And you combine
all those together,

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:02.450 align:middle line:90%
and you make up a supposition.

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And then you test
the supposition,

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:07.910 align:middle line:84%
and it turns out to
work pretty well.

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:09.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What are some
of the cool things

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:12.530 align:middle line:84%
that his new interpretation
of quantum mechanics

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:13.750 align:middle line:90%
would allow you to do?

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Well, one of the
things was we took an old Xerox

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:17.390 align:middle line:90%
machine--

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:19.760 align:middle line:84%
this was in later
life, when I came back,

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:23.690 align:middle line:84%
and we became partners
on a couple things.

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:25.560 align:middle line:90%
You know, 30, 40 years later.

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:27.150 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:30.620 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: He was nearing
the end of his lifespan,

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:32.220 align:middle line:90%
but he had some very good ideas.

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:35.000 align:middle line:84%
We took a Xerox
machine, and we made

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.190 align:middle line:84%
a thing we could slit
mylar sheets in it,

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:42.950 align:middle line:84%
and print photo cells
at about $0.25 a watt.

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:50.160 align:middle line:84%
We made some special batteries,
or electronic storage devices.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.590 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'll call them batteries.

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:54.530 align:middle line:84%
They were something different,
but we'll call them batteries.

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:58.320 align:middle line:90%
But they stored electricity.

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:03.360 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were very,
very good as solar cells.

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And then we learned how to
make better, and better,

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:07.810 align:middle line:90%
and better solar cells.

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:10.910 align:middle line:84%
So now there are
cells that are--

00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:13.310 align:middle line:84%
lithium ion phosphate
cells that are

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:17.690 align:middle line:84%
as efficient at converting solar
energy into electric energy.

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:21.150 align:middle line:84%
Some of them up
25%, 26% efficient.

00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:23.690 align:middle line:84%
In production
there's always a 10,

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:26.360 align:middle line:84%
or 6, or 7 year break
between, you know,

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:29.150 align:middle line:84%
a physical thing that you
can show as a reality,

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:31.606 align:middle line:84%
and something that you
can use at home with.

00:28:31.606 --> 00:28:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So there were practical
applications, obviously?

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:35.980 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Very
practical applications.

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.429 align:middle line:84%
He passed away about
three or four years ago.

00:28:38.429 --> 00:28:40.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It's really
good to get this down,

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:41.720 align:middle line:90%
and we've got a lot more coming.

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.830 align:middle line:84%
So thank you, Pete,
for being here.

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:45.710 align:middle line:84%
