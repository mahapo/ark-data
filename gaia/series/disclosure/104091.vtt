00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:15.690 align:middle line:90%


00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.780 align:middle line:10%
I've had 35 years of
experience in doing research

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.480 align:middle line:10%
into the subject of
ESP, metaphysics,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.360 align:middle line:10%
paranormal realities,
alternate forms

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.390 align:middle line:10%
of matter and energy research.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.960 align:middle line:84%
This is a subject that has
come up over and over again

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.230 align:middle line:84%
and has become
increasingly apparent to us

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.850 align:middle line:84%
in the recent disclosures
of Edward Snowden.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.260 align:middle line:84%
What we are finding
is that reality

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.980 align:middle line:90%
is not as simple as we thought.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.040 align:middle line:10%
Reality is a story.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.540 align:middle line:10%
It is only a story that we
think is true because everyone

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.740 align:middle line:10%
is telling the story.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:01:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And yet, is it possible
that reality is only a story

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.790 align:middle line:90%
being sold by the power groups?

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.990 align:middle line:84%
A story that is sold
to us in particular

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.250 align:middle line:90%
to keep us under their control.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.660 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, reality is
the greatest story ever sold.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.570 align:middle line:84%
What we find out is
that reality is defined

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.561 align:middle line:84%
by the voice of the collective,
what everyone around us

00:01:24.561 --> 00:01:25.260 align:middle line:90%
is saying.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.600 align:middle line:84%
This includes our
parents, our teachers,

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.395 align:middle line:90%
our friends, and our coworkers.

00:01:30.395 --> 00:01:33.800 align:middle line:84%
The people we surround
ourselves with every day

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.320 align:middle line:84%
define for us the voice
of the collective.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.010 align:middle line:90%
And that becomes reality.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.560 align:middle line:84%
It's a story that
everyone passes around.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And we believe that it's
true because everyone

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.540 align:middle line:90%
else thinks that it's true.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes a
common knowledge.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.040 align:middle line:84%
But people are repeating
the common knowledge.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And in many cases, we
always use the word "they"

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.020 align:middle line:84%
without citing a
particular source.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.010 align:middle line:84%
Did you hear that they said
that if you take aspirin,

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.530 align:middle line:84%
you're less likely to
have a heart attack?

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.960 align:middle line:84%
Once you start
using the word they,

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.760 align:middle line:84%
there is the automatic
presumption of truth.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.620 align:middle line:84%
It is understood that they
are correct, that they

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.270 align:middle line:90%
have defined reality for us.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And then we assume that
we don't need to ask

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.880 align:middle line:90%
any additional questions.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.270 align:middle line:90%
So who are they?

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.970 align:middle line:90%
What is this concept?

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.650 align:middle line:10%
Why do we use this word with
such blind, childlike trust?

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.790 align:middle line:84%
It seems naive when
you think about it.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Most people are not used to
actually citing sources of all.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.800 align:middle line:84%
Most people use the
term they and just

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.120 align:middle line:84%
automatically assume that
it means that whatever

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.200 align:middle line:90%
they're saying is correct.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.731 align:middle line:84%
And everyone says,
oh, that's right.

00:02:54.731 --> 00:02:56.570 align:middle line:84%
They said it.
It must be right.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.530 align:middle line:84%
One of the basic forms
of they are governments.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.560 align:middle line:84%
It's very recent
that we are actually

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.100 align:middle line:84%
questioning our government
to the extent that we do now.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.970 align:middle line:84%
The Watergate
scandal really blew

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.296 align:middle line:90%
that whole thing wide open.

00:03:11.296 --> 00:03:12.320 align:middle line:10%
These actions--

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.440 align:middle line:10%
DAVID WILCOCK (VOICEOVER): But
governments for a long time

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.580 align:middle line:10%
were believed to be
trustworthy, loyal,

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.990 align:middle line:10%
and honorable protectors
of our society.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.920 align:middle line:10%
That has very much changed.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.410 align:middle line:84%
Institutions are another
form of the they.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.420 align:middle line:84%
Institutions can include
schools, universities,

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.350 align:middle line:84%
hospitals, medical
establishments, everything

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.900 align:middle line:84%
you can think of,
including churches

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.670 align:middle line:90%
and religious organizations.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.900 align:middle line:84%
Those groups also can claim
the power of the word day,

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.970 align:middle line:84%
so that when these
groups make a statement,

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.250 align:middle line:90%
we assume that it must be true.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.770 align:middle line:84%
TV ANNOUNCER (VOICEOVER): What
cigarette do you smoke, doctor?

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.660 align:middle line:90%
Why not change to Camels?

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.520 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WILCOCK (VOICEOVER):
Another simple and obvious

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.007 align:middle line:90%
form of they is public figures.

00:03:54.007 --> 00:03:55.540 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WILCOCK (VOICEOVER):
We trust the people

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.330 align:middle line:90%
that we see on television.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.650 align:middle line:10%
We trust the people
who we see every day,

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.540 align:middle line:10%
even if we've never
met them in person.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.240 align:middle line:84%
They're put out
there in front of us.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And we assume that the
reason why they're out there

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.310 align:middle line:84%
is that there was an honorable
system involved in bringing

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.500 align:middle line:84%
them to power that
has led to them

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.920 align:middle line:90%
becoming trustworthy figures.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.060 align:middle line:84%
This, of course, also
has crumbled noticeably.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.140 align:middle line:90%
Our institutions have collapsed.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And we are left
with a very, very

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.030 align:middle line:84%
different view of the
credibility of public figure

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.580 align:middle line:90%
at this time.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.020 align:middle line:84%
Television networks another
classic example of the they

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.850 align:middle line:84%
that was working so well
for us for such a long time.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.080 align:middle line:84%
We assumed that if it's
on TV, it must be true.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not on
TV, it can't be true.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.170 align:middle line:84%
That has fallen apart
too thanks to the power

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.020 align:middle line:84%
of the internet,
which is uncensored,

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.890 align:middle line:90%
unregulated communication.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.850 align:middle line:84%
But for a long time,
television networks defined

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.440 align:middle line:90%
the voice of the collective.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.670 align:middle line:90%
And they could define reality.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:06.160 align:middle line:84%
I really want to make it clear
that the story of real truth

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.740 align:middle line:84%
is much more profound, much
more interesting, much more

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.200 align:middle line:84%
powerful, and much more
exciting than the story

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.120 align:middle line:84%
that "they," the voice
of the collective,

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.660 align:middle line:90%
have been telling us is true.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.370 align:middle line:84%
We also see Hollywood movies
being a key structuring force

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.850 align:middle line:90%
in the voice of the collective.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.920 align:middle line:84%
Notice too that
there is a tendency

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.160 align:middle line:90%
towards cognitive dissonance.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.810 align:middle line:84%
That means two different
things that your mind

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.960 align:middle line:84%
is trying to hold as if both
of them were equally true.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And then in so trying to
reconcile those two things,

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.090 align:middle line:84%
neither one of them
seemed to be true.

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And the whole thing
gets phased out.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.380 align:middle line:84%
So the subject UFOs
is a classic example.

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.270 align:middle line:10%
Look at the number
of Hollywood movies

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.520 align:middle line:10%
that blatantly talk about
UFOs as if they were true

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.490 align:middle line:10%
and laugh at people
who think they must

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.690 align:middle line:10%
be swamp gas or lights
in the sky or weather

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.230 align:middle line:10%
balloon, cetera, et cetera.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.510 align:middle line:84%
Think about what's
happening here

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.730 align:middle line:84%
in the difference between
Hollywood movies, which have

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.900 align:middle line:84%
been talking about UFOs
almost since the beginning

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.890 align:middle line:84%
with the original Kenneth
Arnold sightings and the Roswell

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:21.370 align:middle line:84%
crash, and what has happened
with all the other forms

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:22.670 align:middle line:90%
of the authorities.

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.910 align:middle line:84%
Government, institutions, public
figures, television networks,

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.510 align:middle line:84%
all of these
collective voices have

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:34.970 align:middle line:84%
consistently denied the reality
of extraterrestrial life.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you can consider
what has happened recently

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.430 align:middle line:84%
with Edward Snowden,
that was knowledge

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.710 align:middle line:90%
that we didn't have before.

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.800 align:middle line:84%
But the surveillance very
much was happening before.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.950 align:middle line:84%
As a result, just because
"they" didn't tell you

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.440 align:middle line:84%
that your phone was
being tapped didn't

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.680 align:middle line:90%
mean that it was being tapped.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.860 align:middle line:90%
It was being tapped.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:57.872 align:middle line:90%
We know this.

00:06:57.872 --> 00:07:00.150 align:middle line:84%
This is something that's
gone on for a long time.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.770 align:middle line:90%


00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Newspapers, magazines,
and print media

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:10.010 align:middle line:84%
is the last big category of
the voice of the collective,

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:11.930 align:middle line:90%
the voice of the they.

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And remember now, this was
a tightly regulated industry

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:16.770 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:21.770 align:middle line:10%
Ben Bagdikian reported that
there were in fact only six

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:26.110 align:middle line:10%
corporations running
all of the media

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:29.510 align:middle line:10%
that was being consumed by most
people in the Western world.

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:34.530 align:middle line:84%
That includes television shows,
movies, newspapers, magazines,

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:36.190 align:middle line:90%
everything you can think of.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And now that number has
actually been reduced to five.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.750 align:middle line:84%
So it appears when
you watch television

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.620 align:middle line:84%
that there are all
these different choices,

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.340 align:middle line:90%
and you can channel surf.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.770 align:middle line:10%
But in fact, there's only a very
small number of corporations

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:52.200 align:middle line:10%
that have a series of
media conglomerates

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.660 align:middle line:10%
that have different umbrellas
and different network names.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:58.730 align:middle line:10%
But those network names
do not mean they are owned

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:00.580 align:middle line:10%
by different companies at all.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:05.970 align:middle line:84%
Then there is a possibility for
centralized control over all

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:09.900 align:middle line:84%
of these institutions, all
of these media outlets,

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:13.350 align:middle line:84%
and in fact, governments
and institutions as well.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:16.480 align:middle line:84%
This is where the story
gets very interesting.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.740 align:middle line:84%
So we really need to
start asking ourselves

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.770 align:middle line:90%
some tough questions here.

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that reality
is so different than what we

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:29.790 align:middle line:90%
think it has been up until now?

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:33.039 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
we have been sold

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:39.080 align:middle line:84%
a story, that we have been to
told lies for a very long time?

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:44.640 align:middle line:84%
The next question we need to
ask ourselves is simply what if.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.030 align:middle line:84%
What if we are not
alone in this universe?

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:52.570 align:middle line:84%
What if reality is much more
interesting and much more

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:56.610 align:middle line:84%
comprehensive than we ever could
have possibly thought before?

00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:01.060 align:middle line:84%
Those questions do not need to
come to us in a fearful way.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:05.620 align:middle line:84%
Those questions can come to
us in a natural, organic form,

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.400 align:middle line:90%
so that we can handle the truth.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.590 align:middle line:90%
You can't handle the truth.

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.880 align:middle line:84%
You can handle the truth
and the secret to handling

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.650 align:middle line:84%
the truth is to understand
that we live in a benevolent

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:18.840 align:middle line:90%
universe.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.750 align:middle line:84%
That there are
positive forces looking

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:22.510 align:middle line:90%
out for our greater good.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And that none of this stuff
that I'm going to be telling you

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:25.790 align:middle line:90%
is scary.

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:30.460 align:middle line:84%
In fact, by releasing the truth
and releasing this information,

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:34.220 align:middle line:84%
we are creating a better
world for ourselves

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:35.680 align:middle line:90%
and for our children.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.260 align:middle line:90%
And that is really the key.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.800 align:middle line:90%
That is why I'm doing this.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing this to
free us from fear

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:44.920 align:middle line:84%
and to transform the
planet, because there

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.500 align:middle line:84%
is a great deal
of negativity that

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.410 align:middle line:90%
is happening in this world.

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And in many ways, we live
in a suicidal culture.

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.130 align:middle line:84%
We're using up
natural resources.

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:57.150 align:middle line:90%
We're burning down the planet.

00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And yet, these control groups
that have maintained power

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.550 align:middle line:84%
for so long consistently
refused to listen

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:04.480 align:middle line:90%
to what the people want.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.080 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WILCOCK (VOICEOVER):
These people in power

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.460 align:middle line:90%
are lying and lying and lying.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.725 align:middle line:84%
People got to know whether or
not their president's a crook.

00:10:11.725 --> 00:10:13.100 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm not a crook.

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:14.910 align:middle line:10%
I did not send that tweet.

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:16.060 align:middle line:10%
My system was hacked.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:17.330 align:middle line:90%
I was pranked.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:22.480 align:middle line:84%
I did not have sexual
relations with that woman.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.620 align:middle line:90%
Read my lips.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:28.240 align:middle line:90%
No new taxes.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And lying is just a standard
practice of doing business.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.410 align:middle line:90%
It's not seen is any big deal.

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:37.060 align:middle line:84%
It's just part of the
story that they tell.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And when they get
caught in a lie,

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.070 align:middle line:84%
they admit it, but only
after they've been caught.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:44.990 align:middle line:84%
So you don't need to be
afraid of what is going on.

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:46.660 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to be
afraid of the fact

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.230 align:middle line:90%
that you've been lied to.

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:51.070 align:middle line:84%
But again, they are not
going to tell you the truth

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:52.690 align:middle line:90%
anytime soon.

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And part of the reason
why is that they are using

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:59.160 align:middle line:90%
fear as their business model.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.470 align:middle line:84%
Now that might be a
little bit shocking.

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.360 align:middle line:84%
But actually, once
you think about it,

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.240 align:middle line:90%
it's very easy to understand.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm Bret Baier in Washington.

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:08.867 align:middle line:90%
And this is a Fox News Alert.

00:11:08.867 --> 00:11:10.600 align:middle line:10%
DAVID WILCOCK (VOICEOVER):
Fear is a business model.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:16.630 align:middle line:10%
Because in the case of the
media, if it bleeds, it leads.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:18.880 align:middle line:84%
They already know what
they're looking for.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.340 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for
sensational headlines.

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:24.280 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for
people to pay attention.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.360 align:middle line:84%
How do you get people
to pay attention?

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.800 align:middle line:84%
You reach out to
their primal urges.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.330 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WILCOCK
(VOICEOVER): Sex and death

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:34.270 align:middle line:84%
are the two main things that
attract people's attention.

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:38.450 align:middle line:84%
There's a primal need
that we have to see sex

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:39.330 align:middle line:90%
and to see death.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.090 align:middle line:84%
We are attracted to these
things because it gets

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:44.940 align:middle line:90%
our nervous system stimulated.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.560 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the reason
why I coined the term

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:51.320 align:middle line:84%
fear porn, which is now
widely used on the internet,

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.550 align:middle line:84%
is because when you're exposed
to something that causes fear,

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:57.220 align:middle line:84%
it stimulates your whole
body in a very similar

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.560 align:middle line:90%
manner as sexual arousal.

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.370 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the same centers
of the brain are triggered.

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:04.430 align:middle line:90%
Pleasure centers are kicked off.

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:07.900 align:middle line:84%
You also get this
rush of adrenaline.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I was
talking to Sperry Andrews.

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:14.530 align:middle line:10%
DAVID WILCOCK (VOICEOVER):
And he worked in Bosnia.

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:18.770 align:middle line:10%
And there were men who were
gunners, who were saying

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:21.890 align:middle line:10%
that killing people was such
a big high for them, shooting

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:23.886 align:middle line:10%
people with these
mounted machine guns that

00:12:23.886 --> 00:12:29.235 align:middle line:10%
have a huge blast, they actually
enjoyed killing more than sex.

00:12:29.235 --> 00:12:33.780 align:middle line:84%
So Sperry Anders was saying,
how do we change the story?

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.600 align:middle line:84%
How do we get
people to appreciate

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:40.270 align:middle line:84%
the positive as much as they
now appreciate the negative?

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:43.000 align:middle line:84%
I can't just blame the
authorities for this.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.480 align:middle line:84%
The reason why this fear as a
business model works so well

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:51.140 align:middle line:84%
is that all of us to varying
degrees are in fear and pain

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:52.480 align:middle line:90%
at all times.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.630 align:middle line:84%
So when we see fear
outside of ourselves,

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:58.710 align:middle line:84%
it makes us feel more
relaxed because now we have

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:00.890 align:middle line:90%
something to put our fear onto.

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:04.500 align:middle line:84%
We have something to blame
for why we feel this way.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.980 align:middle line:84%
The biggest industry on Earth
that is generating profit

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:08.894 align:middle line:90%
is defense spending.

00:13:08.894 --> 00:13:10.460 align:middle line:10%
DAVID WILCOCK (VOICEOVER):
Even conservatively,

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:13.070 align:middle line:10%
when you look at the actual
United States defense budget,

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:16.460 align:middle line:10%
it's over $700 billion.

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.772 align:middle line:90%
That's billion with a "b."

00:13:18.772 --> 00:13:23.400 align:middle line:84%
So you to understand that
the business model requires

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.930 align:middle line:90%
that defense spending continue.

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:29.020 align:middle line:84%
It requires that we
never be free from fear,

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:33.970 align:middle line:84%
because anything that reduces
fear would also reduce profit.

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:37.730 align:middle line:84%
It's a very cynical way of
thinking compared to someone

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:40.690 align:middle line:90%
who runs an ice cream shop.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:43.090 align:middle line:84%
All he's trying to
do is sell ice cream.

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Not so when you're in
the defense industry.

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:48.650 align:middle line:84%
In that case, your
product is fear.

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:49.875 align:middle line:90%
Your product is war.

00:13:49.875 --> 00:13:53.744 align:middle line:90%


00:13:53.744 --> 00:13:55.410 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WILCOCK (VOICEOVER):
In order to have a war,

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.890 align:middle line:84%
you have to have people
afraid of each other

00:13:57.890 --> 00:13:59.740 align:middle line:84%
so they want to
fight each other.

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And then they will hand over
their power and their authority

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.900 align:middle line:90%
to the government.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.770 align:middle line:84%
So the government is then
responsible for giving them

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:11.830 align:middle line:84%
the protection that they
feel they need to free

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:13.960 align:middle line:90%
them from that sense of fear.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:18.540 align:middle line:84%
So defense spending involves
such a high profit margin,

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.500 align:middle line:84%
that there is a great
industry involved

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.150 align:middle line:90%
in keeping that fear going.

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Why wouldn't that industry
want to control the media?

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:28.620 align:middle line:90%
Think about that.

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:32.020 align:middle line:84%
Why wouldn't they
want to have the reins

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:34.180 align:middle line:90%
of power over the media?

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:38.100 align:middle line:84%
Now here's the thing,
what you may not realize

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:42.040 align:middle line:84%
is that all of these companies
are in bed with each other.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:46.450 align:middle line:84%
Defense companies, financial
industries, oil companies,

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:49.590 align:middle line:84%
pharmaceutical companies,
and media, they all share

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:51.650 align:middle line:84%
members of the
board of directors.

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:53.820 align:middle line:84%
They all are sharing
controlling interests

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.430 align:middle line:90%
in each other's companies.

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:58.500 align:middle line:84%
This was discovered
by a study that

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:02.060 align:middle line:84%
was done by the Swiss Federal
Institute of Technology

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.760 align:middle line:90%
led by Dr. James Glattfelder.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:08.050 align:middle line:84%
They went through a
list of over 40,000

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:10.530 align:middle line:84%
transnational
corporations in one

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:13.330 align:middle line:84%
of the largest databases
that's ever been put

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.430 align:middle line:90%
together of these corporations.

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:18.180 align:middle line:84%
This is Orbis 2007
is what they used.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.400 align:middle line:84%
So what did we
find after computing

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.320 align:middle line:90%
all this network control?

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:27.250 align:middle line:10%
Well, it turns out that
the 737 top shareholders

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:29.220 align:middle line:10%
have the potential
to collectively

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.550 align:middle line:10%
control 80% of the TNCs value.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:36.180 align:middle line:84%
They did a meta-analysis using
supercomputer number crunching.

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And what they found
ultimately once you boil

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:43.430 align:middle line:84%
it all down is that there
are only 147 corporations

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:44.910 align:middle line:90%
controlling the world.

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:50.120 align:middle line:84%
And yet those 147 corporations
own a majority stake

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:53.120 align:middle line:84%
in all the industries of
the world to such an extent

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:57.350 align:middle line:84%
that fully 80% of the money
that is being made in the world

00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:00.570 align:middle line:84%
is flowing into these
147 corporations

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:02.020 align:middle line:90%
and their subsidiaries.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And the top 50 of
these 147 corporations

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:07.920 align:middle line:84%
are financial industries
for the most part.

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.137 align:middle line:90%
2/3 of them are.

00:16:09.137 --> 00:16:10.870 align:middle line:84%
DAVID WILCOCK (VOICEOVER):
And at the very, very top

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:13.360 align:middle line:84%
of the list, we have
all the big banks

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.840 align:middle line:90%
that you are familiar with.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:18.060 align:middle line:84%
So there is a central
power group that

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.430 align:middle line:90%
is manipulating the strings.

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And the NSA disclosures
are only one small part

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.110 align:middle line:90%
of what has been going on.

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:29.540 align:middle line:84%
Another very important
point to remember here

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:31.960 align:middle line:84%
is that if there is
one group in charge,

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:35.640 align:middle line:84%
if there is actually one
management structure at the top

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.140 align:middle line:84%
of the pyramid,
so to speak, then

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:39.500 align:middle line:84%
bear in mind, that
the existing power

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:44.380 align:middle line:84%
groups do not want any challenge
to their business model.

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:46.250 align:middle line:84%
They want to keep
on doing business.

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:48.190 align:middle line:84%
They want to keep
everything stable.

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And that means, as I've just
told you with the Swiss Federal

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Institute of
Technology study, they

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:57.420 align:middle line:84%
want to continue controlling
80% of the income

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:59.500 align:middle line:84%
that there is to be
generated from the world.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:02.710 align:middle line:90%
So they become our gods.

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:06.290 align:middle line:84%
That is another very
important point that we

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:08.270 align:middle line:90%
should never lose track of.

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:10.660 align:middle line:84%
When they control
the media, they

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.869 align:middle line:84%
control reality,
because they are

00:17:12.869 --> 00:17:15.430 align:middle line:90%
controlling what we believe.

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:19.819 align:middle line:84%
By controlling belief, they are
literally manipulating the laws

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:22.589 align:middle line:90%
of the universe in their favor.

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:26.710 align:middle line:84%
Reality to a certain degree
is a function of the observer.

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:29.430 align:middle line:84%
This has been proven on
the quantum physics level.

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:33.140 align:middle line:84%
But it also holds true
on the macroscopic level,

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.870 align:middle line:90%
much more than we realize.

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:39.710 align:middle line:84%
In the absence of
any god, the leaders

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:42.780 align:middle line:90%
become a replacement for God.

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:44.980 align:middle line:84%
That's another very
important point.

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:49.430 align:middle line:84%
This power group may have
succinctly trimmed off

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:52.310 align:middle line:84%
all the pieces of
the story that lead

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:54.460 align:middle line:90%
to the idea of a supreme being.

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:57.430 align:middle line:84%
They haven't stopped religions
from being practiced.

00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:02.250 align:middle line:84%
But there is a very derogatory
view of religions in television

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:03.850 align:middle line:90%
shows and in movies.

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the
scientific community,

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:09.200 align:middle line:84%
whether through deliberate
intent or willful ignorance,

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:14.310 align:middle line:84%
has felt as if spirituality as
a whole is a complete throwaway.

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:15.430 align:middle line:90%
It's laughable.

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:17.000 align:middle line:90%
And it's ridiculous.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe
that's true at all.

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:22.900 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of the overarching
principles of this show

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.400 align:middle line:84%
is that we are going
through a massive quantum

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.350 align:middle line:90%
shift in human evolution.

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And that there is scientific
proof for that that

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:32.990 align:middle line:84%
is being very carefully
and assiduously

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:36.310 align:middle line:90%
suppressed by this power group.

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:39.520 align:middle line:84%
If you keep people
in fear, you also

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.730 align:middle line:90%
keep them obedient and servile.

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:47.140 align:middle line:84%
This is another very
interesting and relevant point.

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:50.500 align:middle line:84%
Fear is useful for
the power group,

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:54.720 align:middle line:84%
because fear allows them
to maintain control.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.640 align:middle line:90%
No one wants to rise up.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.270 align:middle line:90%
No one wants to challenge them.

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And of course, with
NSA surveillance,

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:04.400 align:middle line:84%
they can listen in on people's
conversations, on their emails,

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:07.230 align:middle line:84%
on all the different forms
of written and spoken

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:11.480 align:middle line:84%
communication that are going
on and find out who is rippling

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.770 align:middle line:90%
things, who is causing trouble.

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:16.250 align:middle line:84%
But now, thanks to
be internet, they

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:18.960 align:middle line:84%
have not been able to
maintain control anymore.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.080 align:middle line:10%
So many people are
talking about this stuff,

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.510 align:middle line:10%
that they simply can't
afford to harass them,

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:27.860 align:middle line:10%
to intimidate
them, even to stage

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:30.420 align:middle line:10%
fake suicide assassinations.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:31.890 align:middle line:84%
That's not going
to happen anymore.

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:34.040 align:middle line:84%
There's too many people
who know the truth.

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:37.290 align:middle line:84%
So the Cabal, this insider
group I've been speaking of,

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:38.910 align:middle line:90%
they're scared.

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:41.050 align:middle line:84%
They are not the
gods of our society.

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:42.550 align:middle line:90%
We are taking the power back.

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:44.290 align:middle line:90%
We are reclaiming our freedom.

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:46.380 align:middle line:90%
And we demand of the truth.

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:48.470 align:middle line:84%
I want you to demand
the truth with me.

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to do
that by supporting

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.140 align:middle line:90%
and watching this program.

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.330 align:middle line:90%
Some secrets may be valuable.

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:58.610 align:middle line:84%
But beyond a certain point, when
very, very substantial aspects

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:02.770 align:middle line:84%
of our reality and our universe
are being kept hidden from us,

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:04.160 align:middle line:90%
that is a problem.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.620 align:middle line:90%
That is not a good thing.

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:08.000 align:middle line:84%
That should not be seen
as a beneficial thing

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.730 align:middle line:90%
for national security.

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:11.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
wait around anymore.

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:15.030 align:middle line:10%
I don't want to be standing
here with my hands in my pants,

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:16.920 align:middle line:10%
whistling, and
hoping that someday

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.760 align:middle line:10%
the government is going
to tell us the truth

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.420 align:middle line:10%
about what's really going on.

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:22.260 align:middle line:90%
We need the truth now.

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:23.620 align:middle line:90%
Publicity is protection.

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:26.020 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the things
I want to say right now.

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And having someone on the show
is actually safer for them

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:32.370 align:middle line:84%
than if they remain
hidden and quiet.

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Once you've decided that
you want to tell the truth,

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:36.790 align:middle line:84%
once you've decided
that you want

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:40.550 align:middle line:84%
to get the truth out there,
you need to come forward.

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:42.840 align:middle line:84%
You have an opportunity
with this show

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.720 align:middle line:84%
to get your voice out,
to tell us the truth,

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:48.470 align:middle line:84%
and to give us the
knowledge that we need.

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:49.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm David Wilcock.

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And as always, I thank
you for watching.
