00:00:15.792 --> 00:00:17.250 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID WILCOCK:
We've been talking

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.850 align:middle line:10%
about the incredible arc
of information regarding

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.070 align:middle line:10%
ancient civilizations.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.490 align:middle line:10%
And although this
may seem interesting,

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.070 align:middle line:10%
there is a linkage
point, I believe,

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.890 align:middle line:10%
between ancient
civilizations and what's

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.180 align:middle line:10%
going on right now in today's
world with the so-called

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.900 align:middle line:10%
"Illuminati."

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, some people don't
like the use of that word.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.140 align:middle line:10%
But the simple fact is that
we can create a through

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.230 align:middle line:10%
line of data showing that
there were great secrets kept

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.410 align:middle line:10%
in the mystery school teachings
that then were held very highly

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.660 align:middle line:10%
secretive.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And only through initiation
were you able to gain access

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.170 align:middle line:90%
to these secrets.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.775 align:middle line:84%
Now, these secrets, of course,
include the acquisition

00:01:03.775 --> 00:01:05.440 align:middle line:90%
of power.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not just talking
about spiritual power.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
great worldly power.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.120 align:middle line:84%
So what if a group
of people believed

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.010 align:middle line:84%
that acquiring this
power showed that they

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.940 align:middle line:90%
were essentially gods on Earth?

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, the guy I'm going
to start interviewing

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.290 align:middle line:84%
in this and a few other
episodes is none other

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.240 align:middle line:90%
than G. Edward Griffin.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.160 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't get into all that
ancient civilization stuff.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.190 align:middle line:84%
But I want to bring you
right up-to-date by showing

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.190 align:middle line:84%
you what's going on
in the here and now.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.360 align:middle line:84%
That's where G.
Edward Griffin shines.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And specifically, his book,
The Creature from Jekyll Island

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.050 align:middle line:84%
is considered the defining
standard of scholarship

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.260 align:middle line:84%
on the subject of
the Federal Reserve.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.050 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Federal
Reserve was audited,

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.210 align:middle line:84%
and it was
Representative Ron Paul

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.360 align:middle line:84%
who had a lot to do with
that going through Congress.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And the result of that
audit revealed that

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.970 align:middle line:84%
around the time of the 2008
financial collapse and bailout,

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.090 align:middle line:84%
that the actual figure
of how much money was

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.210 align:middle line:84%
paid by the Federal Reserve
to its own member banks

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.200 align:middle line:90%
was $26 trillion.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.790 align:middle line:84%
That's a number that's
staggering beyond belief,

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.920 align:middle line:84%
because the entire
Gross Domestic Product

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.280 align:middle line:84%
of the entire world is only
a little over $60 trillion.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.470 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost half
of all the value

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.860 align:middle line:84%
of real money in the world
that was paid to these "too big

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.620 align:middle line:90%
to fail" banks.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we get into this
first round of interviews

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.610 align:middle line:84%
with G. Edward Griffin,
we're not actually

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.870 align:middle line:84%
talking about the
Federal Reserve as much.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.330 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about his first
book called The Fearful Master.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.660 align:middle line:84%
It was an investigation
of the United Nations

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.190 align:middle line:84%
and incredibly treasonous things
that, as other insiders told

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.090 align:middle line:84%
me, ultimately led
our own US military

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.200 align:middle line:84%
to realize that the United
Nations was selling them out,

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.670 align:middle line:90%
and we were being betrayed.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And we were losing
soldiers in the Korean War,

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.350 align:middle line:84%
because the United Nations was
revealing our true positions.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.880 align:middle line:84%
So what we're also going
to get into in this episode

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.210 align:middle line:90%
is the cancer cure.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, what do you mean
a cure for cancer?

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.160 align:middle line:84%
What if there's been cures
for cancer all along?

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's one of the
things that G. Edward Griffin

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.690 align:middle line:90%
wrote about.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And we get into
this whole concept

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.379 align:middle line:84%
of the pharmaceutical
cartel and the idea

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.420 align:middle line:84%
that there is an incredible
amount of money to be

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.930 align:middle line:90%
made from prescription drugs.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.320 align:middle line:84%
So these are the
precursor arguments

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.350 align:middle line:84%
that we need to build our way
up to discussing the Federal

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.460 align:middle line:84%
Reserve that we're going to
get into in later episodes.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.130 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to
check this out now,

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.110 align:middle line:84%
because G. Edward
Griffin is the name

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.550 align:middle line:84%
that I used to see
on the internet

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.750 align:middle line:84%
when I got into all
this in the 1990s.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.440 align:middle line:84%
Everybody quoted Creature
from Jekyll Island.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.760 align:middle line:84%
His book is loaded
with documentation,

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.700 align:middle line:90%
loaded with references.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.300 align:middle line:84%
I consider him to be the gold
standard by which all Federal

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.190 align:middle line:90%
Reserve scholars are judged.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.850 align:middle line:90%
So let's check it out.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.510 align:middle line:84%
Your first book from
1964, The Fearful Master,

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.630 align:middle line:84%
specifically went in and
exposed very dark stuff going on

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.760 align:middle line:90%
with the United Nations.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.470 align:middle line:84%
Most people say, well,
the United Nations

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.660 align:middle line:90%
is a good organization.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.170 align:middle line:90%
It's promoting world peace.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.370 align:middle line:84%
Your viewpoint was very
different than that.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.040 align:middle line:84%
So somewhere along the way,
the romantic fascination

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.220 align:middle line:84%
with the mainstream view and the
way that most people see things

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.000 align:middle line:90%
must have broken for you.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.650 align:middle line:84%
There must have been
some decisive point when

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.460 align:middle line:84%
you realize that things
aren't working out

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.160 align:middle line:90%
the way they should.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.880 align:middle line:84%
So how do we start out in
discussing the United Nations,

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.760 align:middle line:84%
the first book that you wrote,
and what led you to want

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.240 align:middle line:90%
to investigate this subject?

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.180 align:middle line:90%
How did you find out about this?

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>>G. EDWARD GRIFFIN: I
began to become aware

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:01.370 align:middle line:84%
of other things that were
contrary to my prior education.

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.200 align:middle line:90%
Let's call it that.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.840 align:middle line:84%
I was going to call
it indoctrination,

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.745 align:middle line:84%
and maybe that is a better word,
but nevertheless, my experience

00:05:06.745 --> 00:05:08.440 align:middle line:90%
and my exposure.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And I ran into the topic
of the United Nations.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And I heard this
fellow, Robert Welch,

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.101 align:middle line:84%
and he was the founder of
the John Birch Society.

00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And I saw a film of
him, a 16 millimeter

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.660 align:middle line:84%
film in which he was ranting
on about, this is no good.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's terrible, and
we've got a problem here.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And none of these things
rang a bell with me.

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.550 align:middle line:84%
I thought this guy
is off his rocker.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And when it came to
the United Nations

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.595 align:middle line:84%
and said negative
things about that,

00:05:37.595 --> 00:05:39.754 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well,
this is a bad man.

00:05:39.754 --> 00:05:41.420 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't know what
he's talking about.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.550 align:middle line:84%
Because I went to
school, and I learned

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.540 align:middle line:84%
that the United Nations was
our last best hope for peace,

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:47.209 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:48.750 align:middle line:84%
So how could you
dare criticize this?

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they feed
little children,

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.130 align:middle line:84%
and they prevent yaws
and other dread diseases.

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And they're
humanitarians, right?

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.091 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: The
airport in Katanga

00:05:58.091 --> 00:06:01.170 align:middle line:84%
remains under heavy
UN guard as war rages

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.350 align:middle line:90%
in and around Elizabethville.

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.310 align:middle line:84%
The newest conflict
in the Congo began

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.340 align:middle line:84%
after the Security Council
adopted a resolution calling

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.250 align:middle line:84%
for the use of
force, if necessary,

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.820 align:middle line:84%
to oust mercenaries from
the secessionist province.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.800 align:middle line:84%
It is in this war-torn area
that the United Nations

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.365 align:middle line:84%
faces a grave challenge
to its effectiveness.

00:06:18.365 --> 00:06:21.410 align:middle line:84%
The United States is giving
both moral and material backing

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:26.890 align:middle line:84%
to the effort to ensure the
Congo a peaceful future.

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: So anyway,
but he got to me.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And I remember-- I think it
was the next day-- coming back

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.200 align:middle line:90%
to the insurance office.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.105 align:middle line:84%
I always pass by the main
library for Los Angeles.

00:06:40.105 --> 00:06:42.030 align:middle line:90%
I never went in there before.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.502 align:middle line:84%
But this day, I said,
I'm going to go in there

00:06:44.502 --> 00:06:45.876 align:middle line:84%
and see what I
can find on the UN

00:06:45.876 --> 00:06:48.610 align:middle line:84%
and check this guy out
and see if he's right.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.960 align:middle line:84%
So, to make a long story
short, I did go in.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.030 align:middle line:84%
I went to the international
affairs part of the library,

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.850 align:middle line:84%
and I found five or
six books on the UN.

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And blow me down,
they all confirmed

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.190 align:middle line:90%
what this man, Welch, had said.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.720 align:middle line:84%
But not directly, because
they were all written

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.600 align:middle line:90%
from a favorable point of view.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.672 align:middle line:84%
They were written by people who
were either employed by the UN

00:07:12.672 --> 00:07:14.130 align:middle line:84%
or from the State
Department, which

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:17.550 align:middle line:84%
created the UN, or some
supporter of the UN.

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:21.140 align:middle line:84%
But once you had the
information that I

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.690 align:middle line:84%
heard from this film
as a possible template

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:28.560 align:middle line:84%
to hold up to evaluate what was
being written in these books,

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.930 align:middle line:84%
I could see how that's
just another way

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:32.920 align:middle line:90%
of saying the same thing.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.750 align:middle line:90%
And it was really confirmed.

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.002 align:middle line:90%
Well, that really got to me.

00:07:36.002 --> 00:07:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm really
kind of ticked off

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:41.730 align:middle line:84%
about this, because why didn't
people tell me about this?

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:46.520 align:middle line:84%
So that's when I discovered
that I have kind of a crusader

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.980 align:middle line:90%
spirit, instinct, I guess.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.190 align:middle line:84%
I always want to
defend the underdog.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of
people are like that.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think young people,
especially, are like that.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.630 align:middle line:84%
But as they get older,
they kind of get over it.

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's not the
way the real world runs.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And so, anyway, I never
got over it, I guess.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:05.320 align:middle line:84%
Because that's when
it first hit me that

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:09.750 align:middle line:84%
I really had to do something
about this terrible myth

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:10.960 align:middle line:90%
about the United Nations.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.930 align:middle line:84%
I had to let people know
what I had just learned.

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:17.674 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: OK, so that's the
smoke, but where is the fire?

00:08:17.674 --> 00:08:19.090 align:middle line:84%
What I really want
to know here is

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:22.800 align:middle line:84%
what was the knife in your
heart, that decisive moment

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.540 align:middle line:84%
that just made you see the
United Nations for what

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.710 align:middle line:90%
you came to see it as being?

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:30.960 align:middle line:90%
What was that moment for you?

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: We were told by
newspaper accounts and news

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:38.690 align:middle line:84%
accounts on television
and radio that the UN was

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:43.710 align:middle line:84%
in there to restore peace,
and to put down rebellion,

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:47.510 align:middle line:84%
and to put down chaos, and
to restore law and order,

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:52.240 align:middle line:84%
to save all these poor people
who were losing their property,

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.340 align:middle line:84%
losing their lives, and having
to flee in terror to get out

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.680 align:middle line:90%
of the Congo.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And when I actually got to
the firsthand accounts of what

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:04.970 align:middle line:84%
was happening, written
by people who were there,

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:08.040 align:middle line:84%
and some of them, interestingly
enough, written by United

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.800 align:middle line:84%
Nations people who
were running the show,

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.850 align:middle line:84%
boasting about
what they're doing,

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:16.780 align:middle line:84%
I realized that
they were there not

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:23.160 align:middle line:84%
to restore peace and tranquility
to the overall Congo.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.880 align:middle line:84%
Because there was one
province in the Congo

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.080 align:middle line:84%
called Katanga which already
had peace and tranquility.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.200 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones that said
no, we're seceding from chaos.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.570 align:middle line:84%
That was the phrase
that Moise Tshombe used.

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.537 align:middle line:84%
He said, "we are
seceding from chaos."

00:09:39.537 --> 00:09:41.995 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: Tshombe has declared
that to keep Katanga free,

00:09:41.995 --> 00:09:45.720 align:middle line:84%
his people have poisoned arrows
and spears ready to make up

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.820 align:middle line:90%
for shortage of arms.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: And so he declared
independence of his province

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.300 align:middle line:90%
from the rest of the Congo.

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.200 align:middle line:84%
The Congo was seething in
violence and destruction.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.580 align:middle line:84%
But Katanga was a little island
of tranquility and prosperity.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.930 align:middle line:90%
So where did the UN go?

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:04.540 align:middle line:90%
To Katanga.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:08.600 align:middle line:84%
They attacked Katanga
militarily to bring it back

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.020 align:middle line:84%
under the control of
the larger Congo, which

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.470 align:middle line:90%
was dominated by Communists.

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And when I realized
the reality of what

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:19.680 align:middle line:84%
was happening and compared
that to the myth that

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.620 align:middle line:84%
was perpetuated through
our media, I was outraged.

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.240 align:middle line:84%
And that was the knife that
you refer to in my heart.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And so, from that point
forward, I was through.

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:28.930 align:middle line:90%
I was sunk.

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:30.850 align:middle line:84%
I had to do
something about this.

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:34.085 align:middle line:84%
And one discovery led to
another and then to another.

00:10:34.085 --> 00:10:37.920 align:middle line:84%
It's like once you realize
that maybe not everything is

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.700 align:middle line:84%
hunky-dory and the way you've
been taught to believe.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:45.340 align:middle line:84%
Once you have the ability
to question these things,

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:47.080 align:middle line:84%
it's amazing how
many other things

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:51.400 align:middle line:84%
you see as being in violation
of truth and justice.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.350 align:middle line:84%
So that was how it
all began, and it's

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:56.250 align:middle line:90%
been getting worse ever since.

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Let's talk a
little about Nazi Germany

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:03.440 align:middle line:84%
and, specifically, the largest
industrial conglomerate

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.820 align:middle line:84%
that you say in your
book has ever existed

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.500 align:middle line:90%
on Earth, known as IG Farben.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:14.960 align:middle line:84%
You make some very surprising
connections between IG Farben

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:19.330 align:middle line:84%
and what now is the modern-day
pharmaceutical industry.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.919 align:middle line:84%
So I'm curious about how
this all fits together.

00:11:21.919 --> 00:11:23.460 align:middle line:84%
Could you please
tell us a little bit

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:27.850 align:middle line:84%
about Nazi Germany, IG Farben,
the industrial conglomerate,

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:29.560 align:middle line:90%
and pharmaceuticals?

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, isn't
that an interesting topic?

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.840 align:middle line:84%
And I have to give you a
little back story on that too.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.790 align:middle line:84%
I hope you have enough
chip in the camera

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:39.050 align:middle line:90%
to record all of this.

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it'll wind up on the
cutting room floor, I hope.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:45.480 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, back stories
to me are very important,

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.480 align:middle line:84%
because when I
started to do research

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.830 align:middle line:84%
on cancer therapy--
which is another one

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:54.050 align:middle line:84%
of those outrageous fields where
the truth is really concealed

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:56.625 align:middle line:84%
from the public, and I
was really in crusader

00:11:56.625 --> 00:12:00.540 align:middle line:84%
mode on that-- I was
getting a lot of information

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:03.900 align:middle line:84%
from scientific people, from
doctors, and researchers,

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:09.710 align:middle line:84%
and theorists, academics
about the nature of cancer,

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:15.130 align:middle line:84%
the biological forces and
the biochemical pathways,

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:16.270 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And I was totally focused on
the science of cancer therapy.

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And one of the leaders in that
field of alternative therapies

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:31.545 align:middle line:84%
using things like Laetrile
and other non-toxic natural

00:12:31.545 --> 00:12:34.570 align:middle line:84%
remedies, who was
gaining a lot of support

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:37.550 align:middle line:84%
and making great
headway in curing cancer

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:41.790 align:middle line:84%
at a much higher rate than
orthodox medicine, one

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:43.410 align:middle line:84%
of those men was
a friend of mine

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:47.410 align:middle line:84%
by the name of John Richardson,
who was an MD in the San

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:48.920 align:middle line:90%
Francisco area.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.120 align:middle line:90%
And he and I would confer a lot.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And he was teaching me a
lot about what I needed

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.650 align:middle line:90%
to know from a technical side.

00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:01.640 align:middle line:84%
But his office manager, Ralph
Bowman, was a funny little guy.

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:02.800 align:middle line:90%
I loved Ralph.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.180 align:middle line:84%
He always seemed like
his mind was elsewhere

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.130 align:middle line:90%
into bigger things.

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you
felt like, hey Ralph,

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:10.690 align:middle line:84%
come on back to
the conversation.

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:13.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of these bigger
things that Ralph was into

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:19.300 align:middle line:84%
and he felt that I needed
to know about was IG Farben.

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.610 align:middle line:84%
He says, Ed, if you're
going to do this,

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:26.230 align:middle line:84%
you need to know about this
German chemical cartel.

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And I remember thinking
to myself, Ralph, go away.

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:29.870 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm talking about cancer.

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:33.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to know about
Germany and the Nazis.

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:35.240 align:middle line:90%
I'll just focus on cancer.

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.080 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.450 align:middle line:90%
No, you're making a big mistake.

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:41.030 align:middle line:84%
So he kept loading me
up with books and books.

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And I really didn't
want to read them,

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:45.640 align:middle line:84%
because I thought it
was a waste of time.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.910 align:middle line:84%
But once I started,
I was hooked.

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:51.840 align:middle line:84%
I realized, oh, my
gosh, Ralph is right.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:55.450 align:middle line:84%
This all goes back-- this
is bigger than the science.

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And it was then in
that stage of research

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.635 align:middle line:84%
that I realized that
the story about cancer

00:14:00.635 --> 00:14:02.890 align:middle line:90%
is divided into two parts.

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:05.700 align:middle line:84%
There's the science
of cancer therapy

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:09.290 align:middle line:84%
and the politics of cancer
therapy or the economics.

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:10.910 align:middle line:90%
You might throw that in there.

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And of the two, the
science is really easy.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.690 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple.

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:16.570 align:middle line:90%
It's provable.

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:19.100 align:middle line:90%
It's a slam dunk thing.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:21.787 align:middle line:84%
But the reason nobody
knows about that

00:14:21.787 --> 00:14:23.620 align:middle line:84%
is because of the other
side of the picture.

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:27.280 align:middle line:84%
It's the politics, the
economics, the cash flow,

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:32.640 align:middle line:84%
the profit motive, the
corporatism that's involved.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Prior to World
War II in Germany,

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:38.955 align:middle line:84%
there was a cartel, which means
a grouping, an association

00:14:38.955 --> 00:14:42.899 align:middle line:90%
of competing companies.

00:14:42.899 --> 00:14:44.690 align:middle line:84%
At least on the surface,
they're competing.

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:48.050 align:middle line:84%
But they come together to
minimize their competition,

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:50.050 align:middle line:90%
to reduce their competition.

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:52.819 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, if they can
come to enough agreements,

00:14:52.819 --> 00:14:54.110 align:middle line:90%
they eliminate the competition.

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:56.350 align:middle line:84%
Even though they're
independent corporations,

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:58.300 align:middle line:90%
they work in perfect lockstep.

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:01.630 align:middle line:84%
And the object, of course,
is to avoid competition

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:04.920 align:middle line:84%
so they won't have to reduce
prices, or compete for better

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:05.950 align:middle line:90%
products, or whatever.

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:09.790 align:middle line:84%
They just agree, OK, guys, this
is what we're all going to do.

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And there will be no
competition between us,

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:16.080 align:middle line:84%
so our profit margins can
be a little higher that way.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And part of that
story is that we

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:21.160 align:middle line:84%
have to make sure that nobody
else gets into the field.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.700 align:middle line:84%
So that's what cartels
always do is set about

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:28.260 align:middle line:84%
to create regulations
which keep newcomers out.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.890 align:middle line:84%
I discovered that for the first
time in researching IG Farben,

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:35.300 align:middle line:84%
because in Germany, that was
really the granddaddy of all

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:36.680 align:middle line:90%
of the cartels.

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.480 align:middle line:10%
All of the great
corporations of the world,

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.670 align:middle line:10%
including in the United
States, by World War II,

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:47.140 align:middle line:10%
had created cartel agreements
between themselves.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:47.890 align:middle line:90%
They were layered.

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:50.710 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like
the whole world

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:52.980 align:middle line:90%
was one giant corporation.

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And we see that even more
on the surface today.

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:59.950 align:middle line:84%
But back in World War II,
it was not so visible.

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:01.850 align:middle line:10%
And that's what
Ralph Bowman wanted

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:04.410 align:middle line:10%
me to see in those early days.

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And it was all there,
but it wasn't so visible

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:08.800 align:middle line:90%
as it is today.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:13.850 align:middle line:84%
So IG Farben was the origin
of the medication industry.

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:16.920 align:middle line:84%
The pharmaceutical industry was
an outgrowth of all of that.

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And today, the
significance of that

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:22.640 align:middle line:84%
is that when you look at the
giant pharmaceutical industry,

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.910 align:middle line:90%
it's a cartel.

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:25.530 align:middle line:90%
They all work together.

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:26.522 align:middle line:90%
They compete, yes.

00:16:26.522 --> 00:16:27.730 align:middle line:90%
They have different products.

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:30.430 align:middle line:84%
But they all work
together to make sure

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:31.960 align:middle line:84%
that their prices
for their products

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.420 align:middle line:90%
are all within the same range.

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And they divide up categories
and, in some cases,

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:39.320 align:middle line:90%
even regions.

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And they share
patents and processes.

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And they actually work basically
as one huge corporation.

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's important to
know that if you're

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:54.550 align:middle line:84%
going to understand why it
is that your doctor does not

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:58.650 align:middle line:84%
know about the latest
treatments for some disease,

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:03.091 align:middle line:84%
especially if those treatments
do not come from the cartel.

00:17:03.091 --> 00:17:03.590 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:06.069 align:middle line:84%
And now we're getting
back to where we started.

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:11.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is the reason Bowman
wanted me to take this trip.

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.119 align:middle line:84%
And after you do
take the trip, you're

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:16.300 align:middle line:84%
finally able to answer
the question, why is it?

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:18.505 align:middle line:84%
If this is true, if there
is a control for cancer,

00:17:18.505 --> 00:17:21.790 align:middle line:90%
how come I can't get it?

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:24.079 align:middle line:84%
How come my doctor
can't offer it to me?

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:26.829 align:middle line:84%
How come it's not
available in my hospital?

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And until you know
about this other side

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.990 align:middle line:84%
of the story, the
cartels and how

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:35.930 align:middle line:84%
they do control the
industries that they dominate,

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:39.100 align:middle line:84%
and control what products
are available and at what

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.250 align:middle line:84%
price, and all that
sort of-- until you

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:44.884 align:middle line:84%
know that, then there's
no believable answer

00:17:44.884 --> 00:17:45.550 align:middle line:90%
to the question.

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:47.174 align:middle line:84%
Everybody says, well,
it can't be true,

00:17:47.174 --> 00:17:49.770 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise, my
doctor would know about it.

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:51.710 align:middle line:84%
So that's where the
significance of IG Farben

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:53.700 align:middle line:90%
fits into all of this.

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: How do
we prove to people

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:57.060 align:middle line:84%
who are going to be
watching this video

00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:00.530 align:middle line:84%
and think that you're a
doddering old man who's crazy

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:02.980 align:middle line:84%
that what you're saying
is actually true?

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: It's always hard
for people to, let's say,

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:12.500 align:middle line:84%
change their views on
something important

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:17.730 align:middle line:84%
if that view is reinforced
by authority or consensus.

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:19.600 align:middle line:84%
If there's a great
comfort for us to feel,

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.400 align:middle line:84%
well, everybody knows this
or everybody believes this.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And I believe this, therefore,
I'm in the majority.

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.160 align:middle line:90%
And therefore, it must be right.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.030 align:middle line:90%
I hope, hope, hope.

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:31.780 align:middle line:84%
So I understand why people might
laugh at some of these ideas

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:33.030 align:middle line:90%
the first time they hear them.

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:35.010 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
I laughed at them

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:38.900 align:middle line:84%
the first time I heard from
Ralph Bowman and others

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.430 align:middle line:84%
on various things, that there
was a control for cancer

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:42.995 align:middle line:84%
from my friend
Dr. Richardson who

00:18:42.995 --> 00:18:44.870 align:middle line:84%
said, hey, we're curing
cancer with something

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:46.650 align:middle line:90%
that comes from nature.

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:48.400 align:middle line:84%
You can get it from
an apricot seed.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.510 align:middle line:90%
I said, John, come on.

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:51.620 align:middle line:90%
You're pulling my leg.

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:54.950 align:middle line:84%
I didn't laugh at him, but I
knew that couldn't be true.

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:56.685 align:middle line:90%
Well, it didn't take long.

00:18:56.685 --> 00:18:59.880 align:middle line:84%
I found it is true,
and so I understand.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And there are probably things in
all of our paths ahead of this

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:05.250 align:middle line:84%
where we're going to
stumble across something

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:08.360 align:middle line:84%
and we'll hear somebody's
view, and then we'll say,

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:09.514 align:middle line:90%
they're crazy.

00:19:09.514 --> 00:19:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And we're going
to find out, we're

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:12.720 align:middle line:84%
going to be humbled
a few years later.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.970 align:middle line:84%
We're going to look back and
say, no, I was the crazy one,

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:17.460 align:middle line:90%
and he was right.

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:20.950 align:middle line:84%
So your question is how do
I answer people like that.

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:23.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't
really answer them.

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:26.290 align:middle line:84%
I'll just suggest that they
take a look at the evidence

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:29.330 align:middle line:84%
and back off and not
be so quick to judge.

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at the
evidence, that's all.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:32.360 align:middle line:90%
That's all I can say.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So let me
point out one thing.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.380 align:middle line:84%
What would happen
to the prophets

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:39.870 align:middle line:84%
of the pharmaceutical industry
if the average person knew

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:44.010 align:middle line:84%
that they could cure their
cancer with vitamin B17

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:49.200 align:middle line:84%
or Laetrile, that can be
derived out of apricot kernels?

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.760 align:middle line:84%
What would that do
to the bottom line

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:55.080 align:middle line:84%
of the pharmaceutical cartel
that we've been discussing?

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, it
would destroy the cartel.

00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:02.400 align:middle line:84%
If people understood that they
could control not only cancer,

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:07.180 align:middle line:84%
but most of these dread chronic
metabolic diseases, by that I

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:09.425 align:middle line:84%
mean, they're not
infectious diseases.

00:20:09.425 --> 00:20:10.800 align:middle line:84%
You don't catch
it from somebody.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:15.900 align:middle line:84%
They just grow out of the body's
deterioration in some way.

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:19.200 align:middle line:84%
Most of those, if they knew
that they could be controlled

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:24.350 align:middle line:84%
through therapies that are
outside of mainstream medicine

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:27.900 align:middle line:84%
and also therapies which
are relatively inexpensive,

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:31.990 align:middle line:84%
and in some cases, totally
free-- totally free-- I mean,

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:33.990 align:middle line:90%
this is outrageous.

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:36.690 align:middle line:84%
How can you run a multi-billion
dollar cancer cure

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:39.400 align:middle line:84%
industry if the therapies
are free, you see?

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.230 align:middle line:90%
So what would that do to them?

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:43.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, it would
put them out of business.

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And you know they're not
going to stand by and allow

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.680 align:middle line:90%
that to happen.

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:52.460 align:middle line:84%
This does not mean, David, that
there are people standing over

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.160 align:middle line:84%
there in these
industries saying,

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.900 align:middle line:84%
yeah, we know that there's
a control for cancer that

00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:59.130 align:middle line:90%
doesn't cost a lot of money.

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:00.970 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to
push ours anyway,

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:02.632 align:middle line:84%
because we want to
make the profit.

00:21:02.632 --> 00:21:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And the heck with
all these people.

00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:04.740 align:middle line:90%
Let them die.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:05.640 align:middle line:90%
Let them suffer.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:06.920 align:middle line:90%
They don't do that.

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.850 align:middle line:84%
There may be some that do, but
I don't think many of them do.

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:12.190 align:middle line:84%
Maybe at the top, but the
practicing physicians,

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:14.450 align:middle line:84%
the people in the
hospitals and the clinics,

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:17.540 align:middle line:84%
the people delivering
what they consider

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:20.460 align:middle line:84%
to be lifesaving drugs--
even though they're not,

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:21.910 align:middle line:84%
but they think
they are-- they're

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:23.860 align:middle line:90%
all well-intentioned people.

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:28.360 align:middle line:84%
But they are dependent
upon this industry.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And so, there's an
instinctive reaction

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:34.662 align:middle line:84%
to support the industry
that supports them.

00:21:34.662 --> 00:21:38.150 align:middle line:84%
I know of people, in
my personal experience,

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:40.580 align:middle line:90%
who are very good people.

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:43.260 align:middle line:84%
They're ethical people,
high-minded people.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And they're working for evil
corporations, and they know it.

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:49.880 align:middle line:84%
But they don't like
to think about it,

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:52.060 align:middle line:90%
because it's their job.

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:56.740 align:middle line:84%
And they never said, yeah,
I'm working for evil,

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:59.820 align:middle line:84%
but I don't care, because I
put money ahead of principle.

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:01.290 align:middle line:90%
They don't do that.

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:05.480 align:middle line:84%
But at the subconscious
level, they are saying, well,

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:06.540 align:middle line:90%
this is my job.

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And if I don't have this
job, I can't feed my family.

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:14.780 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, I'll do the best
I can in the spot where I am.

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think this
is the explanation

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:21.100 align:middle line:84%
for 99% of the people trapped
in this environment, where they

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:26.090 align:middle line:84%
are working for institutions
and corporations which are not

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:27.740 align:middle line:90%
very ethical.

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: How does
IG Farben morph

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:33.160 align:middle line:84%
into the modern
pharmaceutical industry?

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.232 align:middle line:90%
What's the through line on that?

00:22:35.232 --> 00:22:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: I don't know that
I'm aware of the through line,

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:41.230 align:middle line:84%
except to say that
after World War II,

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:46.800 align:middle line:84%
a lot of those corporations
were legally broken up.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:52.500 align:middle line:84%
But you know how the lawyers
and the financiers are.

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:56.210 align:middle line:84%
They can put structures together
that are not so obvious.

00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:57.390 align:middle line:90%
They can use street names.

00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:58.840 align:middle line:90%
They can use subsidiaries.

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:04.040 align:middle line:84%
They can use all kinds of legal
and financial relationships

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:07.270 align:middle line:84%
that are not obvious to people
like you and me to continue

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:08.130 align:middle line:90%
the operation.

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:11.040 align:middle line:84%
They say that Standard Oil
was broken up, for example.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:14.510 align:middle line:84%
But we know that,
technically, it's broken up.

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:18.510 align:middle line:84%
You can show an organizational
chart with two tops added.

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:20.720 align:middle line:84%
But what they don't show
is the invisible connection

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:23.650 align:middle line:84%
between the two tops, which
is at the board of directors

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:27.340 align:middle line:84%
level and the institutional
investment level.

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:31.620 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sure that
the cartel continues

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:34.480 align:middle line:90%
on this more subtle basis.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.900 align:middle line:90%
But we do know that it's real.

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's not
necessary for us to be

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:40.190 align:middle line:84%
able to trace the
connections and say,

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:43.730 align:middle line:84%
well, this is the corporate
relationship, and so forth.

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:45.760 align:middle line:84%
All we know is
that it's a cartel.

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.970 align:middle line:84%
That's obvious on
the surface of it,

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:50.159 align:middle line:84%
and that's really
all we need to know.

00:23:50.159 --> 00:23:52.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, I understand
that for some people,

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.170 align:middle line:84%
this is going to be
disturbing material.

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:56.240 align:middle line:10%
For other people, this
is going to be oh, yeah,

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.170 align:middle line:10%
we already knew all that stuff.

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:01.810 align:middle line:10%
The important part here is, that
if cheap and effective cures

00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:04.640 align:middle line:10%
for cancer already
exist, and there

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:08.230 align:middle line:10%
is this industrial conglomerate
that has formed-- what we were

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:10.760 align:middle line:10%
warned about, the military
industrial complex,

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:14.750 align:middle line:10%
by Eisenhower-- then we
should take this seriously.

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
this show is about.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.650 align:middle line:84%
Disclosure is about
speaking truth to power

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:21.650 align:middle line:90%
and giving power to the truth.

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:23.780 align:middle line:90%
We'll see you next time.

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:26.530 align:middle line:90%
