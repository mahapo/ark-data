00:00:15.772 --> 00:00:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID WILCOCK:
Welcome to "Disclosure."

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.270 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, David
Wilcock, and in this episode,

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.370 align:middle line:10%
we're going to finalize our
groundbreaking discussion

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.160 align:middle line:10%
with Dean Garner, a man who
has a history as a black ops

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.370 align:middle line:10%
soldier and mercenary
working in special ops

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.320 align:middle line:10%
programs for the Army Rangers
and then taking that expertise

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.210 align:middle line:10%
and extending it into being the
secret ghost writer and idea

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.060 align:middle line:10%
maker for many top
bestselling authors,

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.790 align:middle line:10%
giving them the
information they need

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.080 align:middle line:10%
to be able to accurately
write about spy

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.530 align:middle line:10%
trade in their publications.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, in this final
episode, what we're doing

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.970 align:middle line:84%
is going through 20th century
history of the cabal, which

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.280 align:middle line:84%
Dean is definitely
an expert about

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.220 align:middle line:84%
and has specifically spent
most of his time studying

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.800 align:middle line:90%
the Jesuits.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.730 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about
things like the Titanic

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.110 align:middle line:84%
and what really
was going on there.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Apparently this was
not an accident.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.610 align:middle line:84%
It was a planned
attack to defeat

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.730 align:middle line:84%
people who were trying
to stop the Federal

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.790 align:middle line:90%
Reserve from being implemented.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.020 align:middle line:84%
We also talk about the
very real likelihood

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.560 align:middle line:84%
that this group is not
going to be able to succeed

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.510 align:middle line:90%
because people are waking up.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.050 align:middle line:84%
There is a strange
occult magic that they

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.970 align:middle line:84%
seem to be following
where they have

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.340 align:middle line:84%
to tell us what
they're doing, and we

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.430 align:middle line:90%
have to give our power to them.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.270 align:middle line:84%
We have to allow
ourselves to be enslaved

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.430 align:middle line:90%
but with that comes a choice.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.530 align:middle line:84%
We can choose to live
and to think differently,

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.060 align:middle line:84%
and we can choose a
more loving path, which

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.080 align:middle line:84%
in turn, holographically alters
the nature of space and time

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.900 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.180 align:middle line:84%
We can harness the
power of consciousness

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.640 align:middle line:84%
so that we no longer need
there to be this epic villain

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.680 align:middle line:90%
in our planetary script.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.540 align:middle line:84%
So we can start
doing that now as you

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.410 align:middle line:84%
watch this last part of the
Dean Garner interview with me.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.430 align:middle line:84%
Let's check it out
and educate ourselves.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.160 align:middle line:84%
It's not that hard to
understand what's going on.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.660 align:middle line:84%
It's a fear wall
that prevents you

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.050 align:middle line:84%
from looking at something
really quite simple, which

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.100 align:middle line:84%
is we have organized crime in
the form of a religious cult,

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.580 align:middle line:84%
but the religion is
not Christianity.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.850 align:middle line:90%
It's a different religion.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.650 align:middle line:84%
It's based on them having
a group identity, of being

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.480 align:middle line:84%
from somewhere
else, coming here,

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.300 align:middle line:84%
and they organized a
society that systematically

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.010 align:middle line:84%
used ruthlessness and
sociopathic deception to stop

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.000 align:middle line:90%
at nothing to seize power.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.140 align:middle line:84%
One little tidbit
of history that I

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.650 align:middle line:84%
know is not your specialty
that other researchers have

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.820 align:middle line:84%
discussed is that
during the crusades.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.850 align:middle line:84%
the Templars, which were the
military arm of the Vatican,

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.290 align:middle line:84%
came in contact
with the assassins,

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.810 align:middle line:84%
which was the middle eastern
Islamic secret society,

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.530 align:middle line:84%
and that's where they
learned how to do things

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.640 align:middle line:84%
like leaving a dagger in the
king's bedroom to threaten him.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And then he finds out
I'm not safe anywhere.

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.200 align:middle line:84%
I better do exactly
what they say.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.250 align:middle line:84%
So when that technology
was brought in,

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.200 align:middle line:84%
including the use of hasheesh
and drugging-- hasheeshian

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.950 align:middle line:84%
is the derivation of
the word assassin.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.360 align:middle line:84%
So we have that technology
that was brought

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.940 align:middle line:84%
in during the Templar
period, and it

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.440 align:middle line:84%
may be that if the Templars
reunited with the Vatican

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.870 align:middle line:84%
through renaming themselves
as the Society of Jesus

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.120 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't want the
association with the name

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Templar anymore-- now they've
got all this assassination

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.540 align:middle line:84%
technology, and I've heard from
military insiders that still

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.730 align:middle line:84%
to this day when you get
special ops training,

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.300 align:middle line:84%
and they teach you
how to kill people

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.300 align:middle line:84%
and what to do with
a knife and going up

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.841 align:middle line:84%
under the chin like
this into the brain,

00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:13.090 align:middle line:84%
that's all stuff that they
learned from the assassins.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.184 align:middle line:90%
Have you heard that, too?

00:04:14.184 --> 00:04:15.850 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM DEAN GARNER:
Yes, anecdotally.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:16.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Of course.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.649 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: Which
you very aptly said

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:19.730 align:middle line:90%
was not my area of expertise.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.800 align:middle line:10%
I wish I could talk
about everything,

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.320 align:middle line:10%
but I chose, as a
scientist, to be smart,

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.500 align:middle line:10%
to be a thinker here
and try to focus

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.020 align:middle line:10%
on one item, which is just
the behavioral ecology

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.210 align:middle line:10%
of the Jesuits.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so, I still
don't have enough hours

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.890 align:middle line:84%
in a day, David, to study
what I want to study.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Undoubtedly.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GARNER: I'm overwhelmed.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, I don't choose
to see it as overwhelming.

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.470 align:middle line:84%
I choose to see it
as a great quest,

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.490 align:middle line:84%
and it's an enjoyable
quest because what are we

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.100 align:middle line:90%
really looking at?

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.260 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at the possibility
of getting our planet back

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.160 align:middle line:84%
from people who have been
deliberately creating

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.710 align:middle line:84%
crisis and conflict for
their own gain and profit.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.450 align:middle line:84%
Most of the wars
that are happening

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.830 align:middle line:90%
are deliberately created.

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.970 align:middle line:84%
These people are
looking for where

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:24.520 align:middle line:84%
we disagree, gender versus
gender, race versus race,

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.030 align:middle line:84%
country versus country,
religion versus religion, region

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.780 align:middle line:84%
versus region,
continent vs continent.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.010 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to find-- how
do we exploit the difference

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:37.400 align:middle line:90%
between town and country.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.300 align:middle line:90%
People in the city are Liberals.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.710 align:middle line:84%
People in the country are
Republicans and Conservatives.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.740 align:middle line:90%
Let's throw them together.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.390 align:middle line:84%
They want the Republican
people to think

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:52.590 align:middle line:84%
that the only people that are
on public assistance, welfare,

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.850 align:middle line:84%
are blacks, and
therefore they're

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.990 align:middle line:84%
the problem because they're
taking all our money,

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.500 align:middle line:84%
but all they're doing
is giving these people

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.010 align:middle line:84%
a very, very small
amount of money,

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.647 align:middle line:90%
which is not enough to live on.

00:06:04.647 --> 00:06:06.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: It just
keeps them in check.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.646 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: The money that they're
pulling out of our economy

00:06:08.646 --> 00:06:11.140 align:middle line:84%
is much greater than what
they're diverting to welfare.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GARNER: Oh, of course.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.717 align:middle line:84%
They're just pennies to
welfare, but no one knows that.

00:06:14.717 --> 00:06:16.300 align:middle line:84%
Big media and big
entertainment ensure

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.620 align:middle line:90%
that we do not know that.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It's incredible to
see the amount to which Fox

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:24.040 align:middle line:84%
News and these kind
of Republican outlets

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:30.310 align:middle line:84%
are promulgating the idea
that the real problem is

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.040 align:middle line:84%
these people that are taking
your hard earned money.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.000 align:middle line:90%
You're working hard.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.400 align:middle line:90%
You're paying your taxes.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.320 align:middle line:84%
You're a law abiding citizen,
and these sons of guns

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.450 align:middle line:84%
are just siphoning
all your wealth,

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.990 align:middle line:84%
and they're the problem,
and that's the game.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:49.800 align:middle line:84%
Turn us against each other,
create fake problems,

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.297 align:middle line:90%
create wars.

00:06:52.297 --> 00:06:53.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: Not to
mention the two class

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.930 align:middle line:84%
system-- the so-called
wealthy on one end

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.234 align:middle line:90%
and the poor on the other.

00:06:58.234 --> 00:06:59.150 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: That's right.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:04.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: We're seeing the last
vestiges of the middle class.

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It's incredible to
watch the greatest depression

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.840 align:middle line:84%
ever in America
happening, and it's

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.440 align:middle line:84%
sort of like the idea, if
a tree falls in the forest

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.930 align:middle line:84%
and no one's there to hear
it, did it make any sound?

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.639 align:middle line:84%
Well yes, technically the
air vibrated, because that's

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:24.680 align:middle line:84%
what's going to happen,
but it's like, if there's

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.580 align:middle line:84%
a great depression and
nobody calls it that,

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:27.680 align:middle line:90%
is it a depression?

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.430 align:middle line:90%
>>GARNER: Exactly.

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It still is,
and we're actually

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.440 align:middle line:84%
seeing all the numbers,
all the statistics

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.640 align:middle line:84%
are worse than the
Great Depression.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.612 align:middle line:84%
We're not calling it
a Great Depression.

00:07:37.612 --> 00:07:38.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GARNER: No way.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.130 align:middle line:90%
It's the little recession.

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:44.220 align:middle line:84%
The first volume of my
book, "Who Really Owns

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Your Gold," I
called the intended

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:50.490 align:middle line:84%
global meltdown of 2012, 2014,
and of course people said,

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:50.990 align:middle line:90%
what?

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:51.750 align:middle line:90%
Are you kidding?

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.499 align:middle line:84%
You have no idea what
you're talking about

00:07:53.499 --> 00:07:55.040 align:middle line:84%
because you can't
see it around you.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.010 align:middle line:84%
It's because of that
demoralization, the numbing

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:01.230 align:middle line:84%
of the public, that
first step with big media

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.760 align:middle line:84%
and big entertainment
that, again, are numbing

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:08.000 align:middle line:84%
the population such that you
have no idea that the greatest

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.830 align:middle line:84%
depression in the
history of our country

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:11.890 align:middle line:84%
is occurring all around
you all the time,

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:14.348 align:middle line:84%
and you could actually go out
and just look at the results.

00:08:14.348 --> 00:08:17.400 align:middle line:84%
You go, say, downtown Tampa
or St. Petersburg or Miami

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.410 align:middle line:84%
or Atlanta, and you can just
count the number of homeless

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:21.459 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:23.250 align:middle line:84%
You look at the number
of homeless shelters

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:24.200 align:middle line:90%
that are out there.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You've got
Amazon, which is completely

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:32.090 align:middle line:84%
destroying all retail sales, and
they don't even make a profit.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:35.059 align:middle line:84%
So it's just everything's
being stripped away.

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we can just
ditch the fear,

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:42.650 align:middle line:84%
because I think people willfully
overlook the truth thinking

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:45.070 align:middle line:84%
that, if I look at
it, then it's real,

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:47.370 align:middle line:84%
but if I don't look at
it, then it's not real.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:49.667 align:middle line:84%
I want to stay asleep, and
they use that, don't they?

00:08:49.667 --> 00:08:50.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GARNER: Yes.

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:52.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: That's a part
of the normalization.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.180 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to go back to
those previous cycles of crisis

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:56.140 align:middle line:90%
and trauma.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.120 align:middle line:90%
You want to just be peaceful.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.960 align:middle line:84%
Oh, we shouldn't
question our leaders.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.410 align:middle line:90%
We shouldn't question authority.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:03.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: Well, you
have to keep in mind

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.535 align:middle line:84%
too that those
four steps are not

00:09:04.535 --> 00:09:07.210 align:middle line:90%
necessarily in linear order.

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:08.840 align:middle line:90%
In general, they are.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.370 align:middle line:84%
However, step one,
demoralization of the public,

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.360 align:middle line:90%
occurs all the time.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.130 align:middle line:90%
It is a continuous process.

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:17.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like you get
a booster shot every now

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:18.210 align:middle line:90%
and then.

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:19.335 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right, absolutely.

00:09:19.335 --> 00:09:20.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GARNER: It's just ongoing.

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:24.380 align:middle line:84%
Now the false flag attacks,
you don't see those every day.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, they've ramped
that up quite significantly

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.280 align:middle line:90%
in the last few years.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.196 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: Well, again
we see that acceleration

00:09:30.196 --> 00:09:32.920 align:middle line:90%
of events since 9/11.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Very much so.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:39.000 align:middle line:84%
I remember actually seeing
before 9/11 seemingly desperate

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.790 align:middle line:84%
efforts to try to cause
fear that were not working.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:45.960 align:middle line:84%
They tried to make us
afraid that the internet was

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.810 align:middle line:84%
going to be taken
down by a virus

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:50.539 align:middle line:84%
and that we can't use
the internet because it's

00:09:50.539 --> 00:09:51.580 align:middle line:90%
going to ruin everything.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:52.890 align:middle line:90%
>>GARNER: Y2K.

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:53.750 align:middle line:90%
Stuff like that.

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:55.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And we saw
all these attempts

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.000 align:middle line:84%
to try to get
terrorism for people

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.630 align:middle line:84%
to be afraid of-- the
bombing of the USS

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:03.260 align:middle line:84%
whatever it was off
the coast of Yemen.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:04.830 align:middle line:90%
There was that terrorist attack.

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.900 align:middle line:90%
That didn't get people scared.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.869 align:middle line:90%
Then along comes 9/11.

00:10:08.869 --> 00:10:10.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: If one thing
doesn't work-- the Jesuits

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:14.040 align:middle line:84%
are masters at this,
and you'll have

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.780 align:middle line:84%
about 1,000 different
conspiracies going

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.634 align:middle line:84%
on in every country
at any given moment.

00:10:18.634 --> 00:10:20.050 align:middle line:84%
So if something
doesn't work, then

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:23.120 align:middle line:84%
they just immediately change
gears and try something

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.370 align:middle line:84%
different because they
have, as we've talked about,

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:28.570 align:middle line:84%
the 5, 10, 25, 50,
and 100 year plans.

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:32.200 align:middle line:84%
So people even in the
generation before them--

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.170 align:middle line:84%
the ones who were carrying out
these attacks or these events

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:37.130 align:middle line:84%
right now, the actions
and behaviors--

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.660 align:middle line:84%
it may have been
written by their father

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:43.100 align:middle line:84%
or another bloodline member,
25 or 50 years before.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:46.820 align:middle line:84%
So they have this playbook
that continually evolves,

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:51.570 align:middle line:84%
if not continuously evolves
when things don't work.

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:54.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So there's some guy
with his arms crossed right now

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:58.580 align:middle line:84%
watching his screen
saying, you guys

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:02.050 align:middle line:84%
are trying to make the grand
unified conspiracy theory.

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:06.270 align:middle line:84%
The Vatican had nothing to
do with the Federal Reserve.

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:08.530 align:middle line:84%
So what would you
say to that guy?

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:10.210 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the Federal Reserve.

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:13.790 align:middle line:84%
The Fed Reserve--
we can trace now

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:17.580 align:middle line:84%
through James Glattfelder,
the Swiss scientist,

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:21.440 align:middle line:84%
that 80% of all the money that
is to be earned in the world

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.450 align:middle line:84%
is going into an interlocking
directorate of a core of 147

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:28.840 align:middle line:84%
corporations, 2/3 of which are
financial institutions, the top

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:33.180 align:middle line:84%
50 of which are all the usual
suspects of the big mega banks.

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:34.240 align:middle line:90%
So we know that.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.910 align:middle line:84%
We know that the
banks are in control,

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:40.330 align:middle line:84%
and we know that those banks
are the banks that are actually

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:43.520 align:middle line:84%
secretly the Federal
Reserve banks, because--

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GARNER: In America, yes.

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:48.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So we know that the
Fed Reserve is behind this,

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:52.070 align:middle line:84%
but how do we establish
the linkage to the Vatican.

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:54.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: Well, first
the Federal Reserve Act

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:56.502 align:middle line:90%
of, I think, 1912.

00:11:56.502 --> 00:11:58.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, 1913 was when
they actually passed it.

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:00.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: Then 1913, yeah, but
it had actually been started--

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: They were running
it through in 1912, yeah.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.471 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: Yes,
exactly, and of course

00:12:03.471 --> 00:12:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Paul Warburg, a
German immigrant,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:10.170 align:middle line:84%
came from a long lineage
of Teutonic history,

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:12.130 align:middle line:84%
was one of the
architects of that.

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And so that had been going
on for about 25 years, even

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:17.700 align:middle line:84%
longer, because of
course remember Alexander

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Hamilton under the
direction of-- by direction

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.740 align:middle line:84%
of certain Jesuits who
were handling him--

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:26.274 align:middle line:84%
they instituted the first
central bank in America.

00:12:26.274 --> 00:12:27.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: That's right.

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:30.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: So this
has probably gone on

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.390 align:middle line:84%
to establish that
Federal Reserve

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:35.160 align:middle line:90%
bank even 100 years before.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, and I'm sure
you know that Lincoln ended up

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.870 align:middle line:84%
printing American currency
in America that were called

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:45.610 align:middle line:84%
"greenbacks" to try to break
the bank because the bank wanted

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:49.560 align:middle line:84%
to take 24% to 36%
tax on our money.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:50.560 align:middle line:90%
>>GARNER: Yeah, exactly.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And Lincoln threw them
away, and then he gets whacked.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:56.180 align:middle line:90%
And as soon as he gets whacked--

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:57.560 align:middle line:90%
>>GARNER: By a Jesuit.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.060 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:04.390 align:middle line:84%
As soon as he gets whacked,
the greenbacks are gone,

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:05.910 align:middle line:84%
and you've got
central bank currency

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.030 align:middle line:90%
coming over from overseas.

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:10.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: It's a good example
of one of their products

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.510 align:middle line:84%
that didn't work, so
they took it offline.

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:13.720 align:middle line:90%
They tried something different.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:14.636 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: That's right.

00:13:14.636 --> 00:13:16.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: They finally
normalized things

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:20.790 align:middle line:84%
in the 1912, 1913 time
period with the institution

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:23.990 align:middle line:84%
of the Federal Reserve
bank, the private bank.

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:26.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: After a series of
deliberately manufactured

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.546 align:middle line:90%
economic crises--

00:13:27.546 --> 00:13:28.420 align:middle line:90%
>>GARNER: Absolutely.

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: --which they
blamed on America

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:33.620 align:middle line:84%
doesn't know how to take
care of its own problems.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:38.890 align:middle line:84%
We need investors to come in
and basically bail out America,

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:40.640 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to
be smarter and better

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.890 align:middle line:84%
at running it than ourselves
because the government is

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:44.480 align:middle line:90%
a bunch of dipwads.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.010 align:middle line:84%
They don't know
what they're doing.

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:47.620 align:middle line:84%
The elected leaders don't
know what they're doing.

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.090 align:middle line:84%
Let's let the
people who know how

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:53.220 align:middle line:84%
to make money invest in America
just like what they tried

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:56.120 align:middle line:84%
to do with, oh, privatize
your social security

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.790 align:middle line:90%
and put it on the stock market.

00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:58.820 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing.

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:03.070 align:middle line:84%
They said let's privatize
the American economy,

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:07.030 align:middle line:84%
and then these bankers
will know better than us

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:08.540 align:middle line:90%
how to make a profit.

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:12.480 align:middle line:84%
Let's outsource American
currency to them.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.820 align:middle line:84%
It sounds crazy now
because look at what's

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:17.490 align:middle line:84%
happened in the last 100
years, but people bought it.

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:18.615 align:middle line:90%
>>GARNER: Well, absolutely.

00:14:18.615 --> 00:14:21.500 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's because that
magnificent, that brilliant

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:25.500 align:middle line:84%
genius advertising marketing
PR machine of the Jesuits.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.360 align:middle line:84%
They do it better
than anyone else.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.480 align:middle line:90%
Just the examples today.

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.239 align:middle line:84%
Look at Hollywood,
how slick it is.

00:14:31.239 --> 00:14:32.280 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: It's incredible.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: The production
value of every show, the TV

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:37.380 align:middle line:84%
shows, the reality
TV shows, even

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:40.170 align:middle line:84%
these little basic
documentaries--

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:41.280 align:middle line:90%
these guys have it down.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.740 align:middle line:90%
It's not just a science.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:46.170 align:middle line:84%
It's an art, and it ropes people
in because they understand

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:50.850 align:middle line:84%
the psychology, the
neurophysiology behavior

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:51.740 align:middle line:90%
of human beings.

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:54.420 align:middle line:84%
They know how to manipulate us,
and there's that normalization

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:55.175 align:middle line:90%
thing, again.

00:14:55.175 --> 00:14:56.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: They
flash these symbols

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:59.120 align:middle line:84%
that go all the way back
to the Roman Empire.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:03.270 align:middle line:84%
Just as one example off the top
of my head, the Lemony Snicket

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:03.770 align:middle line:90%
movie.

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:06.700 align:middle line:84%
One of the ones that
Jim Carey is in.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.500 align:middle line:84%
The whole entire
movie they're showing

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.720 align:middle line:90%
you the eye all the time.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.070 align:middle line:90%
It's unbelievable.

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:13.850 align:middle line:84%
They have tons of
examples like this.

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:14.558 align:middle line:90%
>>GARNER: Oh yes.

00:15:14.558 --> 00:15:16.280 align:middle line:84%
So you see symbolism
all over the place.

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.488 align:middle line:84%
I used to think that it was
they were just rubbing it

00:15:18.488 --> 00:15:20.270 align:middle line:84%
in our faces until a
wise man said, well,

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:21.936 align:middle line:84%
you know it's actually
part of the plan.

00:15:21.936 --> 00:15:24.630 align:middle line:84%
It's part of laws that
they have to adhere to.

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:29.340 align:middle line:84%
They sort of let us know it's
the fine print that we always

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:30.537 align:middle line:90%
ignore.

00:15:30.537 --> 00:15:31.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: They gotta give notice.

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:33.369 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: They give
notice, exactly.

00:15:33.369 --> 00:15:34.554 align:middle line:90%
They give notice.

00:15:34.554 --> 00:15:35.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And they
also use terror.

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:39.730 align:middle line:84%
So we were going
to talk about there

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:42.440 align:middle line:84%
were people who were opposing
the Federal Reserve obviously,

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:42.540 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.373 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: Oh these very,
very wealthy people

00:15:44.373 --> 00:15:47.070 align:middle line:84%
like the John Jacob
Astors of America.

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:48.470 align:middle line:90%
They were they were brilliant.

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:50.870 align:middle line:84%
There is that advertising
marketing PR machine again

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:52.870 align:middle line:84%
that roped a bunch of
these guys and said

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:55.410 align:middle line:90%
let's take a little cruise.

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:56.750 align:middle line:90%
What do you say?

00:15:56.750 --> 00:16:00.108 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a little cruise,
and that little cruise was--

00:16:00.108 --> 00:16:00.983 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: The Titanic.

00:16:00.983 --> 00:16:02.816 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: --the Titanic,
which wasn't really

00:16:02.816 --> 00:16:05.180 align:middle line:84%
the Titanic anyway, but
that's another conversation.

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:08.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So there's a book
that was written years before

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:12.370 align:middle line:84%
the Titanic disaster about a
ship called the Titan that was

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:14.835 align:middle line:84%
the crown jewel, the
biggest luxury ship--

00:16:14.835 --> 00:16:16.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: There's
the fine print.

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:18.251 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: --and then it
goes on its maiden voyage,

00:16:18.251 --> 00:16:19.860 align:middle line:90%
and it crashes, and it sinks.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:21.979 align:middle line:84%
So they have to tell you
what they're going to do.

00:16:21.979 --> 00:16:23.270 align:middle line:90%
They have to put it in writing.

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:24.311 align:middle line:90%
>>GARNER: Or visual aids.

00:16:24.311 --> 00:16:27.325 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: They use one of their
patsies to write the story.

00:16:27.325 --> 00:16:29.700 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing is out there,
and then they do it anyway.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:30.449 align:middle line:90%
>>GARNER: Exactly.

00:16:30.449 --> 00:16:32.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Because there's
some sort of magical ceremony

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:36.400 align:middle line:84%
thing-- there's a magic that
they get that they acquire

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.580 align:middle line:84%
power, but only because
there's actually ultimately

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:43.790 align:middle line:84%
a benevolent universe, where
they cannot gain the power they

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:47.040 align:middle line:90%
need unless we consent to it.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.100 align:middle line:90%
They need consent.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:51.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: But you know
that consent is in quotes,

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:53.030 align:middle line:90%
and it's not logical consent.

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:56.040 align:middle line:90%
It is not psychological.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.640 align:middle line:84%
It is not a positive
behavioral consent.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.710 align:middle line:90%
It's not a conscious consent.

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:04.389 align:middle line:84%
It's not even
subconscious consent.

00:17:04.389 --> 00:17:07.329 align:middle line:90%


00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:08.780 align:middle line:90%
It's based on ignorance.

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:12.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, I would imagine
that the pure magic does

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:16.099 align:middle line:84%
require consent, and they
have heard this magic,

00:17:16.099 --> 00:17:18.390 align:middle line:84%
and they're trying to
follow it, but now it's

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:23.040 align:middle line:84%
ridiculous because they're
not telling us everything.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.876 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: No, again
it's the fine print

00:17:24.876 --> 00:17:26.000 align:middle line:90%
that we're just not seeing.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.140 align:middle line:84%
It's yet to be
discovered, I would say.

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But if you look
at the movie "John Carter,"

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:34.570 align:middle line:84%
this was an incredible film
that had a huge, huge budget--

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:37.480 align:middle line:84%
enormous, enormous
budget-- but it

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.370 align:middle line:84%
got too close to what's
really going on in my view.

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:43.620 align:middle line:84%
It's about this guy
who goes to Mars,

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:48.064 align:middle line:84%
and there are these archons,
the negative aliens--

00:17:48.064 --> 00:17:48.980 align:middle line:90%
>>GARNER: Yes, aliens.

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:52.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: --that are manipulating
both sides of a war,

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:54.840 align:middle line:90%
and they buried this film.

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's like that film is an
example where they tell us

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:01.130 align:middle line:84%
what's going on-- that there's
these spiritual beings that

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:06.200 align:middle line:84%
require the energy of fear and
terror and death to feed on,

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.546 align:middle line:84%
and that they're
financing both sides,

00:18:08.546 --> 00:18:10.670 align:middle line:84%
but then they buried that
film so they don't really

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:12.137 align:middle line:90%
want you to know.

00:18:12.137 --> 00:18:13.720 align:middle line:84%
So I think what's
happening is they're

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:17.170 align:middle line:84%
trying to go through the
motions because they know that,

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:18.830 align:middle line:84%
if they do this
right, that they're

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:21.640 align:middle line:84%
allowed-- that the power
has to be given to them.

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.830 align:middle line:84%
They can't just take it,
but they're not really

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:26.100 align:middle line:84%
following it correctly,
and therefore they're

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.420 align:middle line:90%
just losing and losing now.

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:30.390 align:middle line:84%
They're becoming
exposed to such a degree

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:31.960 align:middle line:90%
that everybody knows about this.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: Yes, well
again, because the advent

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:37.354 align:middle line:84%
of the internet,-- such that
people could get wind of these

00:18:37.354 --> 00:18:40.020 align:middle line:84%
things-- and now we have a bunch
of amateur historians out there

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:43.710 align:middle line:84%
and these little sleuths who
are discovering them and putting

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:44.930 align:middle line:90%
the information out there.

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:48.180 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, it's buried
under millions and millions

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:50.280 align:middle line:90%
of big data.

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.870 align:middle line:84%
So how can we possibly
learn about these

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:54.962 align:middle line:84%
from people-- good little
amateur researchers,

00:18:54.962 --> 00:18:56.170 align:middle line:90%
with all due respect to them.

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:58.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean to say
little to belittle them,

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:03.800 align:middle line:84%
but folks who can-- again,
someone is always watching.

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And so those folks
who are watching now

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:10.620 align:middle line:84%
can actually write it down in
a blog or take a video of it,

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:15.130 align:middle line:84%
upload it to Vimeo or YouTube
for other people to get.

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:18.380 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately we
don't usually see it

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.850 align:middle line:84%
because it's just buried
under too much information.

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I would say there's
a non-linear effect going on

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.680 align:middle line:84%
though, in which there's
so much of this information

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:30.110 align:middle line:84%
out there that everybody is
coming in contact with it

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:32.370 align:middle line:84%
in different ways and at
different levels of quality.

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:32.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GARNER: No, good point.

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:35.366 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And when you start
going through dumpster diving,

00:19:35.366 --> 00:19:37.260 align:middle line:84%
eventually you look
for better food

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:38.970 align:middle line:84%
than you're going to
get in the dumpster,

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:41.890 align:middle line:84%
and you keep going
back to where the best

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:43.620 align:middle line:90%
quality is going to be.

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:46.680 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk a little bit
more about this Titanic thing.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:49.380 align:middle line:84%
Some people are going to
laugh and say, oh, these guys

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:50.060 align:middle line:90%
are so crazy.

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:52.110 align:middle line:90%
They got their tinfoil hats on.

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:54.630 align:middle line:84%
What do we know
about the Titanic?

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:56.310 align:middle line:90%
Who was on the Titanic?

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: Well, as I said, the
John Jacob Astors of the world.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:01.400 align:middle line:84%
There were probably
about a dozen

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.610 align:middle line:90%
different multi-millionaires.

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So some very wealthy
people were on the Titanic.

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:10.041 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: Yes, and they
were all invited, probably

00:20:10.041 --> 00:20:11.290 align:middle line:90%
in the most wonderful of ways.

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:17.020 align:middle line:84%
They got these probably
elaborate salesmanship speeches

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:21.270 align:middle line:84%
from various Jesuits, who
just convinced them obviously

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:22.610 align:middle line:90%
without a problem.

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:24.680 align:middle line:84%
Just come along on
this little cruise.

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Pump up your ego.

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:27.160 align:middle line:90%
Make them feel great.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:27.937 align:middle line:90%


00:20:27.937 --> 00:20:28.770 align:middle line:90%
You're so important.

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:29.850 align:middle line:90%
This is the big thing.

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:31.610 align:middle line:84%
We want you to be here
for this big event.

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:32.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: Yeah, it's
the first of its kind.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.835 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And they just
get everybody together

00:20:34.835 --> 00:20:36.560 align:middle line:84%
who opposed the Federal
Reserve and said

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:37.750 align:middle line:90%
we don't want this to go.

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:39.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: Yes, well, the
most important people.

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:44.130 align:middle line:84%
Yes, the actual
influencers of the day.

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:47.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And wasn't it JP Morgan
who right at the last minute

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:49.390 align:middle line:90%
didn't get on the Titanic?

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: Yes, and
among other folks,

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:53.870 align:middle line:84%
because you had to
make a convincing

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:59.690 align:middle line:84%
scene, or a set of scenes,
that would be believable enough

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:02.340 align:middle line:84%
by Astor and his
colleagues so he

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:05.500 align:middle line:84%
could see that even
people who opposed him

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.460 align:middle line:84%
and his views were
actually going too.

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You don't want
to tip them off that--

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:11.410 align:middle line:90%
>>GARNER: No, not at all.

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:12.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: --oh,
well wait a minute.

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:13.510 align:middle line:90%
The other guys aren't here.

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:15.230 align:middle line:90%
It's just us.

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:19.480 align:middle line:84%
So right up until the last
minute before it set sail

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:22.052 align:middle line:84%
they thought that the people
who they were arguing with

00:21:22.052 --> 00:21:23.510 align:middle line:84%
were going to be
on there, as well.

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GARNER: Yes.

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.575 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And then
they're not on there.

00:21:25.575 --> 00:21:26.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GARNER: Exactly.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well this is
huge because if you

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:34.650 align:middle line:84%
think about fear, so much
of it is about the story.

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:36.330 align:middle line:84%
If I'm standing here
and all of a sudden

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:38.496 align:middle line:84%
there's this sword that
goes through my chest, which

00:21:38.496 --> 00:21:42.330 align:middle line:84%
is probably not going
to happen at Gaiam,

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:43.650 align:middle line:90%
I don't have time to be afraid.

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:47.234 align:middle line:84%
I'm just dying all of a
sudden, but if you and I are

00:21:47.234 --> 00:21:48.900 align:middle line:84%
in this room, and
we're taping the show,

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:52.460 align:middle line:84%
and the lights go dead,
and then all of a sudden

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:53.960 align:middle line:84%
we start hearing
noises, and we hear

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:57.510 align:middle line:90%
breathing, and what's that?

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:59.000 align:middle line:90%
It's the ballet dance.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.040 align:middle line:84%
Fear is all about
the anticipation

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.000 align:middle line:84%
that something bad
is going to happen.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.300 align:middle line:84%
So what happens after the
opponents to the Federal

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:08.410 align:middle line:90%
Reserve are aced in the Titanic?

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: Well, then we
get to the Income Tax Act

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:12.786 align:middle line:90%
and the Federal Reserve Act.

00:22:12.786 --> 00:22:14.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But I'm
just also saying

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:17.910 align:middle line:84%
the ballet of anybody
else that would oppose.

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:20.670 align:middle line:84%
It makes these people
look like god, like they

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:22.160 align:middle line:90%
have the power of gods.

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: Well that
supposes already

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:26.324 align:middle line:90%
that people knew what was up.

00:22:26.324 --> 00:22:27.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: At the
higher levels, I'm

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:30.260 align:middle line:84%
sure they did because
President Woodrow Wilson said

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:35.150 align:middle line:84%
there is somewhere a power
so secretive, so devastating

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:36.970 align:middle line:84%
that we dare not
speak above a breath

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:38.700 align:middle line:84%
when we speak in
condemnation of it.

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:40.241 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: Exactly,
so what I'm saying

00:22:40.241 --> 00:22:41.844 align:middle line:84%
is the American
people in general

00:22:41.844 --> 00:22:43.010 align:middle line:90%
had no idea what's going on.

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:44.135 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, of course not.

00:22:44.135 --> 00:22:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: But the influencers
were sent a message.

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:47.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh yeah.

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:49.136 align:middle line:90%
Very powerful message.

00:22:49.136 --> 00:22:50.510 align:middle line:84%
We're willing to
stop at nothing.

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:51.930 align:middle line:90%
We're totally ruthless.

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:53.769 align:middle line:90%
Your life means nothing to us.

00:22:53.769 --> 00:22:56.310 align:middle line:84%
If you don't do exactly what we
say, we're going to kill you,

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:59.680 align:middle line:84%
and you're never going
to see it coming.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough they railroad
this through Congress

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:03.230 align:middle line:90%
when hardly anybody is there.

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:04.140 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's gone.

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:07.047 align:middle line:90%
There's hardly anybody around.

00:23:07.047 --> 00:23:08.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GARNER: Not properly ratified.

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: All the opposition gets
removed in the Titanic-- well,

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:12.150 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the
opposition got removed

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:14.770 align:middle line:84%
from the financial
sector in the Titanic,

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:19.050 align:middle line:84%
and now we've got 96%
to 98% degradation

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:22.870 align:middle line:84%
of the value of the dollar
since the time that started.

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:24.890 align:middle line:90%
So look at the obvious evidence.

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:26.510 align:middle line:84%
All we've got to
do now is link it

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:29.020 align:middle line:84%
to a cult that's been
going on for a long time.

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:31.560 align:middle line:84%
They wanted a new world
order, and as I've

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.170 align:middle line:84%
said in my financial
tyranny investigation,

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:37.480 align:middle line:84%
they paid for both sides of
World War I and World War II.

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GARNER: Exactly.

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Because what their goal
is is to get a new world order,

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:46.030 align:middle line:84%
do the same thing they did
in Europe in the 1600s,

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:47.870 align:middle line:84%
get everybody
fighting each other.

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:51.420 align:middle line:84%
They control the whole thing,
and whoever comes out on top

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:52.172 align:middle line:90%
is the winner.

00:23:52.172 --> 00:23:54.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: Again, that's
that four step process.

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:57.040 align:middle line:90%
They do it everywhere they go.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.180 align:middle line:84%
That's why, in studying
the behavioral ecology

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:02.770 align:middle line:84%
of the Jesuits, if you
study, say, five years back,

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:05.160 align:middle line:84%
you see a few interesting
events here in America.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.940 align:middle line:84%
You go 10, 25, 50,
or even 100 years,

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:10.210 align:middle line:84%
then you start seeing
some fascinating patterns

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:11.180 align:middle line:90%
of behavior.

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:13.570 align:middle line:84%
Go back 200 years, then
you say, oh my gosh,

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:15.790 align:middle line:84%
the patterns are
absolutely unmistakable.

00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:19.640 align:middle line:84%
Now when you go to France or
Switzerland or China or Japan,

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.470 align:middle line:84%
you see the very same
patterns of behaviors

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:25.110 align:middle line:84%
that are occurring, not
necessarily at the same time

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:27.050 align:middle line:84%
in which they
occurred in America,

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:29.392 align:middle line:84%
but the same patterns
still exists nonetheless.

00:24:29.392 --> 00:24:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to ask-- and
then you go back even further,

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:36.760 align:middle line:84%
and you start seeing anecdotally
these common threads,

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:40.100 align:middle line:84%
and those threads always
lead to the Society of Jesus,

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:42.620 align:middle line:90%
at least back until 1540 or so.

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Which is just
basically another name for what

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.590 align:middle line:84%
people-- and you
would say erroneously

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:49.290 align:middle line:90%
are calling the Illuminati.

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:51.456 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: I wouldn't even
talk about the Illuminati.

00:24:51.456 --> 00:24:54.160 align:middle line:90%
I don't, respectfully.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:56.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So we're
calling it the Jesuits?

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:57.760 align:middle line:90%
>>GARNER: Yes.

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So if we take this
premise that 20th century

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:06.400 align:middle line:84%
history has been
manipulated by these people,

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.290 align:middle line:84%
then one logical
outcropping of that

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:15.850 align:middle line:84%
would be that Hitler is just
a more visible way of looking

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:18.250 align:middle line:84%
at the way they really all
are, the way they really

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:20.350 align:middle line:90%
think and feel.

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:23.144 align:middle line:84%
That's probably the most visible
it got as a public display.

00:25:23.144 --> 00:25:25.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: Respectfully, I'd
say no because he was actually

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.480 align:middle line:84%
out of control, and
the Jesuits themselves,

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.000 align:middle line:84%
the ones behind
the black curtain,

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.266 align:middle line:90%
are much more in control.

00:25:30.266 --> 00:25:32.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, you might call them
sociopaths or psychopaths,

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:34.430 align:middle line:84%
but I would say,
would you actually

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:38.400 align:middle line:84%
call a lion out there on
the savanna a sociopath

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.960 align:middle line:84%
because it just tears apart
an animal without any regard

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:42.910 align:middle line:90%
for the animal's life?

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:48.180 align:middle line:84%
No, it's just sort of doing what
the pattern of DNA prescribes?

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And it just, it's
a universal fact

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:56.320 align:middle line:84%
that we tend to anthropomorphize
using terms like sociopath

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:59.590 align:middle line:84%
and psychopath with respect to
the Jesuits, or any assassins,

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:02.250 align:middle line:84%
or people with these
malevolent behaviors,

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:04.830 align:middle line:84%
but the fact is they're
doing what they're coded for

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:09.020 align:middle line:84%
or what the behavior
from the playbook

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:10.659 align:middle line:84%
prescribes for them
in that moment.

00:26:10.659 --> 00:26:12.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Sure if
you've been ritually

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.825 align:middle line:84%
traumatized your whole life, and
your frontal lobe's shut down,

00:26:14.825 --> 00:26:17.440 align:middle line:84%
you don't have feelings
and compassion anymore,

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:21.100 align:middle line:84%
you start to-- by
creating a group identity

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:24.230 align:middle line:84%
that people latch on
to, they basically

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:26.540 align:middle line:90%
see that everybody else is bad.

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:28.540 align:middle line:84%
Everybody else is evil,
and we're the good ones,

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:29.920 align:middle line:90%
and we're saving humanity.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: Sure, well that's
why they have the missions,

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.249 align:middle line:84%
and that's why they
establish the colleges

00:26:33.249 --> 00:26:34.180 align:middle line:90%
and the universities.

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:38.650 align:middle line:84%
That's why they have all
these philanthropic events--

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:41.960 align:middle line:84%
to show their quote,
"good," end quote, side.

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:42.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and it works.

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:45.243 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So they do believe
that they are the good guys,

00:26:45.243 --> 00:26:48.020 align:middle line:84%
and that's how they're able
to keep their group in check

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:50.250 align:middle line:84%
and keep them
doing what they do.

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:54.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm excited to be
getting the truth out in a way

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:59.230 align:middle line:84%
like this because this is part
of helping people understand

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:02.070 align:middle line:90%
the truth in a safe manner.

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:05.460 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very frightening,
especially for somebody who's

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:09.970 align:middle line:84%
new to this to understand
that there is an organized

00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:14.920 align:middle line:84%
cult that's using black
magic and has basically,

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.944 align:middle line:84%
to a large degree, succeeded in
most of what they wanted to do.

00:27:17.944 --> 00:27:19.110 align:middle line:90%
>>GARNER: They're brilliant.

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:20.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: They've got control
of the financial system.

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:22.810 align:middle line:84%
They've got to
control of the media.

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:24.260 align:middle line:84%
Hollywood movies
are increasingly

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:27.100 align:middle line:90%
becoming propaganda.

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:30.460 align:middle line:84%
The music industry is
putting out propaganda,

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:34.985 align:middle line:84%
and yet as terrifying as it
looks and as close to the edge

00:27:34.985 --> 00:27:36.760 align:middle line:84%
as it looks, people
are waking up

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.960 align:middle line:90%
in staggeringly high numbers.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:42.050 align:middle line:84%
The truth is just
exploding, and what

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:45.780 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing now is,
I believe, the dawning

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:50.150 align:middle line:84%
of a totally new
renaissance, a new space

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:52.074 align:middle line:84%
age as this
classified technology

00:27:52.074 --> 00:27:54.240 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to be talking
about in other episodes

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.070 align:middle line:90%
becomes declassified.

00:27:56.070 --> 00:28:00.720 align:middle line:84%
The cabal is like the dragon
that's guarding the gold,

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:04.150 align:middle line:84%
and in the archetypes,
the dragon guards the gold

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:06.230 align:middle line:84%
and it also guards the
virgin and that represents

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:08.120 align:middle line:90%
the virginal awareness.

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:11.330 align:middle line:84%
So I do believe
that, in my view,

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:16.000 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing a metaphysical
puppet show of good and bad,

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.080 align:middle line:84%
but ultimately it
is the creator.

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:21.690 align:middle line:84%
It is god, and it's
for our evolution.

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:24.310 align:middle line:90%
The bad guy is allowed to exist.

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:27.860 align:middle line:84%
He's allowed to be the greatest
villain in human history,

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:29.780 align:middle line:84%
because if you want to
write a great story,

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:32.080 align:middle line:84%
you've got to have
a great villain.

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.994 align:middle line:84%
And we've got the
best villain ever.

00:28:33.994 --> 00:28:35.410 align:middle line:84%
What we're talking
about right now

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:39.570 align:middle line:84%
is the ultimate super villain,
the scariest, craziest,

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:41.290 align:middle line:84%
weirdest villain
you could imagine.

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:42.350 align:middle line:90%
>>GARNER: Human villain.

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:45.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: A human villain with
metaphysical connections.

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:48.410 align:middle line:84%
A cult-- Lucifer, Satan,
this kind of stuff

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:49.530 align:middle line:90%
is also involved in it.

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:50.405 align:middle line:90%
>>GARNER: Absolutely.

00:28:50.405 --> 00:28:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But the positive
side is there too,

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:55.930 align:middle line:84%
which is there are benevolent
forces in the universe,

00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:57.530 align:middle line:84%
and we've been
told that this was

00:28:57.530 --> 00:29:00.330 align:middle line:84%
going to happen in many ancient
cultural prophecies, not just

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:01.490 align:middle line:90%
the bible.

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:03.260 align:middle line:90%
And it is going to work out.

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:06.100 align:middle line:84%
These people are not
being allowed to succeed.

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:09.544 align:middle line:84%
There is a government
of celestial beings,

00:29:09.544 --> 00:29:10.960 align:middle line:84%
in my view, that's
preventing them

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.480 align:middle line:90%
from fully ever succeeding.

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: Well,
that's a good point,

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.390 align:middle line:84%
and let me get back to the
celestial-physical argument

00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:17.800 align:middle line:84%
because the universe itself
is not a system of entropy

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.990 align:middle line:84%
like we're taught here in
the sandbox physics, earth

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:21.300 align:middle line:90%
based science.

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.410 align:middle line:84%
It's a system of organization,
and all you got to do

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:27.910 align:middle line:84%
is look around-- an organization
of planets, specks of sand that

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:31.020 align:middle line:84%
get together and silica and
gold and silver and titanium.

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:32.700 align:middle line:84%
They get together
and form a planet.

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:34.210 align:middle line:90%
That's not chaos.

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:35.180 align:middle line:90%
That's not entropy.

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:36.870 align:middle line:84%
That's organization,
and then you

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:40.070 align:middle line:84%
have this system of
organization of living things.

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:41.190 align:middle line:90%
Life finds a way.

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:43.090 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't do that
through entropy.

00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:45.950 align:middle line:84%
It does that through a
system of organization

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:48.534 align:middle line:84%
and a benevolent organization,
what I would go out on the limb

00:29:48.534 --> 00:29:49.033 align:middle line:90%
and say.

00:29:49.033 --> 00:29:50.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: If you look
at complexity theory,

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:54.382 align:middle line:84%
when they model sand that's
actually forming a mountain--

00:29:54.382 --> 00:29:55.840 align:middle line:84%
that's one of the
simplest things--

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:56.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GARNER: Oh yeah, that's cool.

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:56.650 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:59.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: --like an hourglass,
when the system reaches

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:01.860 align:middle line:84%
a point of peak
instability, there

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:07.240 align:middle line:84%
is a sudden change that
leads to a new order, which

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:10.480 align:middle line:84%
sounds like new world order,
but in fact, the laws of nature

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.290 align:middle line:90%
do this benevolently.

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:13.470 align:middle line:90%
There is an avalanche.

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:15.150 align:middle line:84%
The sand pile goes
whoosh, but then it

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:17.362 align:middle line:84%
structures itself into a
higher organized sand pile.

00:30:17.362 --> 00:30:19.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: It finds another way,
just like life finds a way.

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:21.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And that's
why they're not

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:22.910 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to get a
global economic collapse.

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:25.118 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to be able
to tear everything down.

00:30:25.118 --> 00:30:28.650 align:middle line:84%
The harder they try, the more
it stimulates this new change

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:31.280 align:middle line:84%
to occur, which is going to
be benevolent and positive.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:34.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: Yes, also celestial
physically speaking,

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:36.900 align:middle line:84%
we've seen the largest
planetary alignment, at least

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:40.380 align:middle line:84%
in our known universe,
just a couple of years ago.

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:41.939 align:middle line:90%
It was around June of 2012.

00:30:41.939 --> 00:30:42.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:45.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GARNER: So we're getting
a huge amount-- or actually

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:49.080 align:middle line:84%
a huge decrease in
energies all over,

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:52.580 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's in
our favor, because we

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:54.430 align:middle line:84%
as the good guys, the
humans, we the people,

00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:56.888 align:middle line:84%
whoever, however you would you
like to label us good guys--

00:30:56.888 --> 00:31:01.710 align:middle line:84%
not the Jesuits-- don't have
the collective power to harness

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:06.080 align:middle line:84%
all that energy that would
be out there, but we do

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:10.770 align:middle line:84%
have the power to take it away
from the people, the Jesuits.

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't have those
peak power periods anymore,

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:18.630 align:middle line:84%
then they're going to have a
lot less energy to work with.

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:19.570 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: That's great.

00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:21.153 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's all the
time we have for.

00:31:21.153 --> 00:31:23.320 align:middle line:84%
It's been a real honor
to have you here.

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:24.760 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating conversation.

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:25.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GARNER: Thank you, David.

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:26.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And I want to
thank you for being here.

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:27.803 align:middle line:90%
>>GARNER: Oh, I appreciate that.

00:31:27.803 --> 00:31:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Thank you, Dean.

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:33.210 align:middle line:84%
I love the analogy
of complexity theory

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:37.100 align:middle line:84%
because it's not just the sand
pile that I was discussing.

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:39.850 align:middle line:10%
There's many, many
ways in which nature

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:43.490 align:middle line:10%
is built so that,
when any system is

00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:46.330 align:middle line:10%
at a peak of instability--
any complex system,

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:49.270 align:middle line:10%
meaning individual agents
with simple instructions that

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:50.920 align:middle line:10%
are interacting
with each other--

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:54.330 align:middle line:10%
when those systems move
into peak instability,

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:56.080 align:middle line:10%
guess what happens.

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:59.170 align:middle line:84%
Instead of failing,
they actually

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:02.610 align:middle line:84%
do experience a
reconstruction, and they

00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:05.970 align:middle line:84%
reorganize into a greater
level of intelligence

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:07.660 align:middle line:90%
and sophistication.

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:09.220 align:middle line:84%
That is why I do
not believe there's

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.310 align:middle line:84%
going to be a global
economic collapse.

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:12.760 align:middle line:84%
I do not believe
that we're going

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:15.660 align:middle line:84%
to see martial
law, prison camps,

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:19.300 align:middle line:84%
mass viruses that kill
a whole bunch of people.

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:22.360 align:middle line:84%
The laws of nature
itself are built

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:25.160 align:middle line:84%
to reorganize when
things get destabilized,

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.710 align:middle line:84%
and what I didn't
say on camera, is

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:30.110 align:middle line:84%
that single agents
within the system

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:32.000 align:middle line:84%
can turn the whole
system around.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.719 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the sand
pile, the calculations

00:32:34.719 --> 00:32:36.260 align:middle line:84%
that have been done
in supercomputers

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:39.220 align:middle line:84%
show that one
single grain of sand

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:43.260 align:middle line:84%
can be the determining factor
on which way the avalanche goes.

00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:45.850 align:middle line:84%
So the analogy for
what we're doing here

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:48.330 align:middle line:84%
is that even one
person like you,

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:49.960 align:middle line:84%
who's just been
exposed to the truth

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.980 align:middle line:84%
as I've shared it with you and
as Dean has shared it with you,

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:54.920 align:middle line:90%
can make a difference.

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.590 align:middle line:90%
You have the power.

00:32:56.590 --> 00:33:00.090 align:middle line:84%
It only takes one
person in the system

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:03.820 align:middle line:84%
to transform the system, and
best of all, the complexity

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:07.380 align:middle line:84%
theory research shows, with
supercomputers and fractals,

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:10.900 align:middle line:84%
it is absolutely impossible
to predict the outcome

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:12.470 align:middle line:90%
before it happens.

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:14.960 align:middle line:84%
This group has tried
to control the thing.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.000 align:middle line:84%
They've tried to
determine the outcome,

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.450 align:middle line:90%
but science is against them.

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:20.530 align:middle line:90%
They cannot control the outcome.

00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:24.560 align:middle line:84%
Any agent within the system
can steer the outcome,

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:27.510 align:middle line:84%
and if we live in a loving,
intelligent, conscious

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:30.420 align:middle line:84%
universe, then ultimately that
is going to be the bottom line.

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:33.290 align:middle line:84%
It's going to keep steering
us back towards love.

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:35.860 align:middle line:84%
So there's much more
information to be had.

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:39.880 align:middle line:84%
We are going through the
disclosure process on the show,

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:41.800 align:middle line:84%
and disclosure is a
lot more than what

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.090 align:middle line:90%
you might have thought.

00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:46.620 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot more to come up
ahead in future episodes here

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:49.920 align:middle line:84%
on "Disclosure,"
speaking truth to power

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:53.230 align:middle line:90%
and giving power to the truth.

00:33:53.230 --> 00:34:03.093 align:middle line:90%
