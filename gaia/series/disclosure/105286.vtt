00:00:08.415 --> 00:00:15.990 align:middle line:90%


00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.620 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to another
episode of "Disclosure."

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, David Wilcock,
and I think you're really going

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.480 align:middle line:90%
to be blown away by this one.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.050 align:middle line:10%
In the previous episode,
I tried to sketch out

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.400 align:middle line:10%
the sort of long term
history of what this group

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.590 align:middle line:10%
calls itself as the Illuminati.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.420 align:middle line:10%
Now, you'll notice that Dean
Garner doesn't want to touch

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.330 align:middle line:10%
that word with a 10-foot pole.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.510 align:middle line:10%
Anytime I mention it, he's
like no, no, no, no, no.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.070 align:middle line:10%
Jesuits.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.600 align:middle line:10%
Well, let's not
such a common term.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.300 align:middle line:10%
And I understand that
from his research,

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.246 align:middle line:10%
he wants to call it the
Jesuits, and I respect that,

00:00:47.246 --> 00:00:49.060 align:middle line:10%
so that's what I do
in the interview,

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.410 align:middle line:10%
but there are plenty
of whistle blowers

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.600 align:middle line:10%
from within this group who do
say that the group has called

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.230 align:middle line:10%
itself the Illuminati,
so I'm not going

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.900 align:middle line:10%
out on a limb by saying that.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:58.990 align:middle line:90%
Now.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough,
Garner's expertise

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.010 align:middle line:84%
is in the 1500s
and onward, where

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.970 align:middle line:84%
we start to see this group
reconsolidate its efforts.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.910 align:middle line:84%
They get invited back
into the Vatican.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.420 align:middle line:84%
They rebrand themselves,
first as the Black Robes.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.100 align:middle line:84%
That didn't sound too good.
Then they say, oh.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.840 align:middle line:90%
We're the Society of Jesus.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.180 align:middle line:90%
The Jesuits.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is kind
of hard to accept.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.870 align:middle line:84%
I understand that it sort
of requires you to break

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.710 align:middle line:84%
free from some of the
shackles of conditioning

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.840 align:middle line:90%
that's been held in your mind.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, the idea here is that,
well, if it's Christianity,

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.320 align:middle line:84%
how could that be bad.
Remember.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.910 align:middle line:84%
All these books were
written about the Jesuits,

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.860 align:middle line:84%
exposing them doing the
most horrendous stuff.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.190 align:middle line:90%
Raping people.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.950 align:middle line:90%
Sacrifices.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.730 align:middle line:84%
Rituals that are very much
not Christian in nature.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.350 align:middle line:84%
So the evidence has been
leaked over and over again.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And yet, because this same
group is still in power

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.300 align:middle line:84%
500 years later, you don't
hear about those whistleblower

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.560 align:middle line:90%
books that have been released.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.400 align:middle line:84%
So Dean starts to talk
about the four-part formula

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.780 align:middle line:84%
in our off-camera discussion
of how they have systematically

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.770 align:middle line:84%
gotten into different countries,
infiltrated, and taken over.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.940 align:middle line:84%
I summarize the
first three stages

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.940 align:middle line:84%
of that four-part
formula, and then

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.240 align:middle line:84%
have him go into the
last stage, normalizing.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.290 align:middle line:84%
This is a fascinating
discussion.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.440 align:middle line:84%
I think you're really
going to be quite amazed

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.140 align:middle line:90%
by what you're about to hear.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.852 align:middle line:90%
So let's check it out.

00:02:28.852 --> 00:02:29.710 align:middle line:90%
All right, Dean.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:30.440 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.340 align:middle line:84%
-Thanks very much, David.
-OK.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.680 align:middle line:84%
We got a very
intense formula here

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.930 align:middle line:84%
that we're discussing about how
these same usual suspects that

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.810 align:middle line:84%
keep showing up all over the
place throughout history,

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.400 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to build
a new world order,

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.130 align:middle line:90%
take over the planet.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.090 align:middle line:84%
You said they demoralize,
they destabilize,

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.531 align:middle line:84%
they create crisis, and
then they try to normalize.

00:02:55.531 --> 00:02:56.230 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.250 align:middle line:84%
So we discussed
demoralization, that

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.930 align:middle line:84%
they'll go after
somebody who's prominent

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.510 align:middle line:84%
and do a public hanging, or--
DEAN: Yes.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.890 align:middle line:84%
 --some big,
bloody, nasty murder.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:08.590 align:middle line:90%
Something.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.310 align:middle line:84%
It's to create the anxiety and
depression within, which makes

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.030 align:middle line:90%
the population more malleable.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.090 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.720 align:middle line:84%
Then destabilize
is where they use

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.470 align:middle line:84%
the momentum from that
event to create a larger

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.024 align:middle line:90%
breakdown in social order.

00:03:25.024 --> 00:03:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is obviously
something that goes

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.990 align:middle line:84%
on with a variety of plans.
-Yeah.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.350 align:middle line:84%
-It's not just one thing.
-Exactly.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.780 align:middle line:84%
Where they are
essentially just pitting

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.660 align:middle line:84%
one group against the other.
-Right.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.370 align:middle line:84%
-Democrats verses Republicans.
-Right.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.070 align:middle line:90%
As just a prime example.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, and, as I've always
said, the basic Democrat

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.320 align:middle line:84%
versus Republican paradigm
is town versus country.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.020 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.350 align:middle line:84%
Democrats are more
apt to live in a city.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.700 align:middle line:10%
They're more used to
being around other people.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.630 align:middle line:84%
Republicans are more apt
to live in the country.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.720 align:middle line:84%
They're very into
self-sufficiency.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.470 align:middle line:84%
They typically are
more religious,

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.920 align:middle line:84%
they have a more
traditional viewpoint,

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.440 align:middle line:84%
and they play off of
those differences.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.380 align:middle line:84%
So this is not, like,
a single formula that

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.330 align:middle line:90%
involves one set of actions.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.310 align:middle line:90%
This is a prolonged plan.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.050 align:middle line:84%
So the demoralize
plan is going to have

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.791 align:middle line:84%
multiple stages, multiple acts
that just knock people down.

00:04:11.791 --> 00:04:12.490 align:middle line:90%
DEAN: Correct.

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about
movies that are using

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:16.919 align:middle line:90%
old characters that were--

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:17.720 align:middle line:90%
DEAN: Yes.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.430 align:middle line:84%
They used to be
nice, and now they're

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.579 align:middle line:90%
getting weirder and weirder.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.035 align:middle line:84%
Then, with destabilization,
you destabilize the economy,

00:04:25.035 --> 00:04:27.600 align:middle line:90%
you destabilize the food supply.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.670 align:middle line:84%
You basically create
a lack of safety.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:32.580 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.780 align:middle line:90%
And then crisis.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And the crisis is something
where you've now deliberately

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.690 align:middle line:84%
created that set of conditions,
and you-- obviously, the crisis

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.420 align:middle line:84%
is a manufactured crisis.
Right?

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.201 align:middle line:10%
When you create the
problem-reaction-solution

00:04:49.201 --> 00:04:50.250 align:middle line:10%
scenario.
-Right.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.390 align:middle line:10%
But they're all manufactured.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.250 align:middle line:10%
So the problem is, could
be a false flag attack.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.700 align:middle line:10%
And so the-- the problem there.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.930 align:middle line:10%
And then we have the reaction
by the public, the good people.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.210 align:middle line:90%
And it's more of a cry for help.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And of course, then they swoop
in with a so-called solution

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.780 align:middle line:84%
at the end, which
ends up subjugating

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.167 align:middle line:90%
the universal rights.

00:05:11.167 --> 00:05:13.100 align:middle line:84%
You know, let's forget about
the US constitutional rights.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.080 align:middle line:84%
It's a dead letter right now.
-Yeah.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.120 align:middle line:84%
So it ends up subjugating
the rights of all people,

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.720 align:middle line:84%
and they end up losing just by
crying out for help in the end.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.630 align:middle line:90%
So problem-reaction-solution.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.730 align:middle line:84%
If you've spent time reading
about and analyzing conspiracy,

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:30.790 align:middle line:90%
you've seen that before.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.000 align:middle line:84%
So the subheading of
problem-reaction-solution

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.090 align:middle line:84%
is within the category of
what you're calling crisis.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.870 align:middle line:90%
DEAN: The crisis, yes.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:37.890 align:middle line:90%
Creating crisis.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.880 align:middle line:84%
So they manufacture
the problem, they

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.870 align:middle line:84%
look at what kind of
a reaction they get,

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.530 align:middle line:84%
and then the solution comes
out and the people say,

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:49.840 align:middle line:90%
oh, this is what we want.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.411 align:middle line:84%
We want you to
take our guns away.

00:05:51.411 --> 00:05:52.110 align:middle line:90%
DEAN: Exactly.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Because we can't trust
those people with guns.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.905 align:middle line:84%
When, in fact,
they're the ones that

00:05:56.905 --> 00:05:58.280 align:middle line:90%
set this up in the first place.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.000 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.170 align:middle line:84%
Or the classic case
would be the Patriot Act.

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.450 align:middle line:84%
This thing, this, like,
5 inches tall of paper.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.691 align:middle line:84%
And right after 9/11,
they railroad it through.

00:06:08.691 --> 00:06:09.390 align:middle line:90%
DEAN: Sure.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And the only two senators that
didn't support the Patriot Act

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.820 align:middle line:84%
got anthrax mailed to
them, and the anthrax came

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.550 align:middle line:90%
from Fort Detrick, Maryland.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.410 align:middle line:84%
US military manufacturing
chemical weapons.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:21.180 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:26.770 align:middle line:84%
So you know what you want,
and then you manufacture

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.390 align:middle line:84%
a crisis to get that goal.
-Yes.

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And what we didn't
talk about is normalize.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Normalization of the
population, which is actually

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:40.950 align:middle line:84%
bringing a now malleable and
plastic population in the fold,

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:43.940 align:middle line:84%
into the fold under
their full control.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.050 align:middle line:84%
That's the end game--
-OK.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:48.030 align:middle line:84%
 --regarding that
four-step scenario.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And, by the way,
the Jesuits have

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.220 align:middle line:84%
been using that
four-step scenario

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.830 align:middle line:90%
in every single country.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a great formula
that works perfectly.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.510 align:middle line:84%
So I would agree
that you can see

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:02.880 align:middle line:84%
many, many examples of the
same type of false flag

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.810 align:middle line:90%
behavior being used.

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And a case would be
that there's typically

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:10.820 align:middle line:90%
a spark that starts a war.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.090 align:middle line:84%
So you have the sinking of
the "Lusitania" that starts

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:14.850 align:middle line:90%
the Spanish-American War.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.500 align:middle line:84%
You have the assassination
of Archduke Franz Ferdinand

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.464 align:middle line:90%
that starts World War I.

00:07:18.464 --> 00:07:19.530 align:middle line:90%
DEAN: World War I. That's right.

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:20.852 align:middle line:84%
You have the bombing
from Pearl Harbor

00:07:20.852 --> 00:07:22.270 align:middle line:84%
that starts World
War II, at least

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:23.685 align:middle line:84%
America's involvement in it.
DEAN: Exactly.

00:07:23.685 --> 00:07:24.385 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:07:24.385 --> 00:07:27.260 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: And Hitler's starting
World War II in Europe

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.910 align:middle line:84%
was the invasion of Poland,
in which they manufactured

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.140 align:middle line:84%
39 false flag events,
attacked their own country,

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.290 align:middle line:84%
blamed it on Poland,
and that all came

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:36.360 align:middle line:90%
out in the Nuremberg trials.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.090 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Including the Gleiwitz
incident, where he actually

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.050 align:middle line:90%
blew up his own radio station.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.550 align:middle line:84%
The one that is still
being argued about

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:48.910 align:middle line:84%
and hasn't become
a common consensus

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:50.360 align:middle line:84%
is the idea that
he actually blew

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.420 align:middle line:90%
up his own parliament building.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.020 align:middle line:84%
But there is actually
some very good testimony

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.090 align:middle line:84%
that's now come out
of people that said,

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:59.500 align:middle line:84%
yes, that was a false flag.
-Yes.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.560 align:middle line:84%
You know, you can even
take that further back,

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.400 align:middle line:84%
and this has everything
to do with America

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.900 align:middle line:84%
nowadays, because remember,
the Weimar Republic.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.870 align:middle line:90%
It collapsed in 1923.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:09.410 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: Weimar Republic, Germany.
DEAN: In Germany.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:10.180 align:middle line:10%
Exactly.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.290 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing
almost the same things

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.110 align:middle line:84%
to the letter, the same
actions, behaviors, and events,

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:16.040 align:middle line:90%
occurring now.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.740 align:middle line:84%
So there's a tried and true
formula that the Jesuits

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:19.600 align:middle line:90%
have used elsewhere.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.790 align:middle line:84%
Are there other examples
of this besides--

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:23.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Weimar, Germany--
DEAN: Yes.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, people who want to read
about that, even a little,

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.020 align:middle line:84%
just go to a Ferguson's
book, "When Money Dies."

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.360 align:middle line:84%
It's an obscure book,
but it'll give you

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.820 align:middle line:84%
a clue about what has
happened, and what is happening

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.750 align:middle line:90%
right now here in America.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And if we ignore
that kind of history,

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.700 align:middle line:90%
then we are repeating it.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:44.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, Weimar Republic-- I'm
sure most people know this,

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.310 align:middle line:90%
but some people might not.

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:50.190 align:middle line:84%
I heard a story from someone
who was there who actually said

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:53.480 align:middle line:84%
that there was a case
where a child had brought

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.091 align:middle line:84%
a basket of money to town.
-Yes.

00:08:55.091 --> 00:08:58.510 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
10 trillion marks, notes.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And the basket was stolen
when the child turned his back,

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.150 align:middle line:84%
but the money was
left on the street.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:04.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, people were using
it to sandpaper things,

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:10.780 align:middle line:84%
and as wallpaper in
their apartments.

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:11.690 align:middle line:84%
-Toilet paper.
-Yeah.

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:12.389 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:15.161 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was because of
that severe hyperinflation.

00:09:15.161 --> 00:09:15.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.626 align:middle line:84%
And we see the same thing
with the French Revolution,

00:09:17.626 --> 00:09:18.740 align:middle line:84%
as I was saying before.
DEAN: Yes.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.680 align:middle line:84%
Exactly.
-They create a food crisis.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.010 align:middle line:90%
They blame it on the people.

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:23.590 align:middle line:90%
The people are being terrorists.

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:25.331 align:middle line:84%
And now we gotta fight
terror with terror.

00:09:25.331 --> 00:09:28.014 align:middle line:84%
DEAN: Yes.
-We gotta have a bigger mallet.

00:09:28.014 --> 00:09:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And that actually brings
up another point that we

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.660 align:middle line:90%
talked about previously.

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:36.850 align:middle line:84%
I contend that negative
or morally negative

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:40.020 align:middle line:84%
events carry more
universal energy--

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.070 align:middle line:90%
and I'm talking about energy.

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:43.740 align:middle line:84%
You can measure it in
joules-- real energy

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:45.390 align:middle line:90%
than positive events.

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And so you can take a lot
of these negative events

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.430 align:middle line:90%
and say, OK, how do we fight it.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have to do it
probably with some kind

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:55.000 align:middle line:90%
of morally negative energy.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.670 align:middle line:84%
Either that or what
you had suggested,

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:58.890 align:middle line:84%
and what you and I've
talked about in the past,

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:02.150 align:middle line:84%
is get enough people around, get
them beyond a certain tipping

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:05.790 align:middle line:84%
point, such that this
mass consciousness

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:09.910 align:middle line:84%
of positive moral energy,
that usurps the negative.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:10.810 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:15.020 align:middle line:84%
I definitely feel that we
don't need to try to balance

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.140 align:middle line:90%
negative with negative.

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.800 align:middle line:84%
There is a point,
though, at which,

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.150 align:middle line:84%
if there is not
going to be some sort

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:25.330 align:middle line:84%
of crazy divine intervention
scenario, which could happen--

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:26.470 align:middle line:90%
DEAN: I pray for that.

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:28.630 align:middle line:90%
 --power must counteract power.

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:29.330 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have to
have sufficient power,

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:33.420 align:middle line:84%
and it has to do with
that certain magnitude

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:34.860 align:middle line:90%
of universal energy.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very real entity,
the energy I speak of.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:37.740 align:middle line:90%
DAVID: Sure.

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.360 align:middle line:84%
It's not that woo woo new age
energy that people who don't

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.650 align:middle line:84%
know what they're talking
about, respectfully,

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:45.410 align:middle line:84%
but it's a real physical,
universal energy.

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:47.710 align:middle line:84%
But-- and I would
agree with you, also,

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:51.850 align:middle line:84%
that if someone
goes through trauma,

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:57.010 align:middle line:84%
they can be given the raw
kinetic energy that leads

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:59.010 align:middle line:90%
to consciousness advancement.

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:02.770 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you look at where are
the super psychics coming from.

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:04.810 align:middle line:84%
They're coming from some of
the most impoverished places

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:09.890 align:middle line:84%
on earth, like China and central
Russia, where they really

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:12.020 align:middle line:84%
hardly have any food,
and they're constantly

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.710 align:middle line:90%
in fear for their lives.

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's in that
environment of great stress

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.030 align:middle line:84%
that the soul cries
out for innovation.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, that power, that
energy is enough to power

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.170 align:middle line:90%
a positive act.

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:24.970 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
Absolutely.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And so I did not mean to--
maybe I misspoke before.

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:29.780 align:middle line:84%
But you don't necessarily
have to create

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:30.820 align:middle line:90%
your own negative energy.

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.230 align:middle line:84%
You can actually use
the bad guys' energy

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:35.350 align:middle line:90%
to create a new power source.

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:36.900 align:middle line:84%
A positive power source.
-Sure.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening
now is that they

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:49.100 align:middle line:84%
are so desperate to maintain
their agenda that they have

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.440 align:middle line:84%
to push much harder to try to
get the same results that they

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.140 align:middle line:90%
used to get.

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.470 align:middle line:84%
This formula that
we were talking

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.370 align:middle line:84%
about-- the four-part
formula doesn't work anymore.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:57.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, it still does,
but not as much.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:58.910 align:middle line:90%
Not anywhere near as much.

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Because the populations,
because of the Iron Age,

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:06.560 align:middle line:84%
and then the tech age, the high
tech, people have habituated to

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.930 align:middle line:84%
and gotten used to, and
just sort of like a bacteria

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.691 align:middle line:84%
getting used to
antibacterial cream.

00:12:12.691 --> 00:12:13.570 align:middle line:84%
-Absolutely.
-Something like that.

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:14.690 align:middle line:90%
It's exactly like that.

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:17.270 align:middle line:84%
They habituated to it
chemically and physically,

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:18.930 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, you
either pile on more

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:21.615 align:middle line:84%
of the same, or reinvent
something that's entirely new.

00:12:21.615 --> 00:12:24.930 align:middle line:84%
A new drug that
subjugates the population.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:25.790 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:30.050 align:middle line:84%
First of all we're saying that
the Jesuits were essentially

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:32.080 align:middle line:84%
the Society of
Jesus, which you said

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.110 align:middle line:90%
was originally the Black Robes.

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:37.210 align:middle line:84%
That was a name
given by the elite

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:41.540 align:middle line:84%
to their own elite society,
their own power militant group

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:42.680 align:middle line:84%
that they had created.
Right?

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:43.890 align:middle line:84%
There was one of
their offshoots,

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:45.970 align:middle line:84%
their advertising,
marketing, PR that came

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:47.640 align:middle line:84%
up with a really cool name.
DAVID: Right.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:48.440 align:middle line:90%
Society of Jesus.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.600 align:middle line:90%
DAVID: It's great branding.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.960 align:middle line:90%
It's a fantastic one.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And I like poking
fun a little bit.

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:55.681 align:middle line:84%
Instead of just calling it
Jesuits, I call it G Suits.

00:12:55.681 --> 00:12:56.900 align:middle line:84%
The G Suits.
DAVID: The G Suits.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.850 align:middle line:84%
The analogy from the G-Suit
you wear as a fighter pilot

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:02.920 align:middle line:90%
to restrict the flow of blood.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.390 align:middle line:84%
So these, you said
that they came from,

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:07.250 align:middle line:84%
that they were
basically financed

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:09.090 align:middle line:84%
by the people with
deep pockets from

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:11.300 align:middle line:84%
Spanish and Italian nobility.
DEAN: Absolutely.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.330 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, a lot
of the wealth that

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.890 align:middle line:84%
was coming in from the spice
trade and from the New World,

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:16.780 align:middle line:90%
as we said.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's also, the Vatican
itself had a vast wealth.

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:21.650 align:middle line:84%
It was the largest--
it was the largest

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:23.316 align:middle line:84%
economy in the planet itself.
-Well, yeah.

00:13:23.316 --> 00:13:24.810 align:middle line:84%
But these guys
invaded the Vatican.

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:26.260 align:middle line:84%
They didn't start
out in the Vatican.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.080 align:middle line:90%
No, not all.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:27.850 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:28.800 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.047 align:middle line:84%
You said you're focusing
on your 1540, your 1530.

00:13:32.047 --> 00:13:32.780 align:middle line:90%
DEAN: About that, yes.

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:33.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:34.677 align:middle line:90%
1534.

00:13:34.677 --> 00:13:36.010 align:middle line:84%
Because remember,
there's a continuity.

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:38.891 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't-- the Jesuits didn't
just pop up out of nowhere.

00:13:38.891 --> 00:13:40.289 align:middle line:84%
There were folks--
-All right.

00:13:40.289 --> 00:13:42.080 align:middle line:84%
So since this is totally
suppressed history,

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.670 align:middle line:84%
and I wasn't familiar with
it until I heard your show

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.610 align:middle line:84%
and I want to hear more
than I heard in your show,

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:49.190 align:middle line:90%
let's talk about what happens.

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:53.830 align:middle line:84%
So how long does it take from
the build up to the Jesuits,

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:55.500 align:middle line:84%
or you're saying
they just rebranded

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.600 align:middle line:84%
something they'd been doing for
hundreds and hundreds of years.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.020 align:middle line:84%
DEAN: That's my contention, yes.
-OK.

00:13:59.020 --> 00:13:59.920 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
Absolutely.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.351 align:middle line:84%
So this is a long term goal
towards a new world order.

00:14:02.351 --> 00:14:03.050 align:middle line:90%
DEAN: Absolutely.

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:05.630 align:middle line:84%
They gotta go after the power
center, which is the Vatican.

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:08.670 align:middle line:84%
That's where all the wealth
in the world is concentrated.

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:10.740 align:middle line:90%
The primary concentrate.

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:14.400 align:middle line:84%
Because the Vatican is just
this vast, vast powerful entity,

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.970 align:middle line:84%
because it is essentially
the Roman Empire,

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:19.490 align:middle line:90%
but given a religious face.

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:20.340 align:middle line:90%
DEAN: Yes.

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:21.180 align:middle line:90%
A very public face.

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.430 align:middle line:84%
So it's the spiritual
and temporal power

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:25.230 align:middle line:90%
of the Roman Empire.

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:25.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:30.230 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, around
1540, the Jesuits

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:34.870 align:middle line:84%
had infiltrated the Vatican, and
they came up with a new plan,

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:36.640 align:middle line:90%
being confessors.

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:40.550 align:middle line:84%
That is, they would infiltrate
not simply the Vatican--

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:42.200 align:middle line:84%
this is sort of a
generalization--

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.560 align:middle line:90%
any kind of government power.

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.000 align:middle line:90%
Power in any country.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And they would become
the confessor, which

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:51.570 align:middle line:84%
means that they learned every
single bit of information

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:55.200 align:middle line:84%
from any leader
anywhere in the world.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.520 align:middle line:90%
DAVID: What if I say F you guys.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.030 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to go to confession

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:01.620 align:middle line:84%
DEAN: That doesn't happen,
because they would be coerced,

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:05.040 align:middle line:84%
they would be threatened,
and ultimately murdered,

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.557 align:middle line:90%
and then simply replaced.

00:15:06.557 --> 00:15:07.390 align:middle line:90%
That's easy enough to do.

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:08.980 align:middle line:84%
So this is like
original NSA, right?

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:10.000 align:middle line:90%
DEAN: Yes, absolutely.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has to say all
of their darkest stuff

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:17.300 align:middle line:84%
to the priest in
confessional, and that's

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.181 align:middle line:84%
the original
intelligence agency.

00:15:19.181 --> 00:15:19.880 align:middle line:90%
DEAN: Exactly.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:23.100 align:middle line:84%
That's scooping up all the
intel, figuring out who can we

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:26.720 align:middle line:84%
blackmail, who can we bribe,
whose wife is beating them

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:31.040 align:middle line:84%
up at night and, you know, can
we turn the screws on this guy.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.007 align:middle line:84%
What can we do?
-Yes.

00:15:32.007 --> 00:15:33.140 align:middle line:84%
They learn everything
so that they

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:34.750 align:middle line:90%
can essentially just blackmail.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And if you're a
sociopath, right?

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:41.640 align:middle line:84%
If you're a violent sociopath
and you're capable of killing,

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:45.630 align:middle line:84%
and you go into confession
and you say, I saw this dog,

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:50.090 align:middle line:84%
and I freaking ripped it apart,
I just tore its legs off, oh.

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:51.071 align:middle line:84%
We got one here.
DEAN: Yes.

00:15:51.071 --> 00:15:51.770 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:53.380 align:middle line:84%
DEAN: And then
they could actually

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:56.050 align:middle line:84%
recruit that person,
because he or she-- well,

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:59.450 align:middle line:84%
he, mostly-- would have a
desirable characteristic

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:02.530 align:middle line:84%
they could use against the
rest of the population.

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:06.180 align:middle line:84%
They recruit by knowing
everything, every single item,

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:08.590 align:middle line:84%
every psychological,
every physiological,

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:11.410 align:middle line:84%
every anatomical item
about the human beings

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:13.220 align:middle line:90%
in every single country.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And so they can manipulate
them in any way they want.

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:20.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's not forget
that, if the Jesuits,

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:25.940 align:middle line:84%
if one arm of the octopus, one
tentacle is the confessional,

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.420 align:middle line:84%
and then another tentacle
later on is that they start

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.830 align:middle line:84%
an organization
called freemasonry,

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:33.280 align:middle line:84%
somebody comes up you
seemingly nonchalantly says,

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.020 align:middle line:84%
hey, I'm in this really
cool, amazing thing.

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:37.300 align:middle line:90%
It's secret.

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.410 align:middle line:84%
But if I bring you in, you're
gonna be able to get wealthy,

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:42.790 align:middle line:84%
and we'll give you
all this power.

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:44.980 align:middle line:84%
Little do you know
that they have

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:47.980 align:middle line:84%
the intel in the
secret society that you

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.630 align:middle line:84%
gave in the confession box.
-Sure.

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:52.390 align:middle line:84%
So you actually just
become a pawn of theirs.

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:53.210 align:middle line:90%
That's incredible.

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And what's fascinating is that
the mobsters, again, it doesn't

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:59.210 align:middle line:84%
matter how smart they are,
how much money they have,

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:01.520 align:middle line:84%
how better or how
educated they are.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.360 align:middle line:84%
These mobsters will
go after that power.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.890 align:middle line:10%
They thirst for it,
or the limelight.

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:08.829 align:middle line:84%
So that's how they
are kept there

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:12.400 align:middle line:84%
in those positions of power, and
know that they're being bribed,

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.750 align:middle line:84%
and will still stay there
and play along with the game.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:19.650 align:middle line:84%
I think you gotta look at this
as organized crime where you

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:25.270 align:middle line:84%
have sociopathic groups in
which the members of the groups

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:28.020 align:middle line:84%
are systematically
tortured and violated

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:32.240 align:middle line:84%
beyond all human comprehension
from a very young age.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:38.030 align:middle line:84%
They grow up so traumatized,
that they have a great deal

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:41.030 align:middle line:84%
of work to go through
to ever be able to see

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:43.570 align:middle line:84%
other people in a loving way.
-Absolutely.

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:46.250 align:middle line:84%
If you've been tortured--
I mean, you know about this.

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:48.039 align:middle line:84%
The Spanish Inquisition.
DEAN: Yes.

00:17:48.039 --> 00:17:50.650 align:middle line:84%
The torture research has
shown, every human being

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:51.930 align:middle line:90%
can be broken.

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:55.560 align:middle line:84%
No one will stay positive and
loving past a certain point.

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.320 align:middle line:84%
Everyone can be turned
into a violent criminal

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.319 align:middle line:84%
if you torture them enough.
-Sure.

00:18:00.319 --> 00:18:02.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you change if you
change a person's behavior,

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:03.840 align:middle line:84%
then you can change
their neurochemistry.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And if you change
their neurochemistry,

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.550 align:middle line:84%
you can change their
neuroanatomy, which means,

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:09.560 align:middle line:84%
in reverse, you change
the neurochemistry

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.610 align:middle line:84%
again, which is a new,
undesirable neurochemistry.

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And then, beyond that,
there's the behavior--

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:17.000 align:middle line:84%
the resultant
behavior-- which is

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.531 align:middle line:84%
sociopathic, or psychopathic,
or anxious, or depressed.

00:18:21.531 --> 00:18:22.230 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And we know from the
MRI scans of psychopaths

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.570 align:middle line:84%
that their whole
frontal lobe shuts down.

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:31.130 align:middle line:84%
There's all this darkness here
that normally would be here.

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is emotions, and
compassion, and sensitivity.

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:34.970 align:middle line:90%
And it goes even beyond that.

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:38.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can change
a person's DNA makeup.

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:40.061 align:middle line:84%
You don't hear that
in modern science.

00:18:40.061 --> 00:18:40.760 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you what.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.410 align:middle line:84%
You can change
the makeup of DNA,

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:46.511 align:middle line:84%
the chemical components of
it, the molecular components.

00:18:46.511 --> 00:18:47.210 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah.

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:50.620 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just saying that even
mainstream psychologists are

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:53.700 align:middle line:84%
saying that the brain
scan of a psychopath

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:54.740 align:middle line:90%
is totally different.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:55.480 align:middle line:90%
DEAN: Yes, it is.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's a weakness,
because there's

00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:59.380 align:middle line:84%
a whole part of the
brain that normal people

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:01.000 align:middle line:84%
that are not
psychopathic would have

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.340 align:middle line:90%
that they don't even access.

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:03.050 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't come on.

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:03.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:05.730 align:middle line:84%
Psychopaths cannot access
certain parts of the brain,

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:08.460 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, they are not
functional members of society

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:10.770 align:middle line:84%
in general, or they cannot
be, at least to the extent

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:13.300 align:middle line:90%
that folks like you and I are.

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:17.230 align:middle line:84%
How the heck did these
people infiltrate the most

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:19.630 align:middle line:90%
powerful organization on Earth?

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:23.320 align:middle line:84%
They've-- they would have
limitless military capability,

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.950 align:middle line:84%
you would think,
with all that money.

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:26.860 align:middle line:84%
How the hell did these
guys get in there?

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:29.250 align:middle line:84%
They were brought into
by law in the Vatican.

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:32.030 align:middle line:84%
So they were brought
into by papal bull.

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:35.470 align:middle line:84%
So they were already brought
in to the Vatican, the highest

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:38.190 align:middle line:84%
level, which makes me wonder--
and I haven't studied this

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:42.450 align:middle line:84%
extensively-- that
a precursor to them

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:43.880 align:middle line:84%
had already planned
this, because it

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.780 align:middle line:84%
can't just happen all at
once, or within the span

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:46.670 align:middle line:90%
of a few years.

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:49.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, that would make sense,
because the whole working

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.890 align:middle line:84%
hypothesis that
we've been discussing

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:53.920 align:middle line:84%
is that it's just
the Roman Empire.

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:54.750 align:middle line:90%
It's like I said.

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:55.580 align:middle line:90%
All roads lead to Rome.

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:56.880 align:middle line:84%
And they have for
the past 2,000 years.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:57.760 align:middle line:90%
DAVID: Yeah.

00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:58.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:06.640 align:middle line:84%
So then we could argue that
the Templar insurgency was

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.450 align:middle line:84%
that the Roman Empire,
through the Vatican,

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:13.730 align:middle line:84%
had created soldiers to
protect people on the Crusades.

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:16.270 align:middle line:84%
The soldiers did not
have to pay taxes,

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:18.740 align:middle line:84%
they could cross
borders without papers,

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:20.451 align:middle line:84%
and they built their
own central bank.

00:20:20.451 --> 00:20:21.150 align:middle line:90%
DEAN: Yes.

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:23.460 align:middle line:84%
So then those people
rebelled against the Vatican,

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:26.080 align:middle line:90%
formed a separate faction.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:29.100 align:middle line:84%
The Pope and the King of
France turned against them,

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:30.700 align:middle line:84%
purged a bunch of them,
killed a bunch of them.

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:32.550 align:middle line:90%
They all scatter to the winds.

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And my insiders have
told me-- because I had

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.300 align:middle line:84%
this whole theory for a while--
DEAN: Yes.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:37.130 align:middle line:84%
I know.
Yeah.

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:39.540 align:middle line:84%
 --that the Templars
stayed a separate

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:41.610 align:middle line:90%
faction and never reunited.

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:43.870 align:middle line:84%
What I heard from my
insiders was that they worked

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:45.810 align:middle line:90%
out a business deal later on.

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:48.570 align:middle line:84%
Even though the Templars
had originally rebelled,

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:50.810 align:middle line:84%
they were welcomed back
in once they had built

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:52.470 align:middle line:84%
their own infrastructure--
-Exactly.

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:54.090 align:middle line:84%
 --combining forces
for the greater

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:55.750 align:middle line:90%
good of this new world order.

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:57.460 align:middle line:84%
They worked out their
differences well enough

00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:58.500 align:middle line:90%
that they could get along.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:03.200 align:middle line:84%
See, the Vatican had sort of
strayed from the seat of power,

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.101 align:middle line:84%
from the precursors
to the Jesuits.

00:21:05.101 --> 00:21:05.800 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.720 align:middle line:84%
By the 1500s, the Holy
Roman Empire is crumbling.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:08.420 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:10.420 align:middle line:90%
So the Jesuits were emplaced.

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:11.590 align:middle line:90%
My hypothesis.

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:14.270 align:middle line:84%
The Jesuits were emplaced to
bring them back into the fold.

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:16.860 align:middle line:90%
To normalize the Vatican.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:20.180 align:middle line:84%
So the Society of
Jesus, the Black Robes

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:21.710 align:middle line:84%
was something that
had originally

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:23.180 align:middle line:90%
been built outside the Vatican.

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:23.880 align:middle line:90%
DEAN: Oh yes.

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.030 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they beta tested it.
DEAN: Yes.

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:28.650 align:middle line:84%
So what was that early
beta phase before it got

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:30.300 align:middle line:84%
incorporated into the Vatican?
What were they doing?

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:31.655 align:middle line:84%
That goes outside
my area of expertise,

00:21:31.655 --> 00:21:34.661 align:middle line:84%
because I started
around 1530, 1540.

00:21:34.661 --> 00:21:37.560 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: OK.
-I just have anecdotal evidence.

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.470 align:middle line:84%
So it's possible--
DEAN: Yes.

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:42.540 align:middle line:84%
 --that the people who split
off and were the Templars,

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:46.860 align:middle line:84%
and spent 200 years perfecting
their method eventually came

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:48.350 align:middle line:90%
back to their home countries.

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:49.150 align:middle line:90%
Spain and Italy.

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:49.950 align:middle line:90%
It's not just possible.

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:51.140 align:middle line:90%
I think it's highly plausible.

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:51.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:52.650 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:53.410 align:middle line:90%
So they came back.

00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And my insider testimony
would confirm that.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:58.620 align:middle line:84%
So they came back to
where they started.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.810 align:middle line:84%
They left Scotland
or some of them

00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:03.310 align:middle line:84%
probably were still in Scotland,
and Portugal, whatever.

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:05.500 align:middle line:84%
They come back to
Spain and Italy,

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:08.871 align:middle line:84%
and they've got this
long-term lineage.

00:22:08.871 --> 00:22:09.570 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:11.136 align:middle line:84%
Well, they take people
from the same bloodline.

00:22:11.136 --> 00:22:13.160 align:middle line:84%
That's where Loyola came from.
-OK.

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:13.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:16.160 align:middle line:84%
So they recruited him
from a very young age

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.840 align:middle line:84%
and groomed him all along.
-Right.

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And as we said-- I think we
said in previous episode,

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:25.720 align:middle line:84%
one of my main insiders told
me that, although most of us

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:28.750 align:middle line:84%
here on Earth all have some
degree of extraterrestrial DNA,

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:30.410 align:middle line:84%
that the Jesuits
in particular have

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:32.950 align:middle line:84%
25% extraterrestrial
DNA, which is higher

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:34.040 align:middle line:90%
than anybody else on Earth.

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:36.040 align:middle line:84%
Again, we have to be careful
about when we're using

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:38.620 align:middle line:84%
any kind of math with that,
because if we talk about, say,

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:42.950 align:middle line:84%
25% ET DNA today, in 50
years, that will be diluted

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:45.750 align:middle line:90%
if they're mating with humans.

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:46.500 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.980 align:middle line:84%
100 years ago, or say,
maybe 500 years ago,

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:52.390 align:middle line:84%
maybe if it were 25% and they
were mating with Earth humans,

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:54.960 align:middle line:84%
then that'd be
highly diluted today.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, and let's also
be clear on this.

00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:58.550 align:middle line:84%
You say a term like
mating with humans.

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:01.420 align:middle line:84%
I just want to be
really clear on camera.

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:04.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that these people
are reptilian shape shifters.

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:05.930 align:middle line:90%
DEAN: Yes.

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:07.140 align:middle line:90%
I do not.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:12.370 align:middle line:84%
We're dealing with what started
out as a race of white skinned,

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:15.990 align:middle line:84%
red haired giant people,
and over time, their height

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:17.580 align:middle line:84%
goes down, but
they're not reptiles,

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:19.220 align:middle line:90%
they're not shape shifters.

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.580 align:middle line:84%
They're human
like, and I believe

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:24.141 align:middle line:84%
humanity is actually much bigger
than just what's on Earth.

00:23:24.141 --> 00:23:25.880 align:middle line:84%
DEAN: Of course.
-But they were immigrants.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.091 align:middle line:84%
They did not evolve
on Earth, per se.

00:23:28.091 --> 00:23:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
I have a hypothesis about that.

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:31.940 align:middle line:84%
It extends your thought
about that, too.

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:32.640 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:36.120 align:middle line:84%
I think that there was
further ET intervention,

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:37.950 align:middle line:84%
molecular biology--
I mean, really

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:42.500 align:middle line:84%
fancy molecular biology--
that took those giants

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:46.690 align:middle line:84%
and manipulated their DNA, and
then created what we see today

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:49.701 align:middle line:84%
is normal Homo sapiens.
-Yeah.

00:23:49.701 --> 00:23:51.060 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
That's--

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Because it's just
not enough time

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:58.380 align:middle line:84%
for evolution to have
gone from 12-foot beings,

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:00.571 align:middle line:84%
these big cannibals,
to what we see today.

00:24:00.571 --> 00:24:02.410 align:middle line:84%
-Sure.
-It's just not plausible.

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:05.060 align:middle line:84%
So there had to
be, my hypothesis,

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:09.030 align:middle line:84%
a molecular intervention.
-Yeah.

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:10.380 align:middle line:90%
I would agree with that.

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:12.930 align:middle line:84%
Genetic engineering
that sort of

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:16.490 align:middle line:84%
filled that huge gap in
the, quote, "fossil record,"

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:18.610 align:middle line:84%
end quote.
-OK.

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:22.110 align:middle line:84%
So I just-- I'm not trying
to belabor the point here,

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:24.370 align:middle line:84%
but I want to make sure
that we really cover this.

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:29.410 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying the
Jesuits were invited

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:31.560 align:middle line:90%
in to the Vatican in 1540?

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:32.400 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk a little bit.

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.490 align:middle line:90%
They were emplaced.

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:36.150 align:middle line:84%
They were emplaced by
the previous power.

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:40.011 align:middle line:84%
Whoever was or whatever was
the precursor to the Jesuits.

00:24:40.011 --> 00:24:40.840 align:middle line:84%
OK.
It's

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.630 align:middle line:84%
A long, continuous line.
Now, somewhere--

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:45.400 align:middle line:84%
So how did the people
find out about the Jesuits?

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:47.690 align:middle line:84%
Over a course of
about 50 years.

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:49.300 align:middle line:90%
But was there an announcement?

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:50.870 align:middle line:84%
We're working with
these people now

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:52.700 align:middle line:84%
called the Society of Jesus?
-I don't think.

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.310 align:middle line:84%
We're gonna let
them do what they do?

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:58.360 align:middle line:84%
I have not found
any evidence lately.

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:00.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, you may have to recall
that just about everything

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:06.350 align:middle line:84%
concerning the Jesuits from
the 1530s, 1540s to today

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:07.950 align:middle line:90%
has been suppressed.

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:11.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's somewhere in a
Jesuit vault, all that history,

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:12.360 align:middle line:90%
all the books that were written.

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, to answer your
question directly,

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:17.360 align:middle line:84%
it took about 50 years-- five,
zero-- 50 years for people

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.940 align:middle line:84%
all around the world-- that's
after the Jesuits had spread,

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:22.990 align:middle line:84%
like a virus, to all four
corners of the planet--

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:25.520 align:middle line:84%
to finally see their
actions and behaviors,

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.510 align:middle line:84%
and then start to formulate
some ideas about who they are.

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:30.800 align:middle line:84%
They say, they finally
came to the realization

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.570 align:middle line:84%
that these guys are not
benevolent, black robe beings.

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:35.910 align:middle line:84%
These guys are out to
control and harm us.

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:40.360 align:middle line:84%
But you could also argue
that, with the Italian mafia,

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:43.050 align:middle line:84%
they're not gonna hang
out a placard over

00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:44.690 align:middle line:90%
their headquarters and say--

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:45.390 align:middle line:90%
DEAN: Exactly.

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Casa Nostra, which was the
name they originally had.

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:49.400 align:middle line:90%
DEAN: Yes.

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:53.900 align:middle line:84%
The Casa Nostra was a
secret society until it was

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:55.720 align:middle line:90%
broken apart by the government.

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:58.180 align:middle line:84%
Yes and then we get
all these mafia movies.

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:02.800 align:middle line:84%
People forget that the mafia was
a successfully secret society.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.411 align:middle line:84%
People did not know about
it until it collapsed.

00:26:05.411 --> 00:26:06.110 align:middle line:90%
DEAN: Correct.

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:07.509 align:middle line:84%
And that's what happened
with the Jesuits.

00:26:07.509 --> 00:26:10.430 align:middle line:84%
When people started-- we talked
about in a previous episode

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:12.770 align:middle line:84%
that, with the advent of
the printing press, where we

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:15.850 align:middle line:84%
started seeing these little
publishing companies pop up,

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:17.940 align:middle line:84%
could just be one
person who published

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:22.090 align:middle line:84%
books about the malevolent
behavior of the Jesuits.

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:22.890 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:25.310 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: And most people wouldn't
have known who the Jesuits were

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:27.340 align:middle line:84%
unless the whistleblowers
came out and said

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:28.510 align:middle line:90%
here's what's going on.

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:29.070 align:middle line:84%
Here's what they
call themselves.

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:29.769 align:middle line:90%
DEAN: Correct.

00:26:29.769 --> 00:26:32.040 align:middle line:84%
But also, you have to
remember that the population

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:32.920 align:middle line:90%
was largely ignorant.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:33.960 align:middle line:90%
Could not read.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, there had to be
these criers, the town criers,

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:38.850 align:middle line:84%
who would educate people.
-Right.

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And most of the educators
in any village or township

00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:47.280 align:middle line:84%
were Jesuits, because they
set up missions in order

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:48.720 align:middle line:90%
to control the population.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.320 align:middle line:84%
They controlled the
flow of information

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:53.050 align:middle line:90%
from A to Z and beyond.

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:57.381 align:middle line:84%
So this really is church
totally interwoven with state.

00:26:57.381 --> 00:26:59.340 align:middle line:84%
DEAN: Yes.
-The church is the government.

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:00.674 align:middle line:90%
The church is the military

00:27:00.674 --> 00:27:02.040 align:middle line:84%
DEAN: The church is
just the public face.

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.439 align:middle line:84%
And the church is the
educational system.

00:27:03.439 --> 00:27:05.580 align:middle line:84%
The church is just the public
face of the control mechanism.

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:07.380 align:middle line:84%
-Right.
-You don't need religion.

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:08.800 align:middle line:84%
With all due respect
to anyone out there

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.890 align:middle line:84%
who is highly religious,
you don't need religion.

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:12.630 align:middle line:90%
It's been a means of control.

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen lately the
collapse or the near collapse

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:18.392 align:middle line:84%
of the Catholic church and
many religions in general,

00:27:18.392 --> 00:27:19.725 align:middle line:84%
but the fact is, we
have a new religion.

00:27:19.725 --> 00:27:22.310 align:middle line:90%
It's called the internet.

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:23.320 align:middle line:90%
And we have big pharma.

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:24.270 align:middle line:90%
We have big agriculture.

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:25.840 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was selfies.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:26.860 align:middle line:90%
DEAN: Oh, it's all.

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:28.110 align:middle line:90%
You know, there are so many.

00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:29.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it just
goes-- it's endless.

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:31.371 align:middle line:84%
Social media is
the new religion.

00:27:31.371 --> 00:27:33.130 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
It's a means of control.

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:33.829 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:33.829 --> 00:27:35.970 align:middle line:84%
Religion has simply
been a means of control.

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And if it doesn't
work, they drop that

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:39.200 align:middle line:84%
and they move onto
the next thing.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.230 align:middle line:84%
The new religion
is the internet,

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:43.310 align:middle line:90%
and it is social media.

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:46.260 align:middle line:84%
But this is an old, old game.
DEAN: Yes.

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:48.510 align:middle line:84%
It's been going on
for thousands of years.

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:49.660 align:middle line:90%
DEAN: Yes.

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:54.890 align:middle line:84%
When people wrote books that
are exposing the Jesuits,

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:56.830 align:middle line:84%
you're saying the missionaries
come into the town,

00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:59.251 align:middle line:84%
they basically take
control of what you learn.

00:27:59.251 --> 00:27:59.950 align:middle line:90%
DEAN: Yes.

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:02.940 align:middle line:84%
They control information,
they control the military.

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:04.745 align:middle line:84%
They are the judiciary,
I assume, right?

00:28:04.745 --> 00:28:05.620 align:middle line:90%
DEAN: Absolutely.

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:07.491 align:middle line:84%
If you get guilty of some--
if they say you're guilty,

00:28:07.491 --> 00:28:08.190 align:middle line:90%
you're guilty.

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:11.650 align:middle line:84%
Anything that is important
to a town, township,

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:14.660 align:middle line:84%
any organization,
anything that's important,

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:18.050 align:middle line:84%
whatsoever, will be controlled,
ultimately, by the Jesuits.

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And this genius idea that
they run confessional,

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.330 align:middle line:90%
which becomes the original NSA.

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:23.663 align:middle line:84%
DEAN: Oh, I love that,
the confessional.

00:28:23.663 --> 00:28:24.800 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's just so brilliant.

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.320 align:middle line:90%
So they can control everybody.

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.330 align:middle line:84%
You know, up until around--
I think it was around 1871,

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:32.510 align:middle line:84%
"Harper's Magazine" had
run a little editorial

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:33.710 align:middle line:90%
about that when they described.

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:37.070 align:middle line:84%
They said, the Jesuits have
these little cards-- they're

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:40.170 align:middle line:84%
like three by five
cards, if not larger--

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:42.310 align:middle line:84%
and they have every
bit of information

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:44.771 align:middle line:84%
on every single person
they come in contact with.

00:28:44.771 --> 00:28:45.470 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And so they have their
own little Rolodex

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.440 align:middle line:84%
slash Encyclopedia
Britannica on everybody.

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that's
evolved into a highly

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:54.530 align:middle line:90%
computerized system.

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:56.230 align:middle line:84%
So people are writing
books about this,

00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:57.230 align:middle line:90%
and they're exposing this.

00:28:57.230 --> 00:29:00.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, some people were
eyewitnesses to--

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:01.720 align:middle line:90%
DEAN: Yes.

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.921 align:middle line:84%
 --sacrifice rituals
and pedophilia--

00:29:03.921 --> 00:29:05.520 align:middle line:84%
DEAN: Remember.
- --being done by these people.

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.020 align:middle line:84%
-Somebody always sees something.
-Right.

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:09.090 align:middle line:90%
Somebody out there.

00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:11.010 align:middle line:90%
Somebody's always watching.

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:12.180 align:middle line:90%
And there's always a witness.

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And that witness has to
be normalized somehow.

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, how many of these books
do you think there were?

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:20.090 align:middle line:84%
How many different
types of people

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:22.380 align:middle line:84%
got to the point of
printing something about it?

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:26.800 align:middle line:84%
When I look at a new subject
and I start uncovering just

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:30.790 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of information and
I find-- I don't know-- say 10,

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:35.230 align:middle line:84%
20 books after maybe a
couple of years of research,

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:38.371 align:middle line:84%
I gotta wonder, how many
other books out there--

00:29:38.371 --> 00:29:39.070 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:42.180 align:middle line:84%
 --over the hundreds of
years could there possibly be?

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd have to
kind of extrapolate.

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know.
Who knows?

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:47.084 align:middle line:90%
Were there probably hundreds?

00:29:47.084 --> 00:29:48.250 align:middle line:84%
I would imagine
there were probably

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:49.730 align:middle line:90%
hundreds, in the hundreds.

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:53.150 align:middle line:90%
Maybe 500 as an educated guess.

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:54.250 align:middle line:84%
Because you have
to keep in mind,

00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:57.887 align:middle line:84%
too, that, again, the population
was largely uneducated.

00:29:57.887 --> 00:29:58.820 align:middle line:90%
They were not going to read.

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:00.320 align:middle line:90%
Someone had to read to them.

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.020 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:02.690 align:middle line:84%
That's where a lot of
the storytelling came in.

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:03.560 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:06.960 align:middle line:84%
Because that population was
just a really ignorant one.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:11.350 align:middle line:84%
So they had to be told,
orally, what was going on.

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:14.410 align:middle line:84%
Now they had-- that's
when these people started

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:18.160 align:middle line:84%
going underground and you
found the-- you see the advent

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.740 align:middle line:84%
of the underground broadsheets,
and newspapers, and things,

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:22.130 align:middle line:84%
whereas back then,
it was probably

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:25.450 align:middle line:84%
just the underground
criers who were

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:29.450 align:middle line:84%
the members of sort of like
the resistance movement.

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And they had to
keep quiet, and they

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.920 align:middle line:84%
had to be stealthy so that
the Jesuit missionaries,

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:41.161 align:middle line:84%
the priests or their short
robes, the Jesuit coadjutors,

00:30:41.161 --> 00:30:41.860 align:middle line:90%
who were--

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:44.300 align:middle line:84%
All it would take is for
you to tell one person.

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:45.120 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.360 align:middle line:84%
Who then says, I don't
like the fact that you're

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:48.691 align:middle line:84%
questioning the missionaries.
-Yes.

00:30:48.691 --> 00:30:50.250 align:middle line:84%
Exactly.
-And then you're dead.

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:50.760 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.026 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what has happened.

00:30:52.026 --> 00:30:54.050 align:middle line:84%
In the resistance,
like in World War II,

00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:56.190 align:middle line:84%
you never know whom
you could trust.

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:57.040 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:01.800 align:middle line:84%
The postulate here is, they're
creating missionary encampments

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:02.740 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:03.440 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:07.180 align:middle line:84%
They're basically going
out and westernizing,

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:10.870 align:middle line:84%
and so we have this whole
history of marine exploration,

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:13.150 align:middle line:84%
and penetration into all
these other countries,

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:15.550 align:middle line:84%
because it's the
European powers that

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:21.850 align:middle line:84%
had the endowment of the Roman
technology, of running water,

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:25.810 align:middle line:84%
and buildings with flush
toilets, and septic systems,

00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:29.980 align:middle line:84%
and chariots with wheels,
and all this, and gunpowder,

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:33.940 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, metal smithing.
-DEAN: Yes.

00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:37.310 align:middle line:84%
So all this stuff gets
exported around the world,

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:39.730 align:middle line:84%
and as they keep going and
circumnavigating the globe,

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:42.720 align:middle line:84%
like Magellan and all
that starts to happen,

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.937 align:middle line:84%
it's all missionaries going out.
-Yes.

00:31:44.937 --> 00:31:46.070 align:middle line:84%
We have to remember,
too, and this

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:49.280 align:middle line:90%
is an important hypothesis.

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:53.430 align:middle line:84%
There has been punctuated
ET intervention all along.

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:54.360 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah.

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:57.900 align:middle line:84%
So you see, for example,
these modern day--

00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:01.620 align:middle line:84%
the invention of
the silicone chip

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:04.750 align:middle line:84%
and other huge
inventions that were--

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:06.460 align:middle line:90%
that just created an explosion.

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:09.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this was E equals
mc squared at its best.

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:11.160 align:middle line:84%
Just a tiny little thing--
-Yeah.

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:15.040 align:middle line:84%
 --item that created this
huge explosion of ideas,

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:17.571 align:middle line:84%
and new actions, and
behaviors, and events.

00:32:17.571 --> 00:32:18.530 align:middle line:84%
Very true.
DEAN: Yeah.

00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:22.330 align:middle line:84%
So there was the ET intervention
that was punctuated,

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:23.590 align:middle line:90%
and it wasn't every day.

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:24.670 align:middle line:90%
It's not an everyday thing.

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:26.860 align:middle line:84%
It's an-- I see, what
I can tell, probably

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:29.270 align:middle line:84%
about every 25 or so years.
-Oh.

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:32.800 align:middle line:84%
It's-- I would-- I don't wanna
blatantly contradict you,

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:35.390 align:middle line:84%
except to say that there is
constant intervention going on.

00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:37.650 align:middle line:84%
I would agree, but we don't
necess-- I mean, I misspoke.

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:40.500 align:middle line:84%
We don't necessarily
see all of that.

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:44.930 align:middle line:84%
We see these huge inventions,
the punctuated ones,

00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:46.230 align:middle line:90%
maybe once every generation.

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:48.060 align:middle line:84%
It's probably even
more so than now,

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:51.440 align:middle line:84%
because the Jesuits have
accelerated their behaviors--

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.050 align:middle line:84%
their malevolent
behaviors toward us--

00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:54.710 align:middle line:90%
significantly since 9/11.

00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:58.460 align:middle line:84%
So that was a very, to use the
term again, significant event.

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:04.280 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk a little
bit more about-- just

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:08.870 align:middle line:84%
to fill in the cracks,
we-- the 1600s was them

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:11.990 align:middle line:84%
essentially paying
both sides of a war

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:14.200 align:middle line:84%
to get the strongest product.
-Yes.

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:16.800 align:middle line:84%
Just sorting out who's
who in the zoo in Europe.

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.720 align:middle line:84%
DEAN: They were using the
four-step process all along.

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:19.419 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:19.419 --> 00:33:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have to
go over that again,

00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:23.310 align:middle line:84%
but just using the f--
in every single country,

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:25.420 align:middle line:84%
and also doing these
little experiments.

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:27.340 align:middle line:84%
Then, as we head
into the 1700s,

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:31.801 align:middle line:84%
it appears that there was a
break in the secret societies.

00:33:31.801 --> 00:33:34.481 align:middle line:84%
-DEAN: Yes.
-And one group goes to America.

00:33:34.481 --> 00:33:35.180 align:middle line:90%
DEAN: Yes.

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:36.245 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
founding fathers.

00:33:36.245 --> 00:33:36.944 align:middle line:90%
DEAN: Yes.

00:33:36.944 --> 00:33:38.490 align:middle line:84%
They had some of this
knowledge, but they

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:40.060 align:middle line:90%
definitely were opposing--

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:40.760 align:middle line:90%
DEAN: Yes.

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:42.440 align:middle line:84%
 --the King of
England, which is really

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.830 align:middle line:90%
a vassal for the Vatican.

00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:44.680 align:middle line:90%
DEAN: Yes.

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:50.690 align:middle line:84%
So what we're seeing is a
split that started to develop,

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:53.410 align:middle line:84%
and then the British empire
keeps trying to take America

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:55.270 align:middle line:90%
back, like the War of 1812.

00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:56.370 align:middle line:84%
DEAN: Yes.
-But it isn't.

00:33:56.370 --> 00:33:58.360 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like the Vatican,
when it sort of broke away

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:01.980 align:middle line:84%
at some point, then the Jesuits
were probably brought in

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:03.510 align:middle line:90%
to normalize the Vatican.

00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And then when these founding
fathers of ours broke away,

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:08.414 align:middle line:90%
the Jesuits are sent in.

00:34:08.414 --> 00:34:10.080 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they had been there
all al-- well, actually,

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:12.320 align:middle line:84%
they had been there all
along to normalize America

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.310 align:middle line:90%
from the very beginning.

00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:14.010 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And their goal was to create
an American central bank

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:18.790 align:middle line:90%
that they were in control of.

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:19.490 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:22.739 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they did with
Alexander Hamilton, who was

00:34:22.739 --> 00:34:25.600 align:middle line:84%
one of their Jesuit coadjutors.
-Right.

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:29.239 align:middle line:84%
So people need to understand,
the Federal Reserve

00:34:29.239 --> 00:34:31.881 align:middle line:84%
wasn't the beginning
of when this was tried.

00:34:31.881 --> 00:34:32.580 align:middle line:90%
DEAN: Not at all.

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:34.343 align:middle line:84%
They've been trying to
do this the whole time.

00:34:34.343 --> 00:34:35.409 align:middle line:90%
DEAN: America has been at siege.

00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:36.880 align:middle line:90%
Since America started.

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:40.699 align:middle line:84%
Davi, America has been at siege
from its day of conception.

00:34:40.699 --> 00:34:41.750 align:middle line:90%
Even before.

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:43.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And you can go back to the
original colonial script,

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:48.159 align:middle line:84%
the money that was
originally made in America.

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:50.070 align:middle line:90%
Ben Franklin's brilliant ideas.

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:52.929 align:middle line:84%
And it's got a pyramid on
it right at the beginning.

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:54.080 align:middle line:90%
A pyramid without the capstone.

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:54.913 align:middle line:90%
DEAN: Isn't that curious?

00:34:54.913 --> 00:34:55.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.900 align:middle line:90%
Right back in the 1700s.

00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:00.220 align:middle line:84%
and people have to
remember that the Great

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:02.249 align:middle line:84%
Seal of the United States--
-DEAN: Yes.

00:35:02.249 --> 00:35:03.820 align:middle line:84%
 --with the Eagle, with
novus ordo seclorum,

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:06.700 align:middle line:84%
and the eye on top of
the triangle, that's done

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:08.920 align:middle line:84%
in 1789 by Charles Thomson.
-DEAN: Yes.

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:10.540 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: 1789.
DEAN: Exactly.

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:11.650 align:middle line:90%
DAVID: This is nothing new.

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:12.370 align:middle line:90%
DEAN: No, not at all.

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:14.060 align:middle line:84%
DAVID: And we're
seeing the same symbols

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:15.680 align:middle line:90%
being shoved in our face.

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.581 align:middle line:84%
Even more so at an
accelerated pace.

00:35:17.581 --> 00:35:18.280 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:20.213 align:middle line:84%
Because you have to remember,
too, because the population

00:35:20.213 --> 00:35:22.420 align:middle line:84%
habituates to their
behaviors after awhile.

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to
change the behaviors.

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:26.940 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you have to ramp
them up just to increase them,

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:29.030 align:middle line:84%
increase their
magnitude to an extent

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:31.450 align:middle line:84%
that the population
will now finally get it.

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:32.340 align:middle line:90%
To normalize.

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:33.160 align:middle line:90%
DEAN: To normalize them.

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:34.559 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
-Right.

00:35:34.559 --> 00:35:36.250 align:middle line:90%
To bring them into the fold.

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:37.480 align:middle line:84%
But the Jesuits,
all they're doing

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.510 align:middle line:84%
is just adapting to
their environment.

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I like saying I'm
a behavioral ecologist studying

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:45.500 align:middle line:84%
the Jesuits, because
behavioral ecology is studying

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:48.450 align:middle line:84%
the evolutionary
processes, the foundations

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:50.240 align:middle line:90%
that underlie animal behavior.

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And how the external environment
influences those behaviors.

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:54.430 align:middle line:90%
Hm.

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And so the Jesuits are
masters of manipulating

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:00.750 align:middle line:84%
their own environment,
not to mention

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:03.870 align:middle line:84%
being masters of manipulating
all of their peers.

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:06.561 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by
peers, all fellow humans.

00:36:06.561 --> 00:36:07.260 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:09.750 align:middle line:84%
So I-- I think that's
a perfect analogy,

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:11.510 align:middle line:90%
if not a great example.

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:13.580 align:middle line:84%
People need to study
the behavioral ecology

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:16.700 align:middle line:84%
of the Jesuits, what's going
on, because that is really,

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:21.320 align:middle line:84%
I think, a key foundation or
a key period to understanding

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.740 align:middle line:90%
which is truly going on.

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And when you understand the
environment, the ecology that

00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:30.217 align:middle line:84%
is the animal in relation to
the nonliving things around it,

00:36:30.217 --> 00:36:31.350 align:middle line:84%
then I think you
get a much better

00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:33.010 align:middle line:90%
handle on the big picture.

00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And then you can zoom in on
some of the details, if you so

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:37.470 align:middle line:90%
choose, depending on your bent.

00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:39.920 align:middle line:84%
I want you to start
connecting the dots here.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:43.920 align:middle line:84%
I want you to look at videos
like Rhianna, Katy Perry, Lady

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:50.000 align:middle line:84%
Gaga, and see how many times
the all-seeing eye shows up,

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.130 align:middle line:84%
how many times they're
flashing these Illuminati

00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:55.290 align:middle line:90%
symbols in our faces.

00:36:55.290 --> 00:36:57.220 align:middle line:84%
They keep doing it
at the Grammy Awards.

00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:58.660 align:middle line:84%
They keep doing it
at the Super Bowl

00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:01.400 align:middle line:84%
halftime show,
though in 2015, they

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:03.150 align:middle line:90%
did tone it down a little bit.

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:05.850 align:middle line:84%
The only real thing there
was this Masonic tile

00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:07.860 align:middle line:84%
checkerboard floor
that they had.

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:10.180 align:middle line:84%
But in some of the other years,
like the one with Madonna,

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:13.700 align:middle line:84%
which we've covered on my
show "Wisdom Teachings" here,

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:15.470 align:middle line:90%
holy smokes.

00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:19.120 align:middle line:84%
Full on Illuminati
ceremony, and in fact,

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:21.640 align:middle line:84%
Madonna did the same
thing at the 2015 Grammys.

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:24.230 align:middle line:84%
She's surrounded by
a group of people

00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:27.320 align:middle line:84%
with the goat horns,
the Baphomet horns,

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:30.470 align:middle line:84%
and these faces that
are totally blanked out.

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And she's introduced by
Miley Cyrus and Nicki

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:37.360 align:middle line:84%
Minaj, both of whom
have had crazy cabal

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.790 align:middle line:90%
symbolism in their videos.

00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:41.760 align:middle line:84%
So the symbolism that
this group is using

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:44.360 align:middle line:84%
goes back to, as I
said, Charles Thomson

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:47.960 align:middle line:84%
designing the Great Seal of
the United States in the 1700s.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:49.840 align:middle line:84%
That's when the pyramid
and the all-seeing eye

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:50.900 align:middle line:90%
were implemented.

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:53.490 align:middle line:84%
This group has been
around for a long time,

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:57.000 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately, they want
us to know they exist.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.220 align:middle line:84%
There's such an inertia
that they're experiencing,

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:02.600 align:middle line:84%
where people just can't believe
that they really are real.

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:04.220 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to come
right out and just say,

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:05.830 align:middle line:84%
here we are, and here's
what we've been doing.

00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:07.360 align:middle line:90%
That's against their religion.

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:10.080 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
they want us to know,

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:12.530 align:middle line:84%
and so they're trying
to tell us indirectly.

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:14.380 align:middle line:84%
So we're gonna have
a lot more for you

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:17.200 align:middle line:84%
coming up in the next
episode of "Disclosure."

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:20.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, David Wilcock,
speaking truth to power

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:23.040 align:middle line:90%
and giving power to the truth.
