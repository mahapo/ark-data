00:00:19.765 --> 00:00:20.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID WILCOCK: All right.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.390 align:middle line:10%
Welcome back to our show.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.830 align:middle line:10%
I'm here with Pete Peterson.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.280 align:middle line:10%
Pete, welcome back to the show.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.613 align:middle line:10%
>>PETE PETERSON: Thank you much.

00:00:26.613 --> 00:00:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: We've been talking
in the past about your work

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.884 align:middle line:90%
with some luminaries.

00:00:30.884 --> 00:00:32.800 align:middle line:84%
So who do we have next
on the list as somebody

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.600 align:middle line:90%
we might remember?

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.130 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: Probably someone
that I started with very young

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.660 align:middle line:90%
also is Kenneth Shoulders.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:39.460 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.793 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: Gentlemen by the
name of Kenneth Shoulders.

00:00:41.793 --> 00:00:44.740 align:middle line:84%
He passed away recently
and left his whole legacy

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.450 align:middle line:90%
on the internet.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.840 align:middle line:84%
So you can go to Google and
Google Kenneth Shoulders.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And you could spend two or
three lifetimes even beginning

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.060 align:middle line:90%
to go through his stuff.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.180 align:middle line:84%
When I met him, he was
one of the people that was

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.520 align:middle line:90%
presented to me as a mentor.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.410 align:middle line:84%
I flew down to
Southern California.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And he lived up in the
mountains above Stanford campus.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And there was a little area
up there where he got to--

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.510 align:middle line:90%
he liked to tune himself.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.040 align:middle line:84%
So he'd go out
early in the morning

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.320 align:middle line:84%
and walk through the fog
up on top of the hills,

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.280 align:middle line:84%
and breathe the air, and smell
the seawater and the seaweed

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.840 align:middle line:84%
on the other side
of the mountain,

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.900 align:middle line:84%
and hug a tree or two, or lie
down by a tree and meditate,

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.650 align:middle line:84%
and then he was ready to go
to his consummate, consummate

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.620 align:middle line:84%
laboratory, which I've
tried to build one

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.160 align:middle line:84%
like it the rest of my life
and I'm not even close.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.550 align:middle line:84%
But he had tools in there
that you've never heard of,

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.180 align:middle line:84%
tools that had been used by the
Egyptians, tools that had been

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.590 align:middle line:90%
used by people way back when.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:00.090 align:middle line:84%
If you think about the rate
of increase of knowledge,

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.220 align:middle line:84%
we've always increased at the
same rate as our increased

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.690 align:middle line:90%
tools to measure it.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.130 align:middle line:90%
We can talk about electricity.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.759 align:middle line:84%
They talked about electricity
for years and years

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.190 align:middle line:84%
mathematically, but they had
nothing to demonstrate it.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.660 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have voltmeters, and
ammeters, and oscilloscopes.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.662 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't have capacitance
meters and inductance meters.

00:02:19.662 --> 00:02:22.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, let me just ask
a kind of a direct question.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.470 align:middle line:84%
Are you saying that he had
either ancient technology

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.270 align:middle line:84%
or classified
technology right there?

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.832 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: I used to talk
about him for many, many years.

00:02:30.832 --> 00:02:32.540 align:middle line:84%
There were certain
things I couldn't say.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.390 align:middle line:90%
But I used to talk about him.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.160 align:middle line:84%
I always said if
there's anybody that I

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.110 align:middle line:84%
know of on this Earth
that's an alien,

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.610 align:middle line:84%
it's got to be this guy, because
he was 50 to 200 years ahead

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.530 align:middle line:90%
of anybody.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.830 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I was 14 he
sent me a handful of integrated

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:48.770 align:middle line:90%
circuits.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And about 12 years later,
they were invented.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.570 align:middle line:84%
In the quality and the amount
of integration that took place,

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.460 align:middle line:84%
it took about 14 years before
they got to be commercial.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So what was the purpose
of them bringing him to you?

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.830 align:middle line:84%
What did he teach you when
you started at six months?

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.530 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: He teaches me the
things that he knows that are

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.371 align:middle line:84%
very different from the things
that are known out in public,

00:03:11.371 --> 00:03:13.870 align:middle line:84%
or very advanced from the things
that are not out in public.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Could you
give us an example?

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: Well, when I
went into his laboratory,

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.176 align:middle line:84%
the first thing he showed me was
a little thing that looked like

00:03:20.176 --> 00:03:22.830 align:middle line:90%
a silver grain of rice.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.580 align:middle line:84%
He took that thing
with a pair of tweezers

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.480 align:middle line:84%
and put it into a
little plastic device

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.250 align:middle line:84%
that snapped in that looked
like a regular maple seed

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.130 align:middle line:90%
off a tree.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And then he took the device
and hit it on his hand.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out there was a
little piston inside this leaf

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.050 align:middle line:90%
seed.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.100 align:middle line:84%
There was a little double
ended piston go back and forth.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And it was filled
with isobutane.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.810 align:middle line:90%
And it would generate--

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.630 align:middle line:84%
it would generate air, it would
compress air, and shoot it

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.000 align:middle line:84%
down the leaf of the maple
seed and out the side.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.856 align:middle line:84%
And it would sit, and hover,
and spin around and around

00:03:59.856 --> 00:04:00.730 align:middle line:90%
and around like that.

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:01.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: And how big?

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.870 align:middle line:84%
Show me with your hands
how big this thing was.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.120 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERSON: About this big.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.411 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing was about
that long and a little engine

00:04:06.411 --> 00:04:08.422 align:middle line:90%
about like that.

00:04:08.422 --> 00:04:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Around
what time was this?

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.990 align:middle line:90%
What year?

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.950 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERSON: Oh boy.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:23.080 align:middle line:90%
Probably 19-- probably 66, 67.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, we know now
that there are very small drone

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.545 align:middle line:84%
technologies, but for
the mid to late 1960s--

00:04:30.545 --> 00:04:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: I've never
seen anything like it.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So this thing
could fly on its own?

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.350 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.891 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: It
would fly on its own.

00:04:37.891 --> 00:04:40.130 align:middle line:84%
You could control
it with a little--

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.490 align:middle line:84%
he'd converted a
very early-- we use

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.870 align:middle line:84%
infrared to control our
television sets and VCRs.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.795 align:middle line:84%
There was a time when you used
a little ultrasonic tweeter.

00:04:51.795 --> 00:04:55.850 align:middle line:84%
It had a little bulb on the
end and a little whistle.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And they came out in the
public for, I don't know,

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.730 align:middle line:84%
two or three years, and then
moved on to electronics.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.660 align:middle line:90%
And he had a little tweeter.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And he had one of
the little sensors

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.210 align:middle line:90%
that I'd learned about from LAN.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.160 align:middle line:84%
They have-- the
Polaroid X series

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.550 align:middle line:84%
cameras had a
ultrasonic range finder.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you're saying
that there's this--

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.320 align:middle line:84%
that he had,
instead of infrared,

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.810 align:middle line:84%
that he used an
ultrasonic noise generator

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.730 align:middle line:90%
but you can't hear the noise?

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.700 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: It's ultrasonic
so it's above the frequency

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.350 align:middle line:90%
of hearing.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:31.730 align:middle line:90%
And it's a little tweeter.

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So it was like a remote
control for the for the device.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.338 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: It's
a remote control,

00:05:35.338 --> 00:05:38.030 align:middle line:84%
it's this ultrasonic
remote control tweeter.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And he could tweet this
thing to go away from you.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.450 align:middle line:84%
wherever it was,
it designed to hook

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.390 align:middle line:90%
to the highest object near it.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:50.240 align:middle line:90%
So it would fly around you.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.884 align:middle line:84%
Now as you would see
it coming around,

00:05:51.884 --> 00:05:54.050 align:middle line:84%
you'd see something out
there you wanted to examine.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.730 align:middle line:84%
So when it got inline,
you'd tweet it.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.550 align:middle line:84%
It'd make a right angled turn
and then fly directly away

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.020 align:middle line:90%
from you.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.414 align:middle line:84%
And so you could maybe
take it out 2, 300 feet.

00:06:03.414 --> 00:06:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And you can tweet it
twice and it'd turn right

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.070 align:middle line:90%
and start circling around you.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.840 align:middle line:84%
And if it found
something taller,

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.950 align:middle line:90%
it'd start circling around that.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:14.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: We routinely
hear insiders

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.800 align:middle line:84%
say that the technology
in the classified world

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.770 align:middle line:84%
is 20 to 50 years ahead of the
conventional world if not more.

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.010 align:middle line:84%
This absolutely sounds
like that to me.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:25.440 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: Oh,
it is like that.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.420 align:middle line:90%
I mean that's reality.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.750 align:middle line:90%
You discover something.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.140 align:middle line:84%
When you discover, a
scientist says, oh, I

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.780 align:middle line:90%
found out that this can happen.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.450 align:middle line:84%
The time between that
actually happening and then

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:41.460 align:middle line:84%
making something that has
the right power source,

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.210 align:middle line:84%
has the right
components available,

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.171 align:middle line:84%
then they're farmed out to a
number of agencies or companies

00:06:49.171 --> 00:06:51.420 align:middle line:84%
that build those things that
have no idea what they're

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.410 align:middle line:90%
going into.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:54.280 align:middle line:90%
I want something that does this.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: That's just like
the Manhattan Project.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:56.970 align:middle line:84%
They were building
a nuclear bomb.

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:58.770 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: Almost like most
all the projects I've worked

00:06:58.770 --> 00:06:59.970 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:01.860 align:middle line:84%
I could have upgraded
them probably

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.130 align:middle line:84%
by 10 or 15 years if I'd had
three or four of the objects,

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.470 align:middle line:84%
but they don't want you to
know what the objects are,

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.360 align:middle line:84%
because they don't want you
to guess what they might be,

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.568 align:middle line:84%
because they don't want you
to sell it to the Soviets

00:07:11.568 --> 00:07:14.200 align:middle line:84%
for 10 times what
you're getting paid.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So what did
this little thing do?

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:18.955 align:middle line:90%
Why was it so useful?

00:07:18.955 --> 00:07:19.830 align:middle line:90%
I mean I have ideas--

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.246 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: It was so useful
because the whole idea of it

00:07:22.246 --> 00:07:26.160 align:middle line:84%
was eventually to make a maple
seed that would fly out across

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.410 align:middle line:84%
the countryside, down
a chimney inside,

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:32.170 align:middle line:84%
through a fireplace grate up,
and land on a wall or a shelf

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.140 align:middle line:90%
and turn the microphone on.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:35.002 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:07:35.002 --> 00:07:36.960 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: And you'd
never know it was there.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And then at times you
could turn it back on later

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:47.080 align:middle line:84%
or have a maid or a housekeeper,
someone who is on the inside,

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.580 align:middle line:84%
I think I always said, there
are more housekeepers in the CIA

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.596 align:middle line:90%
than there are anything else.

00:07:52.596 --> 00:07:57.750 align:middle line:84%
They're in retrieving or putting
down devices of various kinds.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:01.390 align:middle line:90%


00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:05.020 align:middle line:84%
So they could retrieve it later
or maybe just self-destruct it

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.688 align:middle line:90%
later.

00:08:06.688 --> 00:08:08.670 align:middle line:84%
Turn it on and fly it
down into the fireplace.

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:11.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So this would be an
incredible surveillance weapon.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.030 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERSON: Absolutely.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:16.740 align:middle line:84%
Then we made a larger one
that was about six feet long

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:20.440 align:middle line:84%
that was made out of inflated--
at that time, those little

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:25.790 align:middle line:84%
kiddie vinyl swimming pools
were becoming big time.

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:27.310 align:middle line:84%
So we found a
couple of companies

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:31.030 align:middle line:84%
that were run by former
military people and so forth.

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And we could make this
wing that would roll up.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.130 align:middle line:84%
You'd fill the wing
up full of isobutane,

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:39.419 align:middle line:84%
and then put a little engine
in the size of a marshmallow.

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And a little free
piston compressor

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.570 align:middle line:84%
the size of a marshmallow
put out about 17 horsepower.

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:45.370 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:51.300 align:middle line:84%
So you say that this
thing had 17 horsepower?

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.100 align:middle line:90%
That seems--

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: The little
marshmallow-sized engine.

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: That seems
very hard to believe.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure some people are
going to stammer on that.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.448 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: Well, they were
wonderful little things.

00:09:00.448 --> 00:09:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And what it would do is take
this wing-- this flying,

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.880 align:middle line:90%
single wing--

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.500 align:middle line:90%
fly it around in circles.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.592 align:middle line:90%
And we were at SRI.

00:09:08.592 --> 00:09:09.550 align:middle line:90%
We'd would look across.

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:12.272 align:middle line:84%
And here's the
Stanford football team.

00:09:12.272 --> 00:09:13.480 align:middle line:90%
So we took it down with them.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.520 align:middle line:90%
And they made up a little game.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.070 align:middle line:84%
Remember, it's locking
onto the tallest person.

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:20.020 align:middle line:84%
So one guy jumped on
the other's shoulders.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:21.464 align:middle line:90%
And they'd run past it.

00:09:21.464 --> 00:09:22.630 align:middle line:90%
And it would hook onto them.

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:24.254 align:middle line:84%
And they'd head down
the field one way.

00:09:24.254 --> 00:09:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And then another team
would get some people

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.620 align:middle line:84%
to run in front of them, and
do the same thing backwards.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:32.245 align:middle line:84%
And we got it where the
coach says, now, look,

00:09:32.245 --> 00:09:33.520 align:middle line:90%
I got a game in four days.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.462 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
destroy these guys.

00:09:35.462 --> 00:09:36.785 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And, no, no, we want
to play with this.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.390 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to
play football again.

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.349 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:09:42.349 --> 00:09:44.140 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: So anyway,
that was one thing.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And we attended that
for a civilian product.

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:50.290 align:middle line:84%
But naturally, the people
says, no, no, that's

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:52.450 align:middle line:90%
going to be a military product.

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:54.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that it ever
became a military product.

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:56.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
been 30 years ago.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.600 align:middle line:90%


00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, something
like this theoretically

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:04.220 align:middle line:84%
could also become a
smart bullet, right?

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.020 align:middle line:90%
You could--

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: Smart
bullet, smart bomb.

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:11.490 align:middle line:84%
We had little blades that were
like little samurai swords that

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:12.970 align:middle line:84%
would fly across
the battlefield,

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:16.540 align:middle line:84%
and sense a heartbeat, and
sense a body temperature,

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:17.650 align:middle line:90%
and fly through it.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:19.060 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:23.530 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: And it was a blade
big enough to cut enough tissue

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:27.927 align:middle line:84%
inside the body to bleed
it out in short order.

00:10:27.927 --> 00:10:29.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: That's very disturbing.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.280 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERSON: It is.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, since we're
trying to get a lot into one

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:36.640 align:middle line:84%
show here-- just to give
people an overview for you--

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.340 align:middle line:84%
who else were you
trained by that we

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:42.880 align:middle line:84%
might be able to look up
or verify in some way?

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:47.690 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: Well, I got some
training from a fellow that was

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:50.430 align:middle line:84%
the father of
computerized sound.

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:52.010 align:middle line:90%
There wasn't before him.

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:54.520 align:middle line:90%
There was some but very little.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.920 align:middle line:90%
He wrote the manual on it.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.760 align:middle line:90%
His name was Hal Chamberlin.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:07.490 align:middle line:84%
The last I heard of Hal, he was
Kurzweil's head sound engineer.

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And Kurzweil is the god
of robotics, if you would,

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:15.980 align:middle line:90%
in the world today.

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Last I heard he was
teaching at MIT.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And someone else
here mentioned he's,

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:24.442 align:middle line:84%
I think, somewhere else
doing some work in that area.

00:11:24.442 --> 00:11:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I think he
works for Google now.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:28.317 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: Yeah,
he probably does.

00:11:28.317 --> 00:11:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And he's the one that
thinks we're all going

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:33.870 align:middle line:90%
to move into bionic bodies.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Kurzweil is
the guy who was talking

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:37.170 align:middle line:90%
about AI and singularity.

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:37.550 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:38.350 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERSON: Yeah.

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:39.495 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:11:39.495 --> 00:11:43.510 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: And he realizes
that we'll soon have--

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:45.560 align:middle line:84%
because little chip that
I have and so forth.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:49.800 align:middle line:84%
He realizes that we'll soon
have artificial intellect that's

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.215 align:middle line:84%
much greater than
the human capability.

00:11:52.215 --> 00:11:53.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: And so
he's working on that.

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:58.082 align:middle line:90%
And I have no idea--

00:11:58.082 --> 00:12:00.540 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think anybody has
an idea-- of what he's really

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:02.010 align:middle line:90%
working on behind the scenes.

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:08.160 align:middle line:84%
But he's been funded, financed,
and cajoled, and everything

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:14.110 align:middle line:84%
else by the very, very
high levels of government,

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:16.360 align:middle line:90%
total secure operations.

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So tell me a little
more about Hal Chamberlin.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.050 align:middle line:90%
What did you study from him?

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:22.390 align:middle line:90%
When did that take place?

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:25.780 align:middle line:90%
What was his contribution?

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: It was in
the early '80s, '80, '81.

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:36.780 align:middle line:90%
He and his partner had built--

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.850 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning, I
was using a computer

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:42.360 align:middle line:84%
that had been built
to teach people

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:46.080 align:middle line:90%
how to use computers and chips.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.290 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing like it.

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:50.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And what year
are we talking about?

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:52.220 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERSON: 1979 and '80.

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:53.202 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:12:53.202 --> 00:12:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: And there was
a little computer built it

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:59.750 align:middle line:90%
eventually called the AIM-65.

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:00.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: A-M 65?

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.910 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERSON: A-I-M 65.

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:02.980 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: A-I-M 65, OK.

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.685 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: It was
just a circuit board.

00:13:05.685 --> 00:13:07.290 align:middle line:84%
It had another
little circuit board

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:10.830 align:middle line:84%
that had what we call
today a standard computer

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:12.600 align:middle line:90%
keyboard hooked to it.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:17.490 align:middle line:84%
It was the first computer that
ever had a microprocessor chip

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:20.290 align:middle line:90%
and a keyboard hooked together.

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:21.785 align:middle line:90%
And that's how long ago it was.

00:13:21.785 --> 00:13:26.910 align:middle line:84%
It had a little
thermal printer that

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:31.620 align:middle line:84%
would print on thermal paper
out of an Olivetti calculator

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.810 align:middle line:90%
that Sears and Roebuck sold.

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And it had a display screen that
would display 24 characters.

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:43.690 align:middle line:84%
But they were 16-segment
characters, not just

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:45.300 align:middle line:84%
the seven segment
that we normally

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.080 align:middle line:90%
think of in pocket calculators.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.130 align:middle line:90%
You could do alphanumerics.

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:52.710 align:middle line:90%
You could also do graphics.

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And then it had some
input/output on the back.

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:57.660 align:middle line:90%
It had a little bit of RAM.

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:04.440 align:middle line:84%
In those days, RAM was about
$71 for a kilobyte, two chips.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:09.510 align:middle line:90%
It had some read-only memory.

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And in that read-only
memory, we had

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:17.410 align:middle line:84%
two chips that had an operating
system for the device in it.

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:20.370 align:middle line:84%
So when you fired
it up, it came up.

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And then it told it, oh,
you're a little computer,

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:24.372 align:middle line:90%
and you'll do these things.

00:14:24.372 --> 00:14:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And the keyboard will work
this way, and the display,

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.070 align:middle line:84%
and the printer, and
the input/output.

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:31.980 align:middle line:84%
It was designed
specifically to teach people

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:35.550 align:middle line:84%
how to use this
particular processor chip

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:38.580 align:middle line:84%
and the input/output chips
that went with it were designed

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.142 align:middle line:90%
was it in the same family.

00:14:40.142 --> 00:14:41.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And what was
the processor chip?

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:45.150 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERSON: It was a 6502.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:48.540 align:middle line:84%
That became the basis for the
Commodore PET, the Apple II,

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:53.340 align:middle line:90%
the Commodore 64, the Atari.

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.110 align:middle line:84%
The first thing, I
think, that was done

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:57.070 align:middle line:84%
was by one of the
first students.

00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Let's get back
to Hal Chamberlin now.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.010 align:middle line:84%
You're working
with these AIM-65--

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:06.100 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: Well, we brought
him in, because they took that

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:06.900 align:middle line:90%
knowledge.

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And they made from it a
very powerful computer.

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:13.350 align:middle line:84%
It was at least 10,000
times more powerful

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:16.510 align:middle line:84%
than the computer we used
on the Gemini capsule.

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:17.834 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:15:17.834 --> 00:15:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: And it
would do everything.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And this, I assume,
must have been classified?

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:23.330 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: No, it
wasn't classified at all.

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:23.730 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh.

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:25.771 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: It happened
by a private company out

00:15:25.771 --> 00:15:28.040 align:middle line:84%
in the-- a couple
of bright guys.

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.580 align:middle line:90%
One of them was Hal Chamberlin.

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.325 align:middle line:90%
And David Love was his partner.

00:15:32.325 --> 00:15:34.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, was it
ever publicly released?

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:34.850 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERSON: Oh, yeah.

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:36.480 align:middle line:84%
The public bought
them by the thousands.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.170 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:39.150 align:middle line:84%
So it was just a very
significant advancement

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:40.050 align:middle line:84%
in computer power,
you're saying?

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:42.720 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: Yeah, it was, like,
the second computer that ever

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.640 align:middle line:84%
had a keyboard and
a processor chip.

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:47.730 align:middle line:84%
So what was Hal
Chamberlin's role

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:49.521 align:middle line:84%
was you when you started
to train with him?

00:15:49.521 --> 00:15:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: Well, Hal
was David's partner.

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:54.180 align:middle line:84%
So what we got from
David, we got from Hal.

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.612 align:middle line:90%
They were partners.

00:15:55.612 --> 00:15:56.570 align:middle line:90%
And one of the things--

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:58.320 align:middle line:84%
Hal said, well, I have
a little board here

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:02.010 align:middle line:84%
that will allow us to
do any kind of sound.

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And he was just finishing up
his book on computerized sound.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.390 align:middle line:90%
And so he's the guy.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:11.712 align:middle line:84%
As far as I know, the
book is still used.

00:16:11.712 --> 00:16:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So that would be,
like, the first sound card

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:14.250 align:middle line:90%
for any computer.

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:16.208 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: The first
sound card of any kind--

00:16:16.208 --> 00:16:18.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:19.260 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERSON: --that I know of.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:24.420 align:middle line:84%
But if there was another one, it
was 200 levels of intelligence

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:25.770 align:middle line:90%
below that.

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:29.731 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So Hal Chamberlin
helped you to implement

00:16:29.731 --> 00:16:30.980 align:middle line:90%
a sound card in your computer?

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.438 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: Hal Chamberlin
took our needs and designed his

00:16:33.438 --> 00:16:37.050 align:middle line:84%
sound card and their computer--
that's his company's computer--

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:39.150 align:middle line:90%
around our needs.

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And then I built a
whole entire line

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.350 align:middle line:84%
of computerized
diagnostic equipment

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:48.010 align:middle line:84%
that totally altered the world
and the ability to do that.

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:51.542 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So we have time
for one more name-dropping.

00:16:51.542 --> 00:16:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Could you give us
another name of someone

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:59.430 align:middle line:84%
who you got into contact with as
a result of these assignments?

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: Well, there are
a lot of Nobel Prize winners.

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:10.900 align:middle line:84%
But probably one
of them that people

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.180 align:middle line:84%
would know about,
especially in the world

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:17.822 align:middle line:84%
that we are marketing to-- and
that would be Rupert Sheldrake.

00:17:17.822 --> 00:17:19.030 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, yeah, of course.

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:23.560 align:middle line:10%
>> PETERSON: He's a very,
very brilliant biologist from

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.290 align:middle line:10%
Cambridge, I believe.

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And we hired him to come over
in lecture to a group of doctors

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.426 align:middle line:90%
who used my medical equipment.

00:17:33.426 --> 00:17:36.140 align:middle line:90%


00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.690 align:middle line:84%
So when he came
over, it wasn't that

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:40.160 align:middle line:90%
I was trying to impress him.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.550 align:middle line:84%
It's that I knew a lot of
things about what he had found

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:45.800 align:middle line:84%
and wanted to try to give
him some information.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:51.830 align:middle line:84%
So he thought he was supposed
to come over and teach us

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:54.470 align:middle line:90%
what he'd found.

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:55.494 align:middle line:90%
I knew what he'd found.

00:17:55.494 --> 00:17:56.660 align:middle line:90%
And the rest of them didn't.

00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:01.700 align:middle line:84%
So to be fair with them, we
let him talk about his thing.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.146 align:middle line:84%
And I quit talking
about my thing.

00:18:04.146 --> 00:18:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, let
me just state, Pete,

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:09.260 align:middle line:84%
that we actually-- this is
pretty amazing, because I

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:10.910 align:middle line:90%
interviewed Rupert Sheldrake.

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And we've aired some of
those interview clips

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:15.380 align:middle line:90%
on this network.

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And what he's done
in terms of showing

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:23.390 align:middle line:84%
a biological
intelligence field that

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:26.360 align:middle line:84%
seems to interconnect
seemingly separate life forms

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:27.465 align:middle line:90%
is quite amazing.

00:18:27.465 --> 00:18:28.820 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERSON: Yup, it is.

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole
lot more to it.

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And he looks at it
as a geneticist.

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at it
more as a scientist,

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:43.030 align:middle line:84%
from a physics standpoint,
there's so much more.

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:45.395 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: I'm sure.

00:18:45.395 --> 00:18:47.090 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERSON: As would be normal.

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And I've done tons and tons of
work on morphogenetic fields.

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And they are, indeed, very
well-named-- morphogenetic.

00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:00.250 align:middle line:84%
They've morphed
from various things

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:04.850 align:middle line:84%
that the universe itself is
learning on a regular basis.

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And so the universe
will change itself

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:12.050 align:middle line:84%
based on preponderance
of thought.

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's what my PhD thesis
is on, on thought, rather

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:25.360 align:middle line:84%
than looking at everything
from a physical standpoint.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Spirituality is a
different way to put it.

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:34.610 align:middle line:90%
And there are fields out there.

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:36.550 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that
there aren't any words

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:40.260 align:middle line:84%
in the English language
that will describe reality.

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:45.610 align:middle line:84%
The words we have describe very
gross, very personal, "we do it

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:49.600 align:middle line:84%
every day" kind of things,
like burning eggs and stuff

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:50.410 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:53.980 align:middle line:84%
So we need a whole
new series of words

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.760 align:middle line:90%
for the next step of mankind.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:56.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: I agree.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.410 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: And a lot of those
include a lot of words that we

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:01.270 align:middle line:90%
had in the past.

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:03.624 align:middle line:84%
The word has been bastardized
from what it really was.

00:20:03.624 --> 00:20:05.290 align:middle line:84%
But there are words
that talk about what

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:09.640 align:middle line:84%
we would clump in
a spiritual class.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And the human has
a core or a spirit.

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:20.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there aren't words
to talk about it exactly.

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:24.440 align:middle line:84%
There are words to talk about
it exactly for part of it

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:28.190 align:middle line:84%
and not at all for
other parts of it.

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:29.060 align:middle line:90%
But they're there.

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.260 align:middle line:90%
And they used to be there.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:33.020 align:middle line:90%
We've bastardized the words.

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:36.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But what specifically
was Sheldrake doing at the time

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:37.790 align:middle line:90%
that you met him?

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:39.540 align:middle line:90%
What was it that he gave you?

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: Well, what he had
just done is discovered what

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:48.339 align:middle line:84%
the early fundaments of
the morphogenetic field.

00:20:48.339 --> 00:20:49.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Do you
remember specifically

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:52.400 align:middle line:90%
what was the data at the time?

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: Well, the data was
that animals could evidently

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:03.880 align:middle line:84%
gather data from
some other means.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.140 align:middle line:84%
A lot of animals, for
example, dogs, cats--

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:10.400 align:middle line:84%
I have a cat that
does it perfectly.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.630 align:middle line:84%
I have a cat that I live
about 70 miles from.

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:13.430 align:middle line:90%
And I go up.

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:15.970 align:middle line:90%
And he likes it where he is.

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:17.200 align:middle line:90%
And it's in the wilderness.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And so I go up and visit
him every eight or 10 days,

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:23.720 align:middle line:84%
and have water fountains,
and food fountains,

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:27.454 align:middle line:84%
and stuff like that for him,
and robots that feed him,

00:21:27.454 --> 00:21:29.870 align:middle line:84%
and take care of him, and tell
me if that's not happening.

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And he and I can
talk back and forth

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:36.940 align:middle line:84%
on a computer screen
via the internet.

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:40.700 align:middle line:90%
And so I go up to see him.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And when I decide, oh, good,
I've got some time today

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:50.150 align:middle line:84%
and tomorrow, I'm going
to drive up there,

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:54.860 align:middle line:84%
immediately, I can measure his
heart rate, his breathing rate,

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:59.580 align:middle line:84%
where he moves from where
he sleeps to where we sleep.

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And I can see that
all take place.

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:03.150 align:middle line:90%
He knows it long beforehand.

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And he gets very excited
when I get 10 miles away

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:08.467 align:middle line:84%
and more excited when I'm
coming up the driveway.

00:22:08.467 --> 00:22:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you have
an electronic way

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:11.700 align:middle line:84%
to measure your
cat's vital signs.

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And you can see his response as
you're deciding to go up there.

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:15.690 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERSON: Right.

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:17.648 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, that's a
much more advanced form

00:22:17.648 --> 00:22:19.170 align:middle line:90%
of what Sheldrake did.

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:21.120 align:middle line:84%
He has actually a
book called "Dogs

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.190 align:middle line:84%
Who Know Their Owners
are Coming Home,"

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:26.260 align:middle line:84%
where he found that people
who came home at random times

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.290 align:middle line:84%
that the dog would
preferentially stay right

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:29.360 align:middle line:84%
by the front door
waiting for them--

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.450 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERSON: Exactly.

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:30.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: --whenever
they're about to show up.

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:33.063 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: Oh, he's right
inside the front door.

00:22:33.063 --> 00:22:35.530 align:middle line:84%
I have to knock it
open a little bit

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:37.670 align:middle line:90%
so I don't run over his toes.

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:39.390 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:42.027 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So how did Sheldrake's
work influence you at the time

00:22:42.027 --> 00:22:42.860 align:middle line:90%
when you heard this?

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:46.840 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: Well, I started out
that I wanted to just tell him

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:50.490 align:middle line:84%
the things I'd found out in
his area that obviously in his

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:53.910 align:middle line:84%
writing he wasn't putting
there for some reason,

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:57.450 align:middle line:84%
either he didn't know about it,
or he'd been kind of quieted

00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:00.780 align:middle line:84%
by the agencies that
were interested.

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:03.286 align:middle line:84%
I had a lot of agencies
that were interested.

00:23:03.286 --> 00:23:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And they told me things
that I can talk about

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.660 align:middle line:84%
and can't talk
about, which is going

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:08.640 align:middle line:90%
to be a limiting factor here.

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:09.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yes, for sure.

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:11.976 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: And there are
things that they're doing

00:23:11.976 --> 00:23:13.650 align:middle line:90%
totally unbeknownst to me.

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:17.970 align:middle line:84%
There's things they'll doing,
some parts known to me.

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And I see things coming out
that I taught them 20 years ago

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:25.650 align:middle line:90%
and they finally believe.

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:29.220 align:middle line:84%
Like the show that we
were on seven years ago--

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:32.200 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people writing in
what they thought that I said,

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.980 align:middle line:84%
and where I was right,
or whether I was wrong,

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:38.100 align:middle line:84%
or whether I was indifferent,
or didn't see this.

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.470 align:middle line:84%
There are bright people
out in the world.

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:42.540 align:middle line:84%
But they had no idea
what the background was.

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:46.680 align:middle line:84%
So they let their mouth
override their intellect.

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:54.670 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, there were a lot of
things that I learned from him.

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:57.910 align:middle line:84%
But the biggest thing
that I learned from him

00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:01.979 align:middle line:84%
is how and why he got
into what he was doing.

00:24:01.979 --> 00:24:04.270 align:middle line:84%
I said, where did this guy
come up with this knowledge?

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Because it took me a long
time and a lot of research

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.780 align:middle line:90%
to come up with it.

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:12.550 align:middle line:84%
So I found out about
the fact that he was--

00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:13.420 align:middle line:90%
he'd gotten there.

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.030 align:middle line:90%
He was a bit of a misanthrope.

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:19.200 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have any friends,
and he didn't have any people

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.040 align:middle line:84%
that he knew very
well, and he didn't

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:24.490 align:middle line:84%
know any girls, and
et cetera, et cetera.

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:28.630 align:middle line:84%
So his counselor
there at Cambridge

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:30.990 align:middle line:84%
said, I want you to go
down to this hallway

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:34.150 align:middle line:84%
that's got a bulletin board
with all the lists of the

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:38.800 align:middle line:84%
after school extracurricular
clubs and things like that.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.650 align:middle line:84%
I want you to pick a
group, and join it.

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:42.880 align:middle line:90%
So he went down and looked.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.004 align:middle line:90%
And he's a very bright boy.

00:24:44.004 --> 00:24:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And they were all
kind of dull to him.

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And finally, he
found this group that

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:52.550 align:middle line:84%
had Bertrand Russell
and David Bowen.

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:54.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: These
are all world, world,

00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:59.020 align:middle line:90%
world-famous scientists.

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh, that sounds
like an interesting group.

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.560 align:middle line:90%
Well, he hadn't been there.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.410 align:middle line:90%
This was his freshman year.

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:08.840 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know that there
was a pecking order.

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And these are people you didn't
dare go talk to without making

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:15.940 align:middle line:84%
a two-year appointment, and
having something to show them,

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:17.150 align:middle line:90%
and something to--

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:17.950 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And so he just went in,
and joined the club.

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:21.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, everybody in the
club thought, well,

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.375 align:middle line:84%
nobody's going to
be so supercilious

00:25:24.375 --> 00:25:28.390 align:middle line:84%
as just to come walk into
our club without an invite.

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:32.350 align:middle line:84%
So they all thought, somebody
here invited this guy here.

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, since we're
just about out of time,

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:37.824 align:middle line:84%
did Sheldrake end up
impressing these guys?

00:25:37.824 --> 00:25:39.490 align:middle line:84%
Just can you briefly
fill us in on that?

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:41.055 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: Well,
Sheldrake's very bright.

00:25:41.055 --> 00:25:42.055 align:middle line:90%
And he's very different.

00:25:42.055 --> 00:25:43.840 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't understand
social things--

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:47.860 align:middle line:84%
or didn't then and
probably not so much now.

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:52.030 align:middle line:84%
But one thing was, he
realized when he got in there,

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:55.690 align:middle line:84%
that he was in the wrong
spot and that these guys were

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:58.180 align:middle line:90%
talking way over his head.

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And like I was at
that age, I realized

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:04.060 align:middle line:84%
that I was talking over
everybody else's head.

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And he realized that in
his particular field and me

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:09.015 align:middle line:90%
in my particular field.

00:26:09.015 --> 00:26:11.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So how did that lead to
him doing something different?

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.100 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: So what did he
do-- is he just closed his mouth

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:14.060 align:middle line:90%
and listened, mostly.

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:14.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: I see.

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:16.870 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: And very soon,
he was up to speed with some

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:17.670 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And very soon, he was
contributing to the comments.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:27.740 align:middle line:84%
So what he had was 25 or 30
absolutely brilliant mentors

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:30.030 align:middle line:84%
that didn't know they were
being mentors particularly.

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:30.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:32.830 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: But he had
these brilliant mentors.

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And they were like I
am, in a general field,

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:37.170 align:middle line:84%
rather than in his
specific field.

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:37.970 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Cool.

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:40.345 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERSON: So he learned a
lot of things that were very

00:26:40.345 --> 00:26:43.580 align:middle line:84%
helpful to him in his field from
things that they were finding

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:44.830 align:middle line:90%
out in their scientific field.

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:47.038 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: All right, well,
that's all the time we have

00:26:47.038 --> 00:26:48.660 align:middle line:84%
for in this episode--
some really,

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.270 align:middle line:90%
really fascinating stuff--

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:54.230 align:middle line:84%
getting the whole
back-story here.

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for watching, and
we'll see you next time.
