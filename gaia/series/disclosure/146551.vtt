>>DAVID WILCOCK:
Sperry, welcome back.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.510 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to focus in
more on the shadow side,

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:28.390 align:middle line:10%
because it seems that
people are being misled

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.970 align:middle line:10%
by certain forms of
spiritual teaching

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.070 align:middle line:10%
that are out there right now.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.630 align:middle line:84%
You always have
to think positive.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.850 align:middle line:84%
You always have to
be in a good mood.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.620 align:middle line:84%
If you're not
succeeding, it's bad,

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.020 align:middle line:90%
and success means making money.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And specifically I'm
talking about "The Secret."

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.960 align:middle line:84%
"The Secret," of
course, as we both know,

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.640 align:middle line:84%
put out the idea
that the universe is

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.280 align:middle line:84%
like a cosmic gumball
machine, and all

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.620 align:middle line:84%
you have to do is just
ask, and cornucopia

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.020 align:middle line:90%
will tumble out of the skies.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.500 align:middle line:84%
What do you feel about this
idea that the universe is just

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.660 align:middle line:84%
going to grant you
whatever you want

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.509 align:middle line:84%
and the idea of the
law of attraction?

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:08.800 align:middle line:84%
People say, well, I don't
want to look at the bad stuff

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.912 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not attracting
that into my life.

00:01:10.912 --> 00:01:12.370 align:middle line:10%
>>SPERRY ANDREWS:
As creatures tend

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.310 align:middle line:10%
to withdraw our attention from
what's threatening and painful

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.120 align:middle line:10%
and give it to what's
promising and pleasurable.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.790 align:middle line:10%
And if we divide our
attention that way,

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.180 align:middle line:10%
we actually live in a more
contracted and suppressed state

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.460 align:middle line:10%
because we need to give
equal attention to what

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.610 align:middle line:10%
is threatening and painful.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.050 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's part of our lives.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.780 align:middle line:10%
And we need to digest it and
integrate it into our psyches

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.120 align:middle line:10%
both individually and socially.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And when "The Secret"
says, don't give attention

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.270 align:middle line:84%
to what is negative or dark
because you'll make more of it,

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.120 align:middle line:84%
I think that really is
very serious misinformation

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.610 align:middle line:84%
because you really need
to bring that which

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.760 align:middle line:84%
is dark or negative or
unconscious to consciousness

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.890 align:middle line:90%
through being aware of it.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.809 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise you can't integrate
it and make it conscious.

00:01:59.809 --> 00:02:01.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, let me
play devil's advocate

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.322 align:middle line:90%
for a second just for fun.

00:02:03.322 --> 00:02:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Somebody is going
to say-- somebody

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.919 align:middle line:84%
in the audience watching
this is going to say, well,

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:15.130 align:middle line:84%
you're actually enabling
the bad because attention

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.644 align:middle line:90%
feeds what it's paid to.

00:02:17.644 --> 00:02:19.310 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's called
paying attention.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.760 align:middle line:84%
You're paying the negative
if you pay attention to it.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Well, consciousness
is consciousness,

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.350 align:middle line:84%
whether it's yours or
mine or the universe's.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And everything in existence
is part of consciousness.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And for human beings, our
so-called conscious mind

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.170 align:middle line:84%
is only 3% to 5% of our
neurophysiological psychology,

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.220 align:middle line:90%
as I've said before.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And you know, if we want
to integrate what we're

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.690 align:middle line:84%
unconscious about, which
is 99.9999% or more

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.710 align:middle line:84%
of what there is, we need
to consciously attend to it.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.380 align:middle line:84%
Conscious attention
is quite a bit

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.870 align:middle line:84%
different than
unconscious awareness.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.460 align:middle line:84%
So if we want to integrate
what the universe is already

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.240 align:middle line:84%
embodying, and integrate it
into our personal consciousness

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.660 align:middle line:84%
so that we're not
ignorant of it,

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.520 align:middle line:84%
then we really need to attend
to it in an undivided way

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.920 align:middle line:84%
and experience the potentials of
those negative and dark aspects

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.340 align:middle line:84%
in order to understand
them and have the insight

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.710 align:middle line:90%
into our shadow material.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: I think there's a trap.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.620 align:middle line:84%
Would you agree
that there's a trap

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.940 align:middle line:84%
that people fall into a sort
of metaphysical narcissism,

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.470 align:middle line:84%
where they're hip to the idea
that your awareness that you're

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.500 align:middle line:84%
thinking with is
the universal mind,

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.730 align:middle line:84%
but maybe they're not also
situationally aware of the fact

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.210 align:middle line:84%
that we are all here
and that we are all

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.040 align:middle line:84%
co-creating the tapestry of
reality that we experience.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Yes, I agree
with completely, that our--

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.740 align:middle line:84%
with individuals who have a
lot of psychokinetic behavior

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.290 align:middle line:90%
around them--

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.414 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: That's moving
objects with their mind.

00:04:09.414 --> 00:04:11.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: And they don't even
know that they're doing it,

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.631 align:middle line:84%
the ones that are really
just innately that way.

00:04:14.631 --> 00:04:16.089 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Like the
poltergeist case.

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Like let's
say I was angry at you,

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.960 align:middle line:84%
and something comes across
the room and hits you.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.890 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that I did that to
you because I was angry at you.

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.250 align:middle line:84%
But I think, ah, he
got what he deserved.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is
actually the case.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And these people that have this
natural psychokinetic phenomena

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.240 align:middle line:84%
going on around them are people
that are very highly emotional,

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.540 align:middle line:84%
but they can't express it or
give form to it very well.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.910 align:middle line:84%
So it comes out in
psychokinetic phenomena.

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And so on a mass scale,
you see humanity.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.710 align:middle line:84%
Humanity is extremely emotional
body of seven billion people

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.500 align:middle line:84%
that is not very able
to express itself

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.890 align:middle line:84%
as a single consciousness,
as a unified consciousness.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.200 align:middle line:90%
We're collectively unconscious.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And so we're producing the Earth
changes, as many have said.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And there are examples from,
like, the Iroquois Indians.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.770 align:middle line:84%
They believed they
had a long body,

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.930 align:middle line:84%
and that everyone
in the tribe really

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.940 align:middle line:90%
was elements in that long body.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And if an individual
in the tribe got ill,

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.800 align:middle line:84%
then the tribe would
attend to that individual

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.130 align:middle line:84%
and bring them back into
this collective consciousness

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.340 align:middle line:84%
and heal them that way,
through consciousness.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.410 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't avoid the person
and go, like no, no, no,

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.100 align:middle line:84%
you must be paying attention
to the devil, you know.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.900 align:middle line:84%
We've got to exclude
you and not tend to you,

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.220 align:middle line:84%
just let you fall off
the deep end, you know.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.940 align:middle line:84%
That wouldn't be very loving
or inclusive of the tribe.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the tribe
would slowly fall apart

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.030 align:middle line:84%
that way because of
course, if you're

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.860 align:middle line:84%
under threat of
being exiled, that's

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.080 align:middle line:84%
one of the worst
things you can happen

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.491 align:middle line:84%
to a person living in nature,
in a tribal circumstance.

00:06:00.491 --> 00:06:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It's a death
sentence, basically.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: It's
a death sentence.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.500 align:middle line:84%
And not only is it difficult
to survive by yourself,

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:14.470 align:middle line:84%
but to emotionally be exiled
that way and ostracized is

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.370 align:middle line:90%
horrendous psychologically.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:17.170 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Sure.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: And so to be
inclusive of everything

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.330 align:middle line:84%
in an undivided way, to
really own everything,

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.250 align:middle line:84%
that's what used to
be said, is that we

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.730 align:middle line:84%
need to own whatever it
is that's going on for us.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't own it,
we can't transform it.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:39.590 align:middle line:90%


00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:41.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: The
perspective that you

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:49.400 align:middle line:84%
have would seem to indicate that
our whole concept of failure

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.120 align:middle line:90%
in and of itself is a failure.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.590 align:middle line:84%
How does failure-- is there
such a thing as failure,

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.220 align:middle line:84%
in your view, after having
had a near-death experience

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.190 align:middle line:84%
and trying to reintegrate
fragments of yourself?

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:08.300 align:middle line:84%
Do you think of there being
such a thing as failure?

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And if the average person,
whatever that means,

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.860 align:middle line:84%
thinks that there is
failure in their life, how

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:21.800 align:middle line:84%
does that equate with a
perspective of us actually

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.580 align:middle line:84%
just being part of this
divine universal awareness?

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: My sense, and
I would say the sense of--

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.890 align:middle line:84%
going back thousands
of years-- is

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:34.580 align:middle line:84%
that there is this indivisible
unity that is life,

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:35.750 align:middle line:90%
is the cosmos.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And there's no right and
wrong, in some sense,

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:45.320 align:middle line:84%
because everything is integrated
by this singular consciousness.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.800 align:middle line:84%
It has to be digested
and assimilated and made

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.410 align:middle line:84%
sense of by this
singular consciousness.

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:55.370 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody does
something terrible,

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:59.630 align:middle line:84%
no matter how
terrible, or something

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:03.110 align:middle line:84%
happens to us that's terrible
that we need to integrate,

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:06.590 align:middle line:84%
that whole process of
integration, or healing

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:11.210 align:middle line:84%
from that evil
behavior or whatever,

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:14.210 align:middle line:84%
has to take place as
a learning experience.

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And learning is an
ever-present activity.

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:23.180 align:middle line:84%
So in order to learn,
often we have to unlearn.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And so we unlearn
in the presence

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.550 align:middle line:84%
of this featureless,
imageless consciousness which

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:37.350 align:middle line:84%
is the very root of our
moment to moment awareness.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:40.010 align:middle line:84%
So we present what
we feel and think.

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:41.890 align:middle line:84%
If we're being honest
and transparent,

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:48.560 align:middle line:84%
we allow this ever greater
quality of self awareness

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:53.000 align:middle line:84%
to notice that which
is unconscious in us,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.550 align:middle line:84%
and bring and integrate
that into our consciousness.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So can
there be failure?

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:06.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: So failure is just
another learning experience.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:11.570 align:middle line:84%
The military, for example, they
have these military exercises,

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:15.320 align:middle line:84%
and everybody ends up being
dead in the end, pretty much.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And they film it all on
video, and then they say,

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:21.105 align:middle line:90%
you see how you died there?

00:09:21.105 --> 00:09:22.730 align:middle line:84%
You didn't need to
die because if you'd

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:26.660 align:middle line:84%
done this, done it better,
you wouldn't have died, etc.

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.350 align:middle line:90%
And so same with chess playing.

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:34.400 align:middle line:84%
If you play get somebody that's
better than you and you fail

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.590 align:middle line:84%
again and again
and lose, you learn

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:39.170 align:middle line:84%
to play chess better,
more rapidly than if you

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:41.240 align:middle line:90%
were winning all the time.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.130 align:middle line:84%
So failure is a
very integral part

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:46.070 align:middle line:84%
of learning and
growing and becoming

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:50.030 align:middle line:84%
more competent and
conscious and skilled.

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Do you think that--

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.640 align:middle line:84%
getting back to the
concept of people saying,

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.560 align:middle line:84%
well, I'm not creating
the Earth changes--

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.770 align:middle line:84%
that they would see the
Earth changes as a failure,

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:06.920 align:middle line:84%
or they would see the existence
of a cabal, an Illuminati

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:11.210 align:middle line:84%
cartel running the planet
through the financial system--

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:15.350 align:middle line:84%
do people feel that that
would mean that we as a planet

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:20.670 align:middle line:84%
are a failure, and that's why
they don't want to look at it?

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:25.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: In the same way
we want to possess or go

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:29.720 align:middle line:84%
towards the light, if you will,
go towards what is pleasurable

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:34.070 align:middle line:84%
and promising, as I've said,
that is very natural for us

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:35.450 align:middle line:90%
as creatures.

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:41.090 align:middle line:84%
You can put in a cell,
a petri dish with cells,

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:45.330 align:middle line:84%
and put a toxin near them,
and they'll draw away from it.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.390 align:middle line:84%
Put something that
they do want to eat

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:48.890 align:middle line:90%
and they'll move towards it.

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Or here you're just
describing the actual chemical

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.080 align:middle line:90%
effect on the cells.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Well,
the cells, they know

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.170 align:middle line:84%
whether something is
going to harm them

00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:01.130 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's going to
be nourishing for them.

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:02.960 align:middle line:84%
So they'll withdraw
from what is toxic

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:07.280 align:middle line:84%
and move towards what is
beneficial, if you will.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.800 align:middle line:84%
So people will
move away from what

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:14.780 align:middle line:84%
they imagine is failure,
especially if you begin

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:20.120 align:middle line:84%
to calcify some belief about XYZ
is a failure, like if you don't

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:23.300 align:middle line:84%
have enough money or you're
poor or you're not famous

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:27.300 align:middle line:84%
or something, then you want
to move towards fame and money

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.080 align:middle line:90%
and power.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.090 align:middle line:90%
So that's a very natural thing.

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And I think the Illuminati are
really taking advantage of that

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:39.260 align:middle line:84%
and using these natural
instincts to manipulate

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:44.660 align:middle line:84%
in order to gain and maintain
control over mass populations.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:47.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So people's own
sense of perfectionism,

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.140 align:middle line:84%
and wanting to believe
in a happy ending,

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.140 align:middle line:84%
and wanting to believe
that people are basically

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.780 align:middle line:84%
good at heart, and
that there is a god

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.970 align:middle line:84%
makes them say,
well, God wouldn't

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:58.010 align:middle line:84%
allow there to be a
group that's controlling

00:11:58.010 --> 00:11:59.450 align:middle line:90%
the planet like this.

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:01.970 align:middle line:84%
God wouldn't allow
these things to happen.

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:04.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Well, you
know, the average person

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:05.570 align:middle line:90%
is chronically contracted.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And so what's most
accessible is what they think

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:12.730 align:middle line:84%
and what they
believe on principle.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And so religions that are based
on just swallowing these belief

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:23.810 align:middle line:84%
systems hook, line, and
sinker are very prevalent.

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:28.970 align:middle line:84%
So Christian fundamentalism
or Islamic fundamentalism

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:32.790 align:middle line:84%
are very powerful forces on
the planet, or scientism,

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:39.530 align:middle line:84%
the belief in science as a
dogma, the belief that we're

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:42.770 align:middle line:84%
separate individuals,
when in fact humanity

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:45.590 align:middle line:84%
has a multiple personality
disorder and is

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:47.900 align:middle line:84%
in denial about
the fact that we're

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.480 align:middle line:84%
part of a single greater
body, heart, and mind

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.600 align:middle line:90%
that is really universal.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Let's talk a little
more about that fragmentation.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.070 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to bring in
the concept of failure

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:02.810 align:middle line:84%
because I think if a person
was told that they have

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:06.410 align:middle line:84%
a fragment of their psyche
that they don't normally

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:10.300 align:middle line:84%
have conscious access to that's
drawing away energy from them,

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:12.800 align:middle line:84%
they would say, well, only a
crazy person would have that,

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.600 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not crazy.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:18.900 align:middle line:84%
If I had a fragment in my mind,
if I wasn't a whole person,

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:20.750 align:middle line:84%
I would be a
failure, and I can't

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:22.410 align:middle line:90%
allow myself to be a failure.

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, I must
not be fragmented,

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.500 align:middle line:84%
and I had a wonderful childhood
and I loved my parents,

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.770 align:middle line:84%
and I had lots of
friends in school.

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And I've never
fought with my wife

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:34.130 align:middle line:84%
and I've never had
trouble with my boss.

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:37.730 align:middle line:84%
So let's explore that a
little bit, people's concept

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:41.270 align:middle line:84%
of failure and how
the concept of failure

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:45.500 align:middle line:84%
may encourage fragmentation
of the psyche.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: They say denial
is a river in Egypt, which

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:52.460 align:middle line:90%
is not really what denial is.

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:56.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're avoiding
what we believe is toxic.

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:57.200 align:middle line:90%
We're afraid.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.630 align:middle line:84%
We're withdrawing our
attention from what

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:01.540 align:middle line:90%
is painful and threatening.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And so the multiple personality
is going on within us.

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:07.010 align:middle line:84%
We have all these
sub personalities

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:10.130 align:middle line:84%
which are holding the
bag for all these ways

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:14.690 align:middle line:84%
in which we're afraid to really
face them as a part of ourself.

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:16.670 align:middle line:84%
So we don't want
to look at the fact

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:20.090 align:middle line:84%
that we have quote,
unquote failed.

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:22.450 align:middle line:84%
We want to think,
no, we're succeeding.

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:26.144 align:middle line:84%
And so people are believing
in a fantasy self.

00:14:26.144 --> 00:14:27.560 align:middle line:84%
You know, who they
think they are,

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.050 align:middle line:84%
what they think they're
doing is really neurotic.

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:31.340 align:middle line:90%
It's actually psychotic.

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:35.120 align:middle line:84%
It's actually-- they're cut
off from the actual reality

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.460 align:middle line:84%
that they have these multiple
personalities that they

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:41.220 align:middle line:84%
need to talk to, need
to journal with them.

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.220 align:middle line:84%
They need to get to know them,
bring them to consciousness.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And then when this internal
community, as well as

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:49.370 align:middle line:84%
the external community
of friends and family,

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.890 align:middle line:84%
are in good quality
communication,

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:55.430 align:middle line:84%
then there's this sense of
really genuine well-being.

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:58.100 align:middle line:84%
But like Doctor Colin
Ross, who was the president

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.620 align:middle line:84%
of the International Society
for the Study of Multiple

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:04.550 align:middle line:84%
Personality and Disorder, who
has written a couple of books

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:08.120 align:middle line:84%
on the MKUltra type of
mind control, for example,

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.450 align:middle line:84%
with the Cathy
O'Brien and so forth--

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:13.400 align:middle line:90%
whole interesting area there--

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.220 align:middle line:84%
I spoke with him once and I
talked to him about the idea

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:20.930 align:middle line:84%
that humanity had a multiple
personality disorder,

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:24.050 align:middle line:84%
because people with multiple
personality disorder, when

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:27.080 align:middle line:84%
one personality comes on
and takes executive control

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:31.100 align:middle line:84%
over the body mind, that could
be a six-year-old little girl,

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:34.220 align:middle line:84%
and another personality can then
take over in the same person,

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:37.520 align:middle line:84%
and it can be a 40-year-old
man that speaks six languages.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.230 align:middle line:90%
And eye color can change.

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:43.460 align:middle line:84%
Open lesions on the skin
can appear or disappear.

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.122 align:middle line:84%
Allergies to orange
juice can come and go.

00:15:46.122 --> 00:15:48.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And there's a
completely different set

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.840 align:middle line:84%
of brainwave activities
on MRI scans.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Yes.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.190 align:middle line:84%
So if that can happen
with a single individual,

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:59.600 align:middle line:84%
what's going on between and
among seven billion of us?

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I think if we go back
to Eckhart Tolle, who you've

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:05.610 align:middle line:84%
mentioned before, the
concept of a pain body,

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:08.990 align:middle line:84%
sort of like an overarching
concept for this idea.

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen it in
people who I know.

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:18.470 align:middle line:84%
They do not remember what
is said in an argument

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:22.190 align:middle line:84%
because unless they're in the
state where they're arguing,

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:24.120 align:middle line:84%
they're not really
accessing those memories.

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.089 align:middle line:84%
It's like the memories
are safely held away.

00:16:27.089 --> 00:16:28.130 align:middle line:90%
"Well, I never said that.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:30.230 align:middle line:90%
I never said that."

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:31.820 align:middle line:90%
But I was right there.

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.440 align:middle line:84%
So what do you think
is happening there?

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.700 align:middle line:84%
What is this pain body
that Eckhart Tolle

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.127 align:middle line:90%
was talking about?

00:16:39.127 --> 00:16:40.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Well, I
mean, we definitely

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:42.570 align:middle line:84%
want to identify with
that part of us that

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:47.250 align:middle line:84%
feels most capable obviously,
that feels like I'm OK,

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:49.680 align:middle line:90%
you're OK, everything's OK.

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:55.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, that feels a lot safer
to identify with what seems OK,

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:58.560 align:middle line:84%
whereas the pain body obviously
is not getting the kind

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:02.130 align:middle line:84%
and quality of
identification or attention

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:06.640 align:middle line:84%
that this supposedly
OK sub personality that

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:11.010 align:middle line:84%
is in executive
control of us at that

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:14.430 align:middle line:84%
time when we're dissociating
in the service of the ego,

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:16.230 align:middle line:90%
as they call it.

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:19.530 align:middle line:84%
There's association in the
service of ego and dissociation

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:21.589 align:middle line:90%
in the service of the ego.

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And so you can associate
with the pain body

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:29.080 align:middle line:84%
in the service of maturing
and growing and resolving

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:33.480 align:middle line:84%
the narrow mindedness and
the self-destructive nature

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.070 align:middle line:90%
of your ego.

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:36.990 align:middle line:90%
So we have to mature our egos.

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:38.850 align:middle line:84%
We have to actually
attend to them

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:42.240 align:middle line:84%
see how limited and limiting
they are, how much in denial

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:46.970 align:middle line:84%
they are about what we've
dissociated and suppressed,

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:51.750 align:middle line:84%
and re-invite these painful
memories and traumas

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:54.210 align:middle line:84%
to give them the undivided
attention that they need

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:57.930 align:middle line:84%
to be fully digested and
assimilated and integrated

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:04.260 align:middle line:84%
into this one being that
we are that transcends

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.640 align:middle line:90%
any fragmentation.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:11.310 align:middle line:90%


00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:15.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: This concept of
mass group meditation.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:17.490 align:middle line:90%
Is there something to it?

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:21.720 align:middle line:84%
Can we heal the
planet by recognizing

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.610 align:middle line:84%
that the ego is
looking for an enemy

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:27.150 align:middle line:84%
and that we don't actually
have an enemy per se?

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:29.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Well, as long
as we are identified

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.370 align:middle line:84%
with only a piece of
all that we actually

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:35.760 align:middle line:84%
are individually and
indivisibly together,

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.550 align:middle line:84%
we have a reason
to be in danger.

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:39.810 align:middle line:90%
We are in danger.

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:43.020 align:middle line:84%
We're deep in the sixth
mass extinction that's

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:47.250 align:middle line:84%
being brought about by us
because of our fragmentation

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:50.190 align:middle line:84%
and this piecemeal
kind of consciousness.

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:52.650 align:middle line:84%
We're missing the
peace, P-E-A-C-E,

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:55.590 align:middle line:84%
that we need to be feeling
together in order to have

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:58.290 align:middle line:84%
a peaceful civilization,
have one that functions

00:18:58.290 --> 00:18:59.850 align:middle line:90%
in a sustainable--

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:10.500 align:middle line:84%
Faith is-- radiating that faith
and that peace that you are

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.050 align:middle line:90%
going to be OK--

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:15.170 align:middle line:84%
really does influence
the environment.

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:18.140 align:middle line:84%
And when they have these group
meditations of, you know,

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.880 align:middle line:84%
7,000 or 8,000 people
gathered together,

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:28.560 align:middle line:84%
it affects the social indices
in a wide spectrum of ways.

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:33.930 align:middle line:84%
The economic index is
benefiting more people.

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:38.190 align:middle line:84%
There's less crime,
and many other elements

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:middle line:84%
that show consistent benefit
when people are conscious

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.680 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And as you know, there's
been nearly 40 studies that

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.710 align:middle line:84%
have demonstrated that
that were organized

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:52.410 align:middle line:84%
by these neuroscientists
and physicists,

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:55.110 align:middle line:84%
and psychologists of the
Maharishi International

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:57.630 align:middle line:90%
University.

00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And John Hagelin is in
charge, essentially,

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:06.979 align:middle line:84%
there, who ran for president
on the Natural Law party.

00:20:06.979 --> 00:20:09.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Let's talk about
this a little bit more.

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:12.540 align:middle line:84%
I want to make sure we don't
brush over it too quickly.

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:14.760 align:middle line:84%
The particular data
point that I've

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.620 align:middle line:84%
used the most, that
John Hagelin actually

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:18.690 align:middle line:84%
used when he was
running for president,

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:22.560 align:middle line:84%
was a group of 7,000
people meditated together,

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:26.700 align:middle line:84%
and according to statistics
from Rand Corporation,

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:29.550 align:middle line:84%
the overall index of
terrorist activity on Earth--

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:32.190 align:middle line:84%
there's a fairly
moderate baseline

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:35.130 align:middle line:84%
that they can measure how
much terrorism is occurring.

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:36.660 align:middle line:84%
During the week
that they did this--

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:39.820 align:middle line:84%
7,000 people were
meditating in one area--

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:45.960 align:middle line:84%
worldwide, 72% less
terrorist activity.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.190 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And the question
becomes-- you're

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:52.510 align:middle line:84%
saying that we have multiple
personality disorder

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:56.580 align:middle line:90%
as a human civilization.

00:20:56.580 --> 00:21:01.170 align:middle line:84%
This suggests that what
those 7,000 people were doing

00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:03.120 align:middle line:84%
has a disproportionate
effect on everyone,

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:06.620 align:middle line:84%
as if we're all
sharing one mind.

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:11.340 align:middle line:84%
Now what's so magical
about these 7,000 people?

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:12.990 align:middle line:84%
Are they doing
anything spectacular?

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:16.050 align:middle line:84%
Are they special
yogis and ascended

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:18.990 align:middle line:90%
beings that are levitating?

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:21.180 align:middle line:84%
What is the process
that's being done here?

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:22.050 align:middle line:90%
What's the magic?

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:25.126 align:middle line:90%
What's the secret sauce?

00:21:25.126 --> 00:21:27.000 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Well, they're
noticing the quality

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.470 align:middle line:90%
and presence of their noticing.

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And noticing
quantum mechanically

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:33.000 align:middle line:84%
in physics, the
physics of the cosmos,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.580 align:middle line:84%
is that there is this aspect
that is equally everywhere.

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:41.130 align:middle line:84%
We always tend to think
that things are localized

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:44.100 align:middle line:84%
and objectify, you're
there, I'm here.

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.980 align:middle line:84%
But there is that which
is at the very basis

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:50.460 align:middle line:84%
of our consciousness that we're
utilizing right this moment,

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:52.260 align:middle line:90%
which is spaceless and timeless.

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, it can be
omnipresent and omnipotent,

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:56.340 align:middle line:90%
and omniscient.

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:58.370 align:middle line:90%
It acts like a mirror.

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:01.680 align:middle line:84%
Imagine mirroring,
that at every level

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.650 align:middle line:84%
there is a particle, or
appearance of a particle,

00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:06.960 align:middle line:90%
and actually no particles.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:11.520 align:middle line:84%
But they behave like particles,
and that at the same time there

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:15.840 align:middle line:84%
this manifest
behavior, there is also

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:19.120 align:middle line:84%
at the same time and moment,
this mirror-like behavior.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And so the whole of space,
time, energy, and matter,

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:23.340 align:middle line:84%
the entire universe
is being mirrored

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:25.910 align:middle line:90%
by this dimensionless dynamic.

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:31.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: If it's neither
a particle nor a wave,

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:35.470 align:middle line:84%
how does that affect the concept
of me for the average person?

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:37.242 align:middle line:84%
When they are
confronted with this--

00:22:37.242 --> 00:22:39.200 align:middle line:84%
what for a lot of people,
they're going to say,

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.470 align:middle line:84%
well, that was all geek
speak, because we're now

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:43.810 align:middle line:84%
talking at a very high
intellectual level here.

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:45.880 align:middle line:84%
It's going to go over a
lot of people's heads.

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:49.780 align:middle line:84%
But how does this ground
back into the concept

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:51.070 align:middle line:90%
of the individual?

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:55.015 align:middle line:84%
And what can people
learn from what

00:22:55.015 --> 00:22:56.890 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
scientifically, that this

00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:58.660 align:middle line:84%
actually is the way
the universe is?

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:02.000 align:middle line:84%
What does that mean for a
person trying to pay their bills

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.189 align:middle line:90%
and feed their family?

00:23:04.189 --> 00:23:05.980 align:middle line:10%
>>ANDREWS: I think one
of the big obstacles

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:13.120 align:middle line:10%
is that we want to claim to
our imagination, who we think

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.020 align:middle line:10%
we are, what we
think we're doing,

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:19.510 align:middle line:10%
which is a manifest form,
whereas this awakeness is

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:21.670 align:middle line:10%
formless and imageless.

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And we need to get to know
that because by doing that,

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:29.650 align:middle line:84%
we begin to realize what these
dimensionless points are.

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:33.420 align:middle line:84%
They're actually vestiges
of the primordial void out

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:37.060 align:middle line:84%
of which manifestation
materialized.

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And we can actually understand
how that void collapsed

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:45.460 align:middle line:84%
by first appearing as a
dimensionless point which

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:51.040 align:middle line:84%
has no energy and no location
in the traditional sense.

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:54.190 align:middle line:84%
But it is a location,
even though it

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:57.520 align:middle line:90%
has no wavelength or frequency.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:03.100 align:middle line:84%
It's a stillness, like
Eckhart Tolle talks

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:06.670 align:middle line:84%
about, this silence which the
ancients have talked about,

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:11.620 align:middle line:84%
that we are ultimately,
at our very most core.

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And by recognizing this
stillness and this silence,

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:17.350 align:middle line:84%
which is non-manifest,
which isn't anything.

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:20.080 align:middle line:84%
The Buddhists talk about it
as this primordial emptiness

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:21.640 align:middle line:90%
that everything came from.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:25.990 align:middle line:84%
They call it sat purusha, and
that the light of consciousness

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:28.360 align:middle line:90%
emerges from this point.

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And then all points that
expand from that point

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:35.290 align:middle line:84%
are really all still
the same point.

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:37.480 align:middle line:84%
So really everything
in manifestation

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:42.310 align:middle line:84%
is still connected to this
source or origin, which

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:46.630 align:middle line:84%
is dimensionless, which actually
frees us to be free spirits.

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:52.060 align:middle line:84%
We are this which is localizing
the non-local whole as that

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:56.500 align:middle line:84%
which is dimensionless, as
this observer of manifestation

00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:01.190 align:middle line:84%
as really nothing in
particular, nothing measurable.

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:07.050 align:middle line:84%
We are ineffable and boundless,
and indivisible, and immortal,

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:07.850 align:middle line:90%
ultimately.

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And so for the average
person to realize--

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:12.880 align:middle line:90%
and all people, our species--

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:16.510 align:middle line:84%
to realize that we are
this uncreated, unborn--

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:18.310 align:middle line:84%
as the ancients
have talked about--

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:24.190 align:middle line:84%
immortal being that is ever
present and unchanging, that we

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:26.530 align:middle line:84%
are then, through the
quality of our perceptions,

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:30.250 align:middle line:84%
what we choose to pay attention
to, how well we pay attention

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:34.360 align:middle line:84%
individually and together, we
can actually make it all up.

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And we've actually
been making it all up.

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:41.170 align:middle line:84%
It's like we're in the sandbox
with our bucket and our shovel,

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:43.130 align:middle line:90%
playing like children.

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And when we realize
that we really

00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:50.440 align:middle line:84%
are free to co-create this
world more and more consciously,

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.050 align:middle line:84%
and that's really what
human evolution is about,

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:56.380 align:middle line:84%
then the average Joe
with their wife and kids

00:25:56.380 --> 00:26:00.940 align:middle line:84%
realize that they're
completely free-spirited.

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:03.100 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing to be afraid of.

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:06.550 align:middle line:84%
We need to come into
this unitive awakeness

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:08.080 align:middle line:84%
that the ancients
have talked about,

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:11.840 align:middle line:84%
and that I've been exploring
for 30 years with these groups.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And what we notice
together and access,

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:18.910 align:middle line:84%
this commonly sensed
intelligence, this one

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:22.060 align:middle line:84%
infinitely,
incomparably unique form

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:25.360 align:middle line:84%
that we appear to be as space,
time, energy and matter, mind

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.350 align:middle line:90%
and body.

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And we can, at the
same time in a moment,

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:31.780 align:middle line:84%
experience our formless,
eternal, unchanging nature,

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:37.000 align:middle line:84%
which gives us power to
recreate and shape and sculpt

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.100 align:middle line:84%
the reality that we
are experiencing.

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:44.760 align:middle line:90%


00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: A conventional
view about problems,

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:50.760 align:middle line:84%
like, let's look at
the national deficit.

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.340 align:middle line:84%
We're racking up this
tremendous, tremendous debt.

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:55.290 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at climate change.

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:59.400 align:middle line:84%
The world seems to be
unraveling at the seams.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at international
relations and politics and war.

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:08.820 align:middle line:84%
We have been conditioned to
believe that these problems are

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:13.115 align:middle line:84%
complex and they require
complex solutions,

00:27:13.115 --> 00:27:16.380 align:middle line:84%
that the solution must involve
spending a lot of money,

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:20.520 align:middle line:84%
taking a lot of time, all this
thinking, all this intricacy,

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:23.730 align:middle line:84%
poring over the fine
points in the contracts

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:27.730 align:middle line:90%
that we signed 1,000 years ago.

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:33.000 align:middle line:84%
How do we bridge this bias
that the average person would

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.940 align:middle line:84%
have to thinking that
these problems are

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:39.450 align:middle line:84%
so complicated
and insurmountable

00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:42.510 align:middle line:84%
with the simplicity of
something like the meditation

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:44.550 align:middle line:84%
effect, where people
simply go into that state

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:47.460 align:middle line:84%
of meditative consciousness
and the problems in the world

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:50.100 align:middle line:90%
seem to be solving themselves?

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Do we need complexity to
solve the world's problems?

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Do we need to be thinking it
through in great, great depth

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:57.320 align:middle line:90%
and detail?

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:59.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Well, we
are ever more complex

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:01.630 align:middle line:84%
every single moment
because we are really

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:05.830 align:middle line:84%
co-creating this universe
with everything in it.

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:07.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's increasing
in complexity.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:12.480 align:middle line:84%
It's expanding and accelerating
by scientific measure,

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:13.780 align:middle line:90%
so forth.

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:16.240 align:middle line:84%
But as we become more
and more complex,

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:19.620 align:middle line:84%
we need to access our
utter simplicity, which

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:21.420 align:middle line:90%
is this dimensionless quality.

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:25.680 align:middle line:84%
In order to really anchor this
ever increasing complexity

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:30.210 align:middle line:84%
of creation,
manifest creation, we

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:33.610 align:middle line:84%
are able, because we're
noticing more every moment,

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:35.340 align:middle line:90%
we're more capable.

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:38.460 align:middle line:84%
Our ability to observe is
becoming ever more refined

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:39.690 align:middle line:90%
every moment.

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And we're able to notice
the fineness, just like we

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:47.790 align:middle line:84%
have engineered automobile
tires to spin around a very

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:49.600 align:middle line:90%
dimensionless axis.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And so there's no
wobble in the tire.

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:54.960 align:middle line:84%
Humanity is right in
the midst of learning

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.780 align:middle line:84%
how to share a common
axis which is really

00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:59.580 align:middle line:90%
omnipresent, and omnipotent.

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:02.370 align:middle line:84%
It's what gives us
our omniscient ability

00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:05.250 align:middle line:84%
to share a commonly
sensed intelligence

00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:08.160 align:middle line:84%
as a species, which
takes us out of conflict,

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:11.250 align:middle line:84%
out of contentiousness, and
into this golden age, which

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:15.087 align:middle line:84%
has been promised by seers for
hundreds or thousands of years.

00:29:15.087 --> 00:29:17.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Do you really believe
that people are going for that?

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:19.290 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems like the
good are getting better

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:20.540 align:middle line:90%
and the bad are getting worse.

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:23.670 align:middle line:84%
It seems like society is
becoming more polarized.

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:25.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Well, as Eckhart
Tolle said, you know,

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:29.840 align:middle line:84%
it's getting worse at the same
time that it's getting better.

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.370 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's paradoxical.

00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:33.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the people
that have a lot

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:36.900 align:middle line:84%
to integrate into their
consciousness, of course,

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:39.180 align:middle line:84%
are going to feel
like victimized.

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:41.460 align:middle line:84%
They're going to feel
helpless and powerless

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:44.520 align:middle line:84%
and overwhelmed
by this digestion

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:47.909 align:middle line:84%
and assimilation individually
and on a mass level.

00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:49.950 align:middle line:84%
They're going to feel it's
completely impossible,

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:53.580 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to
hell in a hand basket.

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.170 align:middle line:90%
And then there's going to be--

00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:56.880 align:middle line:84%
there are relatively
few people that

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.340 align:middle line:84%
are going to be visionaries,
that are going to see--

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:02.550 align:middle line:84%
as cells in the
body of humanity--

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:05.190 align:middle line:84%
are going to see
that we can wake up,

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:10.290 align:middle line:84%
and how we can help popularize
this capacity that we share,

00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:11.600 align:middle line:90%
all of us.

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.350 align:middle line:84%
But there's going
to be, inevitably,

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:17.640 align:middle line:84%
that sense that people are going
to see enemies in other people

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:19.590 align:middle line:90%
because they feel so helpless.

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:23.490 align:middle line:84%
When you feel contracted
and you feel isolated,

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:26.340 align:middle line:84%
the tendency is to be
paranoid and to think

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:30.120 align:middle line:84%
that everything around you is
coming to get you or whatever.

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And then in extreme
cases, people

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:36.510 align:middle line:84%
get completely schizophrenic
and crazy about it

00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:38.880 align:middle line:84%
and start imagining
things and actually seeing

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:41.820 align:middle line:90%
enemies and Satan everywhere.

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:44.910 align:middle line:84%
So the fundamentalists
are really

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:46.710 align:middle line:90%
having a hard time right now.

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:48.110 align:middle line:90%
And so is the power elite.

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:49.526 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they've
been the ones that

00:30:49.526 --> 00:30:52.170 align:middle line:84%
have been trying to
manage the situation

00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:55.140 align:middle line:90%
and any kind of group that is--

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:56.940 align:middle line:84%
especially secretive
groups that have been

00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:59.580 align:middle line:90%
trying to gain an advantage--

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:04.590 align:middle line:84%
as we wake up to a commonly
sensed consciousness

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:07.680 align:middle line:84%
and realize that that's what
we've always been and always

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:11.130 align:middle line:84%
will be, and we begin
to be noticed together

00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:13.140 align:middle line:84%
in a fully embodied
way as a species,

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:16.110 align:middle line:84%
that will spread like
the dawn coming up.

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And even the most evil
and most fragmented

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:26.580 align:middle line:84%
will begin to feel this
realization and illumination

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:34.080 align:middle line:84%
to a sense of, really, that they
don't need to be controlling,

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:36.750 align:middle line:84%
and they don't need to
be hurting and harming

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:39.600 align:middle line:84%
other people, and living
off other people's suffering

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:44.580 align:middle line:84%
like these sadomasochists that
literally are so unable to feel

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:47.760 align:middle line:84%
themselves that they have to
hurt others on a mass level

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:50.280 align:middle line:84%
in order to feel
anything at all.

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:53.100 align:middle line:84%
But they've been an
integral part of our growth,

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:56.610 align:middle line:84%
because we need to forgive
them because they are really

00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:59.520 align:middle line:84%
just doing what all of us have
been doing but at a much more

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:01.270 align:middle line:90%
extreme level.

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And we've been hiding from
the pain in our bodies

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:06.480 align:middle line:90%
and our hearts and our minds.

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And they're just doing it
for the whole of humanity.

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:11.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Can you
give the audience

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:13.680 align:middle line:84%
some pointers as
to how they would

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:16.320 align:middle line:90%
create this state of awareness?

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.270 align:middle line:90%
Is it a meditation practice?

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And what would they be doing
if they want to be at home,

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:25.110 align:middle line:84%
and they want to create a
resonant frequency that's going

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:26.339 align:middle line:90%
to help improve the planet?

00:32:26.339 --> 00:32:27.380 align:middle line:90%
What would they be doing?

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:29.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Thank you
for that question.

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.170 align:middle line:90%
It's extremely simple.

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:34.560 align:middle line:84%
We've developed this, thousands
of people over the last 30

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:36.750 align:middle line:84%
years that I've been
facilitating this experience

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:41.870 align:middle line:84%
with, we've got it down to as
simple as it could possibly be.

00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:46.530 align:middle line:84%
It's basically replicating
what happens in

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:49.890 align:middle line:84%
meditation when it works,
and translating that

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:52.500 align:middle line:84%
into what you can do
as a group of people,

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:56.940 align:middle line:84%
whether it's your family, your
coworkers or friends, or just

00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:00.300 align:middle line:84%
you with your lover or
best friend or whatever.

00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:03.010 align:middle line:84%
But it can work throughout
the whole of humanity.

00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:05.370 align:middle line:84%
You can have these
pods of people

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:09.330 align:middle line:84%
doing this, any group of
people, like 12 step groups come

00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:10.380 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:12.960 align:middle line:84%
Miscellaneous people, total
strangers meet each other

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.720 align:middle line:84%
and they have this
healing experience.

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:19.450 align:middle line:84%
This is like the 13th
step, if you will.

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And all you have to do
is have a conversation

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:25.920 align:middle line:84%
according to certain
guidelines, where

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:31.260 align:middle line:84%
you don't refer to the past or
to the future when you speak.

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:34.020 align:middle line:84%
What you talk about, just like
if you were having a business

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:36.792 align:middle line:84%
meeting where you talk about
the bottom line, like, you know,

00:33:36.792 --> 00:33:39.000 align:middle line:84%
how are we going to make
more money as a corporation?

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.010 align:middle line:84%
Instead of talking
about money and what

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:44.580 align:middle line:84%
we can get for
ourselves, we describe

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:47.120 align:middle line:84%
with our verbal,
analytic left brain

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:52.110 align:middle line:84%
what it is that we're
experiencing as awareness.

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:57.090 align:middle line:84%
So we give our verbal, analytic
left brain something to do,

00:33:57.090 --> 00:34:00.660 align:middle line:84%
which causes it to become
involved with this formless,

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:03.660 align:middle line:84%
imageless awakeness, which
is uniting everything.

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:05.640 align:middle line:84%
It's where everything
is happening.

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:07.590 align:middle line:84%
Everything is always
happening in awakeness.

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:10.050 align:middle line:84%
It's been that way since
we were little babies.

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:11.880 align:middle line:84%
Every moment of our
life, everything

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:15.120 align:middle line:84%
has always happened
in this awakeness.

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to awake to
it through this exercise,

00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:20.030 align:middle line:84%
we realize that your
awakeness and my awakeness

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:22.050 align:middle line:84%
are not two separate
awakenesses.

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:23.670 align:middle line:84%
There's really
only one awakeness

00:34:23.670 --> 00:34:25.380 align:middle line:90%
and always ever has been.

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we've looked
for this unconditional love

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.419 align:middle line:84%
and trust and unity
with our parents,

00:34:30.419 --> 00:34:34.980 align:middle line:84%
is by just sharing
undivided attention with us,

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:37.590 align:middle line:84%
we feel their love,
and they feel our love.

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And we feel this
beautiful happiness

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:41.580 align:middle line:84%
as children with
our parents when

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:44.639 align:middle line:84%
there's a proper
conscious relationship.

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:46.800 align:middle line:84%
So we're practicing
a way of bringing

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:50.610 align:middle line:84%
about this unconditional eternal
love which is ever present,

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:51.929 align:middle line:90%
always been present.

00:34:51.929 --> 00:34:55.449 align:middle line:84%
And we're gaining access to
it by giving attention to it.

00:34:55.449 --> 00:34:58.770 align:middle line:84%
So I look into your awareness
and you look into mine.

00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:01.550 align:middle line:84%
We look with both our
eyes, to begin with,

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:04.080 align:middle line:84%
into the left eye
of our partner.

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And we create partner pairs,
and we each gaze and speak

00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:11.910 align:middle line:90%
in turn, one at a time.

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And over the course of
the minimum of 90 minutes

00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:20.790 align:middle line:84%
together-- but it's better to do
it for longer, like two hours.

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:23.280 align:middle line:84%
Three or four hours is
even much, much better,

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:26.640 align:middle line:84%
because we have to
shift the momentum

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:29.930 align:middle line:84%
and conditioning of this
separative way of paying

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:30.730 align:middle line:90%
attention.

00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:34.860 align:middle line:84%
We have to change our
attentional style by attending

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:37.500 align:middle line:90%
in an undevided way together.

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's said that we're
going from the head

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:43.410 align:middle line:84%
to the heart that's the greatest
journey we ever go through.

00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And we want to be able to
get the head and the heart

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:49.750 align:middle line:84%
functioning together where
we're sentiently, emotionally,

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:53.040 align:middle line:84%
psychologically, intuitively,
mentally experiencing

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:57.000 align:middle line:84%
them as a unity, not
only alone but together.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.330 align:middle line:84%
So we're gazing into the
left eye to begin with.

00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And then after a while we
can gaze into both eyes.

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:04.260 align:middle line:90%
Becomes very relaxing.

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:06.475 align:middle line:84%
And we just take
turns in a group,

00:36:06.475 --> 00:36:09.390 align:middle line:84%
let's say a group
of eight people.

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:12.030 align:middle line:84%
You don't speak
again after you've

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:15.300 align:middle line:84%
spoken until everybody else
in the group has spoken.

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And you just speak
about awareness

00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:20.070 align:middle line:84%
but by attempting
to describe it.

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's virtually
indescribable.

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:26.490 align:middle line:84%
But by attempting to describe
it, you become humbled.

00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:29.450 align:middle line:84%
You begin to notice your
awareness and your partner's

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:34.160 align:middle line:84%
awareness as one
single awareness.

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And you start describing
this sense of shared

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:41.120 align:middle line:84%
empathic information and
interconnectedness and silence

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:43.309 align:middle line:84%
and stillness that's
at the very core.

00:36:43.309 --> 00:36:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to feel it
in your hearts together.

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:49.010 align:middle line:84%
You begin to feel it in every
cell of your body together.

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And you go into this shared
sensitivity together.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And there's this pure
intelligence joy there.

00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:57.770 align:middle line:90%
Joy naturally arises.

00:36:57.770 --> 00:37:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And this loving kindness
and pure intelligence

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:03.780 align:middle line:84%
and the separate self,
the separate ego,

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:07.480 align:middle line:84%
which is normally so isolated
and afraid in seeing the other

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:11.110 align:middle line:84%
and distrusting the other,
is nowhere to be found.

00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:13.340 align:middle line:84%
After about 15, 20
minutes of the exercise,

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:15.740 align:middle line:90%
it's like, where did my ego go?

00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:17.230 align:middle line:90%
There's no ego anymore.

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:18.850 align:middle line:90%
There's just experiencing.

00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:21.830 align:middle line:84%
So the subject and
the object disappear,

00:37:21.830 --> 00:37:23.840 align:middle line:84%
and they disappear
into the verb,

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:26.900 align:middle line:84%
into the action of
experiencing, observing,

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:29.630 align:middle line:90%
of feeling, of thinking.

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:31.970 align:middle line:84%
The experience of
thinking is going on,

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:34.370 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't really
matter what you're thinking.

00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:36.950 align:middle line:84%
You experience the energy
of thinking, the energy

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:44.000 align:middle line:84%
of sensing, feeling, being,
loving, existing, coexisting,

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.640 align:middle line:90%
watching.

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:51.290 align:middle line:84%
All these verbs become what
is central in the foreground

00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:53.990 align:middle line:84%
of your experience and
your shared experience.

00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And you explore that
with your friends

00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.850 align:middle line:90%
or whatever group you assemble.

00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And you just keep going
round and around like that

00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:07.640 align:middle line:84%
and keep talking
about awakeness.

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find that you enter
into this cosmic consciousness

00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:14.630 align:middle line:84%
that would have taken you
days and days of meditation

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:17.390 align:middle line:84%
to get to, and probably
would have never even gotten

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:19.670 align:middle line:84%
there because you would
have been so overwhelmed

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:21.950 align:middle line:84%
by the fragmentation
of your own thought.

00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:24.260 align:middle line:84%
But when you do it
as a group, your mind

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:26.120 align:middle line:84%
goes silent almost
immediately because

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.190 align:middle line:84%
of the magnitude of
your awareness and mine,

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:29.690 align:middle line:90%
even right now.

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:31.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking without thinking.

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:35.370 align:middle line:84%
It's just this knowing
is able to speak.

00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really not
Sperry that's speaking.

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:42.680 align:middle line:10%
It's our knowing that's able to
relate to itself through words

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:45.020 align:middle line:10%
pointing at what is
really nonverbal,

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:48.230 align:middle line:10%
which is really something
which really transcends

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:52.010 align:middle line:10%
the limits of thought
and self-concept.

00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:54.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So where can
people find out more about--

00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:57.470 align:middle line:84%
obviously this is a topic you've
spent many years developing.

00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:58.970 align:middle line:84%
You've had a lot
of success with it.

00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:01.880 align:middle line:84%
You've been able to transform
individuals and groups.

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Where do people find
out more information

00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:06.830 align:middle line:84%
if they want to learn more about
your technique and practice it?

00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:11.150 align:middle line:10%
>>ANDREWS: You can go
to the Human Connection

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:15.440 align:middle line:10%
Institute, which I
founded over 20 years ago.

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.510 align:middle line:84%
On there you can find
my email address.

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:18.410 align:middle line:90%
You can write to me.

00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And there are materials there
on that website you can look at.

00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:23.510 align:middle line:90%
There's videos there.

00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:27.440 align:middle line:84%
You can see artwork that if
you look at it together and see

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.480 align:middle line:84%
what you both see in
it, will bring you

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:33.410 align:middle line:84%
into a sense of shared
telepathic and somatic

00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:34.820 align:middle line:90%
intelligence.

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And there are published essays
there, peer reviewed articles,

00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:44.540 align:middle line:84%
and scientific research
that you can take a look at,

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:46.460 align:middle line:84%
and this film that
we talked about,

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:50.270 align:middle line:84%
which brings theater
audiences into a commonly

00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:51.817 align:middle line:90%
sensed consciousness.

00:39:51.817 --> 00:39:53.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, Sperry
Andrews, I want to thank you

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:55.030 align:middle line:90%
for coming out here.

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And this has been a real
privilege and an honor.

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.750 align:middle line:90%
So thank you very much.

00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:59.166 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Well,
it's a real honor

00:39:59.166 --> 00:40:01.520 align:middle line:90%
