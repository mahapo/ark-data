Anger is a result of thinking that we have been unfairly treated or disrespected, or that others have broken or fallen short of your rules, standards or expectations, and you won’t stand for it. Thinking this way can lead you to feel angry, which stimulates the body’s adrenaline response which is your body’s way of helping you to cope with either fighting or running away (‘fight or flight’ response).\tWe respond by acting or feeling an urge to act, in sometimes a threatening or aggressive way.  In this session we will help you to gain control of your emotions by helping you control your initial instinctive anger responses.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) consists of two main parts: obsessions and compulsions.  Obsessions are unwelcome thoughts, urges, worries or doubts that repeatedly appear in your mind which can make you feel very anxious.  Compulsions are repetitive activities that you do to reduce the anxiety caused by the obsession. It could be something like repeatedly checking a door is locked, repeating a specific phrase in your head or repeatedly washing hands.  Your mind thinks it’s helping you to be less anxious by repeating rituals but ultimately it’s feeding the sensations. In this session we will use the rewind technique to teach your mind to disassociate from the learnt cognitive patterns that your brain has become accustomed to so you no longer feel the need to react in the same way.
