[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.590 align:middle line:84%
>> You are listening to the
Jaw Clenching Mind Talk audio.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.060 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.670 align:middle line:84%
But before it
does, I'd just like

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.970 align:middle line:84%

powerful hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.300 align:middle line:84%

safe and comfortable place,

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.160 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions, where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.170 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.040 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.260 align:middle line:84%
will alert you and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.750 align:middle line:84%
Do remember to listen
to this Mind Talk audio

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.320 align:middle line:84%
several times to get the
most impact from the audio.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And please don't
forget to rate how

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.030 align:middle line:90%
you feel after each session.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.840 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
there's nothing at all

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.630 align:middle line:84%
you need to do apart
from close your eyes,

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.170 align:middle line:84%
relax, and let go,
and really enjoy

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.730 align:middle line:84%
those peaceful feelings and all
the benefits that come with it.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.600 align:middle line:84%
Make yourself as
comfortable as possible.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.995 align:middle line:84%
And concentrate on
the sound of my voice.

00:01:30.995 --> 00:01:33.650 align:middle line:90%


00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And begin by drawing in
a long, slow, deep breath

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.940 align:middle line:90%
in through your nose.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.990 align:middle line:90%
Hold the breath for a moment.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And now slightly open your
mouth and release all the air

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.980 align:middle line:84%
from your body in a
long, low, deep sigh.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And relax allowing your
lungs to naturally deflate

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.803 align:middle line:84%
as your body sinks into
gentle relaxation now.

00:02:05.803 --> 00:02:09.430 align:middle line:90%


00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.550 align:middle line:90%
And you can release any tension.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.530 align:middle line:84%
Relax and let go as I
guide you through a journey

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:25.560 align:middle line:84%
of relaxation, a journey that
you will find very beneficial

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.120 align:middle line:90%
for your overall well-being.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.590 align:middle line:90%


00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.440 align:middle line:84%
You're going to start
this calming experience

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.635 align:middle line:84%
by first relaxing your
whole body-mind system.

00:02:37.635 --> 00:02:40.470 align:middle line:90%


00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's true to say that the
simple act of relaxing the body

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:51.090 align:middle line:84%
and mind has a positive knock-on
effect, because how you think

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.360 align:middle line:90%
determines how you feel.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And how you feel influences
the world around you.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And how you choose
to think today

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.097 align:middle line:84%
affects your decisions
from here on in.

00:03:04.097 --> 00:03:06.780 align:middle line:90%


00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.320 align:middle line:84%
So to make my
assurances your reality,

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.370 align:middle line:84%
let's begin by
focusing your attention

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.670 align:middle line:90%
at the very top of your head.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.610 align:middle line:84%
Attention often starts at
the scalp and the neck.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.810 align:middle line:84%
So mentally and physically,
allow all the muscles

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.170 align:middle line:84%
around the top of your
head to relax now.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.440 align:middle line:90%


00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.040 align:middle line:84%
Letting all the tension
simply dissolve.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.350 align:middle line:90%


00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:48.620 align:middle line:84%
As you start to tune into
your body-mind system,

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:55.130 align:middle line:84%
just that any tension you may
be holding to release now.

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.330 align:middle line:84%
Allow your brain to relax,
the left and the right

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.330 align:middle line:84%
lobes of the brain
just releasing.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:08.930 align:middle line:84%
Such a simple thought, yet so
profound and so significant.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.880 align:middle line:90%
Just letting go completely.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.690 align:middle line:90%


00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:20.240 align:middle line:84%
Drifting further and further
down, nobody wanting anything.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.040 align:middle line:90%
Nobody needing anything.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.735 align:middle line:90%
This is your time to relax.

00:04:23.735 --> 00:04:27.460 align:middle line:90%


00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.350 align:middle line:84%
Taking the relaxation
into the face now allowing

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.120 align:middle line:84%
all of your facial
muscles to feel loose.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:43.180 align:middle line:84%
Feel your brow relaxing,
your forehead smoothing out,

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.180 align:middle line:84%
the back of your eyes
relaxing, tiny muscles

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.400 align:middle line:84%
around your eyes and eyelids,
down into your cheeks

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.370 align:middle line:90%
and into your jaw muscles.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.280 align:middle line:90%
Just releasing and letting go.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.350 align:middle line:90%


00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.690 align:middle line:84%
Allowing your
tongue to fall away

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.600 align:middle line:90%
from the roof of your mouth.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And should you find you need
to swallow, just do that

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.450 align:middle line:84%
now and drift down, and
down, deeper, and deeper

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.550 align:middle line:90%
into blissful relaxation.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.130 align:middle line:90%


00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.890 align:middle line:84%
The more you physically
relax, the more

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.120 align:middle line:90%
you can mentally relax.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And when you can
mentally relax, you

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.300 align:middle line:90%
can think much more clearly.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And when you think more clearly,
your life becomes clearer.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.450 align:middle line:90%
You make better decisions.

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.565 align:middle line:84%
And you're much more in
control of your days.

00:05:45.565 --> 00:05:49.530 align:middle line:90%


00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.400 align:middle line:84%
So noticing now how
your neck feels.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.150 align:middle line:90%
Relaxing all the little muscles.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.180 align:middle line:90%
Letting go of the strain.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.315 align:middle line:90%
Letting go of the tension.

00:06:01.315 --> 00:06:04.490 align:middle line:90%


00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Allow that tension that you
may be holding in your shoulder

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.390 align:middle line:90%
to go now.

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.450 align:middle line:84%
Feel those shoulders,
both of them,

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.000 align:middle line:84%
sinking into the
frame of your body.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.510 align:middle line:84%
Feel your neck lengthen
as you do this.

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.680 align:middle line:90%


00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.050 align:middle line:84%
Feel, or imagine, all
your cares and worry just

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.980 align:middle line:84%
rolling off your
shoulders now as you

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:38.740 align:middle line:84%
take the relaxation down, now,
into the tops of your homes.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.190 align:middle line:84%
Letting any tension you may
be holding just drain away.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:45.950 align:middle line:90%


00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.988 align:middle line:84%
And as your awareness floats
down through your upper arms

00:06:50.988 --> 00:06:56.170 align:middle line:84%
into your elbows, all the
muscles in your forearms

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:03.960 align:middle line:84%
relax right down to your
wrists, and into your hands,

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.645 align:middle line:84%
and way down into the very tips
of your fingers and thumbs.

00:07:07.645 --> 00:07:11.740 align:middle line:90%


00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.320 align:middle line:90%
Your arms are feeling so heavy.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.448 align:middle line:90%
Your body's so comfortable.

00:07:17.448 --> 00:07:20.260 align:middle line:90%


00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.800 align:middle line:84%
Nothing whatsoever
to do but just

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:28.470 align:middle line:84%
relax and enjoy this feeling
of total release now.

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:34.480 align:middle line:90%


00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:39.280 align:middle line:84%
As you let go of all the
tension in those muscles,

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:45.440 align:middle line:84%
you may experience them becoming
calmer and gently releasing.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.490 align:middle line:90%


00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And just tune into the
feeling of simply letting go.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:56.030 align:middle line:90%


00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:59.540 align:middle line:84%
As you become aware
of your breathing,

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:06.680 align:middle line:84%
notice that you are now
breathing steadily and slowly,

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.620 align:middle line:90%
more rhythmically.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And with each exhale,
you feel yourself

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:17.960 align:middle line:84%
just relaxing even
more deeply, allowing

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:23.490 align:middle line:84%
any tension in the chest area
now to simply drain away,

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:26.985 align:middle line:84%
letting go completely
and totally.

00:08:26.985 --> 00:08:29.960 align:middle line:90%


00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.440 align:middle line:84%
Bring awareness into
your stomach now.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And let all your
stomach muscles relax.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And as you do, I
want you to imagine

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:44.780 align:middle line:84%
a ball of sunlight passing
down from the top of your head

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:49.520 align:middle line:84%
down through your face, your
throat, and into your stomach.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.480 align:middle line:90%


00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.600 align:middle line:84%
Visualize this healing
energy passing down

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:01.560 align:middle line:84%
through your throat and
chest and into your stomach.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.470 align:middle line:90%


00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:12.880 align:middle line:84%
So see and feel the sunlight
swirling and rotating.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And as the light glows, it
warms, and soothes, and heals.

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And you release, and relax, and
drift down, and further down.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:30.550 align:middle line:90%


00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And in your imagination,
you send the sunlight out

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:39.930 align:middle line:84%
now to every nerve cell,
bone, muscle, fiber,

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:43.470 align:middle line:90%
and system of the body.

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:46.770 align:middle line:84%
See it flowing through
the bloodstream

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:50.020 align:middle line:90%
and leave the light.

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.170 align:middle line:90%
It knows what to do.

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:53.700 align:middle line:90%


00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:59.220 align:middle line:84%
As you take the relaxation
round into your back muscles,

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.850 align:middle line:84%
and from your back muscles
it relaxes those muscles

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:06.600 align:middle line:90%
either side of the spine.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:14.010 align:middle line:84%
Releasing, relaxing,
and just letting go now.

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.530 align:middle line:90%
Deeper and deeper now.

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:20.700 align:middle line:90%


00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.310 align:middle line:84%
As you relax your
waist and the muscles

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:29.610 align:middle line:84%
of your lower stomach and
down into the pelvic area, all

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:33.550 align:middle line:84%
the way down through
the large thigh muscles,

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:40.870 align:middle line:84%
down through your knees,
your shins, and your calves,

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:47.128 align:middle line:84%
just allow all those areas of
the body to relax and let go.

00:10:47.128 --> 00:10:52.390 align:middle line:90%


00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:57.220 align:middle line:84%
You're so relaxed, so
heavy, so comfortable.

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.500 align:middle line:90%


00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And now tune into that
comfortable feeling

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:11.660 align:middle line:84%
as you think on down to your
ankles and to your feet,

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.225 align:middle line:84%
right down to the very
tips of your toes.

00:11:14.225 --> 00:11:17.180 align:middle line:90%


00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:22.380 align:middle line:84%
All the muscles of your body
now so beautifully relaxed.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And you feel very heavy
and very comfortable.

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:34.245 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling centered, and
relaxed, and fully in control.

00:11:34.245 --> 00:11:40.140 align:middle line:90%


00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.180 align:middle line:84%
If there are any
areas of your body

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:45.240 align:middle line:84%
that still feel
tight or tense, you

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:48.660 align:middle line:84%
find that you can relax them
simply by giving yourself

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.100 align:middle line:90%
permission to do so.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:54.210 align:middle line:90%


00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And you can now go even
deeper as I count down

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:58.490 align:middle line:90%
from eight to zero.

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:01.230 align:middle line:90%


00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And with every number, you
feel yourself drifting further

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:06.570 align:middle line:90%
into blissful relaxation.

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:09.760 align:middle line:90%


00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:25.740 align:middle line:90%
So 8, 7, 6, 5, deeper now, 4, 3.

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:28.460 align:middle line:90%


00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:32.170 align:middle line:90%
2, 1, and 0.

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:36.860 align:middle line:84%
Deeply relaxed, letting
go of all the cares

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:41.010 align:middle line:84%
and worries, all the tension
and pressure, and stresses

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:41.810 align:middle line:90%
and strains.

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:44.430 align:middle line:90%


00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:50.250 align:middle line:84%
Let them all ease from your
body and ease from your mind

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:55.440 align:middle line:84%
and allow yourself to drift down
into a deeper and more blissful

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.100 align:middle line:90%
state of creative relaxation.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:03.800 align:middle line:90%


00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Now in your
imagination, I'd like

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:07.880 align:middle line:84%
you to imagine that
you're standing

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:13.190 align:middle line:84%
on the top of a hill
on a beautiful island.

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's a lovely,
warm summer's day.

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:22.440 align:middle line:84%
There's a clear, blue
sky, not a cloud in sight.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And the temperature is
just how you like it.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.220 align:middle line:90%


00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.720 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the gentle
warmth of the sun on your head

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.080 align:middle line:90%
and shoulders.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And you can hear
the sounds of nature

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:39.555 align:middle line:84%
all around you, making you
feel even more relaxed.

00:13:39.555 --> 00:13:45.110 align:middle line:90%


00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:49.940 align:middle line:84%
The long grass in the
meadow below sways slightly.

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And you can see a
winding path that

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:55.580 align:middle line:84%
disappears into a
small apple orchard,

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.310 align:middle line:90%
just at the bottom of hill.

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:00.560 align:middle line:90%


00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And just beyond the
orchard, you can

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.920 align:middle line:84%
see the sea, the
sunlight darting off

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:10.370 align:middle line:84%
the tops of the waves
and the whole ocean

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:12.020 align:middle line:90%
shimmering and sparkling.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:16.370 align:middle line:90%


00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:21.530 align:middle line:84%
You begin to move easily
down the path now,

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:26.030 align:middle line:84%
noticing the grass
springing under your feet

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:29.300 align:middle line:84%
pushing you encouragingly
towards your destination.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:32.940 align:middle line:90%


00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And you catch the faint smell
of sea air in the breeze

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:40.070 align:middle line:84%
as you get closer
to the ocean now.

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:45.440 align:middle line:84%
As you stroll down,
down the winding path

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:49.530 align:middle line:84%
and you move
smoothly and easily.

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And you feel relaxed, and
centered, and fully in control.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:59.030 align:middle line:90%


00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And you're becoming aware now
of the growing calm within you.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.849 align:middle line:90%


00:15:05.849 --> 00:15:09.510 align:middle line:84%
You stop to look at the
beautiful flowers growing

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:16.750 align:middle line:84%
each side of the path, their
colors so vivid and bright.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:20.686 align:middle line:84%
And you stand there for a
moment, taking in the view.

00:15:20.686 --> 00:15:25.610 align:middle line:84%
A feeling of happiness flows
through you, continuing down.

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:31.270 align:middle line:90%


00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:38.700 align:middle line:84%
You're aware now of a deep sense
of calmness and tranquility

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:42.930 align:middle line:84%
right from the top of your
head to the tips of your toes,

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:45.330 align:middle line:84%
renewing your energy,
feeling wonderful.

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:48.910 align:middle line:90%


00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:52.300 align:middle line:84%
As you walk, you find yourself
almost floating as though

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:55.263 align:middle line:84%
in a dream now down
towards the orchard.

00:15:55.263 --> 00:15:58.161 align:middle line:90%


00:15:58.161 --> 00:16:03.540 align:middle line:84%
You move with such ease
with no effort whatsoever.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And in no time,
you find yourself

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:09.900 align:middle line:84%
drifting through
the fruit trees with

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:15.630 align:middle line:84%
a lush, cool, green foliage
forming a canopy overhead.

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:17.785 align:middle line:84%
And you see the
sunlight glittering

00:16:17.785 --> 00:16:18.660 align:middle line:90%
through the branches.

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:23.180 align:middle line:90%


00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And as you stand there, you
feel the glittering sunlight

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:30.370 align:middle line:90%
on your face and neck.

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And you feel and
experience it vibrating

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.665 align:middle line:84%
throughout your entire
body-mind system.

00:16:35.665 --> 00:16:40.790 align:middle line:90%


00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And as the sunlight moves, it
glows, and warms, and soothes,

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:49.940 align:middle line:90%
and heals your body and mind.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And you release and relax
and move down and down,

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.450 align:middle line:90%
taking in another deep breath.

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:01.120 align:middle line:90%
Relaxing even more now.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.950 align:middle line:90%


00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:07.560 align:middle line:84%
You can hear the
sound of the ocean

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.079 align:middle line:90%
as you move nearer and nearer.

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And with every
step you take, you

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:16.770 align:middle line:84%
feel more relaxed
and more calm as you

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:20.780 align:middle line:84%
follow that winding path
that leads you downwards.

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:24.150 align:middle line:90%


00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:25.710 align:middle line:90%
You turn a corner.

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And to your delight,
you find yourself

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.505 align:middle line:90%
on a beautiful, deserted beach.

00:17:30.505 --> 00:17:33.810 align:middle line:90%


00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:38.310 align:middle line:84%
The beach sweeping away into
a small bay in front of you.

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And the ocean is a striking
turquoise blue, pure and clear.

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And you can feel the warm
sand underneath your shoes.

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:53.160 align:middle line:90%
And you take your shoes off.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And you start walking
lazily across the beach

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:57.920 align:middle line:90%
to the water's edge.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:00.760 align:middle line:90%


00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:04.030 align:middle line:84%
You feel the sand
beneath your feet.

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And you feel the
sand change from cool

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:11.640 align:middle line:84%
to moist beneath your feet as
you wander along the shoreline.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:17.350 align:middle line:90%


00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:19.630 align:middle line:84%
As you turn around,
you start to walk up

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:24.120 align:middle line:84%
the beach towards
a grassy mound.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And as you walk up slowly, you
take in the smell of the ocean.

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And you hear the
sound of the water

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:35.055 align:middle line:90%
hissing over the warm sound.

00:18:35.055 --> 00:18:39.120 align:middle line:90%


00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:42.450 align:middle line:84%
You reach the mound
now and you sit down,

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:44.410 align:middle line:90%
making yourself comfortable.

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:48.090 align:middle line:90%


00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And as you gaze out across
the breathtaking scene,

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:56.690 align:middle line:84%
you watch the waves roll
in and roll out again.

00:18:56.690 --> 00:19:00.700 align:middle line:90%
Rhythmically in and out again.

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:05.900 align:middle line:90%


00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:09.170 align:middle line:84%
You play with the sand
through your fingers,

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:15.900 align:middle line:84%
noticing just how good
you feel, so relaxed now.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:20.220 align:middle line:84%
So relaxed that you've opened
up your subconscious mind

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.890 align:middle line:84%
and you're ready to start
making those changes

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:25.780 align:middle line:84%
you've been wanting to
make once and for all.

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:32.160 align:middle line:90%


00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And you know that
stressful situations

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:41.470 align:middle line:84%
occur every day which may
cause us to grind our teeth.

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:44.440 align:middle line:84%
Whenever one of these
anxiety-producing events

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:48.250 align:middle line:84%
happen or is going to
happen, you unconsciously

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:51.040 align:middle line:90%
grind your teeth.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And you may have found that
you grind your teeth mainly

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:57.030 align:middle line:90%
at night time.

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Your subconscious
mind remembers the

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:03.630 align:middle line:84%
stressful or
anxiety-producing situations

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:06.520 align:middle line:84%
which have occurred
during the day

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:10.080 align:middle line:84%
or threaten to
occur in the future

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.925 align:middle line:84%
and replays them many
times during the night.

00:20:12.925 --> 00:20:15.590 align:middle line:90%


00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:19.170 align:middle line:84%
Well you may find that
this was once the case.

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And even though the anxiety has
gone, the habit has continued.

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:29.450 align:middle line:84%
So we need to address
both the anxiety and habit

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:33.830 align:middle line:84%
now in this session to
help you to stop grinding

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:36.056 align:middle line:90%
your teeth once and for all.

00:20:36.056 --> 00:20:40.160 align:middle line:90%


00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.460 align:middle line:84%
In order to stop the habit
of clenching your jaw

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.430 align:middle line:84%
and grinding your
teeth, I would like

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:49.730 align:middle line:84%
you to retrain your muscles
in your mouth and jaws

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:54.035 align:middle line:84%
to relax, to release,
and to loosen.

00:20:54.035 --> 00:20:57.200 align:middle line:90%


00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:02.190 align:middle line:84%
So now that you're in
this deeply relaxed state,

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:04.220 align:middle line:84%
I would like you to
allow your breathing

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:06.275 align:middle line:90%
to slow down and deepen.

00:21:06.275 --> 00:21:09.390 align:middle line:90%


00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Allow the relaxation to
spread over your forehead

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:19.520 align:middle line:84%
so that it relaxes and becomes
smooth and comfortable.

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:25.270 align:middle line:84%
Enjoy the feeling of
comfort and well-being.

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:31.270 align:middle line:84%
Now allow the relaxation to
spread in and around your eyes,

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:39.670 align:middle line:84%
down past your cheeks, all the
way to your jaws and your neck,

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:43.570 align:middle line:84%
gently relaxing all the
little muscles as the soothing

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:45.160 align:middle line:90%
comfort gently spreads.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:48.380 align:middle line:90%


00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And as you allow
your mouth to relax,

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:58.670 align:middle line:84%
your muscles are soft, and
loose, limp, and relaxed.

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:01.790 align:middle line:90%


00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:05.630 align:middle line:84%
Your lips may be gently smiling,
and you feel your tongue

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:10.140 align:middle line:84%
relaxing completely,
naturally in your mouth

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:14.350 align:middle line:84%
so that your whole face and head
are totally and gently relaxed

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:15.150 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:17.750 align:middle line:90%


00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:21.280 align:middle line:90%
Your breathing is soft and slow.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And your entire
face, mouth, and jaws

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.670 align:middle line:84%
are totally relaxed
and released.

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:31.550 align:middle line:90%


00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And by listening to this script
before you sleep every night,

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:41.810 align:middle line:84%
you are retraining your
muscles to relax and to release

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:47.400 align:middle line:84%
so they no longer automatically
tense up, whether through habit

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:51.860 align:middle line:84%
or through anxiety, whether
in the night or in the day.

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:54.960 align:middle line:90%


00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:59.730 align:middle line:84%
I would also like to
suggest to your subconscious

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:02.040 align:middle line:84%
that should you feel
your jaws becoming

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:06.360 align:middle line:84%
tense whilst you sleep,
you instinctively wake

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:09.720 align:middle line:90%
and stop clenching.

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now
to focus your attention

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:16.080 align:middle line:84%
on the muscles of your jaw,
those strong muscles that

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:18.030 align:middle line:90%
keep your jaws tight.

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
become exquisitely aware

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:26.680 align:middle line:84%
of those muscles and to
feel them relaxing now.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:30.580 align:middle line:84%
Feel those muscles
releasing all the tension,

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:34.980 align:middle line:84%
allowing you to have a
gap between your teeth,

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:40.520 align:middle line:84%
allowing you to separate
your upper and lower jaws.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in this
state now, part of your mind

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:48.590 align:middle line:84%
is awake, and alert,
and looking after you.

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in this
state when you're sleeping,

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:55.670 align:middle line:84%
part of your mind can
be awake, and alert,

00:23:55.670 --> 00:24:00.200 align:middle line:84%
and looking after you monitoring
those muscles and jaws

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:08.460 align:middle line:84%
and allowing those jaw muscles
to release, relax, and loosen.

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And if they were to
clench in your sleep,

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.590 align:middle line:84%
your subconscious
now knows to wake you

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:19.745 align:middle line:84%
and to once again focus on those
muscles to loosen and release.

00:24:19.745 --> 00:24:25.120 align:middle line:90%


00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:28.030 align:middle line:84%
Letting go of tension
is as easy as can be.

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And each time you
feel and experience

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:33.730 align:middle line:84%
that sense of letting
go, you go deeper

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:39.820 align:middle line:84%
into that lovely
calm, relaxed feeling.

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:44.230 align:middle line:84%
So every time you listen
to this audio download,

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:46.270 align:middle line:84%
you're practicing,
you're retraining,

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:51.980 align:middle line:84%
those muscles to release just
that little bit more now.

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:54.860 align:middle line:84%
With your deep
breathing relaxation,

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:59.750 align:middle line:84%
just like you're doing now
during this audio download,

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:03.530 align:middle line:84%
you're teaching your mind to
breathe rather than clench

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:04.490 align:middle line:90%
when you feel anxious.

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:07.130 align:middle line:90%


00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:10.310 align:middle line:84%
By listening to this download,
you're undoing habits.

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:11.880 align:middle line:90%
You're retraining your mind.

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:14.700 align:middle line:90%
You're retraining your muscles.

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:24.710 align:middle line:84%
Your focus now is on true
relaxation, long, deep breaths,

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:32.620 align:middle line:84%
and releasing muscles,
releasing your jaw,

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:38.050 align:middle line:84%
and releasing the muscles
in your mouth and your lips.

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:42.980 align:middle line:84%
Remember your subconscious is a
very strong part of your mind.

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And it now knows that
you will no longer

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:48.460 align:middle line:90%
sleep through any clenching.

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:52.150 align:middle line:84%
The more you listen to this
audio download, the more likely

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:55.360 align:middle line:84%
your subconscious is
to be listening to you

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:59.480 align:middle line:84%
and to allow you to wake if it
feels any tension in your jaws

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:00.280 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:07.860 align:middle line:90%


00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And these suggestions
are now firmly embedded

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:14.150 align:middle line:90%
in your subconscious mind.

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And they grow stronger and
stronger each and every day.

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:21.720 align:middle line:90%


00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count from one to five.

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:31.120 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of five,
you'll be wide awake.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:42.040 align:middle line:84%
So 1, 2, 3, 4, eyes beginning
to flutter now, and 5,

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.060 align:middle line:90%
returning to normality.

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:45.810 align:middle line:90%
