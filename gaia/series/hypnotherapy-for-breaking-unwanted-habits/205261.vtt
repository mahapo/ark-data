[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to the
House of Well-being.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.320 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to the
Social Media Phone Addiction

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.870 align:middle line:90%
Hypnotherapy audio.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.070 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.460 align:middle line:84%
But before it does,
I'd like to remind you

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.050 align:middle line:84%
that the following
audio contains

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.750 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.420 align:middle line:84%
aim to help you reach a
deep level of relaxation.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.150 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that, wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.630 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place,

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.203 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions, where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:44.203 --> 00:00:46.620 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.173 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:48.173 --> 00:00:50.340 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.250 align:middle line:84%
will alert you and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.030 align:middle line:84%
But right now there's
nothing at all

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.060 align:middle line:84%
you need to do apart
from close your eyes,

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.090 align:middle line:90%
relax, lie back, and let go.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.349 align:middle line:84%
And really enjoy those peaceful
feelings and all the benefits

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:07.620 align:middle line:90%
that come with it.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.490 align:middle line:84%
Make yourself as
comfortable as possible.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.905 align:middle line:84%
And concentrate on
the sound of my voice.

00:01:13.905 --> 00:01:16.530 align:middle line:90%


00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And begin by drawing in
a long, slow, deep breath

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.820 align:middle line:90%
in through your nose.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.870 align:middle line:90%
Hold the breath for a moment.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And now slightly open your
mouth and release all the air

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.860 align:middle line:84%
from your body and a
long, low deep sigh.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And relax, allowing your
lungs to naturally deflate

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.240 align:middle line:84%
as your body sinks into
gentle relaxation now.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.960 align:middle line:90%


00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.140 align:middle line:90%
And you can release any tension.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:05.470 align:middle line:84%
Relax and let go as I guide you
through a journey of relaxing,

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.100 align:middle line:84%
a journey that you will
find very beneficial

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.729 align:middle line:90%
for your overall well-being.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.110 align:middle line:90%


00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.020 align:middle line:84%
You're going to start
this calming experience

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.200 align:middle line:84%
by first relaxing your
hole body-mind system.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.960 align:middle line:90%


00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's true to say that the
simple act of relaxing the body

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.640 align:middle line:84%
and mind has a positive knock-on
effect because how you think

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.280 align:middle line:84%
determines how you
feel and how you feel

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.790 align:middle line:84%
influences the world
around you and how

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.790 align:middle line:84%
you choose to
think today affects

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.200 align:middle line:90%
your decisions from here on in.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.850 align:middle line:84%
So to make my assurance
as your reality,

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.920 align:middle line:84%
let's begin by
focusing your attention

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.300 align:middle line:90%
on the very top of your head.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.140 align:middle line:84%
Tension often starts at
the scalp and the neck.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.370 align:middle line:84%
So mentally and physically
allow all the muscles

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.960 align:middle line:84%
around the top of your
head to relax now,

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:23.900 align:middle line:84%
letting all the
tension simply dissolve

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.035 align:middle line:84%
as you start to tune into
your body-mind system.

00:03:27.035 --> 00:03:32.180 align:middle line:90%


00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:38.700 align:middle line:84%
Just let any tension you may
be holding to release now.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.510 align:middle line:90%
Allow your brain to relax.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.860 align:middle line:84%
The left and the right lobes
of the brain just releasing

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:52.460 align:middle line:84%
such a simple thought yet so
profound and so significant.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:04:00.350 align:middle line:84%
Just letting go completely,
drifting further and further

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.600 align:middle line:84%
down, nobody wanting anything,
nobody needing anything.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.280 align:middle line:90%
This is your time to relax.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.030 align:middle line:90%


00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.640 align:middle line:84%
Taking the relaxation
into the face

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:20.680 align:middle line:84%
now, allowing all of your
facial muscles to feel loose,

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.770 align:middle line:84%
feeling your brow relaxing,
your forehead smoothing out,

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:34.000 align:middle line:84%
the back of your eyes relaxing,
tiny muscles around your eyes

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.960 align:middle line:84%
and eyelids down
into your cheeks

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.930 align:middle line:90%
and into your jaw muscles.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.870 align:middle line:90%
Just releasing and letting go.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.870 align:middle line:90%


00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.240 align:middle line:84%
Allowing your
tongue to fall away

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.180 align:middle line:90%
from the roof of your mouth.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And should you find you need
to swallow, just do that now.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And drift down and
down deeper and deeper

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.130 align:middle line:90%
into blissful relaxation.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.720 align:middle line:90%


00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.450 align:middle line:84%
The more you physically
relax, the more

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.660 align:middle line:90%
you can mentally relax.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And when you can
mentally relax, you

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.750 align:middle line:90%
can think much more clearly.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And when you think more clearly,
your life becomes clearer

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.850 align:middle line:84%
and you make better decisions
and you're much more

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.120 align:middle line:90%
in control of your days.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.070 align:middle line:90%


00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.940 align:middle line:84%
So noticing now how
your neck feels,

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:43.720 align:middle line:84%
relaxing all the little muscles,
letting go of the strain,

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.905 align:middle line:90%
letting go of the tension.

00:05:44.905 --> 00:05:48.330 align:middle line:90%


00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.790 align:middle line:84%
Allow that tension that you
may be holding in your shoulder

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.850 align:middle line:90%
to go now.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Feel the shoulders
both of them sinking

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.530 align:middle line:90%
into the frame of your body.

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.710 align:middle line:84%
Feel your neck lengthen
as you do this.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.230 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Feel or imagine all
your cares and worries

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.210 align:middle line:84%
just rolling off
your shoulders now.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:22.170 align:middle line:84%
As you take the relaxation down
now into the tops of your arms,

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:25.900 align:middle line:84%
letting any tension you may
be holding just drain away.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.440 align:middle line:90%


00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And as your awareness flows
down through your upper arms

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:39.730 align:middle line:84%
into your elbows, all the
muscles in your forearms

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:48.130 align:middle line:84%
relax, right down to your wrists
and into your hands and way

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.205 align:middle line:84%
down into the very tips of
your fingers and thumbs.

00:06:51.205 --> 00:06:55.180 align:middle line:90%


00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.840 align:middle line:90%
Your arms are feeling so heavy.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.040 align:middle line:90%
Your body's so comfortable.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.800 align:middle line:90%


00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.340 align:middle line:84%
Nothing whatsoever
to do but just

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.990 align:middle line:84%
relax and enjoy this feeling
of total release now.

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:17.970 align:middle line:90%


00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:22.770 align:middle line:84%
As you let go of all the
tension in those muscles,

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:29.100 align:middle line:84%
you may experience them becoming
calmer and gently releasing.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.040 align:middle line:90%


00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And just tune into the
feeling of simply letting go.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:39.550 align:middle line:90%


00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:43.180 align:middle line:84%
As you become aware
of your breathing,

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:50.460 align:middle line:84%
notice that you are now
breathing steadily and slowly,

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.190 align:middle line:90%
rhythmically.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:57.555 align:middle line:84%
And with each exhale, you feel
yourself just relaxing even

00:07:57.555 --> 00:07:58.355 align:middle line:90%
more deeply.

00:07:58.355 --> 00:08:00.880 align:middle line:90%


00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.430 align:middle line:84%
Allowing any tension
in the chest area

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:07.690 align:middle line:84%
now to simply
drain away, letting

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:10.525 align:middle line:90%
go completely and totally.

00:08:10.525 --> 00:08:13.540 align:middle line:90%


00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:18.230 align:middle line:84%
Bring awareness into
your stomach now.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And let all your
stomach muscles relax.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And as you do, I
want you to imagine

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:29.520 align:middle line:84%
a ball of sunlight passing
down from the top of your head

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:34.260 align:middle line:84%
down through your face, your
throat, and into your stomach.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:38.220 align:middle line:90%


00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:41.370 align:middle line:84%
Visualize this healing
energy passing down

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:46.270 align:middle line:84%
through your throat and
chest and into your stomach.

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:50.220 align:middle line:90%


00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:57.580 align:middle line:84%
So see and feel the sunlight
swirling and rotating.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And as the light glows, it
goes and soothes and heals.

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And you release and relax and
drift down and further down.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:15.220 align:middle line:90%


00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And in your imagination,
you send the sunlight out

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:24.730 align:middle line:84%
now to every nerve cell,
bone, muscle, fiber,

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:28.230 align:middle line:90%
and system of the body.

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:31.590 align:middle line:84%
See it flowing through
the bloodstream.

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:34.640 align:middle line:90%
Leave the light there.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.440 align:middle line:90%
It knows what to do.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:43.960 align:middle line:84%
As you take the relaxation
round into your back muscles

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.620 align:middle line:84%
and from your back muscles,
it relaxes those muscles

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:55.480 align:middle line:84%
either side of the spine,
releasing, relaxing,

00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:00.390 align:middle line:84%
and just letting go now
deeper and deeper now.

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:05.440 align:middle line:90%


00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.050 align:middle line:84%
As you relax your
waist and the muscles

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:14.380 align:middle line:84%
of your lower stomach and
down into the pelvic area, all

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:18.260 align:middle line:84%
the way down through
the large thigh muscles,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:25.640 align:middle line:84%
down through your knees,
your shins and your calves,

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:31.760 align:middle line:84%
just allow all those areas of
the body to relax and let go.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:37.080 align:middle line:90%


00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:42.040 align:middle line:84%
You're so relaxed, so
heavy, so comfortable.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.260 align:middle line:90%


00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And now tune into that
comfortable feeling

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:56.400 align:middle line:84%
as you think on down to
your ankles, into your feet,

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.995 align:middle line:84%
right down to the very
tips of your toes.

00:10:58.995 --> 00:11:01.980 align:middle line:90%


00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:07.230 align:middle line:84%
All the muscles of your body
now so beautifully relaxed.

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And you feel very heavy
and very comfortable.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And your feeling's centered and
relaxed and fully in control.

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:24.860 align:middle line:90%


00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.930 align:middle line:84%
If there are any
areas of your body

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:30.020 align:middle line:84%
that still feel
tight or tense, you

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:33.410 align:middle line:84%
find that you can relax them
simply by giving yourself

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:34.930 align:middle line:90%
permission to do so.

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:38.840 align:middle line:90%


00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:43.065 align:middle line:84%
And you can now go even deeper
as I count down from 8 to 0.

00:11:43.065 --> 00:11:45.920 align:middle line:90%


00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And with every number, you
feel yourself drifting further

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.310 align:middle line:90%
into blissful relaxation.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:54.510 align:middle line:90%


00:11:54.510 --> 00:12:04.960 align:middle line:90%
So 8, 7, 6, 5--

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:16.950 align:middle line:90%
deeper now-- 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0.

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:23.820 align:middle line:84%
Deeply relax, letting go of
all the cares and worries, all

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.565 align:middle line:84%
the tension and pressure
and stresses and strains.

00:12:26.565 --> 00:12:29.160 align:middle line:90%


00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:35.040 align:middle line:84%
Let them all ease from your
body and ease from your mind.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And allow yourself to drift down
into a deeper, more blissful

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:42.850 align:middle line:90%
state of creative relaxation.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:51.950 align:middle line:90%


00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And now that you're in
a deeply relaxed state,

00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:01.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk to you now
about social media and phone

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:02.438 align:middle line:90%
addiction.

00:13:02.438 --> 00:13:05.930 align:middle line:90%


00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting to
know that interacting

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:14.840 align:middle line:84%
with social media can trigger a
dopamine response in the brain,

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:18.890 align:middle line:84%
similar to that triggered
by a drug or alcohol use.

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:22.810 align:middle line:90%


00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:25.635 align:middle line:84%
And that response can leave
you wanting more and feeling

00:13:25.635 --> 00:13:26.435 align:middle line:90%
addicted.

00:13:26.435 --> 00:13:30.650 align:middle line:90%


00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And whilst there's
nothing inherently

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:37.580 align:middle line:84%
addictive about smart
phones themselves,

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:42.200 align:middle line:84%
the true drivers of our
attachments to these devices

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.155 align:middle line:84%
are the hypersocial
environments that they provide.

00:13:45.155 --> 00:13:51.850 align:middle line:90%


00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps you've
experienced feelings

00:13:54.550 --> 00:14:02.380 align:middle line:84%
of anxiety, depression,
or poor quality sleep.

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:05.815 align:middle line:84%
And studies have shown a
link to smartphone usage.

00:14:05.815 --> 00:14:09.720 align:middle line:90%


00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.300 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps being on your
phone or social media

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.880 align:middle line:84%
too much has
started to interfere

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.630 align:middle line:84%
with your relationships
with your friends and family

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:20.085 align:middle line:84%
or even your partner
and children.

00:14:20.085 --> 00:14:24.160 align:middle line:90%


00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And you know that smartphones
and social media apps

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:31.460 align:middle line:84%
aren't going anywhere
anytime soon.

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.140 align:middle line:84%
But what you can control
is how much you use them.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:38.020 align:middle line:90%


00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:41.050 align:middle line:84%
So from now on, you've
decided to spend less time

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:44.440 align:middle line:84%
on your phone and to
learn to connect more

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:50.250 align:middle line:84%
with those around you or simply
find alternative things to do.

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:58.310 align:middle line:90%


00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:02.840 align:middle line:84%
Experts recommend 30
minutes or less per day

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.940 align:middle line:84%
as the maximum time
you should spend

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:09.350 align:middle line:84%
on social media and just
two hours per day in total

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:10.400 align:middle line:90%
on your phone for adults.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:14.870 align:middle line:90%


00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.120 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
you do is challenge

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.990 align:middle line:84%
yourself to go a certain
time without checking

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:22.515 align:middle line:90%
your phone or social media.

00:15:22.515 --> 00:15:25.790 align:middle line:90%


00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:29.180 align:middle line:84%
So whether it's
a few hours a day

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:33.020 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps an entire morning,
a couple of days a week

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.930 align:middle line:84%
or you stop checking
your phone after 7:00 PM

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:41.310 align:middle line:84%
at night, whatever you
decide, you stick to it.

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:44.880 align:middle line:84%
You feel determined to not
be ruled by your phone.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:45.965 align:middle line:90%
And you take back control.

00:15:45.965 --> 00:15:49.860 align:middle line:90%


00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:52.110 align:middle line:84%
To help with the challenge
you've set yourself,

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:58.100 align:middle line:84%
perhaps you decide to
delete certain social apps

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:01.340 align:middle line:84%
or to remove all addictive
apps to the second page, where

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:04.100 align:middle line:84%
it's harder for you to
open them spontaneously.

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:09.450 align:middle line:90%


00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:12.930 align:middle line:84%
In addition, you turn
off notifications

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:18.190 align:middle line:84%
so you don't see an alert every
time you pick up your phone,

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:20.710 align:middle line:84%
instead only choosing
to check your phone

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:21.835 align:middle line:90%
at a time you've decided.

00:16:21.835 --> 00:16:27.540 align:middle line:90%


00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:31.590 align:middle line:84%
You notice more when you're
reaching for your phone.

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:35.370 align:middle line:84%
So you're able to stop
yourself in your Tracks

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:40.470 align:middle line:84%
and you find new ways
to fulfill your need.

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:43.620 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you
feel lonely, perhaps you

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:47.310 align:middle line:84%
decide to call someone
in your family or friend.

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:49.810 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're bored, you may
want to go for a short walk

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:50.610 align:middle line:90%
or read a book.

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:54.930 align:middle line:84%
You do anything to distract
you from your phone.

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.810 align:middle line:84%
You know it's easier to forget
about checking your phone

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:02.320 align:middle line:84%
when it's physically
out of sight and reach.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.160 align:middle line:84%
So if you're downstairs and
it's time for you to be away

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.559 align:middle line:84%
from your phone, then you
put your phone upstairs out

00:17:08.559 --> 00:17:09.359 align:middle line:90%
of range.

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:13.310 align:middle line:90%


00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:17.569 align:middle line:84%
And the more time you're away
from your phone, the more time

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:21.470 align:middle line:84%
you have in your hands to do the
other things that interest you

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:28.050 align:middle line:84%
that you really enjoy doing,
perhaps a healthy activity

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:30.330 align:middle line:84%
or passion project
you simply never

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:34.160 align:middle line:90%
had time to start or finish.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:39.164 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps you choose to spend
more time with your family

00:17:39.164 --> 00:17:41.290 align:middle line:84%
and reach out to
some old friends.

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:47.360 align:middle line:90%


00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.970 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you choose to
spend some time increasing

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:54.590 align:middle line:84%
the amount of exercise
you do or simply relaxing

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:57.200 align:middle line:84%
by reading a book or
listening to some music.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.960 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it may be, the
more time you have to do it,

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.120 align:middle line:90%
the more you'll love it.

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And you start to
free up your time

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.930 align:middle line:84%
more and more with
the things that you

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:10.040 align:middle line:90%
love that are good for you.

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.350 align:middle line:90%
And that makes you happy.

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:17.590 align:middle line:84%
You have a newfound curiosity
and thirst for your own life

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:20.885 align:middle line:84%
and less interest in the lives
of others on social media.

00:18:20.885 --> 00:18:25.510 align:middle line:90%


00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:27.760 align:middle line:84%
From now on and
every time you're

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:31.520 align:middle line:84%
about to unlock
your phone, I'd like

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.680 align:middle line:84%
you to take a moment
to think about why

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.940 align:middle line:90%
you need to check your phone.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:39.110 align:middle line:90%


00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:41.510 align:middle line:84%
Do you need to do
something in particular

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:44.490 align:middle line:90%
by texting your boss?

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And if you do, you
fulfill the task.

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And then you put your
phone away, straight away.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:54.810 align:middle line:84%
You no longer feel the need
to browse or post so much,

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:56.115 align:middle line:90%
like or comment.

00:18:56.115 --> 00:18:58.990 align:middle line:90%


00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:01.780 align:middle line:84%
You prefer to find
joys outside your phone

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:04.510 align:middle line:84%
and with the closest
people around you,

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:07.450 align:middle line:84%
enjoying life
directly around you.

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:11.110 align:middle line:90%


00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:15.970 align:middle line:84%
You no longer feel the need
to get admiration, confidence,

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:18.235 align:middle line:84%
or approval from your
social media peers.

00:19:18.235 --> 00:19:21.360 align:middle line:90%


00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:26.310 align:middle line:84%
You feel full of
self-confidence, self-worth.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And you know that
you're an amazing person

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:31.470 align:middle line:90%
in your own right.

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:33.900 align:middle line:84%
You think more
about your strengths

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:37.920 align:middle line:84%
and why people like you, what
past successes you've had,

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:41.920 align:middle line:84%
filling your mind with positive
thoughts about yourself,

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:45.300 align:middle line:84%
your life without any
need for comparison

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:46.665 align:middle line:90%
or recognition from others.

00:19:46.665 --> 00:19:51.940 align:middle line:90%


00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:55.630 align:middle line:84%
You know you'll be able to check
what everyone is up to, what's

00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:57.760 align:middle line:84%
going on with the
news, or continue maybe

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:00.400 align:middle line:90%
playing any game in due course.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.770 align:middle line:84%
You simply don't feel the
need to do it every hour,

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:04.960 align:middle line:90%
every minute of the day.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:07.620 align:middle line:90%


00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:10.770 align:middle line:84%
You no longer feel like
you're missing out,

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:13.770 align:middle line:84%
as you feel much more connected
to the world around you

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:14.860 align:middle line:90%
than ever before.

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:17.680 align:middle line:90%


00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:22.530 align:middle line:84%
You feel much more in
control than ever before,

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:26.250 align:middle line:84%
enjoying the space and freedom
you feel from not having

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:28.010 align:middle line:90%
to constantly be on your phone.

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:31.910 align:middle line:90%


00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:34.310 align:middle line:84%
From now on in,
you give yourself

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:39.530 align:middle line:84%
time to breathe away from
your phone, some time out,

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:44.450 align:middle line:84%
time to recharge, time to
reconnect and to re-engage

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:50.780 align:middle line:84%
with those around you, doing
the things you love to do.

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And in return, you're
building the relationships you

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:55.040 align:middle line:90%
want with those that you love.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:58.120 align:middle line:90%


00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:01.690 align:middle line:84%
You find yourself day
by day, hour by hour

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:06.570 align:middle line:84%
spending less and less time
on your phone, less desire

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:07.560 align:middle line:90%
and need.

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:11.130 align:middle line:84%
You have the perfect balance
now of when you should

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:12.640 align:middle line:90%
and shouldn't be on your phone.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.740 align:middle line:90%
And this pleases you.

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:16.650 align:middle line:90%


00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now to
visualize yourself doing

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.340 align:middle line:84%
this hobby, something that
you think you may really

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:28.410 align:middle line:84%
enjoy your passion project,
something you keep putting off.

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:31.340 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's something
important to you

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:36.090 align:middle line:84%
but you don't seem to have time
to do because you're always

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:38.190 align:middle line:90%
on your phone.

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:44.880 align:middle line:84%

Eyes open when you're ready.
