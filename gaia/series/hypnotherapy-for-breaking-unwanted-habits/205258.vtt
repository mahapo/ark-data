00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.480 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>> You are listening to the
Addiction Mind Talk audio.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.180 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the hypnosis will
begin, but before it does,

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.250 align:middle line:84%
I'd just like to remind you that
the following audio contains

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.310 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.800 align:middle line:90%
aim to cause deep relaxation.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.820 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.750 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place,

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.220 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions, where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.660 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.530 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.250 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.330 align:middle line:84%
will alert you, and you will
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.060 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
there's nothing at all

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.480 align:middle line:84%
that you need to do, apart
from close your eyes,

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.920 align:middle line:84%
lie back, relax, and
let go, and really enjoy

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.180 align:middle line:84%
these peaceful feelings and all
the benefits that come with it.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.170 align:middle line:90%


00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.480 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to
imagine that you're

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.800 align:middle line:84%
in a beautiful garden
with colorful flowers

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.870 align:middle line:90%
and immaculate manicured lawns.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.490 align:middle line:90%


00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.050 align:middle line:84%
The sun is shining, and
the sky is a clear blue.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.620 align:middle line:90%


00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.410 align:middle line:84%
The temperature is
just how you like it,

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.685 align:middle line:90%
and there's a cool breeze.

00:01:40.685 --> 00:01:44.320 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.500 align:middle line:84%
There's no pollen
in the air at all,

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.180 align:middle line:84%
and you feel happy
and comfortable

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.740 align:middle line:90%
in the clean, fresh, pure air.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.790 align:middle line:90%


00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.820 align:middle line:84%
You take a look around you
at all the beautiful colors,

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.015 align:middle line:84%
and you hear the sounds of
the birds singing overhead.

00:02:06.015 --> 00:02:10.039 align:middle line:90%


00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.260 align:middle line:84%
You're calm and relaxed here,
and you feel safe and secure.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.170 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now to
take in a deep breath.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And as you breathe out, you can
relax deeper and deeper now.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.910 align:middle line:90%


00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.080 align:middle line:84%
You take a gentle walk
around the garden,

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.830 align:middle line:90%
and you're barefoot as you walk.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.440 align:middle line:90%


00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.000 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the lush
green grass underfoot,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.700 align:middle line:84%
and you walk towards
some beautiful flowers,

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.560 align:middle line:84%
and as you get nearer, you can
smell their beautiful fragrant

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.470 align:middle line:90%
scent.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.840 align:middle line:84%
The colors are magnificent,
and they grow brighter

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.030 align:middle line:90%
as you approach them.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.980 align:middle line:90%


00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And now take in another
long, deep breath,

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.380 align:middle line:84%
and as you inhale the
rich fragrance in,

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.110 align:middle line:84%
you relax even deeper as
you exhale gently now.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:30.400 align:middle line:90%


00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.210 align:middle line:84%
You take another stroll
around the garden,

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.150 align:middle line:84%
and you find a pathway
leading down to a beach.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.700 align:middle line:90%


00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.800 align:middle line:84%
You follow the path, stepping
down easily onto the wide steps

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.050 align:middle line:90%
beneath you.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:56.310 align:middle line:84%
As you go deeper and deeper,
you relax more and more

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.840 align:middle line:90%
with every step you take.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.010 align:middle line:90%


00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And you soon reach the
beautiful beach, which is empty,

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.910 align:middle line:84%
and it has a golden sand,
like a fine powder underfoot.

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.690 align:middle line:90%


00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:20.360 align:middle line:84%
You enjoy the feeling of soft
powdery sand beneath your feet,

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.530 align:middle line:84%
and you take a look
out at the horizon.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.020 align:middle line:90%


00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.860 align:middle line:84%
You take in the
vastness of the sea,

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.380 align:middle line:84%
and you watch as the
waves rhythmically

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:44.440 align:middle line:84%
roll in and out again, one
after the other, gentle rhythmic

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:53.330 align:middle line:84%
waves rolling towards the
beach and back out again,

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.210 align:middle line:84%
the sound of the waves
peaceful and reassuring.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.350 align:middle line:90%


00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.340 align:middle line:84%
You feel a sense
of calm and peace

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:14.300 align:middle line:84%
as the sun gently shines down
on you with a warm sea air

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.330 align:middle line:90%
gently sweeping over you.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.220 align:middle line:90%


00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.020 align:middle line:84%
As you walk across the
beach, you feel your feet

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:32.110 align:middle line:84%
sinking further into the sand,
leaving a delicate footprint

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:43.150 align:middle line:84%
behind you as you walk onwards,
relaxing deeper and deeper

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.980 align:middle line:90%
with every step you take.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:51.420 align:middle line:90%


00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And as you reach the sea's
edge, the waves gently rolling

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:04.070 align:middle line:84%
in and out, you notice how
your feet sink down deeper

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.950 align:middle line:90%
than before into the wet sand.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.340 align:middle line:90%


00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:17.270 align:middle line:84%
You feel the water gently
lap at your ankles,

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.830 align:middle line:84%
and it's warm and
inviting, as you

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:30.170 align:middle line:84%
let your toes test the water
with every wave that rolls in

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:31.780 align:middle line:90%
and back out again.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:38.620 align:middle line:90%


00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And after a while,
when you're ready,

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:47.160 align:middle line:84%
you walk back up the beach,
and there's a lovely deck chair

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:53.220 align:middle line:84%
waiting just for you on
the sand under an umbrella,

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.665 align:middle line:84%
offering just the
right amount of shade.

00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:59.920 align:middle line:90%


00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:04.180 align:middle line:84%
You take a seat, and
you relax deeply now.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.720 align:middle line:84%
You take in a deep
breath, and take

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:13.210 align:middle line:84%
in your beautiful surroundings
as you gently exhale now.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:20.040 align:middle line:90%


00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:25.020 align:middle line:84%
You look out at the
calming sea again,

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:33.080 align:middle line:84%
and you notice the sky, a clear
blue sky without a cloud in it.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling so
relaxed now as you sit

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:41.110 align:middle line:84%
and relax comfortably and
deeply in your deck chair.

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:46.740 align:middle line:90%


00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.670 align:middle line:84%
As you rest in that chair,
you can allow your mind

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:56.070 align:middle line:84%
to imagine a staircase,
a beautiful staircase

00:07:56.070 --> 00:08:00.090 align:middle line:84%
with polished ornate
banister running down

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:03.690 align:middle line:84%
alongside a deep
rich carpet that

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:06.775 align:middle line:84%
feels soft to the touch
underneath your bare feet.

00:08:06.775 --> 00:08:12.910 align:middle line:90%


00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:15.700 align:middle line:84%
As you look down the
stairs, you notice

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:22.990 align:middle line:84%
that there are 10 steps leading
gently down, 10 steps leading

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:26.110 align:middle line:90%
gently down and down.

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.960 align:middle line:90%


00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And these are the steps
that will lead you

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:35.070 align:middle line:84%
into deep relaxation,
giving you access

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:38.730 align:middle line:84%
to that powerful
subconscious, allowing

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:42.375 align:middle line:84%
you to make those changes
that you want to make today.

00:08:42.375 --> 00:08:48.220 align:middle line:90%


00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:53.260 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, I'd like you to
walk down those steps with me,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.170 align:middle line:84%
and I'll count them off
for you one at a time.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.900 align:middle line:90%


00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find that
the deeper down you go,

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:06.465 align:middle line:84%
the more comfortable and the
more relaxed you'll become.

00:09:06.465 --> 00:09:11.140 align:middle line:90%


00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:15.440 align:middle line:84%
So when you're ready to
walk down the stairs,

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:20.380 align:middle line:84%
I want you to gently place
your hand onto the banister

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:24.550 align:middle line:84%
and begin to slowly
descend the staircase,

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:27.919 align:middle line:84%
as I count them
off from 10 to 1.

00:09:27.919 --> 00:09:31.591 align:middle line:90%


00:09:31.591 --> 00:09:37.060 align:middle line:84%
10, deeply relaxed,
deeply comfortable.

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:41.120 align:middle line:90%


00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:45.940 align:middle line:84%
Nine, deeply relaxed,
deeply comfortable.

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:49.460 align:middle line:90%


00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:54.500 align:middle line:84%
Eight, more and
more relaxed now,

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.070 align:middle line:84%
sinking even further
into relaxation.

00:09:57.070 --> 00:10:01.900 align:middle line:90%


00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:08.670 align:middle line:84%
Seven, deeply comfortable,
feeling every muscle release

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:10.620 align:middle line:90%
as you go deeper and deeper.

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.910 align:middle line:90%


00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Six, five, even further into
your deep state of relaxation

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:22.470 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:26.290 align:middle line:90%


00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Four, allowing
your mind and body

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:32.980 align:middle line:84%
to fully relax as you sink
further into deep relaxation.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:37.330 align:middle line:90%


00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:43.490 align:middle line:84%
Three, comfortable, heavy, any
tension completely gone now.

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:47.020 align:middle line:90%


00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.570 align:middle line:90%
Two, almost at the bottom now--

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:53.140 align:middle line:90%
just one more step to go.

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And one, going deeper
and deeper down now

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:03.580 align:middle line:84%
into hypnosis, all the way down
to that deeper, healthier level

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.560 align:middle line:84%
of mind, deeper than
you've ever been.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:09.510 align:middle line:90%


00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And as you reach the
bottom of the staircase,

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.530 align:middle line:84%
letting go of the
banister, you let

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:18.393 align:middle line:90%
go of any worries or concerns.

00:11:18.393 --> 00:11:21.550 align:middle line:90%


00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:26.520 align:middle line:84%
This is your time, and you let
nothing bother or concern you

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.500 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.320 align:middle line:84%
Nobody needs or wants
anything from you.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:36.480 align:middle line:90%


00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And you're now standing at
the bottom of those steps,

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:44.395 align:middle line:84%
feeling so very comfortable,
very relaxed and at peace.

00:11:44.395 --> 00:11:48.740 align:middle line:90%


00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:54.500 align:middle line:84%
You can allow those stairs and
that ordinary everyday well

00:11:54.500 --> 00:12:01.590 align:middle line:84%
to just fade away, further
and further away now,

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:07.140 align:middle line:84%
as you sit deeply into the
comfortable relaxing state

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:13.160 align:middle line:84%
deeply inside of you, your
subconscious mind still fully

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:18.090 align:middle line:84%
alert and aware that you're
ready for the changes about

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:18.890 align:middle line:90%
to come.

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:23.680 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And right now, you
may like to think

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:29.590 align:middle line:84%
about what it is
that's been keeping

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:31.570 align:middle line:90%
the old addiction going.

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:34.880 align:middle line:90%


00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:39.560 align:middle line:84%
Think about whether it
was a pattern of behavior,

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:43.880 align:middle line:84%
where the cause was back
in the past and no longer

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:47.925 align:middle line:84%
applies, but has
left behind a habit.

00:12:47.925 --> 00:12:51.280 align:middle line:90%


00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe the addiction was
your own form of therapy,

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:03.040 align:middle line:84%
where it was meeting a need
or helping you in some way,

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.190 align:middle line:84%
and now you're stuck in a
habit and can't seem to stop.

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:12.470 align:middle line:90%


00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:18.310 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to know that
you can overcome addiction

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:22.120 align:middle line:84%
in your own unique way
and in your own time.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:26.730 align:middle line:90%


00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And you know that you do
have experience of not having

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:35.340 align:middle line:84%
that old addiction, so
you are capable of not

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.260 align:middle line:90%
living with the addiction.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.180 align:middle line:90%


00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.880 align:middle line:84%
You have experience
of living life

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:46.870 align:middle line:84%
very differently, free
from an addiction.

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:52.780 align:middle line:90%


00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And you know that no one
was born with an addiction,

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:02.980 align:middle line:84%
and you're now determined
to go back to the days

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.760 align:middle line:84%
where you lived
every day perfectly

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:11.490 align:middle line:84%
well without succumbing
to the addiction

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:13.545 align:middle line:84%
that you find in
your daily life now.

00:14:13.545 --> 00:14:18.370 align:middle line:90%


00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:23.230 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to focus
on, in your opinion, what

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:27.070 align:middle line:84%
would be the worst
possible outcome of giving

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:28.390 align:middle line:90%
in to the addiction.

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:31.930 align:middle line:90%


00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:35.310 align:middle line:84%
Imagine now what
would happen to you,

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:39.640 align:middle line:84%
your friends, your social
life, your professional life,

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.810 align:middle line:84%
your family, if you continue
with this addiction.

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:50.610 align:middle line:90%


00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And once you've done
that, and now I'd

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:02.830 align:middle line:84%
like you to focus on
what is the outcome that

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:04.840 align:middle line:90%
drives you to want to change.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.550 align:middle line:90%


00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:10.250 align:middle line:84%
How would you be
different if you no longer

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:13.520 align:middle line:90%
had the addiction?

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.110 align:middle line:90%
How would you feel?

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:17.660 align:middle line:84%
How would your friends
and family feel?

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:21.910 align:middle line:90%


00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:24.490 align:middle line:84%
What outcome would
there be in your life

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:26.980 align:middle line:84%
if you no longer
had that addiction?

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:33.110 align:middle line:90%


00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:37.450 align:middle line:84%
Allow yourself to be
absorbed in the future,

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:41.640 align:middle line:84%
thinking about the most
motivating positives

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:46.580 align:middle line:84%
that drive you to stop
with that addiction.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:51.560 align:middle line:84%
Have a think now about that
question, about those two

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.015 align:middle line:90%
very different outcomes.

00:15:53.015 --> 00:16:03.290 align:middle line:90%


00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.240 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, I'm
going to guide you

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.430 align:middle line:84%
through a process
that will change

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:12.380 align:middle line:84%
your feelings of attachment
to that old addiction

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.810 align:middle line:84%
and empower you with
a thought process

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:19.700 align:middle line:84%
to use if you get any feeling
of wanting to continue

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:22.760 align:middle line:84%
with that old addiction
that will help you

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.785 align:middle line:90%
to be mindful in that moment.

00:16:24.785 --> 00:16:29.070 align:middle line:90%


00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:30.420 align:middle line:90%
So let's start now.

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:33.230 align:middle line:90%


00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:36.395 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to imagine that
you're in a vast garden.

00:16:36.395 --> 00:16:39.410 align:middle line:90%


00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:42.020 align:middle line:84%
You look out, and in
the middle of the garden

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.970 align:middle line:90%
is a row of four rooms.

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And within each room, there
are doors linking each room

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:51.110 align:middle line:90%
to each other.

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:54.300 align:middle line:90%


00:16:54.300 --> 00:17:00.860 align:middle line:84%
So on the side of the first
room is a door into that room,

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:03.590 align:middle line:84%
and just a short
walk across that room

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:07.619 align:middle line:90%
is a door to the second room.

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And a short walk
across from that door

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.290 align:middle line:90%
is a door into the third room.

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:15.660 align:middle line:90%


00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.119 align:middle line:84%
And a short walk
across from that door

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:20.040 align:middle line:90%
is a door to the fourth room.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.750 align:middle line:90%


00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And a short walk
across from that door

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:28.745 align:middle line:84%
is a door to the outside
again, into the garden.

00:17:28.745 --> 00:17:34.140 align:middle line:90%


00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:38.310 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, you can start
running through the rooms,

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:42.780 align:middle line:84%
opening and closing doors
as quickly as you can,

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:46.815 align:middle line:84%
from door to door and, finally,
back outside again at the end.

00:17:46.815 --> 00:17:52.560 align:middle line:90%


00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:56.280 align:middle line:84%
Inside the first
room is the trigger,

00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:00.480 align:middle line:84%
the cause, the reason you
start thinking about whatever

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:08.030 align:middle line:84%
your addiction is, whether
it's alcohol or cigarettes

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:09.450 align:middle line:90%
or unhealthy food.

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:14.190 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter what it
is, but think about what

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:18.040 align:middle line:90%
it is that triggers you.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:23.230 align:middle line:84%
What is it that triggers you
to pick up another drink, maybe

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:26.200 align:middle line:84%
another cigarette,
maybe junk food,

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.230 align:middle line:84%
whatever addiction it
is you're dealing with?

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:33.160 align:middle line:84%
That first room holds
all the triggers for you,

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.650 align:middle line:84%
all the causes, the
reason you start

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:37.960 align:middle line:90%
thinking about that addiction.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.840 align:middle line:90%


00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:45.550 align:middle line:84%
In the second room is
the worst case scenario,

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:48.940 align:middle line:84%
the ultimate worst
nightmare of you succumbing

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:52.810 align:middle line:84%
to that addiction, if you
had given in and stayed

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:53.940 align:middle line:90%
in the first room.

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:56.590 align:middle line:90%


00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:59.080 align:middle line:84%
It's a frightening,
gloomy room, and you'll

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.180 align:middle line:84%
want to run through it
as quickly as you can.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:06.700 align:middle line:90%


00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:11.560 align:middle line:84%
The third room is empty, and
when you're in this room,

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:15.670 align:middle line:84%
you can assertively
shout, "no," in defiance

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:16.930 align:middle line:90%
of that old addiction.

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:20.240 align:middle line:90%


00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:25.640 align:middle line:84%
As you shout, "no," you see
this as a symbol of the new

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:31.730 align:middle line:84%
that's slamming the door on
that old you, that old path

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:36.620 align:middle line:84%
or that old addiction,
slamming the door on the past

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:39.170 align:middle line:90%
and your past habits.

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Would you enjoy and
get satisfaction

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:43.730 align:middle line:84%
from slamming the door
to that second room?

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:47.730 align:middle line:90%


00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:52.860 align:middle line:84%
In the fourth room is the
fantastic sensation and scene

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:57.660 align:middle line:84%
of the future having moved
on from that old addiction,

00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:02.160 align:middle line:84%
from quitting that addiction,
where you're happy,

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.690 align:middle line:90%
in control, and thriving.

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:08.960 align:middle line:90%


00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:13.550 align:middle line:84%
After the fourth room, you
can exit into the garden

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:18.080 align:middle line:84%
and quickly go back into
the first or, once again,

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:22.430 align:middle line:84%
passing through all of the
rooms as quickly as you can,

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:25.100 align:middle line:84%
getting faster and
faster each time.

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:29.830 align:middle line:90%


00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:33.270 align:middle line:90%
So let's begin.

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:36.720 align:middle line:84%
You step through the first
door, remembering, this

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.650 align:middle line:84%
is the room with
your triggers in it,

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:45.620 align:middle line:84%
and you run across the room to
the door as fast as you can.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:50.000 align:middle line:84%
You run into that second room,
which is filled with your worst

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.370 align:middle line:90%
case scenarios.

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:55.200 align:middle line:84%
You run through
that room, and you

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.330 align:middle line:84%
run to the door
of the third room,

00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:00.690 align:middle line:84%
slamming the door
behind you, assertively

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:04.620 align:middle line:90%
shouting, no, behind you.

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:07.580 align:middle line:84%
You enter into the
fourth room, where

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:11.090 align:middle line:84%
you can enjoy a
moment of what life

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:13.760 align:middle line:84%
will be like without
that old addiction.

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:16.600 align:middle line:90%


00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And then you walk out of
the door into the garden,

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:22.770 align:middle line:84%
and quickly round
to the first door

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:29.460 align:middle line:84%
again, and go through the same
process as fast as you can,

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:33.680 align:middle line:84%
maybe going faster
this time, stepping

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.470 align:middle line:84%
through the first
door, remembering,

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:39.170 align:middle line:84%
this is the room with
your triggers in it.

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:43.460 align:middle line:84%
As you run across the room to
the door as fast as you can,

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:47.780 align:middle line:84%
you run even faster this time
into that second room, filled

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:49.910 align:middle line:90%
with your worst case scenarios.

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And you run to the
door of the third room,

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:54.800 align:middle line:84%
slamming the door
behind you, assertively

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:58.710 align:middle line:90%
shouting, no, behind you.

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:01.100 align:middle line:84%
You enter into the
fourth room, where

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.320 align:middle line:84%
you can enjoy a
moment of what life

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:07.150 align:middle line:84%
will be like without
that old addiction.

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:09.140 align:middle line:90%
Take in those feelings.

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:12.160 align:middle line:90%
Take in those scenes.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And you walk out of the
door into the garden,

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:16.510 align:middle line:84%
and quickly around
to the first door

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:22.780 align:middle line:84%
again, and go through the
same process just as fast.

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:26.710 align:middle line:84%
You sprint across the first
room with your triggers in it,

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:29.540 align:middle line:84%
into that second room,
the worst case scenarios,

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:32.860 align:middle line:84%
slamming the door,
shouting, no, assertively,

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:34.960 align:middle line:90%
entering the third room.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.760 align:middle line:84%
You run into the
fourth room, where

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:38.830 align:middle line:84%
you enjoy a moment
of what life would

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:40.840 align:middle line:84%
be like without
that old addiction.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.430 align:middle line:90%


00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:47.662 align:middle line:84%
And again, into the
first room, remembering

00:22:47.662 --> 00:22:49.370 align:middle line:84%
that's the room with
your triggers in it,

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:53.030 align:middle line:84%
running across the room to
the door as fast as you can,

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:55.100 align:middle line:90%
into the second room.

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:58.220 align:middle line:84%
Worst case scenarios
face you here,

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:01.280 align:middle line:84%
into the third room slamming
the door behind you, shouting,

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:06.320 align:middle line:84%
no, assertively, into the fourth
room, enjoying that moment

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:12.350 align:middle line:84%
of what life would be like
without that old addiction.

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:15.800 align:middle line:84%
Again, running across into the
garden into the first room,

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.440 align:middle line:84%
running as fast as you can
up through all the rooms

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:22.620 align:middle line:84%
into the first room,
through to the second room,

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:26.370 align:middle line:84%
running as quickly as you
can out of that second room

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:29.100 align:middle line:84%
into the third room and
slamming the door behind you,

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:33.540 align:middle line:84%
shouting, no, assertively,
into the fourth room, enjoying

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:36.820 align:middle line:84%
a moment of life without
that old addiction,

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:41.050 align:middle line:84%
and back out again
into the garden.

00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:44.740 align:middle line:84%
You walk away from
the rooms, and you

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:48.650 align:middle line:84%
take a moment to think about
the process you've been through.

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:52.200 align:middle line:90%


00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Take a moment to think
about what you've

00:23:54.480 --> 00:24:01.210 align:middle line:84%
been learning consciously
and subconsciously,

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:06.260 align:middle line:84%
teaching your subconscious mind
and resolving in your mind once

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:07.060 align:middle line:90%
and for all.

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:12.860 align:middle line:90%


00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:16.130 align:middle line:84%
From now on, if you
ever get a feeling

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:21.130 align:middle line:84%
like you want to carry out
that old addictive behavior,

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:27.620 align:middle line:84%
you quickly remember the image,
the powerful visualizations

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:30.710 align:middle line:84%
of that worst case
scenario, and you

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:35.300 align:middle line:84%
follow this by assertively
saying, "no," to yourself,

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.580 align:middle line:84%
and then gaining
instant pleasure

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.260 align:middle line:84%
from the thoughts
of the life you'll

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:41.660 align:middle line:90%
be having, because you said no.

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:45.140 align:middle line:90%


00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:51.030 align:middle line:84%
You relish in the pride
and strength of saying no.

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And you thrive on this,
knowing you now have the power

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:59.310 align:middle line:84%
to stick to this
decision, moving well away

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:00.805 align:middle line:90%
from the worst case scenario.

00:25:00.805 --> 00:25:07.030 align:middle line:90%


00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And each time you listen
to this Mind Talk,

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:13.315 align:middle line:84%
you're strengthening your
subconscious in this area.

00:25:13.315 --> 00:25:16.260 align:middle line:90%


00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:19.800 align:middle line:84%
You prefer to live your
life in the fourth room,

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:24.680 align:middle line:84%
the room of freedom,
free from addiction.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And you're excited about what
the future holds for you now.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:34.380 align:middle line:90%


00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:37.720 align:middle line:84%
If, at any time, those
thoughts come back,

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:41.920 align:middle line:84%
you can acknowledge them
without attaching to them,

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:45.760 align:middle line:84%
and you can allow your mind to
think about that old worst case

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:52.240 align:middle line:84%
scenario, if your mind had
said yes to that old addiction.

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And you can follow
up by saying no,

00:25:55.780 --> 00:26:01.330 align:middle line:84%
and you can be reminded of
the life you have or will

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:03.280 align:middle line:90%
have because you said no.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:08.300 align:middle line:90%


00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:12.980 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to take
in a long, deep breath

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:18.320 align:middle line:84%
and to take a moment to absorb
and contemplate everything

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:21.645 align:middle line:84%
that your subconscious
and conscious mind

00:26:21.645 --> 00:26:22.445 align:middle line:90%
have been learning.

00:26:22.445 --> 00:26:25.870 align:middle line:90%


00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:28.240 align:middle line:84%
We'll now acknowledge
those changes that

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:35.110 align:middle line:84%
have taken place once and for
all in your mind and behavior,

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:40.660 align:middle line:84%
and you're excited and
confident about the future now

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:45.070 align:middle line:84%
and to moving on to happier,
more positive, fulfilling days.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:51.020 align:middle line:90%


00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:53.600 align:middle line:84%
These hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:57.080 align:middle line:84%
embedded in your
subconscious mind

00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:59.540 align:middle line:84%
and will get more
and more powerful

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:01.810 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:04.440 align:middle line:90%


00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count up from 1 to 5

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:10.620 align:middle line:90%
to awaken you.

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of five, you'll
be wide awake, fully refreshed,

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:19.770 align:middle line:84%
alert, and feeling fantastic,
bringing back with you

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:23.820 align:middle line:84%
all the wonderful new
feelings and changes.

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:34.730 align:middle line:84%
Coming back now, so one,
two, three, four, and five.

00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:37.660 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open when you're ready.

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:42.294 align:middle line:90%
