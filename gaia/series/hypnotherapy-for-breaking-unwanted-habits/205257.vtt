[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>> You are listening to the
Nail-Biting Mind Talk audio.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.420 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the hypnosis will
begin, but before it does,

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.780 align:middle line:84%
I'd just like to remind you that
the following audio contains

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.530 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic suggestions
that aim to help you reach

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.840 align:middle line:90%
a deep level of relaxation.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.930 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.620 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place,

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.030 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions, where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.810 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.860 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.340 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.905 align:middle line:84%
will alert you, and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:51.905 --> 00:00:54.500 align:middle line:90%


00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.230 align:middle line:84%
Do remember to listen
to this Mind Talk audio

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.140 align:middle line:84%
several times to
get the most impact

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.270 align:middle line:90%
from the hypnotherapy session.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And please don't
forget to write how

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.070 align:middle line:90%
you feel after each session.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.970 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
there's nothing at all

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.590 align:middle line:84%
you need to do apart from close
your eyes, relax and let go,

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.770 align:middle line:84%
and enjoy those peaceful
feelings and all

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.320 align:middle line:90%
the benefits that come with it.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.730 align:middle line:90%


00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.920 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now
to make yourself

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.670 align:middle line:84%
as comfortable as
possible, and listen

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.020 align:middle line:90%
to the sound of my voice.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.480 align:middle line:90%


00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And as you do so, you may be
aware of other sounds going on

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.780 align:middle line:90%
around you.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.340 align:middle line:84%
But you know that
they're not important.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.020 align:middle line:84%
They don't matter at all,
and you can dismiss them out

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.030 align:middle line:84%
of your awareness, and
focus your mind entirely

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.860 align:middle line:90%
on what I'm saying.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.020 align:middle line:90%


00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.120 align:middle line:84%
This is your time, and
you make the most of it.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.020 align:middle line:90%


00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.470 align:middle line:84%
No one needs or wants
anything from you at all.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.000 align:middle line:90%


00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to
take in a deep breath,

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.955 align:middle line:84%
filling your lungs as much as
you can, and let it out slowly.

00:02:19.955 --> 00:02:24.210 align:middle line:90%


00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And again, take in a long, slow
breath, and when you're ready,

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.240 align:middle line:90%
let it out slowly.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.920 align:middle line:90%


00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can allow your
breathing to return to normal--

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:50.760 align:middle line:84%
gentle breaths in
and out, returning

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.295 align:middle line:84%
to your normal gentle
breathing pace.

00:02:53.295 --> 00:02:59.250 align:middle line:90%


00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now
to imagine yourself

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.280 align:middle line:84%
outside in your favorite
place in nature.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.650 align:middle line:90%


00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.320 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a peaceful
tropical beach,

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.080 align:middle line:84%
or it could be a
beautiful garden.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.470 align:middle line:90%


00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you can
imagine lying back

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:25.200 align:middle line:84%
on a boat, which is sailing
on a tranquil river.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.440 align:middle line:84%
It really doesn't matter
where you are, as long

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.890 align:middle line:90%
as it feels good to you.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.420 align:middle line:90%


00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.500 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beautiful day.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:44.800 align:middle line:84%
The sky is a special
shade of blue, so clear.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.920 align:middle line:90%
And it's a warm summer's day.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.620 align:middle line:90%


00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.390 align:middle line:84%
There's a breeze gently
blowing over you,

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.480 align:middle line:84%
and the temperature is
just how you like it.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:05.690 align:middle line:90%


00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And in the sky is
a dazzling sun,

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.310 align:middle line:84%
so bright that you just
want to close your eyes

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.829 align:middle line:84%
and feel the glowing healing
warmth of the sun on your body.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.850 align:middle line:90%


00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And surprisingly, you find
that you can direct that sun

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.830 align:middle line:90%
over and around your body.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And as you realize
this, you begin

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.955 align:middle line:84%
to direct the light from
the sun over your face.

00:04:37.955 --> 00:04:42.070 align:middle line:90%


00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.010 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the healing
warmth of the light

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:50.350 align:middle line:84%
from the sun over your face,
just relaxing those muscles

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.255 align:middle line:84%
around the eyes, around the
nose and mouth and your brow.

00:04:55.255 --> 00:04:58.920 align:middle line:90%


00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And as you do this, you find
that your facial muscles

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.420 align:middle line:84%
begin to flatten
out as they relax,

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.370 align:middle line:90%
and you let go completely.

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.820 align:middle line:90%


00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.420 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beautiful day.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.920 align:middle line:84%
You move the light from the
sun into the throat area,

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:26.350 align:middle line:84%
feeling the warmth of the light
from the sun in your throat,

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:31.030 align:middle line:84%
relaxing all the muscles, just
letting go completely now.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:36.280 align:middle line:90%


00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And the warm sunlight now
moving into your shoulders

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.720 align:middle line:84%
and across your
shoulders, making them

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:52.960 align:middle line:84%
feel loose and limp
and comfortable,

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.320 align:middle line:84%
as your shoulders sink into
the frame of your body.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.670 align:middle line:90%


00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And you feel so comfortable
now, so relaxed and at peace,

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.744 align:middle line:84%
and you let nothing bother
or concern you at all.

00:06:15.744 --> 00:06:19.920 align:middle line:90%


00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And you direct the light from
the sun down your right arm,

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:30.050 align:middle line:84%
from the shoulders to
the tips of your fingers.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:36.610 align:middle line:84%
Your right arm begins
to relax and let go,

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.770 align:middle line:84%
and it's a beautiful feeling
to be here right now.

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.930 align:middle line:90%


00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.120 align:middle line:84%
The warmth of the
light from the sun

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.290 align:middle line:84%
penetrates the nerves and bones
and muscles of that right arm.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:55.190 align:middle line:90%


00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.800 align:middle line:90%
And it's such a beautiful day.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.110 align:middle line:84%
You move the sun
over to your left arm

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:09.020 align:middle line:84%
and guide the light from the
sun down and up your left arm,

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:13.490 align:middle line:84%
from the top of your
shoulders, all the way down

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:14.885 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your fingers.

00:07:14.885 --> 00:07:17.570 align:middle line:90%


00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:23.450 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the left arm
relaxing, becoming comfortably

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:27.215 align:middle line:90%
heavy and totally relaxed.

00:07:27.215 --> 00:07:32.750 align:middle line:90%


00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, move that moonlight
across and into the chest area,

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:43.370 align:middle line:84%
and relax the chest,
all the muscles there.

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:46.700 align:middle line:90%


00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:50.360 align:middle line:84%
Now down to the stomach,
relaxing your tummy down

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.892 align:middle line:84%
into your hips and your
thighs over to your right leg.

00:07:54.892 --> 00:07:58.510 align:middle line:90%


00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:03.370 align:middle line:84%
The light warms the muscles
as you relax your right leg.

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:08.290 align:middle line:84%
Let it feel comfortable
and heavy now.

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:12.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, move the light from
the sun down your right leg,

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:17.560 align:middle line:84%
up and down from the top of the
hips to the tips of your toes,

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.390 align:middle line:84%
as the right leg
relaxes, and you let go.

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:27.820 align:middle line:90%


00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a beautiful
day, you now move the light

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.580 align:middle line:90%
into your left leg.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:39.340 align:middle line:84%
You move it up and down the left
leg, from the top of the hips

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.070 align:middle line:84%
to the tips of your
toes, and your left leg

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:48.900 align:middle line:84%
relaxes, releasing tension,
letting go now completely.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:52.810 align:middle line:90%


00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:59.630 align:middle line:84%
Your whole body is now totally
and completely relaxed,

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:02.330 align:middle line:84%
from the top of your
head all the way down

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:03.755 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your toes.

00:09:03.755 --> 00:09:07.720 align:middle line:90%


00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And as your body relaxes,
your mind also relaxes.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:16.910 align:middle line:90%


00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And I want you now to
notice that the sun is

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:27.070 align:middle line:84%
setting, going down now,
deeper and deeper down.

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And you're so deeply
relaxed, but still completely

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:32.020 align:middle line:90%
alert and aware.

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:34.870 align:middle line:90%


00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:38.140 align:middle line:84%
You resist the temptation
to fall asleep.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:40.450 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is thoroughly
relaxed, but you

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:42.160 align:middle line:90%
stay focused on these words.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.580 align:middle line:90%


00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.260 align:middle line:84%
So now, I'd like you to
use your imagination,

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:54.640 align:middle line:84%
and once again, you're in a
wonderful place in nature.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:59.230 align:middle line:84%
The trees are a
beautiful shade of green.

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:02.220 align:middle line:84%
It's a stunning day, and the
sun is shining down on you.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.740 align:middle line:90%


00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:09.550 align:middle line:84%
There's a soft and
gentle breeze in the air,

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:12.490 align:middle line:84%
making you feel pleasantly
relaxed and calm.

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:16.000 align:middle line:90%


00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.200 align:middle line:84%
All around, you can see
trees and plants and an array

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:25.490 align:middle line:84%
of the most beautiful
flowers you have ever seen,

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:28.870 align:middle line:90%
so colorful and vibrant.

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And you can smell the rich
aroma of these flowers,

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:34.650 align:middle line:90%
making you feel so peaceful.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:39.040 align:middle line:90%


00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.860 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else matters right now.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.820 align:middle line:84%
You feel completely
at ease and so calm.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.710 align:middle line:90%


00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And in the distance, you
can hear the sound of water

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:52.675 align:middle line:90%
flowing slowly and gently.

00:10:52.675 --> 00:10:56.580 align:middle line:90%


00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:00.065 align:middle line:84%
The sound of water is helping
you to go more and more deeply

00:11:00.065 --> 00:11:00.865 align:middle line:90%
relaxed.

00:11:00.865 --> 00:11:03.760 align:middle line:90%


00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.290 align:middle line:84%
You may feel your muscles
loosening more and more,

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:10.180 align:middle line:84%
relaxing with the beautiful
flowing sound of water.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:14.940 align:middle line:90%


00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:21.330 align:middle line:84%
Out of curiosity, you decide to
follow the sound of the water,

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:25.170 align:middle line:84%
and you feel excited about
where it's leading you,

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:27.000 align:middle line:84%
knowing deep within
yourself, you're

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.320 align:middle line:84%
going to a very special
place, a place where

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.350 align:middle line:84%
you're going to create
some positive, wonderful,

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:35.645 align:middle line:90%
long-lasting changes.

00:11:35.645 --> 00:11:39.990 align:middle line:90%


00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:44.280 align:middle line:84%
As you walk slowly
towards the water,

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:49.320 align:middle line:84%
you can hear the sound of
birds singing in the trees.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.045 align:middle line:90%
You feel totally at ease.

00:11:51.045 --> 00:11:54.910 align:middle line:90%


00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:58.120 align:middle line:84%
As you finally
reach the lake, you

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:02.860 align:middle line:84%
realize it's the most beautiful
vision you've ever seen,

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:05.530 align:middle line:84%
and you're in awe of the
beauty that surrounds you.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:09.590 align:middle line:90%


00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:13.760 align:middle line:84%
The vast lake is filled
with a variety of colors,

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:19.310 align:middle line:84%
rich colors of blues,
turquoise, and light greens,

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:23.080 align:middle line:84%
and it fills your mind and
body with a wave of relaxation.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.730 align:middle line:90%


00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:29.480 align:middle line:84%
You may be becoming more relaxed
with each and every breath

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:37.760 align:middle line:84%
you take, feeling more calm,
more peaceful, and more

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.260 align:middle line:90%
relaxed than ever before.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.920 align:middle line:90%


00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:46.760 align:middle line:84%
Your mind may be
drifting in and out,

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:51.560 align:middle line:84%
just letting go deeper
and deeper still.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:56.390 align:middle line:84%
You may feel as though your
mind is flowing gently,

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:59.440 align:middle line:84%
flowing gently like the
lake in your imagination.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:03.050 align:middle line:90%


00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:06.320 align:middle line:84%
You look into the distance,
and you can see a wooden bridge

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.610 align:middle line:90%
leading over the lake.

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:10.340 align:middle line:90%


00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:13.130 align:middle line:84%
You walk towards the bridge,
feeling more and more

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:14.150 align:middle line:90%
deeply relaxed.

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.700 align:middle line:90%


00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.530 align:middle line:84%
As you reach the
bridge, you can see

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:22.682 align:middle line:84%
there are 10 steps leading over
to the other side of the lake.

00:13:22.682 --> 00:13:26.120 align:middle line:90%


00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.870 align:middle line:84%
You slowly start
walking over the bridge,

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:31.625 align:middle line:90%
counting the steps in your mind.

00:13:31.625 --> 00:13:34.380 align:middle line:90%


00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:46.210 align:middle line:84%
10, 9, deeper and
deeper still, 8, 7,

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:57.090 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to
relaxation now, 6, 5, and 4,

00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:05.760 align:middle line:84%
drifting off peacefully and
easily, 3, 2, all the way down,

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:10.860 align:middle line:90%
deep and relaxed, and 1.

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.050 align:middle line:84%
You see a comfortable
padded chair,

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:16.320 align:middle line:84%
and you take a seat,
ready to embrace

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:20.280 align:middle line:84%
the changes to come in your
deep state of relaxation now.

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.580 align:middle line:90%


00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:27.660 align:middle line:84%
You are now deeply relaxed
and ready to accept

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:31.770 align:middle line:90%
the suggestions I give you.

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And for a while now, you've
been biting your nails,

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:39.710 align:middle line:84%
and this is something
you would like to stop.

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:43.250 align:middle line:84%
As I'm sure you are
aware, some people

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:48.140 align:middle line:84%
start biting their nails when
they are anxious or stressed.

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And after a while,
they don't even

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:53.960 align:middle line:84%
realize they're doing it,
until other people comment

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:57.110 align:middle line:90%
about your habit.

00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And of course, just
like any other habit,

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:04.370 align:middle line:84%
the more you bite your nails,
the harder it can be to stop.

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:07.220 align:middle line:90%


00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is because nail-biting
has now become an unconscious

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:15.200 align:middle line:84%
response, something you
might do when you're not

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.500 align:middle line:90%
even stressed or anxious.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.480 align:middle line:84%
But you're beginning
to realize how

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.140 align:middle line:90%
unsightly chewed nails look.

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:27.890 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you hide your
hands in embarrassment

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:32.310 align:middle line:84%
when attention is brought
to that region of your body.

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's because you want
to look good and feel good

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:40.670 align:middle line:84%
and would like to have lovely,
smooth, rounded nails that you

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:43.340 align:middle line:84%
have decided to use
hypnosis to help

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:49.760 align:middle line:84%
you to overcome that old habit
of yours once and for all.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:54.650 align:middle line:84%
And because nail-biting is an
automated pattern of behavior,

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:57.140 align:middle line:84%
hypnotherapy is the
ideal method for you

00:15:57.140 --> 00:16:01.670 align:middle line:84%
to quit the habit, because
your subconscious mind governs

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:05.780 align:middle line:84%
your automatic nervous
system, the part of you

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:09.140 align:middle line:84%
that regulates your
breathing, your heartbeat,

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:13.760 align:middle line:84%
the flow of your blood, and
the movement of your muscles.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And this includes the muscles
of your shoulders and arms

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:22.370 align:middle line:84%
that lift up your hands and
fingers and nails to mouth.

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:26.570 align:middle line:84%
But very soon, you're going
to forget that response,

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:31.340 align:middle line:84%
and you know how easy it
can be to forget something.

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:34.550 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you had the experience
of going to another room

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:36.840 align:middle line:90%
to collect something.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you went out of
the door, the object you were

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:45.350 align:middle line:84%
going to bring back flies
straight out of your mind,

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.960 align:middle line:84%
or maybe even at
this moment, you

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.110 align:middle line:84%
forgot about the position
of your left foot,

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:55.660 align:middle line:84%
until I just brought
it to your attention.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we can be in
the middle of doing something

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:03.190 align:middle line:84%
when we're suddenly distracted,
and then whatever we're doing

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:06.640 align:middle line:90%
is totally forgotten.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And when this
happens, we may need

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:12.640 align:middle line:84%
to retrace our steps
in order to remember.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.550 align:middle line:84%
So from now on, instead
of putting your fingers

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:20.000 align:middle line:84%
to your mouth, you're going
to find a new way to forget.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.170 align:middle line:84%
You will simply
do something else.

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And this other activity
is going to make

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:28.990 align:middle line:84%
it so easy for you to forget
about biting your nails.

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:31.780 align:middle line:90%


00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And the longer you go
without biting your nails,

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:39.040 align:middle line:84%
the more ridiculous that old
habit of yours seems to be.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.650 align:middle line:90%


00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:46.090 align:middle line:84%
From this day forward, you
have had enough of nail biting.

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:49.270 align:middle line:84%
It's something that you
used to do but no longer do.

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:51.950 align:middle line:90%


00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:54.620 align:middle line:84%
When you see other people
biting their nails,

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:59.010 align:middle line:84%
it seems more and more
like a silly thing to do.

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:04.490 align:middle line:84%
It's so easy to forget that this
is something you used to do.

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:09.050 align:middle line:84%
You no longer need that
old, unwanted response,

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:12.260 align:middle line:84%
because from now
on, you are becoming

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:18.180 align:middle line:84%
calmer and more relaxed and
far more confident, too.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And you find yourself practicing
regular deep breathing

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:25.470 align:middle line:84%
techniques instead
of biting your nails,

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:30.120 align:middle line:84%
breathing in slowly and
evenly, holding your breath

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:35.760 align:middle line:84%
with a mental count of four and
exhaling a long, slow breath.

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.520 align:middle line:90%


00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And you practice your
breathing whenever it's

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.510 align:middle line:90%
appropriate for you to do so.

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:45.430 align:middle line:90%


00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And as you do breathing, you're
reminded of how much calmer

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:54.180 align:middle line:84%
and how much more relaxed
and happier you now are.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:56.940 align:middle line:90%


00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:02.580 align:middle line:84%
You feel an inner sense of
calmness, peace, harmony,

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:05.550 align:middle line:84%
and tranquility,
and these feelings

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:06.930 align:middle line:90%
are going to remain with you.

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:11.410 align:middle line:90%


00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And if nail-biting is brought to
your attention by someone else,

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:18.240 align:middle line:84%
you immediately feel
a deep sense of pride

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:22.320 align:middle line:84%
in your achievements, and your
lovely smooth, rounded nails

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.195 align:middle line:90%
make you look and feel great.

00:19:24.195 --> 00:19:26.990 align:middle line:90%


00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:30.170 align:middle line:84%
As you're enjoying these
wonderful feelings of calmness

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.590 align:middle line:84%
and relaxation, I
wonder if you would also

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:36.140 align:middle line:84%
like to learn a very
special technique

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:39.710 align:middle line:84%
to help you to create this
wonderful feeling whenever

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:40.510 align:middle line:90%
you want to.

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:43.650 align:middle line:90%


00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:48.630 align:middle line:84%
So gently lift your hand,
your fingers up to your cheek,

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:54.810 align:middle line:84%
ever so slowly lifting,
floating, lifting your hand up

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:55.830 align:middle line:90%
to your cheek.

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And as it touches
your cheek, you

00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:01.440 align:middle line:84%
notice a pleasant feeling
spreading over you.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.650 align:middle line:84%
A wave of complete
peace and relaxation

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:06.900 align:middle line:84%
washes over your
body and your mind,

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:13.620 align:middle line:84%
relaxing you, calming you,
and making you feel wonderful.

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:19.110 align:middle line:84%
You immediately experience a
very calm and pleasant feeling

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:22.860 align:middle line:84%
as you notice the feel
of the skin on your cheek

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.360 align:middle line:90%
beneath your fingertips.

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:29.160 align:middle line:90%


00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Soft to the touch, smooth and
comfortable, such a lovely,

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:37.890 align:middle line:84%
comfortable, and
comforting feeling,

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:40.110 align:middle line:84%
and whenever you want
to feel that way again,

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:43.650 align:middle line:84%
your inner mind will direct
your hand and your fingers

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:46.530 align:middle line:84%
to touch your cheek,
and you will, again,

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:49.770 align:middle line:84%
experience that curiously
calming sensation.

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:53.440 align:middle line:90%


00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And in the past, when you
used to bite your nails,

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.360 align:middle line:84%
you found that
chewing those nails

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.900 align:middle line:84%
seemed to help with the
tension inside of you.

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.810 align:middle line:90%
And all of that is changing now.

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:08.060 align:middle line:90%
Your body knows how to relax.

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:11.380 align:middle line:84%
Instead of chewing those nails,
if you feel tension or need

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:14.440 align:middle line:84%
comfort, or for
any other reason,

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.620 align:middle line:84%
you simply allow the
hand to float up,

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:22.210 align:middle line:84%
past your mouth and teeth
to touch your cheek.

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And as your hands and
fingers touch your cheek,

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:28.120 align:middle line:84%
you feel, once again,
this wonderful, calm,

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.920 align:middle line:90%
and curious feeling.

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.590 align:middle line:84%
You immediately
experience a sensation

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:38.350 align:middle line:84%
of calm, a sensation
of curiosity.

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:40.950 align:middle line:90%
How does your cheek feel?

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:44.460 align:middle line:84%
Touching your cheek is your
cue to experience once more

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:50.110 align:middle line:84%
that lovely, calming,
relaxing feeling.

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:52.990 align:middle line:90%
And you feel wonderful.

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:56.680 align:middle line:90%
You feel calm and relaxed.

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And you feel proud of
yourself as those nails

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:02.140 align:middle line:90%
start to grow and take shape.

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:04.820 align:middle line:90%
No more ragged edges.

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:08.440 align:middle line:84%
They're beginning to feel
so smooth and comfortable,

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:12.740 align:middle line:90%
looking and feeling so good.

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:14.560 align:middle line:84%
You're becoming
proud of your hands

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:18.230 align:middle line:84%
and how good your nails
look now and also enjoying

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:22.510 align:middle line:84%
the wonderful, calm, relaxing
feelings and confidence

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:24.890 align:middle line:84%
that comes from knowing
that you are now in control.

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:27.640 align:middle line:90%


00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:31.260 align:middle line:84%
You've had enough
of nail biting.

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:34.900 align:middle line:84%
You see it as something
you used to do in the past,

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:37.230 align:middle line:84%
but you no longer
need to do that,

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:38.520 align:middle line:90%
and this makes you feel great.

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.730 align:middle line:90%


00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And these suggestions are firmly
embedded in your subconscious

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:49.840 align:middle line:84%
mind, and they grow stronger
and stronger day by day.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.590 align:middle line:90%


00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:56.070 align:middle line:84%
They grow stronger by the
day and stronger by the hour,

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:59.800 align:middle line:90%
stronger by the minute.

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:04.510 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, I'm going to
count the numbers from 1 to 5,

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:07.600 align:middle line:84%
and at the count of five,
you'll be wide awake,

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:11.650 align:middle line:84%
refreshed and alert and ready
to allow the suggestions to work

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:13.660 align:middle line:90%
for you.

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:19.150 align:middle line:84%
One, two, three,
coming slowly back,

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:22.510 align:middle line:84%
four, eyelids beginning
to flutter, and five,

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:27.750 align:middle line:84%
eyes open, wide awake, mind and
body returning to normality.

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:31.200 align:middle line:90%
