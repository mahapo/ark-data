00:00:09.101 --> 00:00:13.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Hi, I'm Sophie from
the House of Wellbeing.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.040 align:middle line:84%
In our addiction
and stopping habits

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.250 align:middle line:84%
guided meditation and
hypnotherapy series,

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.870 align:middle line:84%
you'll find audio
to help you deal

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.330 align:middle line:84%
with a variety of different
addictions and habits

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.230 align:middle line:84%
that you no longer want or
need, such as addiction, anger

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.080 align:middle line:84%
management, blushing,
nail biting,

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.220 align:middle line:84%
obsessive-compulsive disorder,
overcoming laziness, sugar

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.270 align:middle line:84%
addiction, and clenching
your teeth and jaw at night.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.790 align:middle line:10%
Our audio is slightly
different to guided meditation

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.070 align:middle line:10%
alone because we use
powerful therapeutic tools,

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.490 align:middle line:10%
including cognitive
behavioral therapy,

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.820 align:middle line:10%
neurolinguistic therapy,
visualization, and of course,

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.380 align:middle line:10%
hypnotherapy.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.110 align:middle line:10%
And it's that combination of
powerful therapeutic tools

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.140 align:middle line:10%
put all together that help
you to make those changes

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.960 align:middle line:10%
to those unwanted, negative
thinking patterns, beliefs,

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.580 align:middle line:10%
and behaviors.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.260 align:middle line:84%
When you listen to
our audios, you'll

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.320 align:middle line:84%
be put into a deep
state of relaxation.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's a state that's
really familiar to you.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.670 align:middle line:84%
You go into that state just as
you fall asleep every evening.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.460 align:middle line:10%
It's a really natural
state, and it's really safe,

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.250 align:middle line:10%
so there's nothing to
worry about at all.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.590 align:middle line:84%
When you're in that lovely,
deep state of relaxation,

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.840 align:middle line:84%
your brain waves go into
the theta brainwave state.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's important
because then we

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.430 align:middle line:84%
can bypass your conscious
mind and talk directly

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.870 align:middle line:90%
to your subconscious mind.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And the reason we want to
get to your subconscious mind

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.180 align:middle line:84%
is because that's where all
your permanent thoughts, habits,

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.650 align:middle line:90%
and memories live.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.290 align:middle line:84%
So by talking directly to
your subconscious mind,

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.900 align:middle line:84%
we're able to really
make some changes.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.540 align:middle line:84%
We're able to retrain,
reframe, and rewire

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.790 align:middle line:84%
your mind so that
we can eliminate

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.070 align:middle line:84%
that negative
thinking and instead

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.770 align:middle line:84%
replace with
empowering suggestions,

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.210 align:middle line:90%
and they'll be long lasting.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see those
changes once and for all.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.100 align:middle line:84%
We recommend that you
listen to our audios

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.310 align:middle line:84%
at least four times so you can
override those old thinking

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.190 align:middle line:84%
patterns and you can compound
with new positive thinking

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.120 align:middle line:90%
patterns.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.360 align:middle line:90%
It's different for everyone.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.259 align:middle line:84%
But do make sure you listen
to them at least four times.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And you should soon start to
see some changes in the way

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.860 align:middle line:90%
that you think or feel.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.590 align:middle line:84%
You can listen to our audios at
any time of the day or night.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.840 align:middle line:10%
But we suggest that you
listen to them when you're not

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.290 align:middle line:10%
too tired because if you
fall into a deep, deep sleep,

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.520 align:middle line:10%
then your subconscious
mind just isn't listening.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.790 align:middle line:84%
So try and stay in a
nice, relaxed state

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.080 align:middle line:84%
but not into a deep state where
you've just fallen asleep.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.295 align:middle line:84%
Do make sure that you
listen to our audios

00:02:34.295 --> 00:02:35.920 align:middle line:84%
when you're free from
any distractions.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.753 align:middle line:84%
So don't listen to them
when you're actively

00:02:37.753 --> 00:02:41.440 align:middle line:84%
doing something, like driving
or operating machinery.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.230 align:middle line:84%
If there's an emergency and you
need to come out of hypnosis,

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.440 align:middle line:90%
that's no problem.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.630 align:middle line:90%
That's absolutely fine.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.430 align:middle line:84%
Your subconscious
mind will alert you,

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.950 align:middle line:84%
and your easily come
out of hypnosis,

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.710 align:middle line:84%
just like waking up from a
nap or from a little sleep.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.780 align:middle line:90%
It's no problem at all.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.380 align:middle line:84%
So for now, please click
on any audio that you feel

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.750 align:middle line:84%
is relevant to you
within the series.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Find a comfortable position,
whether it's a bed or chair,

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.570 align:middle line:84%
just any way you can
relax and let go.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.620 align:middle line:90%
So close your eyes to begin.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.000 align:middle line:90%
