You're listening to the sugar
addiction mind talk audio.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.170 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.920 align:middle line:84%
But before it does,
I'd like to remind you

So please be sure that wherever
you listen to this audio,

comfortable place,

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.190 align:middle line:84%
somewhere you're free
from distractions, where

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.233 align:middle line:90%
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:42.233 --> 00:00:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.160 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.910 align:middle line:84%
will alert you and your
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.470 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
there's nothing at all

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.890 align:middle line:84%
you need to do apart
from close your eyes,

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.520 align:middle line:84%
relax, and let go and enjoy
all those peaceful feelings

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.660 align:middle line:84%
and all the benefits
that come with it.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.300 align:middle line:84%
I do like you now
to make yourself

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.070 align:middle line:84%
as comfortable as
possible and listen

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.420 align:middle line:90%
to the sound of my voice.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.820 align:middle line:90%


00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And as you do so, you may be
aware of other sounds going on

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.230 align:middle line:90%
around you.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.800 align:middle line:90%


00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.740 align:middle line:84%
You know that they're
not important.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.610 align:middle line:90%
They don't matter at all.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And you can dismiss them
out of your awareness

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.265 align:middle line:84%
and focus your mind
entirely on what I'm saying.

00:01:36.265 --> 00:01:39.350 align:middle line:90%


00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.710 align:middle line:84%
This is your time, and
you make the most of it.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.410 align:middle line:90%


00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.860 align:middle line:84%
No one needs or wants
anything from you at all.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.360 align:middle line:90%


00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to
take in a deep breath,

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:04.295 align:middle line:84%
filling your lungs as much as
you can, and let it out slowly.

00:02:04.295 --> 00:02:08.560 align:middle line:90%


00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And again, taking a
long, slow breath.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.350 align:middle line:90%


00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready,
let it out slowly.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.350 align:middle line:90%


00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.780 align:middle line:84%
Now you can allow your
breathing to return to normal.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:35.150 align:middle line:84%
Gentle breaths in
and out, returning

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.685 align:middle line:84%
to your normal gentle
breathing pace.

00:02:37.685 --> 00:02:43.540 align:middle line:90%


00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now
to imagine yourself

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.700 align:middle line:84%
outside in your favorite
place in nature.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.000 align:middle line:90%


00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.650 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a peaceful
tropical beach,

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.480 align:middle line:84%
or it could be a
beautiful garden.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.850 align:middle line:90%


00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you can
imagine lying back

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.985 align:middle line:84%
on a boat, which is sailing
on a tranquil river.

00:03:06.985 --> 00:03:09.520 align:middle line:90%


00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.520 align:middle line:84%
It really doesn't
matter where you are as

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.300 align:middle line:90%
long as it feels good to you.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.740 align:middle line:90%


00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.285 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beautiful day.

00:03:19.285 --> 00:03:21.920 align:middle line:90%


00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:29.100 align:middle line:84%
The sky is a special
shade of blue, so clear.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.370 align:middle line:90%
And it's a warm summer's day.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.980 align:middle line:90%


00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.770 align:middle line:84%
There's a breeze gently
blowing over you,

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.750 align:middle line:84%
and the temperature is
just how you like it.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:50.090 align:middle line:90%


00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And in the sky is
a dazzling sun,

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.700 align:middle line:84%
so bright that you just
want to close your eyes

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.250 align:middle line:84%
and feel the glowing, healing
warmth of the sun on your body.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.310 align:middle line:90%


00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And surprisingly, you find
that you can direct that sun

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.120 align:middle line:90%
over and around your body.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And as you realize
this, you begin

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.330 align:middle line:84%
to direct the light from
the sun over your face.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.420 align:middle line:90%


00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.390 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the healing
warmth of the light

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.730 align:middle line:84%
from the sun over your face,
just relaxing those muscles

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.675 align:middle line:84%
around the eyes, around the
nose and mouth and your brow.

00:04:39.675 --> 00:04:43.250 align:middle line:90%


00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And as you do this, you find
that your facial muscles

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:51.230 align:middle line:84%
begin to flatten out
as they relax and you

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.790 align:middle line:90%
let go completely.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.170 align:middle line:90%


00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.800 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beautiful day.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.340 align:middle line:84%
You move the light from the
sun into the throat area,

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.690 align:middle line:84%
feeling the warmth of the light
from the sun in your throat,

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:20.600 align:middle line:84%
relaxing all the muscles,
just letting go completely now

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:26.740 align:middle line:84%
and the warm sunlight now
moving into your shoulders

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.480 align:middle line:84%
and across your shoulders,
making them feel

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:37.270 align:middle line:90%
loose and limp and comfortable.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:45.960 align:middle line:84%
As your shoulders sink
into the frame of your body

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:52.680 align:middle line:84%
and you feel so comfortable
now, so relaxed and at peace.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.520 align:middle line:90%


00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And you let nothing bother
or concern you at all.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.270 align:middle line:90%


00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And you direct the light from
the sun down your right arm,

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:14.390 align:middle line:84%
from the shoulders to
the tips of your fingers.

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.860 align:middle line:84%
Your right arm begins
to relax and let go.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.810 align:middle line:90%


00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's a beautiful feeling
to be here right now.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.260 align:middle line:90%


00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.510 align:middle line:84%
The warmth of the
light from the sun

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.710 align:middle line:84%
penetrates the nerves and bones
and muscles of that right arm.

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:39.560 align:middle line:90%


00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.140 align:middle line:90%
And it's such a beautiful day.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:46.550 align:middle line:84%
You move the sun
over to your left arm

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:53.420 align:middle line:84%
and guide the light from the
sun down and up your left arm,

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.900 align:middle line:84%
from the top of your
shoulders, all the way down

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.280 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your fingers.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.970 align:middle line:90%


00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:06.230 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the
left arm relaxing,

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:11.630 align:middle line:84%
becoming uncomfortably
heavy and totally relaxed.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:17.080 align:middle line:90%


00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:23.790 align:middle line:84%
Now move that warm light
across and into the chest area,

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:28.243 align:middle line:84%
and relax the chest,
all the muscles there.

00:07:28.243 --> 00:07:30.961 align:middle line:90%


00:07:30.961 --> 00:07:34.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, down to the stomach,
relaxing your tummy,

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:39.310 align:middle line:84%
down into your hips and your
thighs, over to your right leg.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:42.830 align:middle line:90%


00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:47.850 align:middle line:84%
The light warms the muscles
as you relax your right leg.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:50.415 align:middle line:84%
Let it feel comfortable
and heavy now.

00:07:50.415 --> 00:07:53.390 align:middle line:90%


00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:57.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, move the light from
the sun down your right leg,

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:01.880 align:middle line:84%
up and down from the top of the
hips to the tips of your toes

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.810 align:middle line:84%
as the right leg
relaxes and you let go.

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:12.160 align:middle line:90%


00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.320 align:middle line:90%
And it's such a beautiful day.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, move the light
into your left leg.

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:23.740 align:middle line:84%
You move it up and down the left
leg, from the top of the hips

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.450 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your toes.

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And your left leg relaxes
releasing tension,

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:33.350 align:middle line:90%
letting go now completely.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:37.190 align:middle line:90%


00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Your whole body is now
totally and completely relaxed

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.730 align:middle line:84%
from the top of your
head all the way down

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:48.135 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your toes.

00:08:48.135 --> 00:08:52.050 align:middle line:90%


00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And as your body relaxes,
your mind also relaxes.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:01.260 align:middle line:90%


00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And I want you now to
notice that the sun is

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:11.470 align:middle line:84%
setting, going down now,
deeper and deeper down.

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And you're so deeply
relaxed, but still completely

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:16.270 align:middle line:90%
alert and aware.

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:19.240 align:middle line:90%


00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.480 align:middle line:84%
You resist the temptation
to fall asleep.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.820 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is thoroughly
relaxed, but you

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.560 align:middle line:90%
stay focused on these words.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:30.940 align:middle line:90%


00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:34.560 align:middle line:84%
So now, I'd like you to
use your imagination.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And once again, you're in a
wonderful place in nature.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:43.570 align:middle line:84%
The trees are a
beautiful shade of green.

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:46.660 align:middle line:84%
It's a stunning day and the
sun is shining down on you.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:50.090 align:middle line:90%


00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:53.930 align:middle line:84%
There's a soft and
gentle breeze in the air,

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:56.880 align:middle line:84%
making you feel pleasantly
relaxed and calm.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.360 align:middle line:90%


00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.590 align:middle line:84%
All around you can see trees
and plants and an array

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:09.910 align:middle line:84%
of the most beautiful
flowers you have ever seen,

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:13.190 align:middle line:90%
so colorful and vibrant.

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And you can smell the rich
aroma of these flowers

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.085 align:middle line:90%
making you feel so peaceful.

00:10:19.085 --> 00:10:23.370 align:middle line:90%


00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:26.220 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else matters right now.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:29.010 align:middle line:84%
You feel completely
teased and so calm.

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:32.060 align:middle line:90%


00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And in the distance, you
can hear the sound of water

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.115 align:middle line:90%
flowing slowly and gently.

00:10:37.115 --> 00:10:40.930 align:middle line:90%


00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:44.360 align:middle line:84%
The sound of water is helping
you to go more and more deeply

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.160 align:middle line:90%
relaxed.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.070 align:middle line:90%


00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:51.650 align:middle line:84%
You may feel your muscles
loosening more and more.

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:54.615 align:middle line:84%
Relaxing with the beautiful
flowing sound of water.

00:10:54.615 --> 00:10:59.310 align:middle line:90%


00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:02.970 align:middle line:84%
Out of curiosity, you decide to
follow the sound of the water.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.650 align:middle line:90%


00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And you feel excited about where
it's leading you, knowing deep

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:15.010 align:middle line:84%
within yourself you're going
to a very special place,

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:16.780 align:middle line:84%
a place where you're
going to create

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:20.030 align:middle line:84%
some positive, wonderful
long lasting changes.

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:24.410 align:middle line:90%


00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:28.650 align:middle line:84%
As you walk slowly
towards the water,

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:33.720 align:middle line:84%
you can hear the sound of
birds singing in the trees.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.470 align:middle line:90%
You feel totally at ease.

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:39.250 align:middle line:90%


00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:42.520 align:middle line:84%
As you finally
reach the lake, you

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:47.200 align:middle line:84%
realize it's the most beautiful
vision you've ever seen,

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.160 align:middle line:84%
and you're in awe of the
beauty that surrounds you.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.950 align:middle line:90%


00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:56.530 align:middle line:84%
The vast lake is
filled with a variety

00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:03.730 align:middle line:84%
of colors, rich colors of blues,
turquoise, and light greens.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And it fills your mind and
body with a wave of relaxation.

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:10.080 align:middle line:90%


00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:13.755 align:middle line:84%
You may be becoming more relaxed
with each and every breath

00:12:13.755 --> 00:12:22.140 align:middle line:84%
you take, feeling more calm,
more peaceful, and more

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:23.655 align:middle line:90%
relaxed than ever before.

00:12:23.655 --> 00:12:27.290 align:middle line:90%


00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:31.160 align:middle line:84%
Your mind may be
drifting in and out,

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:35.900 align:middle line:84%
just letting go deeper
and deeper still.

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:40.760 align:middle line:84%
You may feel as though your
mind is flowing gently,

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.790 align:middle line:84%
flowing gently like the
lake in your imagination.

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:47.410 align:middle line:90%


00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:50.740 align:middle line:84%
You look into the distance and
you can see a wooden bridge

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.010 align:middle line:90%
leading over the lake.

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:54.700 align:middle line:90%


00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.520 align:middle line:84%
You walk towards the bridge
feeling more and more

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.540 align:middle line:90%
deeply relaxed.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:01.070 align:middle line:90%


00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:02.900 align:middle line:84%
As you reach the
bridge, you can see

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:06.410 align:middle line:84%
there are 10 steps leading over
to the other side of the lake.

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:10.500 align:middle line:90%


00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:14.250 align:middle line:84%
You slowly start
walking over the bridge,

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:23.970 align:middle line:84%
counting the steps in your mind
10, nine, deeper and deeper

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:35.250 align:middle line:84%
still, eight, seven, all the
way down to relaxation now,

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:43.120 align:middle line:84%
six, five, and four
drifting off peacefully

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:52.810 align:middle line:84%
and easily, three, two, all
the way down deeply relaxed,

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:55.220 align:middle line:90%
and one.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:59.640 align:middle line:84%
You see a comfortable padded
chair, and you take a seat.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:03.435 align:middle line:84%
Ready to embrace the changes
to come in your deep state

00:14:03.435 --> 00:14:04.235 align:middle line:90%
of relaxation now.

00:14:04.235 --> 00:14:10.750 align:middle line:90%


00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And now, that you're feeling
so comfortable and so relaxed,

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:19.960 align:middle line:84%
your mind is open and receptive
to suggestions that I give you.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.480 align:middle line:90%


00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And as you listen carefully
to the sound of my voice,

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:29.820 align:middle line:84%
allowing the words to sink deep
down into your subconscious

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:38.040 align:middle line:84%
mind, you can begin to feel even
more comfortable and relaxed.

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And you're listening
to me today,

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:43.140 align:middle line:84%
because you've decided
that now is the time

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:47.970 align:middle line:84%
to control the amount of
added sugar that you consume.

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.610 align:middle line:84%
We're not focusing on
cutting it out completely,

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:52.770 align:middle line:90%
as we're going to be realistic.

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:55.740 align:middle line:84%
We're going to reach
an achievable goal.

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.920 align:middle line:84%
But you know the time has come
to limit the amount of added

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.930 align:middle line:84%
sugar you eat, and you're
ready to make this change once

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:02.730 align:middle line:90%
and for all.

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:05.760 align:middle line:90%


00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.890 align:middle line:84%
You're ready to
make the change now

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:11.115 align:middle line:84%
and to take action to beat those
old cravings for added sugar.

00:15:11.115 --> 00:15:14.850 align:middle line:90%


00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you
already know that sugar

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.230 align:middle line:90%
is bad for your health.

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:26.700 align:middle line:84%
You know that it's linked to
weight gain and to obesity.

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:29.460 align:middle line:84%
It's responsible for
causing dental decay,

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:33.090 align:middle line:84%
and it can overload the
liver in much the same way

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:34.320 align:middle line:90%
the alcohol does.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:37.580 align:middle line:90%


00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.760 align:middle line:84%
Foods high in added
sugar can quickly

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.460 align:middle line:84%
spike your blood sugar
and insulin levels

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:47.170 align:middle line:90%
leading to increased energy.

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:49.625 align:middle line:84%
However, this rise in
energy levels is fleeting.

00:15:49.625 --> 00:15:52.710 align:middle line:90%


00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:54.690 align:middle line:84%
Products that are
loaded with sugar

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:58.320 align:middle line:84%
but lacking in
protein, fiber, or fat,

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.930 align:middle line:84%
lead to a brief
energy boost that's

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:05.190 align:middle line:84%
quickly followed by a sharp drop
in blood sugar, which is when

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:07.020 align:middle line:90%
we feel that crash in energy.

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:10.850 align:middle line:90%


00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:13.700 align:middle line:84%
So having these constant
blood sugar swings

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:18.200 align:middle line:84%
can lead to major fluctuations
in energy levels, which you may

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.625 align:middle line:90%
have found difficult to manage.

00:16:19.625 --> 00:16:25.440 align:middle line:90%


00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:28.830 align:middle line:84%
You know that sugar is a highly
addictive substance which

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:33.000 align:middle line:84%
is hard to avoid, since it's
found in so many processed

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.720 align:middle line:90%
foods.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:39.790 align:middle line:84%
So from now on, when
realistically possible,

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:41.800 align:middle line:84%
you choose to cook
everything you

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.700 align:middle line:84%
eat from scratch
using whole foods,

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:50.140 align:middle line:84%
fresh leafy green
vegetables, and fresh fruit.

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And you much prefer the
taste of fresh foods,

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:56.380 align:middle line:84%
and you crave the feeling
of goodness and feeling

00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:00.350 align:middle line:84%
healthy after you've eaten such
wholesome, clean, nutritious

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:01.150 align:middle line:90%
food.

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:05.920 align:middle line:90%


00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:09.819 align:middle line:84%
From this moment on, your
mind and body no longer

00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:11.049 align:middle line:90%
crave added sugar.

00:17:11.049 --> 00:17:16.780 align:middle line:90%


00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.390 align:middle line:84%
You know the health
risks, and you no longer

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:22.720 align:middle line:90%
want to be part of that.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.520 align:middle line:84%
You're ready to change
and to take control.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.920 align:middle line:90%


00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:31.920 align:middle line:84%
You realize that you can
get all the natural sugars

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:35.220 align:middle line:84%
that your body requires
through eating fresh fruit

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:40.260 align:middle line:84%
and vegetables, and you don't
need any excess to that.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.830 align:middle line:84%
You know that added sugar
is like a form of toxin

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:47.670 align:middle line:84%
in your body, and you prefer
to eat much more healthy,

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:50.420 align:middle line:84%
protecting your body and
boosting your immune system.

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:54.720 align:middle line:90%


00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.750 align:middle line:84%
Instead of eating sugar,
you have many substitutes

00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:01.130 align:middle line:90%
for your cravings now.

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:03.500 align:middle line:84%
If you feel like something
sweet, then perhaps

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:09.010 align:middle line:84%
you reach for some fresh fruit,
perhaps some strawberries,

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:13.600 align:middle line:84%
cherries, fresh blueberries,
or juicy grapes,

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.910 align:middle line:84%
immediately giving your
body what it wants,

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:17.160 align:middle line:90%
but in a healthy way.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.140 align:middle line:90%


00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.120 align:middle line:84%
Or if you don't feel
like eating fruit,

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:25.300 align:middle line:84%
you reach for some nuts
or eggs, cheese or hummus,

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:27.220 align:middle line:84%
or something that's high
in protein or fiber.

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:31.740 align:middle line:90%


00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.220 align:middle line:84%
After a while, you realize
that you no longer crave sugar

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:38.260 align:middle line:90%
in the way you used to.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.810 align:middle line:84%
You no longer crave
chocolates or biscuits.

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:43.830 align:middle line:90%


00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:47.490 align:middle line:84%
You lose your taste and your
desire for all sweet foods

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:48.300 align:middle line:90%
and sweet drinks.

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:52.550 align:middle line:90%


00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:55.280 align:middle line:84%
You remember that
artificially sweetened foods

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.970 align:middle line:84%
and sweet drinks are like
toxins to your system.

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:00.800 align:middle line:90%
You don't need them.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.350 align:middle line:84%
You don't want them, and you
certainly don't have them.

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:07.200 align:middle line:90%


00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.980 align:middle line:84%
That sugar converts
into fat in your body,

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:14.490 align:middle line:84%
forming eventual
hardening of the arteries,

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:18.090 align:middle line:84%
rotting your teeth, your
skin, and overloading

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:19.740 align:middle line:90%
your liver and so much more.

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:23.630 align:middle line:90%


00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:27.200 align:middle line:84%
Your mind and body reject
all sweet foods now,

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.390 align:middle line:90%
all sweet drinks.

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And from now on, you enjoy
the fresh, natural food

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.490 align:middle line:90%
and drink that you consume.

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:40.340 align:middle line:90%


00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:45.260 align:middle line:84%
You make sure you find the time
to cook, to shop consciously,

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:48.620 align:middle line:84%
and you buy the right foods
to create good healthy meals.

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:51.700 align:middle line:90%


00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.640 align:middle line:84%
This becomes more and more
of a priority for you.

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And your love experimenting
with recipes and meals

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:01.150 align:middle line:84%
grows more and more
each and every day.

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:05.360 align:middle line:90%


00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:10.010 align:middle line:84%
The cleaner your body becomes,
the more you notice and dislike

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:11.450 align:middle line:90%
the taste of added sugar.

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:14.290 align:middle line:90%


00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:18.940 align:middle line:84%
You visualize that sugar
entering your body like toxin,

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:22.900 align:middle line:84%
causing damage to your
liver your skin, your teeth,

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:24.300 align:middle line:90%
and other parts of your body.

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.870 align:middle line:90%


00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And if by accident or
on a special occasion,

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.320 align:middle line:84%
you do just have a little
bit of extra sugar,

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:36.200 align:middle line:84%
you find it tastes so much
sweeter than you remembered,

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:41.030 align:middle line:84%
too sweet for you, a
synthetic taste reminding you

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:45.620 align:middle line:84%
of plastic, stickier, sicklier
than it ever tasted before.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:48.830 align:middle line:90%


00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:51.530 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to
visualize yourself now,

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:55.220 align:middle line:84%
at an occasion at home or
perhaps out with friends, when

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:58.580 align:middle line:84%
you would normally have enjoyed
some of that added sugar,

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:02.480 align:middle line:84%
perhaps in a take away or
a friend's birthday cake.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.270 align:middle line:90%
And see yourself now.

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:09.530 align:middle line:84%
Notice what you can see, what
you can hear, and what you can

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:12.290 align:middle line:90%
smell.

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And see yourself
refusing the sugar.

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And instead, suggesting
an alternative,

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:22.250 align:middle line:84%
if not for everyone, then
perhaps for yourself.

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:26.000 align:middle line:84%
You feel healthy, clean,
natural, and fresh

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.975 align:middle line:84%
knowing that you're eating
such nutritious foods, fueling

00:21:28.975 --> 00:21:29.975 align:middle line:90%
your body with goodness.

00:21:29.975 --> 00:21:33.140 align:middle line:90%


00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling
really good now,

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:37.340 align:middle line:84%
because you know that
sweet foods and drinks are

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:40.130 align:middle line:90%
a thing of the past.

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:42.630 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you choose
to say no to sugar.

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:45.620 align:middle line:84%
You don't want it,
you don't need it,

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:49.220 align:middle line:84%
and you definitely
don't have it.

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Sweets and sugary
foods no longer

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:55.670 align:middle line:90%
serve any purpose in your life.

00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:57.620 align:middle line:84%
You've had enough of
giving in to cravings,

00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:59.885 align:middle line:84%
and you're ready and
equipped to make that change.

00:21:59.885 --> 00:22:02.840 align:middle line:90%


00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:07.960 align:middle line:84%
You look forward to getting
the body you've always desired,

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:13.390 align:middle line:84%
to an even temperament, and
to a much better health.

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:18.710 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you say no to all
sweet foods and sweet drinks.

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:22.500 align:middle line:90%
You say no, and you mean no.

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And you're excited to
begin to enjoy life so

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:28.725 align:middle line:84%
much more, because you know
that you are now in control.

00:22:28.725 --> 00:22:31.660 align:middle line:90%


00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:34.230 align:middle line:84%
You have much more
natural energy.

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And you're now in control
of your mind, your body,

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:37.420 align:middle line:90%
and your health.

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:41.310 align:middle line:90%


00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:43.080 align:middle line:84%
These hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:46.140 align:middle line:84%
embedded in your
subconscious mind.

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And they'll become
more and more powerful

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:52.290 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count up from one to five

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:57.130 align:middle line:90%
to awaken you.

00:22:57.130 --> 00:23:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of five, you'll
be wide awake, fully refreshed,

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:03.900 align:middle line:84%
alert, and feeling fantastic,
bringing back with you all

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:06.240 align:middle line:90%
the wonderful, new feelings.

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:12.720 align:middle line:84%
So coming back now with one,
two, three, four, and five.

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.650 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open, when you're ready.

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:18.000 align:middle line:90%
