[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to
House of Wellbeing.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.810 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to the
Overcoming Laziness mind talk

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.390 align:middle line:90%
audio.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.530 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.080 align:middle line:84%
But before it
does, I'd just like

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.140 align:middle line:84%
to remind you that the
following audio contains

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.840 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.900 align:middle line:84%
aim to help you reach
deep level of relaxation.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.870 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.230 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place,

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.670 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions, where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.690 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.880 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:50.680 align:middle line:90%
will alert you.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And you'll easily
come out of hypnosis.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.640 align:middle line:84%
But right now, there's
nothing at all.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.130 align:middle line:84%
You need to do apart
from close your eyes,

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.880 align:middle line:84%
relax, lie back, and
let go, and enjoy

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.850 align:middle line:84%
all those peaceful feelings
and all the benefits that

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.570 align:middle line:90%
come with it.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Make yourself as
comfortable as possible

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.840 align:middle line:84%
and concentrate on
the sound of my voice.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.490 align:middle line:90%


00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And begin by drawing in
a long, slow, deep breath

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.810 align:middle line:90%
in through your nose.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.850 align:middle line:90%
Hold the breath for a moment.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And now slightly open your
mouth and release all the air

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.800 align:middle line:84%
from your body, in a
long, low, deep sigh,

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:43.020 align:middle line:84%
and relax, allowing your
lungs to naturally deflate

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.370 align:middle line:84%
as your body sinks into
gentle relaxation now.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.260 align:middle line:90%


00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.430 align:middle line:90%
And you can release any tension.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Relax and let go as I
guide you through a journey

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:07.430 align:middle line:84%
of relaxation, a journey that
you will find very beneficial

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.990 align:middle line:90%
for your overall well-being.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.420 align:middle line:90%


00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.300 align:middle line:84%
You're going to start
this calming experience

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.490 align:middle line:84%
by first relaxing your
whole body-mind system.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.290 align:middle line:90%


00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's true to say that the
simple act of relaxing the body

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.960 align:middle line:84%
and mind has a positive knock
on effect, because how you think

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.220 align:middle line:90%
determines how you feel.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And how you feel influences
the world around you.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And how you choose
to think today

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.580 align:middle line:84%
affects your decisions
from here on in.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.140 align:middle line:84%
So to make my assurance
as your reality,

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.240 align:middle line:84%
let's begin by
focusing your attention

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.580 align:middle line:90%
at the very top of your head.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.470 align:middle line:84%
Tension often starts at
the scalp and the neck.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.670 align:middle line:84%
So mentally and physically
allow all the muscles

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.290 align:middle line:84%
around the top of your
head to relax now.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.400 align:middle line:90%


00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Letting all the
tension simply dissolve

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.970 align:middle line:84%
as you start to tune in
to your body-mind system.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.500 align:middle line:90%


00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Just let any tension you may
be holding to release now.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.730 align:middle line:84%
Allow your brain to relax,
the left and the right lobes

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.400 align:middle line:84%
of the brain just releasing,
such a simple thought,

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.770 align:middle line:84%
yet so profound
and so significant.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:57.270 align:middle line:84%
Just letting go
completely, drifting

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.940 align:middle line:90%
further and further down.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.190 align:middle line:90%
Nobody wanting anything.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.890 align:middle line:90%
Nobody needing anything.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.580 align:middle line:90%
This is your time to relax.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.340 align:middle line:90%


00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.480 align:middle line:84%
Taking the relaxation
into the face now.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.970 align:middle line:84%
Allowing all of your facial
muscles to feel loose.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:25.050 align:middle line:84%
Feel your brow relaxing,
your forehead smoothing out,

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:32.300 align:middle line:84%
the back of your eyes relaxing,
tiny muscles around your eyes

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.260 align:middle line:84%
and eyelids, down
into your cheeks,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.230 align:middle line:90%
and into your jaw muscles.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.170 align:middle line:90%
Just releasing and letting go.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.210 align:middle line:90%


00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.550 align:middle line:84%
Allowing your
tongue to fall away

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.460 align:middle line:90%
from the roof of your mouth.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And should you find you need
to swallow, just do that

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:00.320 align:middle line:84%
now and drift down and
down, deeper and deeper,

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.578 align:middle line:90%
into blissful relaxation.

00:05:02.578 --> 00:05:06.000 align:middle line:90%


00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.760 align:middle line:84%
The more you physically
relax, the more

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.000 align:middle line:90%
you can mentally relax.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And when you can
mentally relax, you

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.080 align:middle line:90%
can think much more clearly.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And when you think more clearly,
your life becomes clearer.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.280 align:middle line:90%
You make better decisions.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And you're much more in
control of your days.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.400 align:middle line:90%


00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.270 align:middle line:84%
So noticing now how
your neck feels.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.050 align:middle line:90%
Relaxing all the little muscles.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.050 align:middle line:90%
Letting go of the strain.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.185 align:middle line:90%
Letting go of the tension.

00:05:43.185 --> 00:05:46.300 align:middle line:90%


00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.070 align:middle line:84%
Allow that tension that you
may be holding in your shoulder

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.250 align:middle line:90%
to go now.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Feel those shoulders
both of them sinking

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.830 align:middle line:90%
into the frame of your body.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.225 align:middle line:84%
Feel your neck length
then as you do this.

00:06:02.225 --> 00:06:05.550 align:middle line:90%


00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Feel or imagine all your
cares and worries just

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:15.610 align:middle line:84%
rolling off your shoulders now
as you take the relaxation down

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:21.860 align:middle line:84%
now into the tops of your
arms, letting any tension you

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.100 align:middle line:90%
may be holding just drain away.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.780 align:middle line:90%


00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And as your awareness flows
down through upper arms,

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:37.660 align:middle line:84%
into your elbows, all the
muscles in your forearms

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:45.780 align:middle line:84%
relax, right down to your
wrists, and into your hands,

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.515 align:middle line:84%
and way down into the very tips
of your fingers and thumbs.

00:06:49.515 --> 00:06:53.510 align:middle line:90%


00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.170 align:middle line:90%
Your arms are feeling so heavy.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:58.910 align:middle line:90%
Your body's so comfortable.

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.100 align:middle line:90%


00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.960 align:middle line:84%
Nothing whatsoever
to do, but just relax

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.920 align:middle line:84%
and enjoy this feeling
of total release now.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:16.350 align:middle line:90%


00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:21.100 align:middle line:84%
As you let go of all the
tension in those muscles,

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:27.370 align:middle line:84%
you may experience them becoming
calmer, and gently releasing.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.052 align:middle line:90%


00:07:30.052 --> 00:07:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And just tune into the
feeling of simply letting go.

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:37.880 align:middle line:90%


00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.410 align:middle line:84%
As you become aware
of your breathing,

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:48.930 align:middle line:84%
notice that you are now
breathing steadily, and slowly,

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:51.550 align:middle line:90%
rhythmically.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And with each exhale, you
feel yourself just relaxing,

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:59.260 align:middle line:90%
even more deeply.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.665 align:middle line:84%
Allowing any tension
in the chest area

00:08:01.665 --> 00:08:06.010 align:middle line:84%
now to simply
drain away, letting

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:08.785 align:middle line:90%
go completely and totally.

00:08:08.785 --> 00:08:11.840 align:middle line:90%


00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:15.260 align:middle line:84%
Bring awareness into
your stomach now.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And let go your
stomach muscles relax.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And as you do, I
want you to imagine

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:26.630 align:middle line:84%
a ball of sunlight passing
down, from the top of your head

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:31.145 align:middle line:84%
down through your face, your
throat, and into your stomach.

00:08:31.145 --> 00:08:35.330 align:middle line:90%


00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.450 align:middle line:84%
Visualize this healing
energy passing down

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:43.430 align:middle line:84%
through your throat, and
chest, and into your stomach.

00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:47.330 align:middle line:90%


00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:54.750 align:middle line:84%
So see and feel the sunlight
swirling and rotating.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:09:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And as the light glows, it
warms, and soothes, and heals.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And you release, and relax, and
drift down and further down.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:12.320 align:middle line:90%


00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And in your imagination,
you send the sunlight out

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.810 align:middle line:84%
now to every nerve cell,
bone, muscle, fiber,

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:25.340 align:middle line:90%
and system of the body.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:28.200 align:middle line:84%
See it flowing through
the bloodstream,

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.840 align:middle line:90%
and leave the light there.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:37.350 align:middle line:84%
It knows what to do as
you take the relaxation

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:41.100 align:middle line:90%
round into your back muscles.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And from your back
muscles, it relaxes

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:48.450 align:middle line:84%
those muscles, either
side of the spine,

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:53.240 align:middle line:84%
releasing, relaxing,
and just letting

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:57.410 align:middle line:90%
go now, deeper and deeper now.

00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:02.570 align:middle line:90%


00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:05.750 align:middle line:84%
As you relax your waist, and
the muscles of your lowest

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:11.460 align:middle line:84%
thigh, and down into
the pelvic area, all

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:15.390 align:middle line:84%
the way down through
the large thigh muscles,

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:22.720 align:middle line:84%
down through your knees,
your shins, and your calves,

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:28.982 align:middle line:84%
just allow all those areas of
the body to relax, and let go.

00:10:28.982 --> 00:10:34.220 align:middle line:90%


00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:39.367 align:middle line:84%
You're so relaxed, so
heavy, so comfortable.

00:10:39.367 --> 00:10:42.350 align:middle line:90%


00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And now tune into that
comfortable feeling

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:53.540 align:middle line:84%
as you think on down to your
ankles, and to your feet,

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.090 align:middle line:84%
right down to the very
tips of your toes.

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:59.030 align:middle line:90%


00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:04.260 align:middle line:84%
All the muscles of your body
now so beautifully relaxed.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And you feel very heavy
and very comfortable.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling centered, and
relaxed, and fully in control.

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:21.970 align:middle line:90%


00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:24.040 align:middle line:84%
If there are any
areas of your body

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:27.100 align:middle line:84%
that still feel
tight or tense, you

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:30.520 align:middle line:84%
find that you can relax them
simply by giving yourself

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:31.810 align:middle line:90%
permission to do so.

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:35.940 align:middle line:90%


00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And you can now go even
deeper as I count down

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.325 align:middle line:90%
from eight to zero.

00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:43.060 align:middle line:90%


00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And with every number you
feel yourself drifting further

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.340 align:middle line:90%
into blissful relaxation.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:51.630 align:middle line:90%


00:11:51.630 --> 00:12:16.820 align:middle line:84%
So 8, 7, 6, 5, deeper now, 4,
3, 2, 1, and 0, deeply relaxed.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:21.590 align:middle line:84%
Letting go of all the cares
and worries, all the tension,

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:26.054 align:middle line:84%
and pressure, and
stresses, and strains.

00:12:26.054 --> 00:12:32.090 align:middle line:84%
Let them all ease from your
body and ease from your mind.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And allow yourself to drift down
into a deeper, more blissful

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:39.890 align:middle line:90%
state of creative relaxation.

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:45.670 align:middle line:90%


00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:47.740 align:middle line:84%
Now in your
imagination, I'd like

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:52.000 align:middle line:84%
you to imagine that you're
standing on the top of a hill,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.090 align:middle line:90%
on a beautiful island.

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's a lovely
warm summer's day.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:04.280 align:middle line:84%
There's a clear blue sky,
not a cloud in sight.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And the temperature is
just how you like it.

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:09.990 align:middle line:90%


00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:13.590 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the gentle
warmth of the sun on your head

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:15.920 align:middle line:90%
and shoulders.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And you can hear
the sounds of nature

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:21.486 align:middle line:84%
all around you, making
you feel even more relax.

00:13:21.486 --> 00:13:26.950 align:middle line:90%


00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:31.780 align:middle line:84%
The long grass in the
meadow below sways slightly.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And you can see a
winding path that

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.450 align:middle line:84%
disappears into a
small apple orchard,

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:39.341 align:middle line:90%
just at the bottom of the hill.

00:13:39.341 --> 00:13:42.430 align:middle line:90%


00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And just beyond the orchard,
you can see the sea.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:51.030 align:middle line:84%
The sunlight darting off
the tops of the waves.

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:54.020 align:middle line:84%
The whole ocean
shimmering and sparkling.

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:58.250 align:middle line:90%


00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:03.360 align:middle line:84%
You begin to move easily
down the path now,

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:07.880 align:middle line:84%
noticing the grass
springing under your feet,

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:11.180 align:middle line:84%
pushing you encouragingly
towards your destination.

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:14.840 align:middle line:90%


00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And you catch the faint smell
of sea air in the breeze

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:22.010 align:middle line:84%
as you get closer
to the ocean now.

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:27.280 align:middle line:84%
As you stroll down,
down the winding path,

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:31.420 align:middle line:84%
and you move
smoothly and easily.

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And you feel relaxed, and
centered, and fully in control.

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:40.800 align:middle line:90%


00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And you're becoming aware now,
the growing calm within you.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:48.180 align:middle line:90%


00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.360 align:middle line:84%
You stop to look at the
beautiful flowers growing

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:54.196 align:middle line:90%
each side of the path.

00:14:54.196 --> 00:14:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Their colors so
vivid and bright.

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And you stand there for a
moment taking in the view.

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:07.400 align:middle line:84%
A feeling of happiness flows
through you, continuing down.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:13.150 align:middle line:90%


00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:20.570 align:middle line:84%
You're aware now of a deep sense
of calmness and tranquility,

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:24.800 align:middle line:84%
right from the top of your
head to the tips of your toes,

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.588 align:middle line:84%
when you and your energy
feeling wonderful.

00:15:27.588 --> 00:15:30.800 align:middle line:90%


00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:34.160 align:middle line:84%
As you walk, you find yourself
almost floating as though

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.690 align:middle line:84%
in a dreamland, down
towards the orchard.

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:40.510 align:middle line:90%


00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:45.440 align:middle line:84%
You move with such ease,
with no effort whatsoever.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And in no time,
you find yourself

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.030 align:middle line:84%
drifting through
the fruit trees,

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:54.020 align:middle line:84%
with a lush, cool,
green foliage,

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:57.520 align:middle line:90%
forming a canopy overhead.

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And you see the
sunlight glittering

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:00.505 align:middle line:90%
through the branches.

00:16:00.505 --> 00:16:05.050 align:middle line:90%


00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And as you stand there, you
feel a glittering sunlight

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:12.020 align:middle line:90%
on your face and neck.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And you feel and
experience it vibrating

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:17.475 align:middle line:84%
throughout your entire
body-mind system.

00:16:17.475 --> 00:16:22.670 align:middle line:90%


00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And as the sunlight moves, it
glows, and warms, and soothes,

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:31.790 align:middle line:90%
and heals your body and mind.

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And you release, and relax,
and move down and down,

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:43.000 align:middle line:84%
taking in another deep breath,
relaxing even more now.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.800 align:middle line:90%


00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.440 align:middle line:84%
You can hear the
sound of the ocean

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:52.000 align:middle line:90%
as you move nearer and nearer.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And with every
step you take, you

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:58.630 align:middle line:84%
feel more relax and
more calm as you

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:02.600 align:middle line:84%
follow that winding path
that leads you downwards.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:06.000 align:middle line:90%


00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.589 align:middle line:90%
You turn a corner.

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And to your delight,
you find yourself

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:12.360 align:middle line:90%
on a beautiful deserted beach.

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:15.670 align:middle line:90%


00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:19.660 align:middle line:84%
The beach sweeping away into
a small bay in front of.

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And the ocean is a striking
turquoise blue, pure and clear.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And you can feel the warm
sand underneath your shoes.

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And you take your
shoes off, and you

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:39.780 align:middle line:84%
start walking lazily across
the beach to the water's edge.

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:42.590 align:middle line:90%


00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:45.910 align:middle line:84%
You feel the sand
beneath your feet.

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And you feel the sand
change, from cool

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:53.410 align:middle line:84%
to moist beneath your feet as
you wander along the shoreline.

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:59.210 align:middle line:90%


00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:01.520 align:middle line:84%
As you turn around,
you start to walk up

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:06.010 align:middle line:84%
the beach towards
a grassy mound.

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And as you walk up slowly, you
take in the smell of the ocean.

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And you hear the
sounds of the water,

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.450 align:middle line:90%
hissing over the warm sand.

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:20.970 align:middle line:90%


00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:24.430 align:middle line:84%
You reach the mound
now, and you sit down,

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:26.257 align:middle line:90%
making yourself comfortable.

00:18:26.257 --> 00:18:29.920 align:middle line:90%


00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And as you gaze out across
the breathtaking scene,

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:38.570 align:middle line:84%
you watch the waves roll
in and roll out again,

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:42.798 align:middle line:90%
rhythmically in and out again.

00:18:42.798 --> 00:18:47.790 align:middle line:90%


00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:51.050 align:middle line:84%
You play with the sand
through your fingers,

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:54.410 align:middle line:90%
noticing just how good you feel.

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:57.760 align:middle line:90%
So relax now.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:02.050 align:middle line:84%
So relax that you've opened
up your subconscious mind.

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And you're ready to start
making those changes you've

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:07.546 align:middle line:84%
been wanting to make
once and for all.

00:19:07.546 --> 00:19:13.870 align:middle line:90%


00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:16.600 align:middle line:84%
You're listening
to this mind talk

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:21.220 align:middle line:84%
to overcome your
feelings of laziness.

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:27.220 align:middle line:84%
You're tired of being idle,
of doing nothing, resisting

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:32.365 align:middle line:84%
effort, procrastinating,
and postponing things.

00:19:32.365 --> 00:19:35.010 align:middle line:90%


00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:38.220 align:middle line:84%
You no longer want to live
in a state of passivity

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:42.190 align:middle line:84%
and letting things
stay as they are.

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:45.190 align:middle line:84%
We all feel lazy at
times in our lives.

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And we may feel lethargic
whilst on holiday.

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:52.280 align:middle line:90%
And that's perfectly fine.

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:55.820 align:middle line:84%
But being lazy and idle
has its place in life

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:59.210 align:middle line:84%
because it helps
us to reenergize.

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:03.470 align:middle line:84%
But if being lazy has become
a way of life for you,

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:08.260 align:middle line:84%
it may be something that
needs to be readdressed.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:10.270 align:middle line:84%
If feeling lazy
makes you feel as

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:12.340 align:middle line:84%
if your life is
wasting away, then it's

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:15.960 align:middle line:90%
time to reverse that trend.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:20.130 align:middle line:84%
When you can learn to develop a
new pattern of choosing action

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:23.760 align:middle line:84%
over stagnant behavior, you'll
become much more motivated

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.560 align:middle line:90%
every day.

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:28.360 align:middle line:90%


00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And you may be feeling that
the tendency to be lazy

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:34.510 align:middle line:84%
has started to take
over your life,

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:36.535 align:middle line:84%
and that you're stuck
in a rut of lethargy.

00:20:36.535 --> 00:20:39.540 align:middle line:90%


00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And this lethargy will then
impact your level of motivation

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:47.630 align:middle line:84%
and your ability
to get things done.

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:50.790 align:middle line:84%
But you're now ready
to change that.

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:56.670 align:middle line:84%
You are ready to wake up
feeling inspired and motivated.

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:59.850 align:middle line:84%
You're sick and tired of
feeling lazy and unmotivated,

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:01.395 align:middle line:90%
and it's time now to change.

00:21:01.395 --> 00:21:04.860 align:middle line:90%


00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:08.190 align:middle line:84%
Your level of motivation
affects everything

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:11.050 align:middle line:90%
you do on a daily basis.

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's easy to
reverse this trend.

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:16.150 align:middle line:90%


00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:21.440 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you feel lazy
for no particular reason.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.990 align:middle line:84%
We may also feel complacent,
or bored, frustrated

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:25.790 align:middle line:90%
with our life.

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:29.320 align:middle line:90%


00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:33.320 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you may need
to just stop and reflect

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:36.590 align:middle line:84%
upon everything we've
already accomplished

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:38.660 align:middle line:84%
to appreciate how
far we've come.

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:42.140 align:middle line:90%


00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:45.460 align:middle line:84%
So take a moment now to think
about all of those things

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:48.540 align:middle line:90%
you've already accomplished.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.250 align:middle line:84%
Think about those
goals that you've

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:53.230 align:middle line:84%
accomplished because you are
committed to your own success.

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:56.230 align:middle line:90%


00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:59.110 align:middle line:84%
All of those achievements
required a great deal

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:02.200 align:middle line:84%
of motivation, so
you already know you

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.580 align:middle line:90%
can accomplish great things.

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:07.560 align:middle line:90%


00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.530 align:middle line:84%
You know as a result that
you can easily overcome

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:13.930 align:middle line:90%
this tendency for laziness.

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:16.000 align:middle line:84%
You know that
everything that you've

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.760 align:middle line:84%
done in your life required a
certain amount of motivation.

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.250 align:middle line:84%
You're taking on a
new personality trait

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:28.330 align:middle line:84%
today, one that helps
you improve your life

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:29.420 align:middle line:90%
and gets things done.

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:32.580 align:middle line:90%


00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:36.500 align:middle line:84%
You're overcoming that tendency
to be lazy once and for all.

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.080 align:middle line:90%


00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.030 align:middle line:84%
You think about the
benefits that you'll

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:43.190 align:middle line:84%
gain if you overcome
your laziness

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:47.390 align:middle line:84%
and take action, instead of
thinking about the difficulties

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:48.410 align:middle line:90%
or obstacles.

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:51.370 align:middle line:90%


00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:54.430 align:middle line:84%
Focusing on the difficulties
of carrying out the task

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:58.330 align:middle line:84%
will only lead to more
discouragement, avoidance

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:03.490 align:middle line:84%
of taking action, and to
more laziness in turn.

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's much more important
that you focus your mind,

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:10.590 align:middle line:84%
your attention on the benefits,
not on the difficulties.

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:13.310 align:middle line:90%


00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:15.470 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you
also think about what

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:17.720 align:middle line:84%
will happen if you
succumb to the laziness

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:21.080 align:middle line:90%
and don't perform your task.

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:24.080 align:middle line:84%
Thinking about the
consequences of not acting

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.940 align:middle line:84%
can also push you
to take action.

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:30.260 align:middle line:90%


00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:36.080 align:middle line:84%
Maybe from now on, you focus
on doing one thing at a time.

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.375 align:middle line:84%
If you feel you
have a lot to do,

00:23:38.375 --> 00:23:44.060 align:middle line:84%
you probably feel overwhelmed
and that laziness overcome you,

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:45.830 align:middle line:90%
instead of overcoming laziness.

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:50.260 align:middle line:90%


00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:55.470 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you get things
done in a timely manner.

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:58.800 align:middle line:84%
You wake up motivated
and inspired.

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And you enjoy completing tasks
as a part of who you are now.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:08.230 align:middle line:90%
you are motivated and energized.

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:11.350 align:middle line:84%
You're more than ready to
make those positive changes

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:13.450 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And you've now outgrown this
part of your personality.

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:20.710 align:middle line:90%
It no longer serves its purpose.

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:24.020 align:middle line:84%
It's time for this part to be
free of its role of serving

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:24.820 align:middle line:90%
you.

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:26.010 align:middle line:90%
And you're more than ready.

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:29.700 align:middle line:90%


00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:32.520 align:middle line:84%
That lazy part of you
is a negative occurrence

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:35.450 align:middle line:84%
that can happen to you
without you even realizing it.

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:38.770 align:middle line:90%


00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:42.400 align:middle line:84%
That part of you has caused you
to hinder your own progression

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.610 align:middle line:84%
at times in the course
of attaining your goals.

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:49.490 align:middle line:90%


00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:53.530 align:middle line:84%
As this lazy part of your
personality dissolves,

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:55.300 align:middle line:84%
you feel as though
a weight has been

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:59.390 align:middle line:90%
lifted from your shoulders.

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And you suddenly feel
like laziness is now

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:05.500 align:middle line:84%
a thing of the past,
because you've replaced it

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:07.630 align:middle line:90%
with confidence and motivation.

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:11.050 align:middle line:90%


00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:13.480 align:middle line:84%
With this new confidence
and motivation

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:16.410 align:middle line:84%
comes an amazing sense
of accomplishment.

00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:21.230 align:middle line:90%


00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:24.800 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you wake up
feeling highly motivated in all

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.770 align:middle line:90%
that you do.

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:30.980 align:middle line:84%
You now trust in your
abilities, knowing

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:36.050 align:middle line:84%
that you can do anything
you set your mind to.

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:40.020 align:middle line:84%
You feel a new
sense of optimism.

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And from now on, you realize
that you deserve the best

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.750 align:middle line:84%
that life has to
offer, because you now

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:47.910 align:middle line:84%
use your gifts and
your talents to make

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:49.610 align:middle line:90%
a positive impact on the world.

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:53.850 align:middle line:90%


00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:57.600 align:middle line:84%
You think about that old
lazy part of your self

00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:01.740 align:middle line:84%
and how it held you
back over the years.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:03.540 align:middle line:84%
But that part of
your personality

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:05.490 align:middle line:90%
has served its purpose.

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:06.630 align:middle line:90%
And it's done its job.

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:09.355 align:middle line:84%
It shows you that you are the
one in control of your life.

00:26:09.355 --> 00:26:12.340 align:middle line:90%


00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:14.350 align:middle line:84%
From now on, when
you see something

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:19.210 align:middle line:84%
that needs to be done, you
jump right in, and you do it.

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:20.470 align:middle line:90%
You act immediately.

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:23.200 align:middle line:84%
You pride yourself
on promptness.

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.290 align:middle line:84%
You accomplish
things step by step.

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:29.140 align:middle line:90%
You always complete your work.

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And you break large
tasks into small tasks

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:35.500 align:middle line:90%
that are easily accomplished.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.300 align:middle line:90%
You get things done.

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:41.260 align:middle line:90%
You are relaxed and confident.

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:43.970 align:middle line:90%
You persevere.

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:44.840 align:middle line:90%
You overcome.

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:49.160 align:middle line:90%


00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.280 align:middle line:84%
If you find you're
tempted to be lazy,

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:57.680 align:middle line:84%
you push through that feeling
and start in the task anyway.

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.200 align:middle line:84%
You tell yourself that
you do a small part.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And once you do that
part, you do another.

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:06.370 align:middle line:90%
You enjoy getting things done.

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:08.010 align:middle line:90%
It's a part of who you are now.

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:11.110 align:middle line:90%


00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:14.120 align:middle line:84%
You enjoy taking charge and
jumping in and doing things

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:14.920 align:middle line:90%
right away.

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.430 align:middle line:90%


00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps, you do the
challenging tasks first

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:21.150 align:middle line:90%
to get them out of the way.

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:24.760 align:middle line:90%


00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.770 align:middle line:84%
You know that putting things
off holds you back in life,

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:31.450 align:middle line:84%
and you're no longer
going to put up with that.

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:34.630 align:middle line:84%
You're someone now who jumps
right in there and starts tasks

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:35.950 align:middle line:90%
when they need to be started.

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:39.660 align:middle line:90%


00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:43.800 align:middle line:84%
From this moment forward, you
are self-competent person,

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.315 align:middle line:84%
who effortlessly
accomplishes your goals.

00:27:46.315 --> 00:27:49.590 align:middle line:90%


00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:54.860 align:middle line:84%
You allow only positive thoughts
to run through your mind.

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:58.160 align:middle line:84%
You take on any task
with confidence now.

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And you have a strong
sense of completion.

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:06.600 align:middle line:84%
You feel enthusiasm and
confidence in all that you do.

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.120 align:middle line:90%


00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:12.360 align:middle line:84%
You feel a sense of
urgency to complete

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:13.820 align:middle line:90%
all that needs to be done.

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:17.490 align:middle line:90%


00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:21.330 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you no longer
allow yourself to drift back

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:25.320 align:middle line:90%
into your lazy mode.

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.540 align:middle line:84%
You feel a sense of
satisfaction as you

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:30.510 align:middle line:84%
accomplish more and
more each and every day.

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:34.020 align:middle line:90%


00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And every day, your work gets
easier to accomplish to finish.

00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:41.820 align:middle line:84%
You know that
you'll do your best.

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And your best will
become better and better.

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:51.000 align:middle line:84%
You'll feel more organized, more
in control, and more confident.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.440 align:middle line:90%


00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.990 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you realize
your full potential,

00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:59.510 align:middle line:84%
and you're motivated
and inspired.

00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And you're excited about this
new chapter in your life.

00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:07.920 align:middle line:90%


00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:11.130 align:middle line:84%
You do things in a timely
manner from now on.

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:13.800 align:middle line:84%
You have a strong desire
to create and hold

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:16.570 align:middle line:90%
yourself accountable to plans.

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:19.900 align:middle line:84%
You focus on the end result.
And this increased focus

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:21.570 align:middle line:90%
helps you move forward in life.

00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:26.800 align:middle line:90%


00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:30.880 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you feel like
a new invigorated person,

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.575 align:middle line:84%
and something within
you has shifted.

00:29:32.575 --> 00:29:35.540 align:middle line:90%


00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:37.640 align:middle line:84%
You start to feel like
you could accomplish

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.410 align:middle line:90%
anything you set your mind to.

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:41.980 align:middle line:90%


00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.110 align:middle line:90%
You're ready to take on life.

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And you're ready to
get what you want.

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And you suddenly have
the energy and enthusiasm

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:49.810 align:middle line:90%
to make it happen.

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:52.390 align:middle line:90%


00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:55.580 align:middle line:84%
You think about all the
incredible contributions you

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:57.980 align:middle line:90%
can make with this new mindset.

00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And you're excited
about your life.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:03.770 align:middle line:84%
Everything in your
life is changing.

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Because from now on, you always
make the effort to do more

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:11.200 align:middle line:90%
and to achieve more.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:14.020 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now
to focus on a task

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:16.750 align:middle line:84%
that you'd like to achieve that
you may have previously been

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:18.590 align:middle line:90%
too lethargic to even start.

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:21.200 align:middle line:90%


00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:24.450 align:middle line:84%
As you focus in on
this task or goal,

00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:26.690 align:middle line:84%
take a moment to think
of all those things

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:30.190 align:middle line:84%
that inspire and motivate you
as it relates to this goal.

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:32.850 align:middle line:90%


00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:35.160 align:middle line:84%
Focus in on your goal
now and visualize

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:36.130 align:middle line:90%
yourself achieving it.

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:40.940 align:middle line:90%


00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:43.060 align:middle line:84%
Notice how you feel
