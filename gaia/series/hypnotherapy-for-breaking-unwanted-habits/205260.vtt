00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to House
of Well-Being.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.630 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to the Anger
Management Mind Talk audio.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.490 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And before it
does, I'd just like

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.690 align:middle line:84%
to remind you that the
following audio contains

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.390 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.628 align:middle line:84%
aim to help you reach
deep level of relaxation.

00:00:30.628 --> 00:00:32.670 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that
wherever you are listening

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.430 align:middle line:84%
to this audio, you are in a
safe and comfortable place,

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.760 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions, where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.150 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to it if
you're driving or operating

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.673 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:43.673 --> 00:00:45.840 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.640 align:middle line:90%
will alert you.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And you'll easily
come out of hypnosis.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.770 align:middle line:84%
But right now there's
nothing at all

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.560 align:middle line:84%
you need to do, apart
from close your eyes,

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.990 align:middle line:90%
relax, lie back, and let go.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And enjoy those peaceful
feelings and all the benefits

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:59.670 align:middle line:90%
that come with it.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.590 align:middle line:90%


00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.815 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to take
a long, slow breath.

00:01:08.815 --> 00:01:11.950 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.670 align:middle line:90%
And let it out nice and slowly.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And, again, when you're ready,
another long deep breath

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.360 align:middle line:84%
filling your upper
and lower lungs.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And, again, let it
out when you're ready.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.180 align:middle line:90%


00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And now you can
allow your breathing

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.960 align:middle line:84%
to return to normal,
gentle breaths

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.330 align:middle line:84%
in and out at your
body's own natural pace.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.510 align:middle line:90%


00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And already you can start to
feel your body relaxing now.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And as you reach that
beautifully relaxed state,

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.110 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to imagine
yourself standing

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.920 align:middle line:84%
on the edge of a wonderful
forest at the top of a path.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.560 align:middle line:90%


00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And this path very
gradually slopes down

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.260 align:middle line:84%
through the center of the
forest of peace and tranquility.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.840 align:middle line:90%


00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to imagine
now just what it would

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:15.070 align:middle line:84%
feel like to begin to
walk slowly down the path,

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.190 align:middle line:84%
each step allowing you to
relax more and more as you

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.665 align:middle line:84%
move peacefully into
this beautiful forest.

00:02:20.665 --> 00:02:24.890 align:middle line:90%


00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps there are leaves and
twigs crackling underfoot.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.400 align:middle line:90%


00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.340 align:middle line:90%
Maybe there's a breeze.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And if so, would it be cool
or perhaps slightly warm

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.450 align:middle line:84%
as you continue walking
safely and contentedly

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.260 align:middle line:84%
into this wonderful
woodland paradise?

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.940 align:middle line:90%


00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.090 align:middle line:84%
As you notice that your
breathing has already slowed,

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.180 align:middle line:84%
you can continue to
notice your surroundings.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.350 align:middle line:90%


00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.660 align:middle line:90%
You look around you.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.530 align:middle line:90%


00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.460 align:middle line:84%
Take note of what you see, what
you hear, and of what you feel.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.350 align:middle line:90%


00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.460 align:middle line:84%
Take note of whatever it is that
you can feel as you relax now

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.505 align:middle line:84%
and you drift through this
tranquil forest of your mind.

00:03:23.505 --> 00:03:26.520 align:middle line:90%


00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.100 align:middle line:84%
Every moment becoming
more and more

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:38.670 align:middle line:84%
relaxed, wonderful, content
safe feeling in the air.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And with each breath you
inhale, you feel good.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And you relax with
every exhalation now.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.350 align:middle line:90%


00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And as you continue
down the path

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.960 align:middle line:84%
into the deep relaxation
of the forest,

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.420 align:middle line:90%
you begin to approach a bridge.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And under that bridge
is a peaceful meandering

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.680 align:middle line:90%
stream or river.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.270 align:middle line:90%


00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And you find yourself at
the bridge now completely

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.695 align:middle line:90%
comfortable and relaxed.

00:04:12.695 --> 00:04:17.120 align:middle line:90%


00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.210 align:middle line:84%
You watch as the water
peacefully flowing down deeply

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:22.010 align:middle line:90%
into the forest.

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.810 align:middle line:90%


00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And just as the water
flows down into the forest,

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.000 align:middle line:84%
you drift deeper down into that
wonderful state of relaxation

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.545 align:middle line:90%
with every breath you take.

00:04:34.545 --> 00:04:38.610 align:middle line:90%


00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And as you continue to
walk now into the forest,

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.160 align:middle line:84%
perhaps the path remains
alongside the water gently

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.890 align:middle line:84%
drifting as you walk
through this wonderful place

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:55.050 align:middle line:84%
deeper and deeper into the
beautiful trance of relaxation

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.450 align:middle line:90%
with every step now.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.710 align:middle line:90%


00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And just ahead of you,
you see a beautiful chair.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.425 align:middle line:84%
And you gently take a
sit down in the chair.

00:05:09.425 --> 00:05:13.400 align:middle line:90%


00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And as you do, you notice that
you're sinking into the chair

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.810 align:middle line:90%
with every breath you take.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.520 align:middle line:90%
And you allow that to happen.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.430 align:middle line:84%
You allow yourself to
drift five times deeper

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.910 align:middle line:84%
into that wonderful
state of relaxation.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.980 align:middle line:90%


00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And as I count down
from 10, you can

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.410 align:middle line:84%
allow yourself to
relax even more

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.150 align:middle line:84%
deeply as you sink into that
beautiful comfortable chair.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.540 align:middle line:90%


00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:53.010 align:middle line:84%
So 10, relaxing
your body now as you

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:59.410 align:middle line:84%
sink into the chair;
9, going deeper still,

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.570 align:middle line:84%
that wonderful
comfortable feeling as you

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:17.340 align:middle line:84%
relax more and more with every
breath; 8, releasing now;

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:25.950 align:middle line:84%
7, further and further down
now; 6, relaxing more and more.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:33.850 align:middle line:84%
5, so relaxed now, noticing
your entire body releasing; 4,

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.280 align:middle line:84%
breathing in
comfortably, relaxing

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:44.970 align:middle line:84%
now; 3, almost there
now; 2, every part

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:51.420 align:middle line:84%
of your body heavy and
comfortable now; and, 1,

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.690 align:middle line:84%
releasing all
tension in your body,

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:58.830 align:middle line:84%
deeply and heavily relaxed
now, going deeper and deeper

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.510 align:middle line:90%
with each breath you take.

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:05.370 align:middle line:90%


00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And as you lie here in
your state of relaxation,

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:13.340 align:middle line:84%
you're now ready to tackle
your feelings of anger.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.860 align:middle line:90%


00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:20.540 align:middle line:84%
You know the anger is a
very powerful emotion that

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:26.090 align:middle line:84%
can stem from feelings of
frustration, hurt, annoyance,

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:27.260 align:middle line:90%
or disappointment.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.990 align:middle line:90%


00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And although feelings
of anger can be normal,

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:40.310 align:middle line:84%
suppressed anger or anger that's
not appropriately expressed

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:46.130 align:middle line:84%
can also disrupt relationships,
affect thinking and behavior

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:51.200 align:middle line:84%
patterns, and create a variety
of physical health issues,

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:56.270 align:middle line:84%
such as high blood pressure,
heart problems, headaches,

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:57.320 align:middle line:90%
digestive problems.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.080 align:middle line:90%


00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:04.100 align:middle line:84%
The mental effect is
also just as damaging.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's also extremely
damaging to those around you.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And you know that
you need help here.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.180 align:middle line:84%
You're about to learn some
powerful techniques to help

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.640 align:middle line:84%
you gain control
of your emotions

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:22.080 align:middle line:84%
and to start rewiring those
negative thinking patterns now.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.530 align:middle line:84%
You know that in order
to manage your anger

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:29.250 align:middle line:84%
and to manage the physical
reaction you have,

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:34.289 align:middle line:84%
the first thing you need to do
is to control your breathing.

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:39.630 align:middle line:84%
So you stop, focus
on your breath,

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:43.270 align:middle line:84%
inhale quickly to
the count of 7,

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:49.000 align:middle line:84%
and slowly exhale to the
count of 11 in your mind.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.030 align:middle line:84%
So every time you feel
those emotions creeping in,

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:57.100 align:middle line:84%
that anger creeping in,
inhaling to the count of 7,

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.035 align:middle line:90%
exhaling to the count of 11.

00:08:59.035 --> 00:09:02.400 align:middle line:90%


00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.120 align:middle line:84%
It's during the exhalation that
your parasympathetic nervous

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.207 align:middle line:84%
system, your relaxation
response, is triggered.

00:09:10.207 --> 00:09:13.410 align:middle line:90%


00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:17.460 align:middle line:90%
Breath in for 7 and out for 11.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.640 align:middle line:90%


00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And it may take you
around 60 seconds

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:27.470 align:middle line:84%
to calm down using
that breathing.

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:30.200 align:middle line:84%
Once you're calm again, you'll
notice that you can also

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.600 align:middle line:90%
think much more clearly.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:38.000 align:middle line:84%
You can focus on possible
consequences for others

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.560 align:middle line:84%
and yourself if you were to
allow those feelings of anger

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.360 align:middle line:90%
to emerge.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.840 align:middle line:90%


00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.750 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like you now
to take yourself

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.610 align:middle line:84%
back to a time when
you've been angry.

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.590 align:middle line:90%


00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:55.480 align:middle line:84%
Go back to a time
when you can just

00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:01.300 align:middle line:84%
feel that emotion creeping up on
you when you were really angry.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:05.290 align:middle line:84%
Feel yourself back in that
situation where you overreacted

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:08.620 align:middle line:90%
in an impulsive way.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:13.090 align:middle line:84%
Think about what was said
to you or what you said.

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:14.920 align:middle line:84%
Hear the tone of
voice that was used.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Or notice that look that
annoyed you so much.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps you thought the
situation was just unfair

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:26.000 align:middle line:84%
or you felt victimized
in some way.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.250 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you were angry on behalf
of someone or something else.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And just for a
moment, I want you

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:33.580 align:middle line:84%
to be there again
in that situation

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:38.907 align:middle line:84%
and really feel those feelings
of anger all inside of you.

00:10:38.907 --> 00:10:40.740 align:middle line:84%
But this time, I'd like
you to see yourself.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.390 align:middle line:90%
You're watching yourself.

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're outside a
window and you're looking in

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.680 align:middle line:90%
at yourself feeling angry.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.220 align:middle line:90%
So you're watching yourself.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:52.830 align:middle line:84%
Notice certain
aspects of that time

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:56.130 align:middle line:90%
you've never noticed before.

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:59.685 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you're observing
your facial expressions.

00:10:59.685 --> 00:11:01.060 align:middle line:84%
Or you're observing
other people.

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:05.280 align:middle line:90%


00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.010 align:middle line:84%
You're undergoing detached
observation right now,

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:10.680 align:middle line:84%
meaning you're using your
thinking brain instead

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:14.400 align:middle line:90%
of your emotional brain.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.000 align:middle line:84%
Notice the difference between
observing the occasion instead

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.280 align:middle line:90%
of being in the occasional.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:26.090 align:middle line:84%
Go back again to the third
person observer position.

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:29.420 align:middle line:84%
And, again, watch
that out-of-date time.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:31.160 align:middle line:84%
But this time,
imagine how it could

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.880 align:middle line:84%
have been had the anger
not got the better of you.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.310 align:middle line:90%


00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Let's create an
alternative blueprint

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:42.350 align:middle line:84%
in your mind of how you could
have handled that situation.

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:45.660 align:middle line:90%


00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:50.190 align:middle line:84%
See yourself now dealing with
the situation very differently.

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:53.100 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps your calm and relaxed.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.530 align:middle line:84%
You're taking that
deep breath in for 7

00:11:55.530 --> 00:12:00.090 align:middle line:84%
and a long, slow
exhalation out for 11.

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:01.380 align:middle line:90%
You are calm again.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:04.020 align:middle line:84%
You have control
over your emotions.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:06.750 align:middle line:84%
You know you can handle
situations differently.

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:09.400 align:middle line:90%


00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.900 align:middle line:90%
You're controlling your anger.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.610 align:middle line:84%
You're controlling
your emotions.

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.700 align:middle line:90%
And you react in a calm manner.

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.190 align:middle line:84%
You're now rewiring
your thinking patterns.

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:21.820 align:middle line:84%
Becoming angry is no longer
your immediate response.

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:25.270 align:middle line:84%
You see yourself third
person, watching yourself.

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:27.430 align:middle line:84%
But your response is
completely different.

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:30.070 align:middle line:84%
You have your
breathing technique.

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:32.410 align:middle line:90%
And you are calm and collected.

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:35.810 align:middle line:90%


00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:41.530 align:middle line:84%
You no longer allow that
anger to spoil things for you.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:42.550 align:middle line:90%
You're in control.

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And you're able to stand
up to that old anger.

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:48.067 align:middle line:84%
That anger does not
define you anymore.

00:12:48.067 --> 00:12:52.540 align:middle line:90%


00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Again, seeing yourself,
go back in time.

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.005 align:middle line:84%
See yourself when
you were angry.

00:12:57.005 --> 00:12:59.670 align:middle line:90%


00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Go back to that time when you
were furious at a situation

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.880 align:middle line:84%
and you let that anger
get the better of you.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:10.290 align:middle line:84%
But you see yourself
observing yourself.

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:11.640 align:middle line:90%
Observe your face.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.950 align:middle line:90%
Observe other people.

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:16.270 align:middle line:90%
Practice your breathing.

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:21.610 align:middle line:84%
In for 7 and a long, slow
exhalation out for 11.

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And think about how you could
change those circumstances,

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.820 align:middle line:84%
reacting in a calm
manner, taking

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.125 align:middle line:90%
control of your emotions.

00:13:30.125 --> 00:13:39.390 align:middle line:90%


00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And if you do start to feel
anger creeping up on you, even

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:46.500 align:middle line:84%
though you're rewiring
those thinking patterns now,

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.440 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to think about
what you're not getting.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.060 align:middle line:90%
What do you need?

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:53.430 align:middle line:90%
Are you not being heard?

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Are you not getting
enough attention?

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:57.810 align:middle line:90%
Were you being spoken over?

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:03.090 align:middle line:84%
What need is it that isn't
being satisfied within you?

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:07.960 align:middle line:84%
For most people, anger rises
when that need isn't being met.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:11.670 align:middle line:84%
So have a think now
about what need it is.

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:15.990 align:middle line:84%
What could be addressed
that could help you?

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:17.910 align:middle line:84%
If you can pinpoint
the need, then you

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:20.160 align:middle line:84%
can find a way to
work out that need

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.580 align:middle line:90%
without resorting to anger.

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:31.970 align:middle line:90%


00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:35.730 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, that anger
may fully be justified.

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:39.680 align:middle line:84%
But by clearly identifying
which need is not being met,

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.200 align:middle line:84%
we can at least give
ourselves space and also

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:46.460 align:middle line:84%
think about what might be the
best way to meet that need

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:51.440 align:middle line:84%
or even whether it's valid
to meet that need right now.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.910 align:middle line:84%
We can take the steering wheel
of emotional responsiveness

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:58.270 align:middle line:90%
a little bit further.

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:01.360 align:middle line:84%
It may be that you may need to
learn to be assertive rather

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:05.590 align:middle line:84%
than just threatening and also
to start to develop boundaries

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:08.770 align:middle line:84%
with yourself by setting
limits on your own behavior

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:09.850 align:middle line:90%
or that old anger.

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:14.910 align:middle line:90%


00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:17.040 align:middle line:84%
You recognize that
by getting angry,

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.680 align:middle line:84%
by shouting, that
doesn't mean that you're

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.600 align:middle line:84%
going to be heard any
more than if you were

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.625 align:middle line:84%
to simply be assertive and
to express yourself clearly

00:15:24.625 --> 00:15:25.425 align:middle line:90%
and firmly.

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:29.050 align:middle line:90%


00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:30.970 align:middle line:84%
You appreciate that,
in fact, people

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:33.730 align:middle line:84%
were expecting much more if
you don't lose your temper.

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:39.180 align:middle line:90%


00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:42.960 align:middle line:84%
Your thinking is no
longer absolutist.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:48.240 align:middle line:84%
You no longer think in terms
of completely, utterly, always,

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.640 align:middle line:90%
and absolutely.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.980 align:middle line:84%
Your black and white
thinking is not healthy.

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And you realize
that now that you're

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:57.930 align:middle line:84%
no longer in the strong
emotional state of mind

00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:00.390 align:middle line:84%
or fight or flight
approach and you're

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:03.055 align:middle line:84%
able to view situations in
a much more balanced state

00:16:03.055 --> 00:16:03.855 align:middle line:90%
of mind.

00:16:03.855 --> 00:16:08.490 align:middle line:90%


00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:13.520 align:middle line:84%
You're much more able to be
able to see the bigger picture

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:18.210 align:middle line:84%
or, simply put, other
pictures other than your own.

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And this huge step
means that you're

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:24.170 align:middle line:84%
able to dissipate anger,
as you no longer rely

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:26.720 align:middle line:84%
on limited and
rigid perceptions.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.550 align:middle line:90%


00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:33.450 align:middle line:84%
You have your breathing
technique to calm you now.

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And in your mind,
you take a step back

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:38.400 align:middle line:90%
and see the bigger picture.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.760 align:middle line:90%
You're no longer absolutist.

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.740 align:middle line:84%
You have control
over your emotions.

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:49.230 align:middle line:90%


00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:50.980 align:middle line:84%
You're going to find
that you're beginning

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:56.440 align:middle line:84%
to feel a much calmer and
more relaxed person inside.

00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:00.820 align:middle line:84%
You feel calmer in every way,
more peaceful, more easygoing,

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:04.420 align:middle line:84%
more relaxed, and happier
because those good feelings

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:09.960 align:middle line:84%
are so much better than the
old destructive negative ones.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And your life becomes much
richer, more meaningful,

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:17.190 align:middle line:90%
much happier in every way.

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:20.069 align:middle line:84%
And every day you feel better,
happier, and more relaxed

00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:22.230 align:middle line:90%
and much calmer.

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:24.990 align:middle line:84%
You begin to feel much
more differently inside.

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And other people notice
a difference in you too

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:31.660 align:middle line:90%
And you feel that difference.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:34.200 align:middle line:84%
You feel happier and
calmer, healthier,

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.320 align:middle line:84%
and much more relaxed
and confident.

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:40.440 align:middle line:90%


00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.120 align:middle line:84%
You're proud of
yourself for having

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:45.090 align:middle line:84%
learned to control your anger
and other people apart of you

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:46.350 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And the more you listen
to this mind talk,

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.500 align:middle line:84%
the more you're rewiring
those thinking patterns

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.070 align:middle line:84%
and your instinctive
response to situations.

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:59.720 align:middle line:90%


00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.210 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, I'm going
to count from 1 to 5.

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of
5, you'll be wide

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.410 align:middle line:84%
awake with beautiful
feelings flowing

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:09.557 align:middle line:84%
through your body,
calm, peaceful thoughts

00:18:09.557 --> 00:18:10.640 align:middle line:90%
flowing through your mind.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:14.720 align:middle line:90%


00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And these hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.472 align:middle line:84%
embedded in your
subconscious mind.

00:18:18.472 --> 00:18:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And they'll become
more and more powerful

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:23.390 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count up from 1 to 5

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:27.530 align:middle line:90%
to awaken you.

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of 5, you'll
be wide awake, fully refreshed,

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:33.440 align:middle line:84%
alert, and feeling
fantastic, bringing back

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.450 align:middle line:84%
with you all the
wonderful new feelings.

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:43.340 align:middle line:84%
Coming back now with
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.850 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open when you're ready.

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:50.000 align:middle line:90%
