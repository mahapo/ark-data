[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to
House of Wellbeing.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.100 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to the
obsessive compulsive disorder

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.290 align:middle line:90%
mind talk audio.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.130 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.040 align:middle line:84%
But before it does,
I'd like to remind you

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.020 align:middle line:84%
that the following
audio contains

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.970 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.060 align:middle line:84%
aim to help you reach a
deep level of relaxation.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.450 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.900 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place,

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.540 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.950 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.580 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.390 align:middle line:90%
will alert you.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.388 align:middle line:84%
And you'll easily
come out of hypnosis.

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:56.930 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
there's nothing at all

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.420 align:middle line:84%
you need to do, apart
from close your eyes,

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.395 align:middle line:84%
relax, lie back, and
let go, and really enjoy

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:04.780 align:middle line:84%
all the peaceful feelings
and all the benefits that

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:05.580 align:middle line:90%
come with it.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.729 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.510 align:middle line:84%
I like you to take in
a long, deep breath,

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.650 align:middle line:84%
filling in lower
and upper lungs.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready, exhale
it, gently and powerfully.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And again, when you're
ready, another big breath in,

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.620 align:middle line:84%
filling your mind and body
with oxygen, all the way in.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready
again, long, slow,

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.720 align:middle line:90%
powerful exhalation.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.640 align:middle line:90%


00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.440 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And now just allow
your breathing

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.920 align:middle line:84%
to return to normal,
gentle breaths

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.665 align:middle line:84%
in and out, at your
body's own natural pace.

00:01:49.665 --> 00:01:54.320 align:middle line:90%


00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And you know that sometimes we
find ourselves paying attention

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.530 align:middle line:90%
to the most relaxing things.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.310 align:middle line:90%


00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.310 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, we find
ourselves adding numbers,

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.840 align:middle line:90%
which are nicely numbered.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.365 align:middle line:84%
And one wonders sometimes
why you do that.

00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:15.035 align:middle line:90%


00:02:15.035 --> 00:02:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And as you lie or sit in
your chair or on your bed,

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.340 align:middle line:84%
listening with your
subconscious mind

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.790 align:middle line:84%
while your conscious mind
remains relaxed and peaceful,

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.800 align:middle line:84%
you can relax
peacefully while you

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.250 align:middle line:84%
try to be aware of the exact
meaning of the words you hear

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.460 align:middle line:84%
and of all the
changes that occurred,

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.580 align:middle line:84%
in your thoughts, sensations,
or awareness as I speak here.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.110 align:middle line:90%


00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.410 align:middle line:84%
Or you can forget
about trying to make

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.800 align:middle line:84%
all the unnecessary effort
to pay close attention

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.180 align:middle line:90%
to everything that happened.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.240 align:middle line:90%


00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.650 align:middle line:84%
Because you can remember that
you can forget so easily.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And we're forgetting
certain things.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.805 align:middle line:90%
You can remember other things.

00:03:08.805 --> 00:03:11.690 align:middle line:90%


00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.010 align:middle line:84%
Remembering what
you need to remember

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.240 align:middle line:84%
and forgetting what
you can forget.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.050 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter if you forget.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.105 align:middle line:90%
We need not remember.

00:03:22.105 --> 00:03:24.910 align:middle line:90%


00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Your subconscious mind
remembers everything

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.990 align:middle line:90%
that you need to know.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And you can let your
subconscious mind listen.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.310 align:middle line:84%
You can let your
subconscious mind

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:41.025 align:middle line:84%
remember, while your conscious
mind sleeps and forgets.

00:03:41.025 --> 00:03:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And all you really
need to do is remember

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.444 align:middle line:84%
that your memory is forgetting
things that you had forgotten.

00:03:49.444 --> 00:03:54.880 align:middle line:90%


00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.050 align:middle line:84%
So you can forget about
trying to make the effort,

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.065 align:middle line:84%
to pay close attention to
everything that happens

00:04:02.065 --> 00:04:05.410 align:middle line:84%
or that everything that doesn't
happen in your experience

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.480 align:middle line:84%
as you listen to me, and
also to your own thoughts,

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.690 align:middle line:84%
or to your own sensations
that change over time.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.209 align:middle line:90%


00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.850 align:middle line:90%
Or, perhaps, stay the same.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.500 align:middle line:90%


00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.320 align:middle line:90%
In and out, or in an ear.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.380 align:middle line:90%


00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Do they say in one
ear, out over there,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.690 align:middle line:90%
and your legs or fingers.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.830 align:middle line:90%


00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And what about the
thoughts and the variety

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.610 align:middle line:84%
of images that speak
to your mind's eye,

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.030 align:middle line:84%
as I speak to your mind to
remind you when you speak

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.360 align:middle line:90%
to yourself speaks for itself.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.270 align:middle line:84%
As you try to search
and find that things

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.320 align:middle line:84%
may seem to be one thing,
but turn out to be another.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.490 align:middle line:90%


00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:05.820 align:middle line:84%
Because two and two are four,
but "too" can also mean also,

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.790 align:middle line:90%
and no two are alike.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:17.200 align:middle line:84%
It all belongs to you and to
your own ability to relax.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.595 align:middle line:90%
Those two is two.

00:05:20.595 --> 00:05:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And to begin to
know that you really

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.610 align:middle line:84%
don't know what means
yes and what means no.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.360 align:middle line:90%


00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:36.040 align:middle line:84%
Here, though you may try to
guess where you're going.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.200 align:middle line:90%
To go not to go, you don't know.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.080 align:middle line:90%
And there is no real way to go.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:48.840 align:middle line:84%
How to let go while holding on,
or to recognize that there's

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.420 align:middle line:84%
nothing you need to try to
know, to do, or not to do,

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.320 align:middle line:84%
because everything you do
allows you to recognize

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.030 align:middle line:90%
that you already know that.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.000 align:middle line:90%
I can say many different things.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And there's no need
for you to make

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.500 align:middle line:84%
the effort it takes to
try to make the effort

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:20.750 align:middle line:84%
to pay close attention to
each thing I say or don't say.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.960 align:middle line:84%
Because there was a time when
the effort to train the mind

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.090 align:middle line:90%
stay on track.

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.120 align:middle line:84%
It's not worth the trip
that led the mind back

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:36.070 align:middle line:84%
to that time, of
peaceful calm awareness,

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:37.980 align:middle line:90%
of effortless letting go.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.720 align:middle line:90%


00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Getting low and knowing that
you don't need to try, or hear,

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:50.590 align:middle line:84%
or even understand what I
might say later on here today,

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:51.940 align:middle line:90%
in this mind talk.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Because the conscious
mind can go anywhere

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:00.100 align:middle line:84%
it wishes whilst I
continue to talk.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And your unconscious
mind continues

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:07.150 align:middle line:84%
to hear that way you overhear
a conversation with a radio

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:08.230 align:middle line:90%
station whilst driving.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:12.330 align:middle line:90%


00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.940 align:middle line:84%
You don't even need
to do anything at all.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.160 align:middle line:84%
It all belongs to
you, so you begin

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:22.890 align:middle line:84%
to hear the way you do
here and now with eyes

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:30.380 align:middle line:84%
closed, comfortable, that voice
or sound in the background

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:37.070 align:middle line:84%
of your mind as you
listen to that show.

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.240 align:middle line:84%
Show that too, and
it shows you how

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:44.460 align:middle line:84%
to notice the
relaxed, drifting glow

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:53.790 align:middle line:84%
of a slow sound show of
quiet calmness and thoughts

00:07:53.790 --> 00:08:03.890 align:middle line:84%
like dreams following
themselves as I speak,

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:12.330 align:middle line:84%
following themselves as I spoke,
turning, spokes in a wheel

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:21.220 align:middle line:84%
turning this way and that, where
we'll be drifting effortlessly

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:26.610 align:middle line:84%
down a path into a
quiet, still place

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:32.630 align:middle line:84%
where words can remind your mind
of those things needed for you.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:37.450 align:middle line:90%


00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And other times, we
drift a bit as we

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.230 align:middle line:84%
think about all the
things that are parallel

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:47.470 align:middle line:84%
and all the things which
cross across the horizons

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:48.670 align:middle line:90%
of those parallel things.

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:51.220 align:middle line:90%


00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.460 align:middle line:84%
But we always find ourselves
slowing down through a stop

00:08:54.460 --> 00:09:01.120 align:middle line:84%
sign and drifting, floating
below the threshold

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:06.900 align:middle line:84%
of our consciousness,
when we feel ourselves

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.750 align:middle line:84%
let go of those
parallel line thoughts

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:17.430 align:middle line:84%
and just focus on how
drifting seems effortless

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:22.960 align:middle line:84%
and a timeless
drifting down motion,

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.725 align:middle line:84%
which we may find many
times to be relaxing.

00:09:25.725 --> 00:09:28.790 align:middle line:90%


00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And relaxing, relaxing
deeper and deeper

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:40.260 align:middle line:84%
as we add three plus
three plus three plus,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:45.570 align:middle line:84%
a horizon of relaxation
and a drifting

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:50.580 align:middle line:84%
feeling as we float along
to the solution, which

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:53.580 align:middle line:84%
relaxes us deep
into the concepts

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:57.380 align:middle line:90%
that we are now examining.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.710 align:middle line:84%
Because four plus
four is fourfold,

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:03.900 align:middle line:90%
to forgo consciousness.

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And drifting happens when we now
calculate all of the forbearing

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:14.380 align:middle line:84%
thoughts and the parallel sphere
of our own reality letting go,

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.665 align:middle line:90%
relaxing deeper and deeper.

00:10:15.665 --> 00:10:20.470 align:middle line:90%


00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:23.470 align:middle line:84%
And as you look at things in
a different light, of course,

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:29.340 align:middle line:84%
you can see now that there's
always been a different way.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.740 align:middle line:90%
And there always has been.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.570 align:middle line:84%
It's just that sometimes it's
the same way that you already

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:36.370 align:middle line:90%
know.

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:39.100 align:middle line:90%


00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And as you weigh that up, it can
be quite relaxing for your mind

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.910 align:middle line:90%
to find that way down.

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:50.110 align:middle line:90%


00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:54.030 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, one
plus one is two of a kind,

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.930 align:middle line:84%
and a straight flush
down the river,

00:10:55.930 --> 00:11:00.350 align:middle line:84%
rowing a boat on a
relaxing day and getting

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:05.600 align:middle line:84%
very tired of rowing and rows
and rows of hay in a field

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.800 align:middle line:84%
have been veiled by a male
that sails down the same river.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.360 align:middle line:90%


00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And let's go of the
drifting current,

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:22.090 align:middle line:84%
currently relaxing in the warm
sunshine, relaxing in a chair

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:27.360 align:middle line:84%
there, like walking down
stairs deeper and deeper.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.830 align:middle line:90%


00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:36.560 align:middle line:84%
Imagine yourself at the top
of 10 stairs leading down.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.640 align:middle line:84%
As I count down,
I want you to step

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:44.400 align:middle line:84%
onto the next step, all the
time doubling your relaxation.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.210 align:middle line:90%
So stepping down now.

00:11:48.210 --> 00:12:07.080 align:middle line:90%
9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.320 align:middle line:90%
Feeling deeply relaxed now.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:14.570 align:middle line:90%


00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:17.660 align:middle line:84%
Whilst you're in this
relaxed state of mind

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:21.230 align:middle line:84%
and relaxed state
of body, it's now

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:25.165 align:middle line:84%
time to focus on any feelings of
obsessive compulsive disorder.

00:12:25.165 --> 00:12:28.680 align:middle line:90%


00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And if you are suffering from
obsessive compulsive disorder,

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.670 align:middle line:84%
then you'll be experiencing
a severe impact

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:41.050 align:middle line:84%
on your daily functioning
and quality of life.

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:43.810 align:middle line:90%


00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:45.940 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you spend
your day-to-day life

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:48.760 align:middle line:84%
having intrusive
thoughts that you believe

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:53.110 align:middle line:84%
if you can control and do
certain rituals, patterns,

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:57.490 align:middle line:84%
and actions, that you'll
be safe and free from harm.

00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:02.650 align:middle line:84%
For example, you may do washing,
checking, writing lists,

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:08.410 align:middle line:84%
tapping, touching, repeating,
cleaning, trying to get

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:11.840 align:middle line:90%
a just right feeling.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps your OCD
may make you feel

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.600 align:middle line:84%
like you have to avoid all
sorts of objects and people

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:21.800 align:middle line:84%
and places, and
hence, you've learned

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.920 align:middle line:84%
that it's those feelings that
ultimately keep the thoughts

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:29.220 align:middle line:84%
and behavior staying
and the rituals alive,

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:33.980 align:middle line:84%
the result of which is a
cycle of fear and anxiety,

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.120 align:middle line:84%
and it impacts heavily on
you and others around you.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.710 align:middle line:90%


00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:46.890 align:middle line:84%
But today, as you're deeply
relaxed and deeply comfortable,

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:51.120 align:middle line:84%
you realize that your
OCD is just thoughts,

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.290 align:middle line:84%
and it's not the
thoughts themselves

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:55.690 align:middle line:90%
which are the problem.

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:58.410 align:middle line:84%
It's how you give those
thoughts energy and time.

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:02.140 align:middle line:90%


00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And those thoughts
fuel your imagination,

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:08.820 align:middle line:84%
and therefore how
you respond to them

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.585 align:middle line:90%
is key to solving the problem.

00:14:10.585 --> 00:14:16.150 align:middle line:90%


00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:20.920 align:middle line:84%
A good way of understanding how
different responses to thoughts

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:27.470 align:middle line:84%
can affect the way we behave
is if you think of a situation.

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:31.160 align:middle line:84%
Let's say it's the middle of
the night, and you're in bed.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.170 align:middle line:84%
You hear a noise
from downstairs.

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:38.600 align:middle line:90%


00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:42.490 align:middle line:84%
You may think it's
just the cat again.

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:43.290 align:middle line:90%
You feel angry.

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:45.120 align:middle line:84%
You put your head
under the pillow,

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.860 align:middle line:90%
and you try to go back to sleep.

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps you hear a noise
downstairs and you think,

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.200 align:middle line:90%
it's just my partner coming in.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.240 align:middle line:90%
I haven't seen them all day.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And you feel happy, and you
get out of bed to say hi.

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:02.460 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps you hear
a noise downstairs

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.800 align:middle line:84%
and you think maybe
it's a burglar,

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.200 align:middle line:84%
and you spend the rest of
the night in total panic.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.240 align:middle line:90%


00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.270 align:middle line:84%
The interesting thing is that
your brain doesn't distinguish

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:16.960 align:middle line:90%
reality from imagination.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:20.050 align:middle line:84%
It means what you
imagined to be happening

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:26.040 align:middle line:84%
is actually happening as far
as your brain is concerned.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:29.555 align:middle line:84%
If your brain thinks it,
then it thinks it's reality.

00:15:29.555 --> 00:15:32.300 align:middle line:90%


00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.120 align:middle line:84%
So in summary, it's not the
thoughts themselves that

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.000 align:middle line:90%
are the focus of treatment.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.850 align:middle line:84%
It's what we make
of those thoughts,

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:44.510 align:middle line:84%
whether or not we let our
imagination get carried away

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.940 align:middle line:84%
and how we react to
them that truly matters.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:50.850 align:middle line:90%


00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:54.230 align:middle line:90%
Your OCD has been lying to you.

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.810 align:middle line:84%
It's been tricking
you, making you

00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:00.187 align:middle line:84%
feel more anxious about things
when you didn't need to.

00:16:00.187 --> 00:16:03.050 align:middle line:90%


00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:05.330 align:middle line:84%
Your coping strategies
to make yourself

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.810 align:middle line:84%
feel safer and
less anxious, when

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:13.590 align:middle line:84%
in fact, all of those thoughts
do the exact opposite.

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:16.185 align:middle line:84%
They make you feel unsafe
and even more scared.

00:16:16.185 --> 00:16:19.330 align:middle line:90%


00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Even if your
thoughts in the past

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:25.130 align:middle line:84%
have made you feel temporary
relief from anxiety,

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:28.030 align:middle line:84%
the rituals themselves
make the meaning attached

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:31.690 align:middle line:84%
to the intrusive thoughts,
images, urges, and doubts

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:36.040 align:middle line:84%
feel even stronger,
therefore becoming necessary

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.740 align:middle line:84%
for you to keep doing
the rituals continuously.

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:41.440 align:middle line:90%


00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:44.560 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, all this has done in
the past is make your thoughts

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.040 align:middle line:84%
and imagination
seem even more real

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.410 align:middle line:84%
and like there's even
more truth in them,

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:53.890 align:middle line:90%
when in fact there is none.

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:57.510 align:middle line:84%
They are vacuous thoughts
until you action upon them.

00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:00.970 align:middle line:90%


00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:05.020 align:middle line:84%
They're simply thoughts that
are fueling your imagination,

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:07.880 align:middle line:84%
and they serve you
no purpose at all.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:10.569 align:middle line:84%
If anything, they offer
much more harm than good.

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:16.490 align:middle line:90%


00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:21.790 align:middle line:84%
So today you're going to learn
to feel much more in control.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:24.774 align:middle line:84%
You'll have the ability to stop
those thoughts in their tracks.

00:17:24.774 --> 00:17:27.520 align:middle line:90%


00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:31.060 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you start to think
a negative OCD thought that

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:34.120 align:middle line:84%
serves you no
purpose, you simply

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:37.780 align:middle line:84%
imagine yourself pulling a
plug socket out of the womb,

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:40.930 align:middle line:84%
cutting the thought,
stopping the power running

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:42.700 align:middle line:84%
into your brain,
switching seconds.

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:46.460 align:middle line:90%


00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:48.080 align:middle line:90%
So let's imagine this now.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.880 align:middle line:90%


00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:54.360 align:middle line:84%
Think about a time when
you've had an OCD thought,

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.280 align:middle line:84%
and halfway through
that thought,

00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:00.840 align:middle line:84%
you pull the plug, stop
that thought immediately,

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.980 align:middle line:84%
and think about something
positive instead.

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:09.870 align:middle line:84%
When you start to feel that
negative thought or feeling,

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:15.820 align:middle line:84%
you also now learn to focus on
the 4-7-8 breathing technique.

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:18.640 align:middle line:84%
You breathe in for four
seconds, hold your breath

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:23.000 align:middle line:84%
for seven seconds,
and exhale for eight.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:29.750 align:middle line:84%
So let's try this now, breathing
in on the count of 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:34.640 align:middle line:84%
Hold your breath for the
count of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:43.260 align:middle line:84%
Exhale for 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.230 align:middle line:84%
In future, you repeat
this two or three times

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:48.210 align:middle line:90%
until you feel calm and relaxed.

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:51.610 align:middle line:90%


00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:57.550 align:middle line:84%
So again, that's in for 4,
hold for 7, and out for 8

00:18:57.550 --> 00:19:01.480 align:middle line:84%
when you start to feel that
negativity or that panic

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:05.600 align:middle line:84%
coming into your body
and into your mind.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.615 align:middle line:90%
In for 4, hold for 7, out for 8.

00:19:08.615 --> 00:19:12.570 align:middle line:90%


00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:16.170 align:middle line:84%
Simply by doing this
relaxing breathing technique,

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:19.470 align:middle line:84%
you're rewiring your
brain's thinking patterns,

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:23.820 align:middle line:84%
rewiring their neural
pathways, teaching your mind

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:27.690 align:middle line:84%
to completely relax when
that panic starts to arrive.

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:30.310 align:middle line:90%


00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:32.650 align:middle line:90%
Your OCD does not own you.

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:36.130 align:middle line:90%
You are in full control.

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:39.100 align:middle line:84%
You are positive, and you
want to be the old you you had

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:42.360 align:middle line:90%
before those negative thoughts.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.810 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back
to that time now,

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:49.200 align:middle line:84%
before you had OCD, before your
thoughts and imagination took

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.000 align:middle line:90%
over.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.700 align:middle line:90%


00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:55.610 align:middle line:84%
With your eyes closed, you
can begin to relax and focus

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:57.480 align:middle line:90%
inwardly on the experience.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.980 align:middle line:84%
Now you're in this lovely,
calm, relaxed state.

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:06.230 align:middle line:84%
You can allow your mind
to notice your breathing

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:09.440 align:middle line:84%
and to notice the feelings
associated with the breathing

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.660 align:middle line:90%
in and breathing out.

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And notice how it feels
to have the air pass down

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:19.010 align:middle line:84%
into your body and
the difference it

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:24.500 align:middle line:84%
feels as it passes back
up and out of your body.

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.800 align:middle line:84%
You're deeply relaxed,
and you're safe,

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.920 align:middle line:84%
and you can allow your mind
to go where it's about to go.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:34.370 align:middle line:90%


00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:37.220 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to create a
blank screen in your mind,

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:40.390 align:middle line:90%
like a TV screen.

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:43.710 align:middle line:84%
So see that TV
screen in your mind,

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:46.440 align:middle line:84%
and see yourself sitting in
a chair in front of the TV.

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:49.090 align:middle line:90%


00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And imagine now drifting
and floating off

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:53.650 align:middle line:84%
to a position at the
side where you can see

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:56.110 align:middle line:90%
yourself sitting in the chair.

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:58.780 align:middle line:90%
You can't see what's on the TV.

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.150 align:middle line:84%
You simply see yourself
sitting on a chair,

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:02.550 align:middle line:90%
looking at the TV screen.

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:06.990 align:middle line:90%


00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:11.200 align:middle line:84%
When I say now, I'd like
you to watch the you there

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.000 align:middle line:90%
in the chair.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.780 align:middle line:84%
Press play and
watch an old memory,

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:19.500 align:middle line:84%
the old memories of an event or
situation when your OCD first

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.650 align:middle line:90%
started.

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And do you see yourself
watching yourself watch

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.260 align:middle line:90%
the movie through to the end?

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And then pause the
movie at a scene

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.310 align:middle line:84%
where you feel calm and
everything was fine.

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:35.540 align:middle line:90%


00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:38.240 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to imagine
floating and drifting

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:43.340 align:middle line:84%
into yourself and the end
of that old paused movie,

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:45.140 align:middle line:84%
drifting and
floating comfortably

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:49.600 align:middle line:84%
into the end of that
old paused movie.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.430 align:middle line:84%
Remember that movie is of
an event or situation when

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:56.090 align:middle line:90%
your OCD first started.

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And you're at the end of the
movie when everything was fine.

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:02.450 align:middle line:90%


00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And when I say now, I
want you to rewind back

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:09.020 align:middle line:84%
to the beginning, back to
before the incident began,

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:12.860 align:middle line:84%
back to a time when you
felt calm and relaxed.

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:17.660 align:middle line:84%
See what you see, hear what
you heard, only all in reverse,

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:20.470 align:middle line:84%
people talking
backwards, sounding

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:23.050 align:middle line:84%
like Mickey Mouse as they
talk backwards and fast,

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:26.470 align:middle line:84%
everything moving backwards, all
the way back to the beginning

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:30.260 align:middle line:84%
to a time where you
were calm and relaxed.

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:34.520 align:middle line:84%
So if you're at the end of the
movie now, let's go back now.

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Rewind the movie back
to the beginning,

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:41.560 align:middle line:84%
back through that OCD event, all
the way back, people, feelings,

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.450 align:middle line:84%
everything you can
see going backwards,

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:46.280 align:middle line:84%
right to the beginning now
again to a time where everything

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.080 align:middle line:90%
was fine.

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.900 align:middle line:90%


00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now
to drift and float

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:55.140 align:middle line:84%
through time and space over
to you sitting in your chair.

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.840 align:middle line:90%


00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:01.080 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to watch
that old, old movie and fast

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:05.520 align:middle line:84%
forward all the way to the end
point after the incident again,

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:09.270 align:middle line:84%
when your OCD first started,
when you were calm and relaxed

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:10.500 align:middle line:90%
and it was all over.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:13.620 align:middle line:90%


00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And it will only
take a few seconds.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.652 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to
pause that old movie when

00:23:19.652 --> 00:23:20.860 align:middle line:90%
you've watched it to the end.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:22.950 align:middle line:90%
So let's do it now.

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:26.130 align:middle line:84%
Watching all the way
forward, going through OCD,

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:28.050 align:middle line:84%
going through those
feelings, those thoughts,

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:29.680 align:middle line:90%
and now you're at the end now.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:33.470 align:middle line:90%


00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And now I'd like you to
repeat this process but faster

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:40.580 align:middle line:84%
than before, drifting,
floating through time and space

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.170 align:middle line:90%
into the end of that old movie.

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:45.245 align:middle line:84%
Again, going all the way
forward through that OCD,

00:23:45.245 --> 00:23:48.920 align:middle line:84%
and now again, you're at the
end, and everything's fine.

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.810 align:middle line:90%


00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And now again, let's rewind to
the beginning, going backwards.

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:56.800 align:middle line:90%
See yourself starting.

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:57.600 align:middle line:90%
You're fine.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:01.500 align:middle line:84%
Going all the way backwards
in reverse through that OCD,

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:03.520 align:middle line:84%
through those feelings,
those thoughts,

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:10.000 align:middle line:84%
those sensors all the way to
the beginning now and again.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.030 align:middle line:84%
Let's repeat this process
but faster than before.

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:15.690 align:middle line:84%
So it's at the speed of a flash
or at the speed of a click

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:18.990 align:middle line:84%
of fingers, drifting, floating
through time and space

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:21.630 align:middle line:84%
into the end of
that old, old movie.

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:24.090 align:middle line:84%
Now going forward through
those OCD feelings,

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:26.455 align:middle line:84%
and you're arriving
at the end now.

00:24:26.455 --> 00:24:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And again, we're
going to rewind.

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:30.870 align:middle line:84%
See yourself at the end
going backwards through OCD.

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:32.655 align:middle line:84%
And again, you're at
the beginning now.

00:24:32.655 --> 00:24:35.690 align:middle line:90%


00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And as you sit there in
front of the TV screen,

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:45.910 align:middle line:84%
having control of the remote,
control over what you're

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:50.230 align:middle line:84%
watching, that old,
old movie comfortably,

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:54.550 align:middle line:84%
moving through at your own
rate and your own speed,

00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:58.550 align:middle line:84%
you can watch it now
at your own speed,

00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:01.810 align:middle line:84%
watching it from the
beginning, moving

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:06.010 align:middle line:84%
through OCD feelings and
thoughts and behaviors

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:09.220 align:middle line:90%
and to the end.

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'll leave you some
time to do that now.

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:29.808 align:middle line:90%


00:25:29.808 --> 00:25:33.560 align:middle line:90%
And now clear the screen.

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.870 align:middle line:84%
Clear the screen
on that old TV set

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:40.580 align:middle line:84%
and imagine future
situations that

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:43.760 align:middle line:84%
may have once caused or
triggered your OCD feelings

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.460 align:middle line:90%
or thoughts or behaviors.

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:49.340 align:middle line:84%
But I'd like you now to see
yourself handling things

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:55.630 align:middle line:84%
very differently, see yourself
now staying calm and responding

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:56.650 align:middle line:90%
appropriately.

00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:59.240 align:middle line:90%


00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:02.510 align:middle line:84%
You no longer do your usual
rituals, your patterns,

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:04.190 align:middle line:90%
or avoiding situations.

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:08.930 align:middle line:84%
But you feel calm and
you feel in control,

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:13.010 align:middle line:84%
ignoring any negative thought
and ignoring any thoughts

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:15.800 align:middle line:84%
or behaviors, acting
the old way would have.

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:18.500 align:middle line:90%


00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:22.180 align:middle line:84%
See yourself handling the
situation the way you want to.

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:26.050 align:middle line:90%


00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:28.960 align:middle line:84%
You no longer let your
OCD control your life,

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.335 align:middle line:90%
as you are now in control.

00:26:30.335 --> 00:26:32.960 align:middle line:90%


00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:37.500 align:middle line:84%
See yourself on that screen
behaving very differently,

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:41.060 align:middle line:84%
the way you want to, the way
your mind body was designed to.

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:46.340 align:middle line:90%


00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And again, by watching yourself
on that screen going forwards

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:52.730 align:middle line:84%
and backwards at
such pace and speeds,

00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:55.490 align:middle line:84%
you've rewired those thinking
patterns and behaviors

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:57.330 align:middle line:90%
in your mind.

00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:01.680 align:middle line:84%
They're no longer so
significant to you.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And as you see yourself
acting differently, behaving

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:09.020 align:middle line:84%
differently, and
feeling differently,

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:11.892 align:middle line:84%
you're rehearsing those
visualizations in your mind

00:27:11.892 --> 00:27:12.975 align:middle line:90%
and making them a reality.

00:27:12.975 --> 00:27:15.720 align:middle line:90%


00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:19.440 align:middle line:84%
You no longer let your
OCD control your life.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.835 align:middle line:90%
You are now in control.

00:27:20.835 --> 00:27:24.720 align:middle line:90%


00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Those old negative
OCD thoughts only

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:31.290 align:middle line:84%
survive if you let your
imagination get carried away

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:34.110 align:middle line:84%
with them and if
you action on them.

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:37.860 align:middle line:84%
Without your action, they're
empty and meaningless.

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:40.830 align:middle line:90%


00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:45.540 align:middle line:84%
You've taken yourself back to
a time before your OCD started,

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:48.900 align:middle line:84%
and you recognize
that you're in control

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:52.110 align:middle line:84%
and that your OCD isn't
making you feel safe anymore.

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:53.400 align:middle line:90%
It's causing more problems.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:57.600 align:middle line:90%


00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.640 align:middle line:84%
Every time you
listen to this mind

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:04.050 align:middle line:84%
talk you're feeling more and
more confident, much stronger

00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:08.880 align:middle line:84%
and much more in control of
your life and your thoughts.

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:11.850 align:middle line:84%
You're determined to leave
the old ways behind you

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:15.900 align:middle line:84%
and to start a fresh,
confident new way of life,

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:19.530 align:middle line:84%
a happy, normal life, safe
in the knowledge that you're

00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:21.900 align:middle line:90%
always safe.

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.000 align:middle line:84%
It's just your
imagination and thoughts

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.640 align:middle line:84%
that drive your insecurities,
and you no longer

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:27.750 align:middle line:90%
want to action them.

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:30.640 align:middle line:90%


00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.950 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you also
make sure that you

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:36.880 align:middle line:84%
have good physical health
so it has a positive impact

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:39.790 align:middle line:84%
on your mood, which
in turn can play

00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:43.955 align:middle line:84%
a significant part in helping
you reduce the anxiety caused

00:28:43.955 --> 00:28:44.755 align:middle line:90%
by your OCD.

00:28:44.755 --> 00:28:48.200 align:middle line:90%


00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And that, of course,
includes making sure

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:52.130 align:middle line:84%
you eat a good,
healthy, balanced diet

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:54.950 align:middle line:84%
and that you regularly
exercise and keep

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:56.190 align:middle line:90%
regular sleep patterns.

00:28:56.190 --> 00:29:02.224 align:middle line:90%


00:29:02.224 --> 00:29:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And these hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:07.440 align:middle line:84%
embedded in your
subconscious mind,

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.270 align:middle line:84%
and they'll become
more and more powerful

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:10.910 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:13.760 align:middle line:90%


00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count up from 1 to 5

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.500 align:middle line:90%
to awakening.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of 5,
you'll be wide awake,

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:24.440 align:middle line:84%
fully refreshed, alert
and feeling fantastic,

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:27.620 align:middle line:84%
bringing back with you all
the wonderful new feelings.

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:33.960 align:middle line:84%
So coming back now
with 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
