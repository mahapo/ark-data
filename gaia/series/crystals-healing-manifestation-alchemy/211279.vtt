>> Crystal healing is an ancient
technology that has been passed

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.590 align:middle line:84%
down for many generations
across a variety of different

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.070 align:middle line:90%
cultures.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.020 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest questions we
all have is, how does it work?

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.030 align:middle line:84%
How is it that a stone, this
seemingly inanimate object,

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.220 align:middle line:90%
can help us heal.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.940 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we're going
to explore how crystals heal

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.130 align:middle line:90%
the mind, body, and spirit.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.080 align:middle line:90%

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.410 align:middle line:84%
>> We consider crystal healing
as a viable therapy for healing

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.490 align:middle line:90%
the human body.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.700 align:middle line:10%
All the principles
of crystal classes,

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.070 align:middle line:10%
crystal systems, and
even the formation

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.000 align:middle line:10%
of crystals themselves,
natural Earthborn crystals,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.530 align:middle line:10%
come into this answer.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And it begins to become
very clear how a crystal can

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.220 align:middle line:90%
support our healing.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Crystals are this perfect
embodiment of sacred geometry.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, any time we're
working with sacred geometry,

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.400 align:middle line:84%
it's putting out
frequencies that

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.020 align:middle line:84%
are according to balance
and proportion and harmony

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.070 align:middle line:90%
and beauty.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.220 align:middle line:10%
And so they are naturally going
to emit this energy of harmony.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And when we then absorb
that energy of harmony,

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.610 align:middle line:84%
it helps us to
entrain or to come

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.660 align:middle line:84%
into a sympathetic
resonance with that harmony.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.760 align:middle line:84%
It's very stable
vibrational energy.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And it just keeps putting
out its frequencies.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.690 align:middle line:84%
Whereas us, we have a
broad range of frequencies

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.220 align:middle line:90%
that we can vibrate at.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.020 align:middle line:90%
And we're constantly in flux.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.070 align:middle line:90%
Humans are constantly changing.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And so when our energy comes
into connection with a crystal,

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.870 align:middle line:84%
the crystal's
actually going to be

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.240 align:middle line:90%
the more stable form of energy.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And it would actually
take a lot of energy

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.820 align:middle line:84%
to try and shift the
crystal structure.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.352 align:middle line:84%
And our energy is not going
to be able to do that.

00:02:23.352 --> 00:02:24.810 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, the
crystal structure

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.320 align:middle line:84%
is so stable and so
strong in its frequency

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.830 align:middle line:84%
that it just keeps putting out
continuously that that then

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.570 align:middle line:90%
is absorbed by us.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And we then will start
to entrain and come

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.400 align:middle line:84%
into phase with that
crystal's vibration

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.620 align:middle line:84%
according to where it
is placed on the body.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.840 align:middle line:10%
>> When we are
healing with crystals,

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.600 align:middle line:10%
we are essentially
working with energy.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.520 align:middle line:10%
What a crystal does is transform
and transmute every single kind

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.140 align:middle line:10%
of energy that permeates it.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Thus, the crystal
practitioner is

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.020 align:middle line:84%
looking at focusing precise
and specific forms of energy

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.700 align:middle line:90%
through the crystal.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.540 align:middle line:84%
To either amplify or
transform these energies,

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.510 align:middle line:84%
to help and to heal,
to be able to work

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.790 align:middle line:84%
with the energy of
crystals and understand

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.400 align:middle line:84%
how they can be
used, we need thus

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.680 align:middle line:90%
to understand how energy works.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Crystal healing is a healing
modality that works directly

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.150 align:middle line:84%
with the light, color, beauty,
and perfect geometric forms.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.370 align:middle line:10%
The mineral kingdom
assists us in balancing

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.410 align:middle line:10%
all aspects of our being.

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.570 align:middle line:10%
The presence of
crystals on the body

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.950 align:middle line:10%
positively influences the
human electromagnetic field,

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.480 align:middle line:10%
activates the chakras or energy
centers, the nervous system,

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.830 align:middle line:10%
and stimulates the
corresponding endocrine glands.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.250 align:middle line:84%
The body naturally attunes
to the crystalline vibration

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.920 align:middle line:84%
and frequency, which
in turn amplifies

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.500 align:middle line:84%
the senses and the
opening of portals

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.414 align:middle line:84%
to access multi-dimensional
fields of knowing and being.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.460 align:middle line:84%
>> First of all,
crystals are transducers.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.940 align:middle line:84%
Now a transducer is something
that takes one form of energy

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.350 align:middle line:84%
and converts it into
another form of energy.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.150 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing technology.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.940 align:middle line:84%
If you think about
that principle

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.670 align:middle line:84%
and you apply it to the way
that the quartz crystal can

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.570 align:middle line:84%
take light, visible
light, from our sun

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.330 align:middle line:84%
and convert that
into forms of energy,

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.750 align:middle line:84%
that can be absorbed
bioelectrically

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.850 align:middle line:84%
and that can be
absorbed into the organs

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.635 align:middle line:84%
and the tissues of our bodies
without any other technology

00:04:34.635 --> 00:04:35.435 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:04:35.435 --> 00:04:38.030 align:middle line:90%


00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Specific energies work
through different frequencies.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.930 align:middle line:84%
One way of understanding
this is through the study

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.350 align:middle line:84%
of sound and music
and its frequencies.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.440 align:middle line:84%
Another way that is
closer to crystal work

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.290 align:middle line:84%
is through the teachings
on the color spectrum.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.160 align:middle line:84%
The color that a crystal
manifests is one of the aspects

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.560 align:middle line:90%
that it orients its energy.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.400 align:middle line:84%
A red crystal does not work the
same way as a violet crystal.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.910 align:middle line:84%
Also, we have an understanding
that everything in the world

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.390 align:middle line:84%
is governed by the elements,
which are the basic building

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.850 align:middle line:90%
blocks of the world.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.700 align:middle line:84%
We are talking here of the
fundamental five elements

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.070 align:middle line:84%
theory that exists
in many traditions

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.040 align:middle line:84%
and also in the Native
American tradition.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.960 align:middle line:84%
In our elements theory, we
have wind, water, fire, earth,

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.390 align:middle line:90%
and the sacred sound.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.140 align:middle line:10%
So understanding the
frequencies of sound, color,

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.320 align:middle line:10%
and the elements, we are
thus able to understand

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.080 align:middle line:10%
how energy work and
use this understanding

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.530 align:middle line:10%
to channel the right kind of
energy through the crystal

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.390 align:middle line:10%
to help and to heal.

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:48.560 align:middle line:84%
This takes years of training and
practice and cannot be conveyed

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.210 align:middle line:90%
in a few words.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.390 align:middle line:10%
A good example of this training
is the traditional Cherokee

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:54.320 align:middle line:10%
training.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.510 align:middle line:84%
When a young person,
a child, displays

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:57.920 align:middle line:90%
what we call the gift--

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.400 align:middle line:84%
that is the right disposition
to become a crystal healer--

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.580 align:middle line:84%
they will undergo 11
to 12 years of training

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.850 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual practice before
they even touch a crystal.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.650 align:middle line:84%
>> The art of laying on of
stones or crystal healing is

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.800 align:middle line:84%
one of the most effective
methods of cleansing the aura,

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.680 align:middle line:84%
releasing suppressed
emotions, traumas,

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.530 align:middle line:84%
and connecting a person
with their own inner truth

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:26.910 align:middle line:90%
and power.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.750 align:middle line:84%
Crystals and stones assist us
in a self-empowering process

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.360 align:middle line:84%
by increasing the
amount of light present

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.790 align:middle line:84%
in the aura, which
stimulates and activates

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:40.200 align:middle line:84%
the more powerful but
subtle realms of being.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.660 align:middle line:84%
Crystals will also
mirror the subconscious,

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.690 align:middle line:84%
highlight an emotion that
is ready to be purified,

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:49.410 align:middle line:84%
or reveal a mental
construct that is outdated.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:52.440 align:middle line:84%
Together with proper
therapeutic techniques applied,

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.000 align:middle line:84%
there is a
possibility of healing

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.880 align:middle line:84%
on all physical, emotional,
mental, and spiritual planes,

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.710 align:middle line:84%
which makes crystal healing
an advanced healing art.

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Since the Chinese have been
working with stones for so long

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.610 align:middle line:10%
and recording their
information for so long,

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.250 align:middle line:10%
much of the early
information is empirical.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.320 align:middle line:10%
That is, they
learned what worked

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.180 align:middle line:10%
and what didn't work
through their experience

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.790 align:middle line:10%
and observations.

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Their explanations
for why things work

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.640 align:middle line:84%
is thoroughly grounded in
their very cohesive philosophy

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.550 align:middle line:84%
of life and their very
subtle understanding

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.530 align:middle line:90%
of how energy functions.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:35.280 align:middle line:84%
In China's first Materia
medica written down

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.250 align:middle line:84%
around the year
220, understanding

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:41.820 align:middle line:84%
of the use of stones and herbs
was sufficiently sophisticated

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:45.660 align:middle line:84%
that they were categorized as
upper grade, substances used

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.900 align:middle line:84%
to support and nourish
life, middle grade,

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.600 align:middle line:84%
substances to help maintain
a life without disease,

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:57.300 align:middle line:84%
and lower grade for use when
there is actual illness.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.540 align:middle line:84%
Some of the stones included
in the upper grade category

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:06.090 align:middle line:84%
are jade, azurite, fluorite,
quartz crystals, and mica.

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Middle grade stones included
stalactite, magnetite, gypsum,

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.410 align:middle line:90%
sulfur, and feldspar.

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And lower grade stones
included malachite, hematite,

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:18.630 align:middle line:90%
and according to some, agate.

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:21.290 align:middle line:90%


00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:23.480 align:middle line:90%
>> We are 70% water.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:27.350 align:middle line:84%
The water is based on a
tetrahedral structure, two

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:30.601 align:middle line:84%
hydrogens and one oxygen.
So at the very foundation,

00:08:30.601 --> 00:08:32.809 align:middle line:84%
where they're talking about
the DNA or the foundation

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:34.700 align:middle line:84%
of our cells,
liquid in our cells,

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.200 align:middle line:90%
we are crystalline in nature.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.159 align:middle line:90%
Our blood is crystal.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:38.450 align:middle line:90%
And our bone is crystal.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And the energy
centers that make up

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:43.429 align:middle line:84%
the chakra centers, the
energy centers of the body,

00:08:43.429 --> 00:08:46.340 align:middle line:84%
are based upon
crystalline structures.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:50.390 align:middle line:84%
When we begin to take all of
these ideas into consideration,

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:55.100 align:middle line:84%
it becomes clear how you
could take a specific crystal

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:59.480 align:middle line:84%
of a specific symmetry
and the specific geometry,

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:03.980 align:middle line:84%
and how that crystal may relate
to a crystalline substance

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.500 align:middle line:84%
in the human body that
have a similar symmetry

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.840 align:middle line:90%
and a similar geometry.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:13.130 align:middle line:84%
From my perspective, I think
the significance of crystals

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:15.680 align:middle line:84%
in healing is that
we may use a crystal

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:20.300 align:middle line:84%
as a point of reference,
a reference for what

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:25.790 align:middle line:84%
the cells in our bodies may be
vibrating at, at an optimal,

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:29.990 align:middle line:84%
in an optimal condition and
through our trauma in life,

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:31.520 align:middle line:90%
through the stress of life--

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.190 align:middle line:84%
and who doesn't have
stress in the world today?

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:37.610 align:middle line:84%
Ultraviolet radiation,
electromagnetic radiation

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:40.830 align:middle line:84%
through environmental toxins,
through toxic thoughts,

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.460 align:middle line:84%
feelings, emotions, beliefs,
through human trauma

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:46.020 align:middle line:84%
that we all have, it
begins to make sense

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.800 align:middle line:84%
how we could use another
crystalline structure that

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.740 align:middle line:84%
has not undergone
that trauma and place

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.530 align:middle line:84%
it close to the body as
a point of reference.

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And our body, through
what is called resonance,

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:01.040 align:middle line:84%
our body will sink
into resonance

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.380 align:middle line:90%
with that external structure.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:06.360 align:middle line:84%
So we become more
aligned once again.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that, we
call that good health.

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:14.520 align:middle line:84%
>> First, I want to say that
relative to other healing

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.940 align:middle line:84%
substances, stone
medicine is slow.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:22.170 align:middle line:84%
In their density, stones
themselves vibrate very slowly.

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:24.540 align:middle line:84%
Their slow rate of
vibration causes

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:28.230 align:middle line:84%
stones to resonate, especially
with very deep aspects

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.150 align:middle line:90%
of our bodies and minds.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:32.940 align:middle line:84%
It takes time for us
to feel their effects,

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:36.270 align:middle line:84%
because we have to be able
to go as deeply as they

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.280 align:middle line:90%
are capable of going.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.520 align:middle line:84%
If we accept that we
are energetic bodies

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.650 align:middle line:84%
and that everything
in existence has

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:46.140 align:middle line:84%
its own energetic
signature, it's

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:49.260 align:middle line:84%
not hard to understand that
we are affected energetically

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.050 align:middle line:84%
by pretty much
everything we encounter.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.420 align:middle line:84%
Whenever something
that is not me

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.640 align:middle line:84%
comes into my
sphere of awareness,

00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:00.030 align:middle line:84%
many subtle messages
occur within my body.

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:03.310 align:middle line:84%
Is this not me
helpful or harmful?

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:06.270 align:middle line:84%
Do I want to absorb
it and make it me,

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:09.210 align:middle line:84%
or mobilize my immune
system to fight it off?

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.360 align:middle line:84%
It's not me, and I want
to keep it that way.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.000 align:middle line:84%
When we're using stones
to touch the skin,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.730 align:middle line:84%
the body responds to
the energetic messages

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:20.820 align:middle line:84%
coming from the chemical
composition, the weight

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.740 align:middle line:90%
and density of the stone.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:24.450 align:middle line:84%
But what if you're
wearing a pendant

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:25.950 align:middle line:90%
on top of your clothing?

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.260 align:middle line:84%
Even still, the
cells in your body

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.050 align:middle line:90%
are constantly emitting photons.

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:34.530 align:middle line:84%
Your body's light interacts
with the structure of the stone,

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:37.780 align:middle line:84%
joining with the light
coming from outside the body,

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:40.620 align:middle line:84%
hitting the stone, bouncing
around inside the stone's

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.060 align:middle line:90%
geometric structure.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:45.510 align:middle line:84%
When the newly shaped energy
interacts with our own body's

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:48.360 align:middle line:90%
energy, we are affected by it.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.000 align:middle line:84%
When we ingest stone
water or elixirs,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.360 align:middle line:84%
we're absorbing these qualities
at a deeper level of anatomy.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.120 align:middle line:90%
We're digesting them.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Crystals aren't just useful
when it comes to physical

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:03.180 align:middle line:84%
healing, they are also known
to be allies when it comes

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:06.750 align:middle line:84%
to transforming
psycho-spiritual dynamics.

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Not so much in terms of actually
changing someone's behavior,

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.410 align:middle line:84%
but more in terms of
behavioral illumination,

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:16.020 align:middle line:90%
becoming aware of one's actions.

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:18.450 align:middle line:84%
Behavioral illumination
allows someone

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:20.940 align:middle line:84%
to confront the source
of their patterns.

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.970 align:middle line:84%
This loosens karmic
bonds and helps

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:28.410 align:middle line:84%
people to break through
unconscious patterns.

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:30.900 align:middle line:84%
>> When we place
crystals on our bodies,

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:34.650 align:middle line:84%
our parasympathetic nervous
system gets activated.

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:36.390 align:middle line:90%
We relax.

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And as we enter into
our inner landscape,

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.490 align:middle line:84%
we create more
space within to be

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.700 align:middle line:84%
able to witness the shadows
that are blocking us

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:48.120 align:middle line:84%
and are waiting to be
released and dispersed.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.870 align:middle line:84%
Often, all we need to do
is notice their presence,

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:56.700 align:middle line:84%
feel the pain, the shame,
the regrets, the fear.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And as we generously
give ourselves the space

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:03.660 align:middle line:84%
to let these shadows arise,
I as a facilitator of healing

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:08.910 align:middle line:84%
empower, the receiver, you,
to release and let it go.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:11.960 align:middle line:84%
This letting go happens once
we realize it is there--

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.270 align:middle line:84%
discovering the
root cause of it,

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:17.270 align:middle line:84%
allowing vulnerability
and self-compassion

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:20.450 align:middle line:84%
and sacred presence
to witness, and then

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:23.810 align:middle line:84%
choosing to release
it once and for all.

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Vedic Gemology really
is a form of therapy.

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:30.500 align:middle line:10%
Gems can be used to help us
master these lessons that we

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.570 align:middle line:10%
are here to learn
on this planet.

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:35.480 align:middle line:10%
If we get stuck and
out of alignment

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:39.510 align:middle line:10%
with our true calling, gems
can help us get unstuck.

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:42.500 align:middle line:84%
But we must consciously
participate in

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.590 align:middle line:84%
and work with the effects
of these gemstones.

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:48.620 align:middle line:84%
If we're out of alignment
with our life purpose

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:51.260 align:middle line:84%
and we're putting on a gem
to try to target that life

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.080 align:middle line:84%
purpose, if we're
in our own way,

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.630 align:middle line:84%
gems will make that
painstakingly clear

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:58.430 align:middle line:84%
until we make these
changes that we really

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:00.800 align:middle line:90%
need to make for ourselves.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm careful to only
work with people

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:06.710 align:middle line:84%
who show that they're
ready to grow and evolve

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:12.380 align:middle line:84%
and to be accountable
and to self-reflect.

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:15.930 align:middle line:84%
Astrological gemstones need
to be properly prescribed.

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:18.740 align:middle line:84%
We need to look at the
wearer's astrological chart

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:20.630 align:middle line:84%
to determine which
gemstones are going

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:22.070 align:middle line:90%
to be best for them to wear.

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:25.630 align:middle line:84%
Not all of our planets are
necessarily good or supportive

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:26.430 align:middle line:90%
for us.

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:28.820 align:middle line:84%
So not all planetary
gemstones are

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:31.820 align:middle line:90%
going to work for everybody.

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:34.100 align:middle line:84%
>> When we start
working with stones,

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:39.450 align:middle line:84%
the Chinese speak of
entering the stone gate.

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And they specify
three methods of use--

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:46.040 align:middle line:84%
topical, internal,
and intentional.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Topical application
includes placing stones

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:53.030 align:middle line:84%
on points or areas of the
body or wearing jewelry

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:54.650 align:middle line:90%
to touch the skin.

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:58.010 align:middle line:84%
The internal method includes
drinking elixirs or waters

00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:01.310 align:middle line:84%
infused with the properties
of an individual stone

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:05.600 align:middle line:84%
or a combination of several
stones for a balanced formula.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.600 align:middle line:84%
The intentional method
includes wearing jewelry

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.710 align:middle line:84%
for a particular purpose,
in particular to support

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:16.280 align:middle line:84%
or transform our
constitutional natures.

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.530 align:middle line:84%
The method also
includes placing stones

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:20.180 align:middle line:84%
in certain parts
of our environment

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:23.390 align:middle line:84%
to support a healthy
harmonious movement of energy

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:25.640 align:middle line:84%
and to remind us of
qualities that we want

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:29.610 align:middle line:90%
to prioritize in our lives.

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Crystals teach us that
instead of burying or avoiding

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:36.840 align:middle line:84%
what does not feel good, to
actually engage the pain,

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:42.150 align:middle line:84%
to feel the drama and breathe
through it breath by breath.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:46.110 align:middle line:10%
That way, we alchemize the
emotions, keep it moving.

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:49.740 align:middle line:10%
So it doesn't get lodged in the
body to manifest into a denser

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:51.090 align:middle line:10%
form like a tumor.

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:53.280 align:middle line:84%
It's important to
move that energy,

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:58.650 align:middle line:84%
pick ourselves up, and resume
our step towards the light.

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:00.510 align:middle line:84%
>>We've also noticed
that gems begin

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:03.240 align:middle line:84%
working for people almost
as soon as they're purchased

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.740 align:middle line:90%
before they're even worn.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.260 align:middle line:84%
It seems that the
intention to wear the stone

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.980 align:middle line:84%
or to commit to it will begin
to change the course of karma

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:13.635 align:middle line:90%
almost right away.

00:16:13.635 --> 00:16:16.930 align:middle line:84%
We had a lady recently get a
Venus gemstone for herself.

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:18.780 align:middle line:84%
She was a medical
professional suffering

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.460 align:middle line:90%
from burnout and exhaustion.

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And she wanted a little bit
more support in her life.

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:24.750 align:middle line:84%
This was a really
big purchase for her.

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.700 align:middle line:84%
She was nervous about
making the investment.

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.710 align:middle line:84%
But she felt more confident
when we matched her

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:29.850 align:middle line:90%
to the right gem.

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:31.830 align:middle line:84%
We were setting it
into jewelry for her.

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:33.810 align:middle line:84%
She hadn't received
the stone yet,

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:36.780 align:middle line:84%
when a couple of days later,
she got called into a meeting

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:38.850 align:middle line:90%
with her supervisors.

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:41.350 align:middle line:84%
She was scared that this was
going to be a critical meeting.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:43.350 align:middle line:84%
But as it turns out,
they wanted to let

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:45.240 align:middle line:84%
her know how incredible
and wonderful

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.620 align:middle line:90%
and supported she was.

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And out of the blue, they
wrote her a bonus check

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:53.790 align:middle line:84%
that she was not anticipating
for almost the exact cost

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:57.680 align:middle line:84%
of the gemstone that
she had purchased.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Of course, the first crystal
with which we work is cleaning,

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:05.510 align:middle line:84%
polishing, and
purifying ourselves.

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:08.930 align:middle line:84%
Before any healing work
with crystals can commence,

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:12.680 align:middle line:84%
there must be
spiritual preparation.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.319 align:middle line:10%
There are two
other preliminaries

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:17.290 align:middle line:10%
to convey in the art of
healing with crystals.

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:19.660 align:middle line:10%
The second preliminary
is you need

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:24.520 align:middle line:10%
to cultivate respect for
crystals as living sentient

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.109 align:middle line:10%
beings.

00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:29.080 align:middle line:84%
So crystals are
multi-dimensional beings.

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And a crystal practitioner
who understands

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:34.990 align:middle line:84%
the living nature of crystals
does not use the crystal.

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:37.760 align:middle line:90%
They work with the crystal.

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.520 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
second preliminary--

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.440 align:middle line:90%
having respect for the crystal.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:46.120 align:middle line:84%
The third preliminary is
respect for Mother Earth.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:48.730 align:middle line:84%
Crystals are very intimate
part of Mother Earth.

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:51.280 align:middle line:84%
They channel her
energy meridians.

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And huge deposits of crystalline
substance in the Earth body

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:59.860 align:middle line:84%
are her energy centers,
what you would call chakras.

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:02.230 align:middle line:84%
With these crystals,
she communicates

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:05.560 align:middle line:84%
with the other planets and the
sun and other celestial beings,

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.260 align:middle line:84%
because they're
also living beings.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.300 align:middle line:10%
A crystal healing
practitioner needs

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:14.200 align:middle line:10%
to be aware of our place
in the Earth's biosystem

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:18.920 align:middle line:10%
and our responsibility
to the Earth.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.740 align:middle line:10%
>> The law of signature is
another model that is important

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:24.740 align:middle line:10%
in Chinese medicine to help
understand the qualities of all

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:27.020 align:middle line:10%
the various substances
used for healing.

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:30.050 align:middle line:84%
With regard to the healing
dynamics of stones,

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:33.350 align:middle line:84%
it is particularly important
to know how a stone was formed

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:35.870 align:middle line:90%
and at what level of the Earth.

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:37.490 align:middle line:84%
The level of the
Earth translates

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:39.530 align:middle line:84%
to the level of our
bodies where the stone

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:41.300 align:middle line:90%
has the most affinity.

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:44.250 align:middle line:84%
Softness and hardness
are also important.

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:47.330 align:middle line:84%
A hard stone can strengthen
us for life's challenges,

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.460 align:middle line:90%
that could be aquamarine.

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:53.720 align:middle line:84%
A soft stone, maybe calcite,
can make us more resilient.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.030 align:middle line:84%
Many red stones
affect the blood.

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:59.300 align:middle line:84%
They're often red because of
iron content, which resonates

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:00.440 align:middle line:90%
with the iron in our blood.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.110 align:middle line:90%


00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:08.150 align:middle line:10%
>> Astrological gemstones
possess and transmit a potent

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:12.140 align:middle line:10%
form of energy that can affect
the wearer and their entire

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:13.250 align:middle line:10%
reality.

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:16.310 align:middle line:84%
They connect us to a
divine form of intelligence

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:19.850 align:middle line:84%
that governs the entire
world and probably

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:21.920 align:middle line:90%
the entire universe.

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:26.060 align:middle line:84%
The light and color frequencies
within certain gemstones

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:30.080 align:middle line:84%
vibrate at a very specific
harmonic resonance.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:33.890 align:middle line:84%
This resonance, when it's
compatible with the wearer,

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:39.020 align:middle line:84%
can enhance and purify the
entire human energy system.

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:42.830 align:middle line:84%
Our most supportive planets
from an astrological perspective

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:45.660 align:middle line:84%
influence the most
positive part of our lives.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And that is what
we want to channel

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:51.820 align:middle line:90%
with astrological gemstones.

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:55.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Crystal healing therapy works
because the crystals are going

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:57.350 align:middle line:90%
to respond to our body.

00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:00.190 align:middle line:10%
They're also going to
respond to our biofield.

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:04.700 align:middle line:10%
And then they will put their
own energy response back out.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a
two-way communication

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.520 align:middle line:84%
that happens between
us and the crystal

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.340 align:middle line:90%
through vibrational energy.

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:16.300 align:middle line:84%
>> We're living a rare
convergence of natural rhythms

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.820 align:middle line:84%
and cycles in human history,
unlike anything we've seen

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:22.420 align:middle line:84%
in 5,000 years of
recorded human history.

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:26.500 align:middle line:10%
Crystals are a tool
for us to become

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:27.970 align:middle line:10%
the best version of ourselves.

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:32.770 align:middle line:10%
They are tools for us to
attune our physical biology.

00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:35.980 align:middle line:84%
So crystals can be
tremendous allies for us

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:39.220 align:middle line:84%
in our lives at this pivotal
moment in human history

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.320 align:middle line:84%
when we're all being
challenged to become

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.030 align:middle line:84%
the best version of
ourselves and create

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:44.050 align:middle line:90%
the best world possible.

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:46.610 align:middle line:90%


00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:50.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Crystal healing has
been around for centuries.

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:54.680 align:middle line:84%
Shamans, alchemists, and those
who could hear and receive

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:57.080 align:middle line:84%
the language of
nature were called

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.780 align:middle line:84%
by the mineral kingdom
itself to be instructed

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:02.330 align:middle line:90%
into its use and properties.

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Longstanding traditions have
experimented, passed on,

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:09.980 align:middle line:84%
reported, and proven their
abilities over many generations

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:12.320 align:middle line:84%
and continue to
utilize their healing

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:16.880 align:middle line:84%
powers through their holistic
medical systems to this day.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:20.550 align:middle line:84%
As crystals abundantly
return into the hands of us,

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:23.060 align:middle line:84%
the people, may
we tune into them

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:26.120 align:middle line:84%
and superpower them with
our will and our intention

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:30.560 align:middle line:84%
to heal ourselves, each
other, and our world.

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:35.110 align:middle line:90%
