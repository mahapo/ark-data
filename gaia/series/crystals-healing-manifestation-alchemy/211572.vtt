>> Alchemy is an
ancient occult science,

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.360 align:middle line:84%
a seemingly magical process of
transformation that takes one

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.090 align:middle line:90%
thing and turns it into another.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.300 align:middle line:84%
Crystal alchemy means
to transmute something,

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.630 align:middle line:84%
whether it be physical,
mental, emotional,

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.520 align:middle line:84%
or spiritual into something else
through the use of crystals.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.600 align:middle line:84%
Drinking a gem elixir is one
of the prime alchemical ways

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.260 align:middle line:84%
to facilitate profound
vibrational healing by means

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.870 align:middle line:90%
of the mineral kingdom.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.980 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we'll learn how
to make gem elixirs according

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.270 align:middle line:84%
to two different traditions, how
to choose the correct crystals

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.650 align:middle line:84%
to concoct them with, and
how and why gem elixirs help

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.470 align:middle line:84%
us transform ourselves
from the inside out,

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.410 align:middle line:84%
so that we can become the
magicians of our inner

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.460 align:middle line:90%
and outer worlds.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Crystal alchemy is the use of
stones and crystals to help us

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.400 align:middle line:10%
transform ourselves.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.130 align:middle line:84%
They can be used
internally as an elixir,

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.920 align:middle line:84%
or externally as
jewelry, or as stones

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.700 align:middle line:84%
to hold during meditation
to help with the process.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.170 align:middle line:84%
As we age, our priorities change
and different issues arise.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.210 align:middle line:84%
When we're challenged
by the changes

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.270 align:middle line:84%
we become aware of new
rough edges or old ones that

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.190 align:middle line:90%
haven't been polished off yet.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.370 align:middle line:84%
Working with stones can
help us shed old patterns

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.430 align:middle line:84%
and become clearer, more
conscious and present,

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.485 align:middle line:84%
and bring more
integrity to our being.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Crystal alchemy is when we
are trying to draw the essence

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.850 align:middle line:10%
out of the mineral kingdom and
using the crystals to raise

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.260 align:middle line:10%
our own vibration, and there are
a variety of ways that we can

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.420 align:middle line:10%
apply the crystal alchemy.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.410 align:middle line:10%
One example of crystal
alchemy is gem elixirs.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.510 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, a gem elixir
is a vibrational healing kind

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.630 align:middle line:84%
of remedy, almost like
a homeopathic, where

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.940 align:middle line:84%
you would take distilled
water-- the thing about water

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.570 align:middle line:84%
is that it has an amazing
capacity for memory.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And when it's a
distilled water, it

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.230 align:middle line:84%
holds no real signature or
information in and of itself.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.150 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like a blank slate.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And whatever we put into
that distilled water,

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.630 align:middle line:84%
it will then take on the
vibrational signatures

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:41.470 align:middle line:90%
of that thing.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.200 align:middle line:84%
So when you put crystals
into the distilled water,

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.360 align:middle line:84%
the water will kind of
take on the vibration

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.740 align:middle line:90%
of that particular crystal.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.980 align:middle line:90%

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>> A very powerful and efficient
way to use crystals to help

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.280 align:middle line:84%
and to heal is in the
form of crystal essences.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.220 align:middle line:84%
This is where we take
pure water and infuse

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.220 align:middle line:84%
the energy and specific
programming of a crystal

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.660 align:middle line:90%
into the water.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.260 align:middle line:84%
As water has memory
and can adopt and hold

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.930 align:middle line:84%
that information, it
will retain the energy

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.690 align:middle line:84%
of the specific crystal
friend that we have

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.540 align:middle line:90%
put into it and the intention.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.300 align:middle line:84%
When we take this
water internally,

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.620 align:middle line:84%
it will affect your body and
your physiology very rapidly--

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.880 align:middle line:90%
within 20 minutes.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.450 align:middle line:84%
It's a bit like the way
homeopathic remedies work.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.420 align:middle line:84%
There are only minute,
undetectable amounts

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.230 align:middle line:84%
of any material in a
homeopathic remedy.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.870 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, in a
crystal essence, there

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.870 align:middle line:84%
is only the presence of
vibration and frequency.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.170 align:middle line:90%

>> When someone ingests either
a gem elixir, or really,

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.730 align:middle line:84%
any alchemical kind of remedy,
whether it's from the mineral

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.690 align:middle line:84%
kingdom or the plant kingdom,
it's going to work with

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.620 align:middle line:84%
vibrational energy to
influence their consciousness.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.960 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes to
something like a gem elixir,

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.360 align:middle line:84%
especially when it's
in distilled water,

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.153 align:middle line:84%
and it's just the
vibrational signal being

00:04:09.153 --> 00:04:10.570 align:middle line:84%
held in that
distilled water, it's

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.330 align:middle line:84%
going to very much work
like a homeopathic.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.430 align:middle line:90%
So we take some of it in.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.850 align:middle line:84%
We hold it in our mouth
for just a little bit.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And we kind of meditate
with it for a moment

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.070 align:middle line:84%
and just allow that
vibrational energy

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.970 align:middle line:84%
to be transferred from
the gem elixir into us.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And when you're meditating
and present with that process,

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:32.620 align:middle line:90%
it can--

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.960 align:middle line:84%
you'll feel the subtle energies
of how it is affecting you.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.680 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes a gem elixir can
also be sprayed in the aura,

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.760 align:middle line:84%
and it'll kind of support
the energetic field

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.530 align:middle line:90%
versus the physical.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.490 align:middle line:84%
But it's all going to work
through vibrational energy.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes to any kind
of work with homeopathics,

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.390 align:middle line:84%
you want to make sure that
it's on an empty stomach,

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:04.040 align:middle line:84%
that you're not having other
energetic signatures from food

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.860 align:middle line:84%
or coffee or any alcohol,
any of these types of things.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.830 align:middle line:84%
You don't want it interfering
with the subtle energy that

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.755 align:middle line:84%
is transferred from
that gem elixir.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.850 align:middle line:84%
>> When we drink water or
elixirs that contain stones,

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.850 align:middle line:84%
we are ingesting the
essence of the stone.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.270 align:middle line:84%
That essence includes the
stone's chemical composition,

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.550 align:middle line:90%
color, and crystal structure.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.540 align:middle line:84%
It also includes its ability to
absorb and refract or reflect

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.620 align:middle line:84%
light, its softness or
hardness, its density.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.320 align:middle line:84%
All of these aspects of
the essence of the stone

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.370 align:middle line:90%
are important.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.800 align:middle line:84%
But when we take something
into our own bodies,

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.470 align:middle line:84%
we must be especially
aware of safety.

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.650 align:middle line:84%
Of these factors, chemical
composition and hardness

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.610 align:middle line:84%
are very important when
making stone water or elixirs.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.880 align:middle line:84%
The standard for identifying
the hardness of a stone

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.600 align:middle line:84%
is called the Mohs scale
which assigns numbers,

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.700 align:middle line:84%
starting with the
softest stone, talc,

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.720 align:middle line:84%
as 1, and ending
with diamond as 10.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.000 align:middle line:84%
For purposes of
elixirs and waters,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.010 align:middle line:84%
I become mindful
of chemistry when

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:16.240 align:middle line:84%
I use any stone with a
hardness of less than 7.5.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.600 align:middle line:84%
A relatively soft stone can very
slowly dissolve into the water,

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.510 align:middle line:84%
so we really need to know
the stone's chemistry.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.510 align:middle line:84%
Some soft stones are
completely safe chemically,

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:27.830 align:middle line:90%
such as calcite.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.970 align:middle line:84%
It is calcium carbonate,
and it has a hardness of 3.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.150 align:middle line:84%
Others, for example,
scolecite, contains aluminum,

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.030 align:middle line:84%
and it's given a
hardness of 5.5.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.850 align:middle line:84%
If we're concerned about
heavy metal toxicity,

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.220 align:middle line:84%
we can place the
scolecite with a quartz

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.650 align:middle line:90%
crystal for at least 24 hours.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.710 align:middle line:84%
The quartz takes on the
qualities of the scolecite.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.990 align:middle line:84%
We call this
potentiating the quartz,

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.855 align:middle line:84%
and it's completely safe
to put it into an elixir.

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.310 align:middle line:90%
substances into the water.

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:12.930 align:middle line:84%
Also, you want to avoid making
essences with coral, malachite,

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.830 align:middle line:84%
and turquoise, as they don't
have a crystalline structure,

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.040 align:middle line:84%
and thus, will not
hold any programming.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.680 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have the specific
crystal with which you

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.900 align:middle line:84%
want to make an essence,
it doesn't matter.

You don't have to have
a problem with that.

If example, you want to
make an emerald essence

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.990 align:middle line:84%
but you don't have an emerald,
take a clear quartz crystal,

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.280 align:middle line:84%
first program it as an
emerald, and then reprogram it

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.380 align:middle line:84%
a second time with your
specific intentions

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.150 align:middle line:84%
for which you're
doing that essence.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.970 align:middle line:84%
In this way, you are
sending true programs

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.625 align:middle line:84%
into the clear quartz crystal,
and it will hold them both.

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:43.750 align:middle line:84%
would only make him sick,
go mad, or just die.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:46.570 align:middle line:84%
For the Daoists, the goal
of alchemical practice

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:48.880 align:middle line:84%
was to go through a process
that would ultimately

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:53.470 align:middle line:84%
lead to a total transformation
of their relationship to life.

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:57.245 align:middle line:84%
It was a heroic, incredibly
difficult process.

00:08:57.245 --> 00:08:59.890 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:02.260 align:middle line:84%
For the purpose of
modern westerners,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.810 align:middle line:84%
there is a group of
stones that exemplifies

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.960 align:middle line:84%
the alchemical process,
and they are totally safe.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.140 align:middle line:84%
In Western mineralogy,
they are termed chalcedony.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:14.260 align:middle line:84%
But in Chinese thinking,
they are the agates, jaspers,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.610 align:middle line:90%
and chalcedonies.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:19.670 align:middle line:84%
The alchemical practice
has specific stages.

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:21.680 align:middle line:90%
First, there is initiation.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.710 align:middle line:84%
We realize there is a
problem in our life.

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Some spark of inspiration
comes, whether from a book

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:31.220 align:middle line:84%
or a teacher, that
causes us to commit

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:35.030 align:middle line:84%
to the formidable discipline
to really want to change.

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:37.940 align:middle line:84%
We become aware of all
the ways we hurt ourselves

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.520 align:middle line:84%
with our habits of
food or exercise,

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.280 align:middle line:84%
with our habits of
thinking and beliefs,

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.500 align:middle line:90%
with our habits of relationship.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.170 align:middle line:84%
This process is called the
separation of the clear

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:49.970 align:middle line:90%
from the turbid.

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:51.770 align:middle line:90%
Agates show us this process.

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:55.130 align:middle line:84%
They have bands or
specks or other patterns

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:58.070 align:middle line:84%
showing how different minerals
have separated themselves

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:00.030 align:middle line:90%
from the others.

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:03.630 align:middle line:84%
As we do this separation,
we find areas of blockage.

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:06.540 align:middle line:84%
We just can't let go
of a particular habit.

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.120 align:middle line:90%
We have to purify it out of us.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.360 align:middle line:84%
For this part of the
process, we can use jasper.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.340 align:middle line:84%
From the Chinese
point of view, jasper

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:17.490 align:middle line:84%
is a single, strong
color, and it is opaque.

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:20.790 align:middle line:84%
Choosing a color that represents
the area of difficulty,

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:24.450 align:middle line:84%
we place the stone, hold it,
or make an elixir from it.

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Purification takes a
long time, and things

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.680 align:middle line:90%
change along the way.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.890 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, jasper offers
us choices along the way.

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:34.650 align:middle line:84%
We can use red,
yellow, green, brown

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:39.210 align:middle line:84%
to help us clear out all the
various blockages we encounter.

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:41.520 align:middle line:84%
When we're cleared
out of everything,

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.280 align:middle line:84%
it's time for refinement
and stability.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.440 align:middle line:84%
It's all well and
good to do this work

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.800 align:middle line:84%
in the privacy of your
home, your meditation space.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.900 align:middle line:84%
But then you go into
the world, and what

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.510 align:middle line:84%
you thought was a stability
of your refinement

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:55.950 align:middle line:90%
flies out the window.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:57.930 align:middle line:90%
It's time for more work.

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:00.150 align:middle line:90%
Now, we use the chalcedonies.

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:04.380 align:middle line:84%
These are also single color
stones, no bands or specks,

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.480 align:middle line:90%
and are slightly translucent.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Again, we have a
variety of colors.

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:12.030 align:middle line:84%
There's carnelian, which is
red or orange chalcedony.

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:14.130 align:middle line:84%
There's blue or
white chalcedony.

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.830 align:middle line:84%
Green chalcedony is
called chrysoprase.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:18.630 align:middle line:90%
There's pink chalcedony.

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:21.150 align:middle line:84%
So we have choices
to work with as we

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:23.580 align:middle line:84%
change our focus for
ever-deepening refinement

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:24.780 align:middle line:90%
of our characters.

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:27.150 align:middle line:84%
Finally, we are
complete in the process.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:29.840 align:middle line:90%


00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.200 align:middle line:84%
Jade is the stone that the
Chinese revered the most,

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.290 align:middle line:84%
and it is jade that they use
to bring their completion

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:37.550 align:middle line:90%
into the world.

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.680 align:middle line:84%
They had gained
tremendous wisdom

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.530 align:middle line:84%
during their process of
purification and refinement.

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:45.830 align:middle line:84%
They had a duty to share
that wisdom with the world.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.480 align:middle line:90%
Again, we have colors--

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.690 align:middle line:84%
green for righteousness,
lavender for integrity

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:53.720 align:middle line:84%
and compassion,
yellow for loyalty,

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:58.610 align:middle line:84%
white for devotion and
purity, and black for wisdom.

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>> The method of creating gem
elixirs or crystal essences

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:05.210 align:middle line:84%
depends on which
tradition you follow.

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:08.810 align:middle line:84%
Here is an example of creating
a gem elixir according

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:11.390 align:middle line:84%
to the Native
American tradition.

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:14.810 align:middle line:84%
>> So today we're going to
give you a demonstration of how

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:16.730 align:middle line:90%
to make crystal essences.

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:19.280 align:middle line:84%
The material you
need is pure water.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.450 align:middle line:84%
You need clear, glass bowls
that have no design on the bowls

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:26.150 align:middle line:84%
so it doesn't
influence the water.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And you need preferably always
outside, preferably in the sun.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:35.310 align:middle line:84%
If it's a day when
it's cloudy, it still

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:37.560 align:middle line:90%
works, just not optimum.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.800 align:middle line:84%
When you have sunshine, like
we were gifted with today,

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:41.880 align:middle line:90%
it's perfect.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:46.500 align:middle line:84%
You can use any crystal except
for malachite, chrysocolla,

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.750 align:middle line:84%
and red coral, as they can
leach harmful ingredients

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:50.550 align:middle line:90%
into the water.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:53.130 align:middle line:90%


00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:56.340 align:middle line:84%
So today we're doing
three essences.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:01.440 align:middle line:84%
Of course, green for
healing, and orange

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.250 align:middle line:84%
for the electromagnetic
field, for the etheric web,

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:08.520 align:middle line:84%
for strengthening
with a carnelian.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.610 align:middle line:84%
This is an emerald for
the green and aquamarine

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:13.710 align:middle line:90%
for a clear thought--

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:17.690 align:middle line:84%
clear thought, clear perception,
and reducing inflammation.

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:20.875 align:middle line:90%

00:13:20.875 --> 00:13:32.040 align:middle line:90%


00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.170 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sending the
same programming

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:38.550 align:middle line:84%
as I put in the crystal,
sending it in through the hands.

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And when the energy
receives it's optimal,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.760 align:middle line:84%
when the water has
taken all it can take,

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.730 align:middle line:90%
I'll feel it beneath the hands.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:50.310 align:middle line:84%
That's part of the
training we get.

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:51.780 align:middle line:90%
It's already coming up.

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:55.161 align:middle line:90%

00:13:55.161 --> 00:13:57.580 align:middle line:90%


00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.940 align:middle line:84%
Separate rapidly so the
energy stays in there,

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:06.125 align:middle line:84%
and tying it up
with the circles.

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:44.750 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:50.390 align:middle line:10%
So things happening, and
we're going to leave this out

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:54.230 align:middle line:10%
so the sunshine continues
the work of impregnating

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:56.930 align:middle line:10%
the water with the
energy in the crystals

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:58.490 align:middle line:10%
and the color of the crystals.

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And we'll be back to
after take the water,

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.790 align:middle line:84%
take the crystal out,
put it in the jar

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:09.120 align:middle line:84%
that we can put in the fridge,
and they're ready to be used.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:12.960 align:middle line:84%
You can even take a
tablespoon, a soup spoon,

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.450 align:middle line:90%
or you can take an ounce or two.

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:18.060 align:middle line:84%
The amount doesn't
matter really.

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:21.360 align:middle line:84%
As long as there's enough
to really fill your mouth so

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.660 align:middle line:84%
that the underneath of the
tongue where the information is

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:28.080 align:middle line:84%
going to start out is
well-impregnated, then

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.890 align:middle line:84%
you'll have very good
results with your tincture.

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:34.673 align:middle line:84%
And you want to keep it up I
think at least three weeks.

00:15:34.673 --> 00:15:36.090 align:middle line:84%
The people are
going to take this.

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:37.830 align:middle line:84%
It has an immediate
effect, rather

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:41.010 align:middle line:84%
than wearing a stone takes a
bit more time to have effect.

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:43.550 align:middle line:90%


00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Another ancient practice of
making gem elixirs comes from

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.540 align:middle line:84%
the Daoist tradition, otherwise
known as Chinese stone

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:52.910 align:middle line:90%
medicine.

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>> A stone elixir involves
soaking stones in water so that

00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:59.150 align:middle line:84%
the water absorbs the
vibrations of the stones.

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:02.990 align:middle line:84%
Chinese medicine advocates
using three to four stones

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:06.890 align:middle line:84%
in a formula because they
believe that interaction

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:08.330 align:middle line:90%
is how we learn.

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:12.230 align:middle line:84%
We interact with the stones, and
we interact with human beings,

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.570 align:middle line:84%
and it helps us learn
about ourselves.

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Making a formula implies
that we have a strategy.

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:20.240 align:middle line:84%
This formula is
intended for the throat.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.700 align:middle line:10%
And I made it for
myself in anticipation

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:26.150 align:middle line:10%
of coming here so that when
I spoke I would be clear.

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:28.730 align:middle line:84%
The principle stone
is a sodalite.

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:30.620 align:middle line:84%
It contains sodium
chloride, which

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.990 align:middle line:84%
helps the body
retain fluid, which

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:36.080 align:middle line:84%
helps thin the phlegm that
accumulates in the throat.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:40.460 align:middle line:84%
So the first stone
goes into the jar.

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:43.110 align:middle line:84%
The second stone is
a transforming stone.

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:45.150 align:middle line:84%
It's an agate, a
blue lace agate,

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:48.630 align:middle line:84%
which we learned earlier
they consider agate to be

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:50.610 align:middle line:90%
for real physical illness.

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:52.590 align:middle line:84%
So there's really
phlegm in my throat,

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:55.230 align:middle line:84%
so I'm using blue lace
agate, and it's going

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:57.180 align:middle line:90%
to help transform that phlegm.

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.610 align:middle line:90%
So it goes in the jar.

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'm going to
add my enhancing stone

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.920 align:middle line:84%
or harmonizing stone,
which is always

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.599 align:middle line:90%
going to be a quartz crystal.

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:09.690 align:middle line:84%
Quartz crystal comes in
many, many different colors,

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:12.329 align:middle line:84%
depending on what
chemicals were around when

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:13.710 align:middle line:90%
the stone was being made.

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:16.829 align:middle line:84%
This is a blue quartz,
again, to target the throat.

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:19.319 align:middle line:84%
It's blue because
of indicolite, which

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:22.980 align:middle line:84%
is a blue tourmaline, which
also helps the body clear itself

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:25.099 align:middle line:90%
of pathology.

00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:29.660 align:middle line:84%
Quartz in Chinese medicine is
known as the outstanding stone,

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:32.720 align:middle line:84%
not because it's so
outstanding, but it

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:36.140 align:middle line:84%
makes every stone it comes
into contact with outstanding.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:39.110 align:middle line:84%
So this is the blue
outstanding stone.

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:42.230 align:middle line:84%
Finally, I have an
assistant stone.

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:45.650 align:middle line:84%
This is because I know that
the reason I have phlegm

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:47.690 align:middle line:84%
in my throat is that
my spleen is weak,

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:49.520 align:middle line:84%
and it's not
transforming properly.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.940 align:middle line:84%
So I have orange calcite, which
is going to target the spleen

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:55.070 align:middle line:84%
and help the transformation
happen better.

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:58.160 align:middle line:90%
Now, I just take the water.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.080 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to use
tap water that has

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.910 align:middle line:90%
fluoride and chlorine in it.

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:04.460 align:middle line:84%
We just want the cleanest
water we can get,

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:07.790 align:middle line:84%
which these days is mostly
bottled spring water.

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:09.515 align:middle line:90%
We fill the quart jar.

00:18:09.515 --> 00:18:12.130 align:middle line:90%


00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'm going to put an
index card on top of the jar.

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:18.970 align:middle line:84%
This is just to prevent any
dust particles from settling

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:21.010 align:middle line:90%
into the water while it sits.

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:23.380 align:middle line:84%
The Mason jar comes
with a metal lid,

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:26.770 align:middle line:84%
but I find that it imparts a
metallic taste to the water,

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:27.880 align:middle line:90%
and I don't like that.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.860 align:middle line:90%
So I use the paper.

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:31.180 align:middle line:90%
You can use an envelope.

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:33.400 align:middle line:84%
You can use anything
you want, so long

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.230 align:middle line:90%
as it protects the water.

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:37.630 align:middle line:84%
I normally let this
sit for 24 hours,

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:39.880 align:middle line:84%
but for purposes of
this demonstration,

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.530 align:middle line:90%
we're just moving on.

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:44.200 align:middle line:90%
So I take my jar.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.440 align:middle line:84%
I pour four ounces,
approximately.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.940 align:middle line:90%
It could be eight ounces.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.520 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot more water to drink.

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:54.710 align:middle line:84%
I like to do two doses-- four
ounces in the morning, four

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:56.110 align:middle line:90%
ounces in the evening.

00:18:56.110 --> 00:19:02.830 align:middle line:84%
Drink the water slowly
and with consciousness.

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Feel the coolness
in the tissues.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.750 align:middle line:84%
Follow the liquid
down your throat.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:12.505 align:middle line:84%
And when you're done,
refill the elixir.

00:19:12.505 --> 00:19:15.772 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:15.772 --> 00:19:16.740 align:middle line:90%


00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And in the evening, I
would do another dose.

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:22.860 align:middle line:10%
If you forget to
refill the elixir,

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.870 align:middle line:10%
that's OK here and there.

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:28.170 align:middle line:84%
But if ever it gets
more than half-way down,

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:32.340 align:middle line:84%
and you fill it more than
half-way with more water,

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:35.010 align:middle line:84%
you've pretty much
ruined the elixir.

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:36.630 align:middle line:90%
So just dump it out.

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:39.300 align:middle line:10%
Also, at this point
there's no taste.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.500 align:middle line:10%
It's just water.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:44.520 align:middle line:10%
But the longer it sits,
it can take on taste.

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.320 align:middle line:10%
Some taste is fine.

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:50.880 align:middle line:10%
But if it starts to taste at all
funky or particularly metallic

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.640 align:middle line:10%
or just strange, just--

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.470 align:middle line:10%
you're done with that elixir.

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:56.550 align:middle line:10%
Pour it out.

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:59.460 align:middle line:84%
And then if you need another
one, you'll make another one.

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:00.825 align:middle line:90%
The stones are good forever.

00:20:00.825 --> 00:20:03.810 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:06.150 align:middle line:10%
And this is how
you make an elixir.

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Depending on what you want
to treat for yourself,

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.670 align:middle line:84%
you're going to need to
find your own stones,

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:13.860 align:middle line:84%
and that means you
have to do research.

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.990 align:middle line:84%
There are many
resources available.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:17.430 align:middle line:84%
There's my book
"Stone Medicine,"

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:18.450 align:middle line:90%
but there are others.

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:21.540 align:middle line:84%
Just make sure that
the information

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:23.790 align:middle line:84%
is coming from a
tradition that has

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:29.180 align:middle line:84%
a history of empirical
evidence or science.
