00:00:18.544 --> 00:00:22.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Crystals and stones have
been used for many different

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.580 align:middle line:84%
purposes throughout
human history.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.520 align:middle line:84%
Lapis lazuli,
carnelian, and malachite

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.710 align:middle line:84%
were used by the
ancient Egyptians,

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.480 align:middle line:84%
emerald by the Incas,
jade by the Chinese,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.260 align:middle line:84%
and turquoise by the
Native Americans.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.300 align:middle line:84%
Many of these
great cultures were

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.400 align:middle line:84%
aware of the power
in the stones,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.535 align:middle line:90%
and they used them consciously.

00:00:45.535 --> 00:00:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Much of the knowledge
of the real purpose

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.340 align:middle line:84%
of crystals in jewelry and their
use in and around the house

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.050 align:middle line:90%
has been lost.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.630 align:middle line:84%
Few people know that
Aztecs traditionally

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.120 align:middle line:84%
used certain gemstones
on the third eye

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.880 align:middle line:84%
to help their consciousness
stay attuned to God

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.450 align:middle line:84%
or that azurite was once used
by some Native American tribes

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:10.100 align:middle line:84%
as an amulet to help the
wearer contact a spirit guide.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.170 align:middle line:10%
Crystals have been
used for thousands

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.930 align:middle line:10%
of years as gatekeepers
at the entrances

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.350 align:middle line:10%
of important buildings to
keep unwanted energy out.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.410 align:middle line:90%


00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.110 align:middle line:84%
Each crystal has a
special gift to offer

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.740 align:middle line:84%
and can be utilized to become
a personal power piece that

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.780 align:middle line:84%
will assist its
user in attaining

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.645 align:middle line:84%
certain states of awareness
or achieving specific goals.

00:01:34.645 --> 00:01:38.735 align:middle line:84%
So what are the different
ways that we can use crystals?

00:01:38.735 --> 00:01:41.570 align:middle line:84%
How can we work with them
in our everyday lives?

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And how do we even begin
to establish a relationship

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.716 align:middle line:90%
with them?

00:01:46.716 --> 00:01:50.645 align:middle line:10%
>> There are several ways
to use crystals and stones.

00:01:50.645 --> 00:01:53.060 align:middle line:10%
Professional practitioners
do full treatments

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.370 align:middle line:10%
placing stones on
their clients' body.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.670 align:middle line:84%
We as individuals can hold
them or carry them in a pocket

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.290 align:middle line:90%
to touch during the day.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.150 align:middle line:84%
We can place them
around the house,

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.450 align:middle line:84%
and we can make elixirs or
water to drink with them.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.529 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps most commonly, we
can wear them as jewelry.

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:11.300 align:middle line:84%
Bringing in Chinese
medical theory

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.550 align:middle line:84%
again when we wear
them as jewelry,

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.250 align:middle line:84%
we also want to have a
reason for placement.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.640 align:middle line:84%
Is the ring on the index
finger or the fourth finger,

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.930 align:middle line:90%
the right hand or the left?

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.480 align:middle line:84%
Is the pendant hanging at
the center of the chest

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.520 align:middle line:90%
or closer to the throat?

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.520 align:middle line:84%
Energetic channels run
through the wrists and ankles,

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.370 align:middle line:84%
so choosing stones that resonate
with a particular channel

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.020 align:middle line:90%
is a consideration.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.080 align:middle line:84%
Generally speaking, women
should hold and wear

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.110 align:middle line:84%
stones on the right side of
the body and men on the left.

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.990 align:middle line:84%
The center of the chest is
a major acupuncture point.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.390 align:middle line:84%
It is the meeting point
for Qi in the body where

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.000 align:middle line:84%
all the energy of the
body passes through.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.880 align:middle line:84%
It helps to relax the
energy in the chest.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.490 align:middle line:84%
A pendant worn over this
point will gradually

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.550 align:middle line:84%
have a sort of filter
effect on the energy passing

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.100 align:middle line:84%
through the area,
eventually influencing

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.990 align:middle line:90%
all the energy in the body.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Wearing a necklace
or a pendant closer

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.910 align:middle line:84%
to the throat, of course,
affects the throat chakra,

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.820 align:middle line:84%
but wearing a
necklace as a choker

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.780 align:middle line:84%
can also help clear inflammation
in the sensory organs.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.870 align:middle line:84%
The fingers have specific
channel associations,

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.670 align:middle line:84%
and if we wear a
particular stone

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.060 align:middle line:84%
on the same finger for years,
it affects the channel.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.490 align:middle line:84%
By Chinese thinking, because
the diamond is so hard,

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.675 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't allow for
flexibility and resilience.

00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Wearing the typical
diamond engagement

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.680 align:middle line:84%
and wedding rings
on the fourth finger

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.950 align:middle line:84%
brings rigidity to a channel
that can ill afford it.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.930 align:middle line:10%
>> We can work with crystals
to aid us in our dream time

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.890 align:middle line:10%
to have more vivid dreams or
to open up psychic awareness

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.060 align:middle line:10%
and psychic gifts.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.660 align:middle line:10%
We can use crystals
for our environment,

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.190 align:middle line:10%
lay out different grids.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.830 align:middle line:10%
They'll help anchor
energy within that space.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.737 align:middle line:10%
We can use crystals
to help us ground

00:03:55.737 --> 00:03:57.820 align:middle line:10%
because almost all crystals
are going to be coming

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.125 align:middle line:10%
from that Mother Earth energy.

00:03:59.125 --> 00:04:01.970 align:middle line:90%


00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>> The first thing we need to do
with a crystal is to establish

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.375 align:middle line:90%
a relationship.

00:04:07.375 --> 00:04:09.310 align:middle line:84%
We communicate
with the crystals,

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.670 align:middle line:84%
so they inform us of what
they're supposed to do with us.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.140 align:middle line:90%
That's the work of a shaman.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.209 align:middle line:84%
When you communicate
with the stones,

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.644 align:middle line:90%
they can tell you what they do.

00:04:19.644 --> 00:04:21.850 align:middle line:84%
It will tell you
why it's in life

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.445 align:middle line:84%
and why it has
been given to you.

00:04:24.445 --> 00:04:27.970 align:middle line:84%
This is why we refrain
from buying stones.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Normally, in our
tradition, it's best

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.160 align:middle line:84%
to receive the crystal
when it is given as a gift

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.650 align:middle line:84%
or finding them in
nature when the Earth

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.035 align:middle line:90%
itself gives them to you.

00:04:38.035 --> 00:04:40.960 align:middle line:10%
That establishes a real
sacred relationship

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.750 align:middle line:10%
between you and the crystal.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.270 align:middle line:10%
I often feel that
there is a need

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.000 align:middle line:10%
for more sobriety in
our work with crystals

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.880 align:middle line:10%
when I look at what some of
the New Age practitioners

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.125 align:middle line:10%
are doing.

00:04:53.125 --> 00:04:55.930 align:middle line:84%
Many crystals and
more crystals is not

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.990 align:middle line:84%
necessarily better
than conscious sobriety

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.940 align:middle line:90%
for several reasons.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.620 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we need to
realize the third principle

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.320 align:middle line:84%
of working with
crystals, awareness of

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.570 align:middle line:90%
and respect for the Earth.

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.610 align:middle line:84%
There is often
quite a destruction

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.000 align:middle line:84%
of the ecology that happens when
people are mining for crystals.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.210 align:middle line:84%
There is a common trap
that we also fall into,

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.270 align:middle line:84%
mistaking outward
objects as substitutes

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.100 align:middle line:90%
for our own inner work.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.850 align:middle line:84%
Chögyam Trungpa, a high
Tibetan tulku and lama,

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:30.200 align:middle line:84%
coined this in the spiritual
saying spiritual materialism.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.750 align:middle line:84%
In fact, a crystal
practitioner can

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.020 align:middle line:84%
work with a single stone, a
single clear quartz crystal.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.850 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't need
any more than that.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.510 align:middle line:84%
You can program this crystal
with all the attributes of all

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.780 align:middle line:90%
the other stones and colors.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.570 align:middle line:84%
>> The best way to cultivate and
establish a relationship with

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.210 align:middle line:84%
crystals is just to
get to know them.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:51.440 align:middle line:90%
Treat them like people.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.940 align:middle line:84%
If you want to get
to know somebody,

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.290 align:middle line:90%
you got to work with it.

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:55.850 align:middle line:90%
You got to have communication.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.860 align:middle line:84%
You work with the
crystals regularly.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.720 align:middle line:84%
You meditate with
them and maybe just

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.988 align:middle line:84%
see how are they going to work
with you, your unique energy.

00:06:02.988 --> 00:06:04.280 align:middle line:90%
How would they like to be used?

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.180 align:middle line:90%
What can they do for you?

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.360 align:middle line:84%
So you have a conversation
with those crystals.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.100 align:middle line:84%
Work with them
regularly and you'll

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.710 align:middle line:90%
get really familiar with them.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.550 align:middle line:84%
>> I recommend exploring the
belief that gemstones like

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.450 align:middle line:84%
plants and animals possess a
unique form of consciousness.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.030 align:middle line:10%
I think they really enjoy
interacting with humans

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.560 align:middle line:10%
as it brings them to life.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.830 align:middle line:84%
It gives them a very
unique sacred purpose.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.980 align:middle line:84%
One way to wake up the
power in a gem or a crystal

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.240 align:middle line:90%
is to admire it.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.630 align:middle line:90%
Gaze into it.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.130 align:middle line:84%
Feel its beauty and its
power and then quietly

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.720 align:middle line:90%
see what happens next.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not difficult to
establish and cultivate

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.945 align:middle line:84%
a relationship with
a crystal or stone.

00:06:44.945 --> 00:06:47.120 align:middle line:84%
Since energy is
transferred through touch

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.870 align:middle line:84%
or other interaction, it
almost happens automatically.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.060 align:middle line:84%
If you're attracted
to a stone, hold it,

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.170 align:middle line:84%
look at it with a conscious
present state of mind,

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.870 align:middle line:84%
and you're already
making relationship.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.050 align:middle line:84%
Over time, as you wear
or handle the stone,

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.885 align:middle line:90%
the relationship will deepen.

00:07:05.885 --> 00:07:09.650 align:middle line:84%
With clear crystals such
as quartz or aquamarine,

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.985 align:middle line:84%
gazing into and through them can
be a very interesting process.

00:07:13.985 --> 00:07:15.800 align:middle line:84%
This focus of
attention is certainly

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.040 align:middle line:84%
a way of developing a
relationship with the stone.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.070 align:middle line:84%
Some stones are more
demanding than others.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Meteorite, for example,
can be challenging.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.800 align:middle line:84%
It is a stone from
heaven and wants

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.740 align:middle line:84%
to bring our evolution
to a higher level.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.990 align:middle line:84%
If we haven't already
been cultivating

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:35.060 align:middle line:84%
with meditation
or other methods,

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.880 align:middle line:90%
it may give too strong a push.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.880 align:middle line:84%
Another challenging
stone is black obsidian,

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.390 align:middle line:84%
which requires us to see
the dark parts of our self,

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:50.150 align:middle line:84%
which can be very difficult. If
you gaze into a black obsidian,

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.390 align:middle line:84%
do it only for a few
seconds because it really

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:56.420 align:middle line:84%
makes you look into
your dark shadow self.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And then shift your
gaze to a clear crystal

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:04.265 align:middle line:84%
to make the effect a
little less difficult.

00:08:04.265 --> 00:08:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>> What you use to communicate
with the crystal is what we

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:10.610 align:middle line:90%
call telepathy.

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:15.140 align:middle line:84%
Now that might seem a big thing,
but it's actually very simple.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.865 align:middle line:84%
All the animals are
always communicating

00:08:16.865 --> 00:08:19.080 align:middle line:90%
through telepathy.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:23.000 align:middle line:84%
When there was this big tsunami
in Asia there, lots of people

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.838 align:middle line:84%
died, but all the
animals three days before

00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:25.880 align:middle line:90%
had gone up to the hills.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.850 align:middle line:84%
They weren't there because the
Earth communicated with them.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.790 align:middle line:84%
When you see the birds flying
through the sky when they're

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:35.100 align:middle line:84%
practicing for migration, you
see them all change direction

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:35.900 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.039 align:middle line:90%
That's telepathy.

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And when the phone rings
and you know who's calling,

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.419 align:middle line:90%
that's telepathy.

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:44.570 align:middle line:84%
When you're with your loved
ones and you say the same thing

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:46.700 align:middle line:84%
at the same time,
that's telepathy.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.330 align:middle line:84%
It's something
natural to everybody.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:54.050 align:middle line:84%
Of course, when we're working
as crystal practitioners,

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:55.040 align:middle line:90%
we practice that.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.660 align:middle line:90%
We have exercises.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:01.560 align:middle line:84%
In one of the ways of doing
this that people when they're

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.560 align:middle line:84%
in their conscious awake
mind don't succeed in doing

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.153 align:middle line:84%
this is by sleeping
with the crystal

00:09:07.153 --> 00:09:09.570 align:middle line:84%
because that part of you that
doesn't believe these things

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:12.120 align:middle line:84%
is asleep in the night and
that part of you that's

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.730 align:middle line:84%
open to everything is
awake in the night.

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:18.540 align:middle line:84%
So you'll notice that when you
sleep with a crystal, when you

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.070 align:middle line:84%
wake up the next
morning, you don't

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:21.930 align:middle line:84%
have the same
relationship with it,

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:23.710 align:middle line:84%
there's something
that's happened.

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And when you go to sleep, try
to hold it in one of your hands

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.315 align:middle line:84%
and check where it
is the next morning.

00:09:30.315 --> 00:09:33.270 align:middle line:84%
So many stories I've
heard where the person

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:36.240 align:middle line:84%
found the stone underneath
where they have pain.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.010 align:middle line:90%
It's almost immediate.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.930 align:middle line:84%
It's always close to
where there's pain.

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.060 align:middle line:84%
The stone knows what
it's doing, and it'll

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.050 align:middle line:90%
travel to where it needs to go.

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:46.410 align:middle line:84%
So sleeping with the crystal
is very good practice.

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:49.440 align:middle line:10%
>> Communicate with crystals
like you would communicate with

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.640 align:middle line:10%
your higher self--

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:55.170 align:middle line:10%
psychically, telepathically--
like when you pray

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:57.990 align:middle line:10%
and you really mean it.

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:01.510 align:middle line:84%
Meditating with a crystal and
having the crystal on your body

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:04.420 align:middle line:84%
is a great way to connect
with their vibration.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:09.010 align:middle line:84%
It's important to allow yourself
to have a childlike mind

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:13.090 align:middle line:84%
and be playful and to not second
guess the information that

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:16.510 align:middle line:90%
comes in but to trust it.

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:19.040 align:middle line:84%
Crystals support us
to do exactly that.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.840 align:middle line:84%
They enhance and help
us trust our intuition.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:26.000 align:middle line:84%
So make a practice
of it every day.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.240 align:middle line:84%
For example, you can
sit with a crystal

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.330 align:middle line:84%
you're getting to
know, ask a question,

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:35.200 align:middle line:84%
then journal whatever comes
up through automatic writing.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:39.460 align:middle line:84%
>> There is much folklore about
using gemstones as good luck

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:42.730 align:middle line:84%
charms and to ward off
negative influences.

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Using a ring as part
of a marriage ceremony

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:47.920 align:middle line:84%
is one of the more
common ways gemstones

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.830 align:middle line:84%
are used as talismans
in our society.

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.980 align:middle line:84%
Talismans have the potential
of activating talents

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:57.160 align:middle line:84%
and positive attitudes
within people.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.860 align:middle line:84%
A talisman's effects
come into full force

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.810 align:middle line:84%
when the person
wearing it becomes

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:04.870 align:middle line:84%
fully aware of its
psycho-spiritual properties.

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:08.710 align:middle line:10%
>> Mythology abounds with
accounts of magical rings

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.450 align:middle line:10%
and talismanic jewels.

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:13.870 align:middle line:10%
I've read about rings which
rendered its wearer invisible

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.210 align:middle line:10%
or had the ability
to extend one's

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:19.240 align:middle line:10%
life with the aid of
seven magical rings,

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.160 align:middle line:10%
changing the ring
every day according

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.920 align:middle line:10%
to the day and the
planetary influence.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.840 align:middle line:84%
Talismans and amulets
are personal to me.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.080 align:middle line:84%
I have a necklace
with multiple amulets,

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.390 align:middle line:90%
each with a significance.

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:36.400 align:middle line:84%
how I received it, the
occasion, the story, the energy

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.620 align:middle line:84%
are all aspects which
create meaning to it.

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.520 align:middle line:90%
This is like my wearable altar.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:45.610 align:middle line:84%
It's bringing me
protection or empowering me

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:48.160 align:middle line:90%
for a specific issue.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Talismans and amulets were
one of these things that have

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.980 align:middle line:84%
been done especially
in ancient cultures.

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.330 align:middle line:10%
They believed that
magical symbols and sigils

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:01.690 align:middle line:10%
and geometries and
seals and so forth could

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:05.270 align:middle line:10%
be inscribed into
certain materia,

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:08.740 align:middle line:10%
and then as it was
inscribed into that materia,

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.080 align:middle line:10%
it would anchor it
into the physical.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.475 align:middle line:84%
So it anchored these magical
properties of what it was they

00:12:14.475 --> 00:12:15.850 align:middle line:84%
were trying to
call in whether it

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:20.860 align:middle line:84%
was an angelic energy or some
kind of healing force or a love

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:21.700 align:middle line:90%
spell.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:25.150 align:middle line:84%
So rather than just holding
the intention in your mind

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.260 align:middle line:84%
and hoping that it would
be attracted to you,

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.530 align:middle line:84%
they brought it
down to the physical

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:32.770 align:middle line:90%
through a magical symbol.

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And then crystals, they would
inscribe it into the stone

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:39.766 align:middle line:84%
because it was really
strong and enduring.

00:12:39.766 --> 00:12:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Amulets are usually a symbol
or substance that is believed

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.820 align:middle line:90%
to convey protection.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.800 align:middle line:84%
There are many
stones that naturally

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.790 align:middle line:84%
have the quality of protection
against many potential evils.

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:56.230 align:middle line:84%
Amber, onyx, obsidian, black
tourmaline, and smoky quartz

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:57.490 align:middle line:90%
are among them.

00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:01.240 align:middle line:84%
Any of these could be made into
a pendant or kept in a pouch

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.390 align:middle line:84%
or pocket to protect against
falling, night terrors,

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.860 align:middle line:90%
or dangers while traveling.

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>> I personally have
altars all over my house.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:13.490 align:middle line:84%
For example, I have an altar
dedicated to my ancestors.

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:16.930 align:middle line:84%
I have an altar for my vision
of healing Mother Earth.

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:20.440 align:middle line:84%
I have an altar dedicated to
Mother Mary and the empowerment

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.730 align:middle line:90%
of women.

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:27.020 align:middle line:84%
I have an altar featuring
my beloved power animals.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Most crystals love to be
seen and be in the sunlight,

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:33.140 align:middle line:84%
so I have crystals
on my windowsills.

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:36.710 align:middle line:84%
I have crystals in my
plants with the intention

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:38.610 align:middle line:90%
of supporting their growth.

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.090 align:middle line:84%
I have a quartz cluster
on our coffee table

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:43.670 align:middle line:84%
with the intention of bringing
in more light and harmony

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:46.865 align:middle line:90%
and to clear negative energies.

00:13:46.865 --> 00:13:49.910 align:middle line:84%
Remember that energy
follows intention.

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Our mind is so powerful
as it creates what

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:54.300 align:middle line:90%
we will manifest in our lives.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:58.160 align:middle line:84%
So trust your intuition and
know that the crystals love you

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.770 align:middle line:90%
and are here to support you.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:03.770 align:middle line:84%
After a house or land
clearing and blessing,

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:06.620 align:middle line:84%
you can also place crystals
in the Earth on the four

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:11.210 align:middle line:84%
corners of the land, or you
can even create a central altar

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:13.070 align:middle line:84%
for the house to
anchor the energy you

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:15.695 align:middle line:90%
want to invite into the house.

00:14:15.695 --> 00:14:19.475 align:middle line:84%
>> When we want to use
crystals around our house,

00:14:19.475 --> 00:14:23.130 align:middle line:84%
these can be a great way to
anchor energy in certain areas.

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:26.850 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, in feng shui,
the ancient Chinese system,

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:31.500 align:middle line:84%
they would use crystals in
particular sections of a room

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:36.450 align:middle line:84%
to help enhance that
energy or to maybe catch

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:38.640 align:middle line:84%
the light as it's
coming in and reflect

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.380 align:middle line:90%
that light into your space.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Or if there was a negative
energy, according to the feng

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.480 align:middle line:84%
shui system, they
might put something

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.640 align:middle line:84%
else there to help ground
it and neutralize it.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:52.410 align:middle line:84%
So the crystals have been used
a lot in feng shui systems,

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:53.778 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:14:53.778 --> 00:14:55.320 align:middle line:84%
Another way that
you can use crystals

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:58.110 align:middle line:84%
is put them in the
pots of your plants

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:00.285 align:middle line:84%
because the plants
really love the crystals.

00:15:00.285 --> 00:15:02.160 align:middle line:84%
They're going to work
with that Earth energy,

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.200 align:middle line:84%
but they also amplify
and sometimes you'll

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.980 align:middle line:84%
find that the plants will
grow stronger and be happy

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:10.530 align:middle line:84%
because they've got this
amplified energy coming through

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:11.820 align:middle line:90%
from the crystals.

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.880 align:middle line:84%
You can have a generator
crystal in your house, which

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:18.330 align:middle line:84%
is going to be a bigger quartz
crystal, just clear quartz

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.790 align:middle line:84%
crystal but one that's
really big and at least as

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:24.390 align:middle line:84%
big as your palm and typically
as wide as your palm.

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:26.020 align:middle line:10%
And then you can
do crystal grids.

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:27.870 align:middle line:10%
You can lay out
the crystals just

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:31.035 align:middle line:10%
to anchor that pure highest
vibrational energy of light.

00:15:31.035 --> 00:15:34.230 align:middle line:90%


00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And you would put them
in different directions,

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:37.810 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:39.510 align:middle line:10%
There's different
grids that will

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:42.460 align:middle line:10%
work with different geometries
and different purposes,

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:46.620 align:middle line:10%
but the most basic would be to
put it in the four directions

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:49.620 align:middle line:10%
to help balance the
directions of your space.

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>> We can use crystals and
stones around the house using

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:56.140 align:middle line:84%
the principles of feng shui,
which literally means wind

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:56.940 align:middle line:90%
water.

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:59.670 align:middle line:10%
It's a very sophisticated
system intended

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:02.800 align:middle line:10%
to bring harmony to living
and work environments.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.880 align:middle line:84%
For example, if we want to
manage the energy coming

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:08.190 align:middle line:84%
into our home, we
can fill a small bowl

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:10.410 align:middle line:84%
with dalmatian
jasper to filter out

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:14.160 align:middle line:84%
obnoxious or annoying
energy or in the bathroom

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.140 align:middle line:84%
a bowl of brown
jasper to break up

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:19.530 align:middle line:84%
negative accumulations or
maybe a fluorite sphere

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:21.960 align:middle line:90%
to absorb toxicity.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.440 align:middle line:84%
One caution of placing quartz
crystals in the television room

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.180 align:middle line:90%
or close to the computer.

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:29.190 align:middle line:90%
Crystals amplify energy.

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:31.920 align:middle line:84%
If you watch a lot of
action shows on television

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.960 align:middle line:84%
or spend lots of
time on the computer,

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.960 align:middle line:84%
the quartz crystals can
amplify the stress and tension

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:39.480 align:middle line:84%
of the action movie
and otherwise amplify

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:42.870 align:middle line:84%
the electromagnetic radiation
put out by the computer.

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:46.620 align:middle line:84%
Instead, place black tourmaline
near electronic appliances

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:48.540 align:middle line:84%
to help absorb the
energy coming off

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:52.490 align:middle line:84%
the computer or the
agitation of action movies.

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>> I have a lot of quartz
crystals in my home that

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.570 align:middle line:90%
I've given certain jobs to.

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:00.030 align:middle line:84%
I seem to have some
flexibility in choosing

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:02.115 align:middle line:90%
what I want them to do for me.

00:17:02.115 --> 00:17:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Quartz feels like a very
flexible mineral in many ways.

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.760 align:middle line:84%
Astrological gemstones
are a little bit different

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.430 align:middle line:84%
in that they'll affect
certain areas of a person's

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:15.069 align:middle line:84%
life no matter what, things
we can predict in advance.

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:18.569 align:middle line:84%
So in some ways, the results
can always be predetermined.

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:21.510 align:middle line:84%
However, even
astrological gems seem

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:24.990 align:middle line:84%
to work better if we are
consciously working with them.

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:26.670 align:middle line:84%
The best way to
do that is to get

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:28.950 align:middle line:90%
really clear on what you want.

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:32.010 align:middle line:84%
This is something I always ask
people when recommending gems.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:33.300 align:middle line:90%
What do you really want?

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:36.120 align:middle line:84%
That will tell me not only
which gems they should wear

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.760 align:middle line:84%
but will help them work
with the gem to make

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.560 align:middle line:90%
these visions a reality.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.530 align:middle line:84%
I think it's really important
to remember that what we want

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:46.740 align:middle line:84%
might not always show up in
the package that we expect.

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Also what we think we
might want may not always

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:51.610 align:middle line:90%
be what's best for us.

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the case,
the gems will actually

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:56.950 align:middle line:84%
manifest what is in alignment
with the greater good,

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:59.770 align:middle line:84%
not what we are
most attached to.

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:03.580 align:middle line:84%
When we get to a place where
our desires and the greater good

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:06.910 align:middle line:84%
are in alignment and we're
wearing gemstones that

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:09.970 align:middle line:84%
specifically target those
particular outcomes,

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:13.640 align:middle line:84%
that's when the
magic really happens.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.800 align:middle line:84%
Another way to
maximize the results

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.050 align:middle line:84%
of an astrological
gemstone is to put it

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:20.360 align:middle line:90%
on at a very specific time.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Certain planetary transits are
more supportive than others.

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:25.730 align:middle line:84%
So we can make the
most of the gem

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.970 align:middle line:84%
by putting it on during a
muhurta or a specifically

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:31.880 align:middle line:84%
chosen astrological
time to begin something.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.000 align:middle line:84%
It also helps to chant
planetary mantras when first

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:35.960 align:middle line:90%
wearing a gem.

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:39.590 align:middle line:84%
Mantras use sacred sound
frequencies in the same way

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:41.940 align:middle line:84%
that gemstones use
light frequencies,

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:46.510 align:middle line:84%
so when you combine the two, the
results can be very powerful.

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:51.200 align:middle line:84%
>> To program a crystal, you can
literally place the termination

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:55.940 align:middle line:84%
point of the crystal to
your third eye like this.

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And you project your prayers,
your vision, your desires,

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:01.730 align:middle line:84%
your intentions, and
you ask the crystal

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:04.920 align:middle line:84%
to show you the answer of
whatever you're asking for.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:05.720 align:middle line:90%
Show me.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.045 align:middle line:90%
Show me, show me, show me.

00:19:08.045 --> 00:19:10.280 align:middle line:84%
Then place the crystal
with a termination pointing

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:14.190 align:middle line:84%
outward from your third
eye and ask the crystal

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:17.550 align:middle line:84%
to send your intentions
out into the universe.

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:19.650 align:middle line:84%
Then place the
crystal on your altar

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:23.460 align:middle line:84%
and be ready for messages,
meetings, or happenings

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:26.100 align:middle line:84%
that will transport
the answer to you.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:30.660 align:middle line:84%
The language of the universe
is often humorous, unexpected.

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:33.660 align:middle line:84%
A message may come to you
from an unsuspecting stranger,

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:35.880 align:middle line:84%
or a book may fall
out of the bookcase.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.640 align:middle line:84%
You may have a prophetic
message in dream time.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:43.230 align:middle line:84%
There are no rules, but once
you project your intentions out

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:46.470 align:middle line:84%
into the universe, know that
the crystal is your ally

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:50.560 align:middle line:84%
and will make things
happen for you.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:56.230 align:middle line:84%
Prayers are real and the
intensity, honesty, and passion

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:59.290 align:middle line:84%
of the prayer is what activates
the crystal and the universe

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:02.605 align:middle line:84%
to work with you consciously
and co-creatively.

00:20:02.605 --> 00:20:06.160 align:middle line:84%
>> I will not work with
people who want to wear gems

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.750 align:middle line:90%
for the wrong reasons.

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:09.820 align:middle line:84%
I've had people ask
for gems for reasons

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.880 align:middle line:84%
that I feel are manipulative
or out of alignment

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.260 align:middle line:90%
with the greater good.

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.990 align:middle line:84%
I've had people request
gems to get revenge

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:20.320 align:middle line:84%
or to get out of legal trouble
when they were actually guilty.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.660 align:middle line:84%
I decline to serve these people
because at the end of the day,

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.150 align:middle line:90%
we're in the karma business.

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:27.730 align:middle line:10%
We're prescribing gems
to uplift humanity

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:30.190 align:middle line:10%
on a frequency of goodness.

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:32.560 align:middle line:84%
Astrological gemstones
can do a lot of good,

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.660 align:middle line:90%
but they can also be harmful.

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:36.790 align:middle line:84%
We have had many
instances of people

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:39.947 align:middle line:84%
being prescribed the wrong gems
which is a challenge for me.

00:20:39.947 --> 00:20:41.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't like having
to go against what

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:43.240 align:middle line:84%
somebody's guru
recommended for them,

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.730 align:middle line:84%
but knowing how to
correctly recommend gems,

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:48.260 align:middle line:90%
I've had to do it many times.

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:53.122 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd like to teach you a very
simple consecration ceremony.

00:20:53.122 --> 00:20:55.580 align:middle line:84%
When you receive your stone,
the first thing you want to do

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.260 align:middle line:90%
is purify it.

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Once you've purified
it, you'll want

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:03.140 align:middle line:84%
to go to the side of
a stream or a lake

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:05.660 align:middle line:84%
where the waves
go over the stone,

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:08.090 align:middle line:84%
and you leave it there
for at least 20 minutes.

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:09.890 align:middle line:90%
The best is about two hours.

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And then you take it
out and you look at it.

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:15.820 align:middle line:84%
It's better on a sunny day, and
you say why are you in my life.

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:16.740 align:middle line:90%
What's your role?

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:18.230 align:middle line:90%
What's your mission here?

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And then you wrap
it in red cloth,

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:23.300 align:middle line:90%
and you put it on your altar.

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And for 14 days in your
evening meditation,

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:29.360 align:middle line:84%
you take the wrapping, you
bring it to your heart,

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.550 align:middle line:84%
you commune heart to
heart with the crystal,

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:33.320 align:middle line:84%
and you put it
back on your altar.

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:37.250 align:middle line:84%
After 14 days, you do
another 14 days but this time

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:40.190 align:middle line:84%
you take it out of the
wrapping and you take it

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:42.260 align:middle line:84%
in your bare hand and
you put it to your heart

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:45.200 align:middle line:84%
and you commune heart and
heart with the crystal.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
the 28 days, you

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:49.820 align:middle line:90%
go back to the running water.

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:52.670 align:middle line:84%
You let it bathe-- that's
energizing the crystal--

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:54.320 align:middle line:84%
and then you ask
the same question.

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And by that time, it's
very, very, very clear

00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:00.620 align:middle line:84%
what that crystal is doing,
and you've imprinted with it.

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:02.660 align:middle line:84%
You've imprinted
into the crystal,

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:05.750 align:middle line:84%
you've consecrated the
crystal, and it will always

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:06.620 align:middle line:90%
do that for you.

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:08.720 align:middle line:84%
Whatever its role
is, that mission is,

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.160 align:middle line:90%
you've got a friend for life.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:14.166 align:middle line:90%


00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:16.650 align:middle line:84%
>> As our experts
have described,

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:19.750 align:middle line:84%
crystals can be used
in many different ways.

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:23.790 align:middle line:84%
You can instruct a crystal as
your own magical power piece

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:27.060 align:middle line:84%
either to call in blessings
or to protect yourself

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.920 align:middle line:90%
from negative influences.

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:32.250 align:middle line:84%
You can use them for
protection and cosmic energy

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:34.410 align:middle line:90%
flow in and around the house.

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And you can create altars to
channel specific influences

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:42.450 align:middle line:84%
either in a work or living
space or on your body.

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:46.770 align:middle line:84%
It all starts with communication
and cultivating a relationship

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:50.300 align:middle line:84%
with these special beings
of the mineral kingdom.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:58.000 align:middle line:90%
