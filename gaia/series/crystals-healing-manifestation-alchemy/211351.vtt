00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.970 align:middle line:84%
>> When it comes
to crystal healing,

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.460 align:middle line:84%
the question everyone wants
to know is what crystal heals

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.260 align:middle line:90%
what?

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.340 align:middle line:90%


00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.970 align:middle line:84%
To understand the specific
effects a crystal may have,

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.220 align:middle line:84%
we first need to
know how crystals

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.930 align:middle line:90%
manifest healing powers.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.630 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, you will
learn the metaphysics

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.540 align:middle line:84%
behind crystal healing
by exploring the seven

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.510 align:middle line:84%
rays of light, the
Daoist elixir fields,

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.540 align:middle line:84%
and how the planets
channel archetypal energy

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.180 align:middle line:90%
through Vedic astrological gems.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.960 align:middle line:84%
These esoteric systems inform
us on how crystals specialize

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.800 align:middle line:84%
their abilities, so we can
begin to understand what

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.675 align:middle line:90%
crystal heals what and why.

00:01:02.675 --> 00:01:08.880 align:middle line:90%


00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Gems and crystals work with
light and color frequency,

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.720 align:middle line:84%
which affects our energy
body, as well as the karmic

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.290 align:middle line:84%
tendencies that we can see
in our astrological charts.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.680 align:middle line:84%
Humans have electromagnetic
fields around them,

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.300 align:middle line:90%
commonly known as auras.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And the right gems can boost
the aura and enhance it.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And the wrong gems can
diminish it and throw us

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.860 align:middle line:90%
into a state of imbalance.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.250 align:middle line:84%
>> The colors really make a
difference when we're talking

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.800 align:middle line:84%
about the metaphysical
properties of the crystals,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.630 align:middle line:84%
because metaphysically we're
talking about light, energy,

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.310 align:middle line:84%
spiritual energy,
metaphysical energy.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.090 align:middle line:84%
We all kind of use these
terms interchangeably.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And anytime we're
talking about light,

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.530 align:middle line:84%
whether we're talking
spiritual light

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.430 align:middle line:84%
or physical photonic
light, the crystals

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.520 align:middle line:84%
will take that light
in and optically

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.260 align:middle line:84%
shift it or they might refract
it, they might reflect it,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.130 align:middle line:84%
they might absorb it,
they might redirect it.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.980 align:middle line:84%
So the crystals work
with this light,

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.140 align:middle line:90%
both physical and metaphysical.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
thing I would add

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.010 align:middle line:84%
to the metaphysical
properties of crystals

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.020 align:middle line:90%
is that these crystals are--

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.790 align:middle line:84%
they have a form of
consciousness to them.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.910 align:middle line:84%
They have their
own spirit essence.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.070 align:middle line:84%
In the ancient
alchemical tradition,

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.510 align:middle line:90%
everything had spirit.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.770 align:middle line:90%
Everything had soul.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.210 align:middle line:90%
Everything had body.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.830 align:middle line:84%
We call these the
three essentials.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.610 align:middle line:84%
>> In crystal healing, the
energy centers called chakras

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.940 align:middle line:84%
or wheels of light are the
primary placement points

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.620 align:middle line:90%
for the crystals.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.550 align:middle line:84%
The crystals infuse the chakras
with associated color and light

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.640 align:middle line:90%
frequency.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.130 align:middle line:84%
The chakras interface
the physical body

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.010 align:middle line:84%
to our subtle bodies
or aura, and are

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.120 align:middle line:84%
connected to specific glands,
functions, and themes.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.330 align:middle line:84%
Each energy center has a
signature vibratory rate

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.720 align:middle line:84%
which has distinct
physical, psychological,

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.150 align:middle line:90%
or spiritual correspondences.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.600 align:middle line:84%
Crystals activate the chakras
to align with the central line

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.300 align:middle line:84%
channel, also
called the Sushumna.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.930 align:middle line:84%
This in turn stimulates the
Ida, the moon channel connected

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.030 align:middle line:84%
to the parasympathetic
nervous system,

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.730 align:middle line:84%
and the Pingala, the
sun channel connected

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.650 align:middle line:84%
to the sympathetic
nervous system.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.150 align:middle line:84%
Harmonizing our feminine
and masculine impulses.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.910 align:middle line:84%
With the support of the
crystals on our chakras,

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.360 align:middle line:84%
the goal is to balance the
duality of yin and yang forces

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.230 align:middle line:90%
within us.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.560 align:middle line:84%
So the dormant central line
channel can fully light up,

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.980 align:middle line:84%
and opening the pathway for
the flow of vital life force

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.060 align:middle line:84%
energy towards the upper
chakras of spiritual connection.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.650 align:middle line:90%


00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>> The color of a crystal is
one of the main attributes that

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.370 align:middle line:84%
determines the effect it will
have on our health and energy.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.560 align:middle line:84%
So the understanding
of the color

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.490 align:middle line:84%
or rays as they are sometimes
called is very important.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.450 align:middle line:84%
Generally speaking, when
there is a chronic illness,

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.260 align:middle line:84%
there is usually a depletion
of energy in a chronic illness.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.240 align:middle line:84%
So you want to add energy so
you'll be using a warm color.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.470 align:middle line:84%
For example, the red is
the warmest of their color.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And that is a ruby,
or you will use

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.380 align:middle line:84%
orange, which is also a warm
color with madeira citrine

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.000 align:middle line:90%
or carnelian.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And the yellow, which is the
highest of the warm color,

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.540 align:middle line:84%
with the yellow citrine
or the golden topaz.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
have a person who

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.380 align:middle line:84%
has an acute pain or illness,
meaning that something recent

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.630 align:middle line:84%
usually, where there's a lot
of accumulation of energy,

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.940 align:middle line:84%
where there is
inflammation, well, you're

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.860 align:middle line:90%
going to use cool color.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.800 align:middle line:84%
So you will go for blue,
which is like the aquamarine.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.630 align:middle line:84%
You can go for the sapphire,
which is the indigo ray.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a deep blue
with the sapphire--

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.460 align:middle line:84%
I have a little sapphire there
on my bolo or azurite crystal.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And the violet, which is
the highest of them all.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.890 align:middle line:84%
The violet, the amethyst,
which is very popular today.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.840 align:middle line:84%
If you want balance, stability,
energizing, yet soothing,

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.960 align:middle line:84%
life-giving vitality,
you go to green.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.040 align:middle line:84%
So you want to
have emerald and/or

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.310 align:middle line:90%
chrysoprase or green jasper.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.060 align:middle line:84%
These stones will bring
the color of the heart,

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.950 align:middle line:90%
will bring stability.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And they are the
color of healing.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.160 align:middle line:90%
Green is the color of healing.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.430 align:middle line:84%
If you don't know which to use,
when in doubt, choose green.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:49.570 align:middle line:90%
You'll never go wrong.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.230 align:middle line:84%
So the seven rays are the
seven colors of the rainbow.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And they correspond also
with your energy centers,

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.620 align:middle line:84%
what some people call chakras,
which are in the middle string.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.400 align:middle line:90%


00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Typically, we want to work
with the crystals of the color

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.320 align:middle line:84%
that corresponds
with the chakra.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.600 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
the crown chakra we

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.890 align:middle line:84%
might work with either amethyst
or purple or just clear

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.290 align:middle line:90%
quartz and white stones.

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.890 align:middle line:84%
With the third eye, you
might work with indigo

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.290 align:middle line:90%
or like a dark blue.

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.000 align:middle line:90%
With a throat, a lighter blue.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.620 align:middle line:90%
With the heart, a green.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.990 align:middle line:84%
All the green stones,
but also the pink stones

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.150 align:middle line:90%
are very much heart-centered.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Solar plexus kind of
the yellow colors.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:36.040 align:middle line:90%
The hara, the orange ones.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.020 align:middle line:90%
And then the root, the red ones.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.045 align:middle line:84%
So this is a general
place to start.

00:06:40.045 --> 00:06:45.250 align:middle line:90%


00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.550 align:middle line:84%
>> The Daoists have a different
understanding of our energy

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.190 align:middle line:84%
centers than the
yogic traditions do.

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.950 align:middle line:84%
The yogic traditions
have seven chakras

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:56.830 align:middle line:84%
that are associated with
the colors of the spectrum.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.040 align:middle line:84%
The Daoists have
three elixir fields

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.920 align:middle line:84%
which relate to the
Daoist alchemical process

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.200 align:middle line:90%
of personal transformation.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.410 align:middle line:84%
The three areas of the
body are the lower abdomen,

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:12.640 align:middle line:84%
chest and upper abdomen, and
the throat and head region.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.880 align:middle line:84%
The lower abdomen is an
area that is energetically

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.970 align:middle line:84%
attached to our Jing,
our physical essence,

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:20.050 align:middle line:90%
our substance.

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.750 align:middle line:84%
Stones that are most
effective for this purpose

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:25.450 align:middle line:84%
are ones that are
known to break up

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.550 align:middle line:90%
accumulations in this region.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.220 align:middle line:84%
They have dark colors,
and are especially

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.700 align:middle line:84%
in the agate and jasper
family, or the aventurines

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:38.020 align:middle line:84%
because they also
break up accumulations.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.300 align:middle line:84%
The chest region
and upper abdomen

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.420 align:middle line:90%
is associated with Qi or energy.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.340 align:middle line:84%
Energy is how we
interact with the world.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.680 align:middle line:84%
Stones to affect
this region could

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.280 align:middle line:84%
be white colored for the lungs,
red or pink for the heart,

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.875 align:middle line:84%
and yellow or orange for
the stomach and spleen.

00:07:54.875 --> 00:07:58.520 align:middle line:90%


00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:04.160 align:middle line:84%
The upper region gives us access
to heaven, to spirit or Shen.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.400 align:middle line:84%
The so-called third eye
was considered by Daoists

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.850 align:middle line:84%
to be the single eye, because
when a practitioner was

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:14.750 align:middle line:84%
cultivating this region,
judgments and comparisons began

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:15.890 align:middle line:90%
to fall away.

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:18.290 align:middle line:90%
Separations fell away.

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:22.820 align:middle line:84%
Everything could be seen
as emanations of the one.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.940 align:middle line:84%
A stone that could be used
for this level of cultivation

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.530 align:middle line:90%
is the diamond.

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Its hardness conveys
great confidence in what

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.720 align:middle line:90%
the practitioner has achieved.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.830 align:middle line:84%
However, it can be
very dangerous to work

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:39.020 align:middle line:84%
on this region
without having already

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.360 align:middle line:90%
cleared up the lower two areas.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.870 align:middle line:84%
People can go mad if they aren't
clear of habitual thoughts

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:46.580 align:middle line:90%
and beliefs.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:50.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Another ancient system of
healing with crystals is Vedic

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:54.080 align:middle line:84%
gemology, which prescribes
a specific gem based

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.740 align:middle line:84%
on your Vedic birth chart to
balance out any challenging

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:01.820 align:middle line:84%
tendencies within you, transmute
any karma you don't want,

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:05.660 align:middle line:84%
and boost your positive inner
resources so you can live

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.310 align:middle line:90%
your best life.

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>> In Vedic gemology, there are
nine precious gemstones that

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:14.720 align:middle line:84%
correspond with the nine
planets in the solar system.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.260 align:middle line:84%
When the sun is a beneficial
influence for the wearer's

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.690 align:middle line:84%
astrological chart,
the sun can be

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:24.760 align:middle line:84%
strengthened with a Vedic
astrological quality ruby.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.100 align:middle line:84%
Ruby is considered
the king of gems.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:32.150 align:middle line:84%
This can promote brilliance,
empowerment, respect,

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.340 align:middle line:90%
recognition, fame.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:38.780 align:middle line:84%
It can help with integration
with the divine and the highest

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.860 align:middle line:84%
sense of self, one's true
potential and authority

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.330 align:middle line:90%
in all areas of life.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.780 align:middle line:84%
The second gem we're going to
discuss is pearl for the moon.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Moon often is used to
directly represent ourselves

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.060 align:middle line:90%
in Vedic astrology.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:55.190 align:middle line:84%
But it's more of
the emotional side,

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:58.040 align:middle line:90%
the psyche, the inner workings.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:01.670 align:middle line:84%
So the moon overall
signifies our emotions,

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:05.510 align:middle line:84%
the watery changing
cyclical energy of them.

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And moon also relates to mother
figures and higher intuition.

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:14.360 align:middle line:84%
When we wear a pearl, if
it's a beneficial influence

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:18.320 align:middle line:84%
for the wearer's chart and its
proper astrological quality,

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:23.030 align:middle line:84%
it can lead to greater
emotional balance, peace,

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:28.460 align:middle line:84%
clearer intuition, states of
ease, benefit to mother figures

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:29.660 align:middle line:90%
and home life.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.390 align:middle line:90%


00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:36.560 align:middle line:84%
When mercury is a beneficial
planet in the wearer's

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.960 align:middle line:84%
astrological chart,
they can strengthen it

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.180 align:middle line:90%
by wearing a Vedic emeralds.

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:44.690 align:middle line:84%
The reported benefits usually
revolve around clarity.

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:48.200 align:middle line:84%
Clarity of the mind, sharper
communication skills,

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.390 align:middle line:90%
enhanced wit and humor.

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:54.350 align:middle line:84%
Also business success and travel
success, more efficient travel.

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And overall, just more rapid
processing of information.

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:05.090 align:middle line:84%
Mars is the planet of physical
endurance, assertiveness,

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:09.140 align:middle line:84%
courage, strength, and
overcoming battles.

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:13.220 align:middle line:84%
If Mars is a beneficial
influence for the wearer

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.850 align:middle line:84%
and it will keep them in a state
of balance to wear a red coral,

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:20.450 align:middle line:84%
it can produce more courage
and physical strength

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:26.535 align:middle line:84%
and motivation and vitality and
athletic ability and victory

00:11:26.535 --> 00:11:27.335 align:middle line:90%
over conflict.

00:11:27.335 --> 00:11:31.400 align:middle line:90%


00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:35.810 align:middle line:84%
Venus is the planet
of love and astrology.

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:41.510 align:middle line:84%
It also overlords creativity
and fine arts and beauty.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:44.690 align:middle line:84%
If Venus is a beneficial
influence in the wearer's

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:47.660 align:middle line:84%
astrological chart, they can
strengthen it even further

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:49.670 align:middle line:90%
by wearing a Vedic diamond.

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:52.790 align:middle line:84%
The most common benefits of
diamond are enhanced and more

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:54.860 align:middle line:90%
fulfilling relationships.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.740 align:middle line:90%
Increased creative potential.

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.010 align:middle line:90%
More luxury.

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:03.510 align:middle line:84%
More refinement and
fulfillment in day-to-day life.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Saturn is one of the most
misunderstood planets

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.120 align:middle line:90%
in all forms of astrology.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.670 align:middle line:84%
People fear its
power because it's

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:14.400 align:middle line:84%
very heavy and prevalent
and noticeable.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.260 align:middle line:90%
And it can be very intense.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.000 align:middle line:90%
Saturn can bring consequence.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.890 align:middle line:84%
But it's usually in response
to idleness or laziness

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:27.600 align:middle line:84%
or incoherence or carelessness
in a person's life.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.580 align:middle line:84%
Excellent results
can be achieved

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:33.090 align:middle line:84%
if channeling Saturn energy
into the wearer's body

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:34.710 align:middle line:90%
is done wisely.

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:37.620 align:middle line:84%
If Saturn is a
beneficial planet,

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:41.310 align:middle line:84%
they can wear an astrological
quality blue sapphire.

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:46.920 align:middle line:84%
This can bring about an increase
in focus and self-discipline,

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:50.730 align:middle line:84%
greater work ethic,
organization, commitment,

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:55.060 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual development.

00:12:55.060 --> 00:13:00.160 align:middle line:84%
Jupiter is considered one of the
greatest beneficial influences

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.500 align:middle line:90%
in all forms of astrology.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:06.340 align:middle line:84%
Where Saturn is associated
with constriction,

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:09.790 align:middle line:84%
Jupiter is associated
with expansion.

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:13.660 align:middle line:84%
It represents the generous, the
benevolent side of humanity.

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.750 align:middle line:84%
If Jupiter is a beneficial
influence in the wearer's

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.660 align:middle line:84%
astrological chart, they can
strengthen it even further

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.640 align:middle line:90%
with a Vedic yellow sapphire.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:28.090 align:middle line:84%
This will promote wealth
expansion, wisdom, education,

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:31.210 align:middle line:84%
health of children,
and generosity

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.150 align:middle line:84%
towards others, which comes
around karmically pretty

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:36.780 align:middle line:90%
full circle.

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Rahu and Ketu are
not actually planets,

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:44.460 align:middle line:84%
but technically, they're
mathematical points in space.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:47.070 align:middle line:84%
They're known as the
north and south nodes.

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:50.130 align:middle line:84%
But in Vedic astrology,
they're known as Rahu and Ketu

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:53.550 align:middle line:84%
if it's appropriate for the
wearer's astrological chart.

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:56.400 align:middle line:84%
A hessonite, the
gemstone for Rahu

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.400 align:middle line:84%
can bring about a
sense of protection,

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:03.690 align:middle line:84%
and it can also bring
about wealth and fame.

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:06.810 align:middle line:84%
Ketu or the south
node of the moon

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:10.620 align:middle line:84%
represents enlightenment,
liberation,

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:13.980 align:middle line:84%
detachment from anything
that may be holding us

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:15.750 align:middle line:90%
down in the material world.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And in certain contexts, it
can be appropriate for somebody

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:22.200 align:middle line:84%
to strengthen Ketu
with a Vedic cat's eye.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:26.820 align:middle line:84%
But we have to be very careful
because out of balance, this

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:31.620 align:middle line:84%
can create an increase in
detachment and eccentricity

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:34.500 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't meld or
relate to society.

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:37.690 align:middle line:84%
So for spiritual
monks who are looking

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:40.480 align:middle line:84%
for this liberation
from attachment,

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.860 align:middle line:90%
it can be a great stone.

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:44.620 align:middle line:84%
But for most people
trying to integrate more

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:47.470 align:middle line:84%
in their day-to-day lives
and in the material world,

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:51.670 align:middle line:84%
I exercise a great deal of
caution with this gemstone.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:55.510 align:middle line:84%
>> In addition to the highly
specific and powerful functions

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:59.650 align:middle line:84%
of Vedic gems, there are many
other quick and accessible ways

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:03.890 align:middle line:84%
to find a crystal that
truly supports you.

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I might go into a New Age
shop to look for a stone that

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:08.930 align:middle line:90%
will attract love into my life.

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:11.960 align:middle line:84%
I look at the signs around
all the various stones

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.790 align:middle line:84%
and I see that rose
quartz is the one.

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:15.140 align:middle line:90%
It's the one I need.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:16.490 align:middle line:90%
And this is true.

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:18.890 align:middle line:90%
Rose quartz can attract love.

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:20.810 align:middle line:90%
But there's more to it.

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:23.960 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that I am having
difficulty attracting love

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.550 align:middle line:90%
in the first place?

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:28.820 align:middle line:84%
I need to take the time
to look inside objectively

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:30.710 align:middle line:90%
to understand the obstacle.

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:32.760 align:middle line:90%
Am I a very rigid person?

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:36.320 align:middle line:84%
Am I very set in my ways,
unable to bend my routines

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.880 align:middle line:90%
to accommodate others?

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Is there room for
someone else in my life?

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:42.650 align:middle line:90%
Am I fearful of intimacy?

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:45.320 align:middle line:84%
Do I have a history
of sexual trauma?

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Do I tend to be very irritable
if someone challenges

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:51.260 align:middle line:84%
my habitual behavior so
that I'm uncomfortable

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:52.550 align:middle line:90%
in a relationship?

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.880 align:middle line:84%
Does it make me feel not
good enough, inadequate?

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Rose quartz doesn't address
any of these particular issues.

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:02.330 align:middle line:84%
But there are other
stones that do.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:06.410 align:middle line:84%
So this is how we start
intelligently combining stones.

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:08.360 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I want love.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.020 align:middle line:84%
So I put a chunk or sphere of
rose quartz in the bedroom.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:16.190 align:middle line:84%
Every time I go in, I'm reminded
this is the priority in my life

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:17.060 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.660 align:middle line:84%
If I'm rigid, I can use a
stone with no structure,

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:23.330 align:middle line:90%
an amorphous stone like opal.

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.790 align:middle line:84%
I can wear it as a
pendant touching the skin

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:29.420 align:middle line:84%
at the center of my chest
to help me relax my tightly

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:32.300 align:middle line:90%
held views, my judgments.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:35.300 align:middle line:84%
Clear quartz is one of
the most important healing

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:36.800 align:middle line:90%
crystals for several reasons.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.590 align:middle line:84%
Number one, quartz
is an amplifier.

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:42.140 align:middle line:84%
Quartz will take in the
energy that's given to it,

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:45.410 align:middle line:84%
and then put a resonant
amplified field back.

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:49.400 align:middle line:84%
It really magnifies the
light that shines through it.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.400 align:middle line:84%
Quartz also has its own
electrical properties.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:57.260 align:middle line:84%
So for example if it's exposed
to an electromagnetic field,

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.660 align:middle line:84%
that electromagnetic
field will actually

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.700 align:middle line:84%
distort the lattice
inside the quartz.

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:04.829 align:middle line:84%
And then when it's
released, we get

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:06.660 align:middle line:84%
what's called the
piezoelectric effect.

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.910 align:middle line:84%
So then the quartz
will start to put out

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:11.520 align:middle line:84%
its own electric
resonant energy.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.579 align:middle line:84%
We are bioelectric
beings as well.

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:17.819 align:middle line:84%
And we have electromagnetic
field that our bodies put off.

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:20.730 align:middle line:84%
As we're sending energy
through the quartz,

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:23.339 align:middle line:84%
we're flowing this kind
of electromagnetic energy.

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And then the quartz
can help amplify

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:28.020 align:middle line:90%
that with its own properties.

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And then because
quartz is clear,

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:36.870 align:middle line:84%
it is said metaphysically to
channel that pure white light

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:41.130 align:middle line:84%
or that source of light from
the highest spiritual self.

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:43.080 align:middle line:90%
That highest spiritual energy.

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And so quartz just takes
that energy in and flows it,

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:49.890 align:middle line:84%
but brings it through
in an amplified way.

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And so quartz is really
powerful for just channeling

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.930 align:middle line:90%
that pure white light.

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Clear quartz has the
same molecular structure

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:03.960 align:middle line:84%
as the first energy field
around the human being,

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.940 align:middle line:90%
which is called the etheric web.

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Thus, the crystal quartz will
naturally and automatically

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.130 align:middle line:84%
heal the etheric web by
bringing an appropriately

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:17.610 align:middle line:84%
purified clear quartz
through the etheric web,

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:21.150 align:middle line:84%
we give the person what
is called a crystal bath.

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:23.640 align:middle line:84%
This will start
and often complete

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.720 align:middle line:84%
healing of the etheric web
if it has holes, tears,

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:28.860 align:middle line:90%
or imbalances.

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:34.340 align:middle line:90%


00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.860 align:middle line:84%
>>Black tourmaline
is so practical,

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:40.580 align:middle line:84%
I always use it in my crystal
healing layouts for grounding.

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:44.510 align:middle line:84%
They are loving, friendly,
supplying us with light force

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:47.420 align:middle line:84%
while they diligently
recycle dense energies

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.610 align:middle line:90%
into positive ones.

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:53.750 align:middle line:84%
Black tourmaline possess both
pyroelectric and piezoelectric

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:55.190 align:middle line:90%
qualities.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:58.670 align:middle line:84%
Black tourmaline can
balance polarities.

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:00.800 align:middle line:84%
They stimulate
the nervous system

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:05.730 align:middle line:84%
and purifies the aura from
all kinds of energetic debris.

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:08.070 align:middle line:84%
It also has the added
benefit of being

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:10.440 align:middle line:84%
an antioxidant with
a trace mineral

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.410 align:middle line:90%
boron found in its composition.

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:15.690 align:middle line:84%
Black tourmaline
is gifted when it

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:17.820 align:middle line:84%
comes to transmuting
negative energy

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:21.540 align:middle line:90%
into usable positive energy.

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:25.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Azurite is a wonderful
stone for the eyes.

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:28.320 align:middle line:84%
When we get eyestrain from
looking into the computer too

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.870 align:middle line:84%
much at night
before sleep, we can

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:32.580 align:middle line:90%
place small pieces of azurite.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:37.290 align:middle line:84%
They call these blueberries on
the inner corner of the eye.

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:40.920 align:middle line:84%
Its chemical composition is
copper and water, both of which

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.620 align:middle line:84%
are very effective
conductors of energy.

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:47.040 align:middle line:84%
The water additionally helps
hydrate the eyes to help

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.260 align:middle line:90%
cool them off and moisten them.

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Because of its
chemical composition,

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:55.410 align:middle line:84%
it's also a good stone for
acute injuries or after surgery,

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:57.240 align:middle line:90%
or for any area of pain.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.700 align:middle line:84%
Any stone with high
copper content,

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:03.420 align:middle line:84%
such as malachite or chrysocolla
can be used for this purpose.

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.040 align:middle line:84%
These two are almost
better than azurite,

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:09.370 align:middle line:84%
because it's easier to get
them in a polished state.

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:13.030 align:middle line:84%
You can use them to massage
the injured painful area

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:16.980 align:middle line:90%
or to gently rub scar tissue.

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:21.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Azurite and red coral,
and I use them most often

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:23.700 align:middle line:84%
because they work
directly with the bones.

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And with alleviating
pain in tendons

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:29.310 align:middle line:90%
and bones and articulations.

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:34.080 align:middle line:84%
For example, if I have a broken
arm here, I had it broken once,

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:38.340 align:middle line:84%
I bring the red coral
like this along the bone.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And what it does is it
enhances the multiplication

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:47.010 align:middle line:90%
of the creation of bone cells.

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:51.570 align:middle line:84%
So your fracture heals
like two times faster.

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And then with the
azurite, same thing.

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:54.840 align:middle line:90%
You take away the pain.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Tendonitis with azurite,
it's gone almost in minutes.

00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:03.630 align:middle line:90%


00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Hematite is a powerful ally
and premium grounding stone

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:10.680 align:middle line:84%
which supports our
connection to Mother Earth.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:14.790 align:middle line:84%
Hematite helps us to establish
healthy personal boundaries,

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:17.820 align:middle line:84%
and encourage us to take
life into our own hands

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.370 align:middle line:90%
with focus and confidence.

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Hematite gathers wandering,
confused, and ungrounded

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:28.440 align:middle line:84%
energies, dissolves
negativity, and draws it down

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.180 align:middle line:90%
for integration.

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:33.870 align:middle line:84%
With a stable and secure
base grounded and connected

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:36.030 align:middle line:84%
to earth, we have
the possibility

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:38.670 align:middle line:84%
to soar higher into
the astral realms

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:41.580 align:middle line:90%
and beyond without getting lost.

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Hematite is good to carry
on airplanes for jet lag,

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:51.300 align:middle line:84%
for daydreamers,
sleepwalkers, before and after

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:54.240 align:middle line:84%
anesthesia or any time
life presents itself

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:58.620 align:middle line:84%
with intense, shocking,
or stressful situations.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Hematite keeps all the subtle
bodies linked to the material

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.830 align:middle line:90%
plane, so we can be present.

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:09.790 align:middle line:84%
Hematite's gray,
black, silver ray

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:13.480 align:middle line:84%
conceals the red ray,
which is revealed

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.940 align:middle line:84%
when it is rubbed
against a streak plate

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:17.470 align:middle line:90%
or in the stone grinder.

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:20.890 align:middle line:84%
The bright red dust left
behind gives hematite

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:22.420 align:middle line:90%
the name bloodstone.

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And being 70% iron
and 30% oxygen

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:30.970 align:middle line:84%
is known to revitalize the
blood, the circulatory system,

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:34.960 align:middle line:84%
and support blood related
issues in general.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:38.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Crystals really
want to serve.

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.325 align:middle line:90%
They want to serve.

00:22:39.325 --> 00:22:42.460 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of the reasons
why I think they're so popular

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:45.130 align:middle line:90%
and they're so universal.

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's going to
benefit from working with them.

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:51.550 align:middle line:84%
>> With hundreds of
crystals on our planet,

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:55.270 align:middle line:84%
finding out which one is the
best match for you could feel

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:56.330 align:middle line:90%
overwhelming.

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:59.020 align:middle line:84%
As explained by our
experts, crystals

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:01.300 align:middle line:84%
and their infinite
array of properties

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:05.080 align:middle line:84%
are truly spectacular allies
and friends that can help us,

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:08.470 align:middle line:84%
that are all around us, and
that have been here all along.
