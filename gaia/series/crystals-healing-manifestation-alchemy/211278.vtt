based upon 17 elements that
are called rare Earth elements.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And they are called
rare Earth elements

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.380 align:middle line:84%
because they are found in very
few locations on the Earth,

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.470 align:middle line:84%
primarily deposits
in China, Russia,

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:05.350 align:middle line:84%
a little bit in Australia, and
a little bit in North America.

These are the foundations
of solar panels.

And this is one of the places
of concern for where technology

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.750 align:middle line:84%
is going because so
much of the technology

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:23.710 align:middle line:84%
is relying upon
crystalline elements that

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:28.840 align:middle line:84%
are relatively rare and in
short supply on our planet.

>> Crystals have become so much
a part of our technology that--

00:09:32.515 --> 00:09:35.420 align:middle line:84%
I recall back in
2003, that there

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:39.860 align:middle line:84%
was a statistic that showed
that over two billion crystals

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.770 align:middle line:84%
per year were being
generated or manufactured

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:48.450 align:middle line:84%
in laboratories in order to
be used for our technology.

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:51.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Most of the crystals used
in modern technology are now

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:52.880 align:middle line:90%
lab-created.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Of course, natural
quartz crystals

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:58.340 align:middle line:84%
were used in the beginning of
radio and computer technology.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:01.970 align:middle line:84%
But they have long been replaced
with synthetic crystals, which

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:05.840 align:middle line:84%
being free from flaws
make them more efficient.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Lab-grown crystals are a
newer phenomenon, obviously.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:12.860 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's
two ways to see it.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:18.540 align:middle line:84%
On one hand, by doing the
crystals in a laboratory,

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.860 align:middle line:84%
we're not mining those
crystals out of the Earth.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:26.030 align:middle line:84%
So it is more eco-friendly
in that sense.

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:29.690 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, the crystals in a
laboratory are more controlled.

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:31.970 align:middle line:84%
So their growth conditions
are more controlled,

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:36.150 align:middle line:84%
which allows for them to have
more perfected structures.

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:39.800 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, our
silicon-based chips

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.490 align:middle line:84%
that go into all of our
technology of our computers

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:48.230 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, those are a
very regular perfected array,

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:51.800 align:middle line:84%
like almost depositing
one atom at a time

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.800 align:middle line:84%
to create such a
perfect crystal.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.350 align:middle line:84%
So from a technological
perspective,

00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:59.585 align:middle line:84%
I think a lab-grown
crystal is great.

it brings a certain radiance.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.040 align:middle line:84%

in our makeup-- and we have
these mineral-based makeups--

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.610 align:middle line:84%
to our energy, according
to our intentions,

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:48.490 align:middle line:84%
and according to some
of the way in which

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:51.250 align:middle line:84%
we're having a conversation
with them, both energetically,

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:54.820 align:middle line:84%
as well as through our
thoughts and our words.

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:57.790 align:middle line:84%
>> What you need to know is
that the crystal will amplify

00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:00.220 align:middle line:84%
and transform all
types of energy--

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.260 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic energy,
emotional energy,

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.310 align:middle line:84%
mental energy, and
healing energy.

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:08.230 align:middle line:84%
If crystals aren't
being utilized

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:10.780 align:middle line:84%
in ways that are
conducive and beneficial,

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.859 align:middle line:90%
it can be detrimental.

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:16.670 align:middle line:84%
So it's very important to know
that crystals don't choose

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:18.609 align:middle line:90%
what they amplify or transform.

00:17:18.609 --> 00:17:21.890 align:middle line:84%
The crystal matrix does
not have free will.

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:24.170 align:middle line:90%
Only humankind has free will.

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:27.710 align:middle line:84%
Thus, only appropriate
use of the crystal

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:30.090 align:middle line:90%
will determine its usefulness.

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:32.810 align:middle line:84%
We have to be careful
how we use them,

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:34.490 align:middle line:90%
as crystals don't discriminate.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I think intention is
critically important when

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:43.490 align:middle line:84%
working with gems and crystals
to ensure that the results that

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:46.880 align:middle line:84%
we have uplift ourselves
and those around us.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.010 align:middle line:10%
It's on behalf of
the greater good.

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:51.980 align:middle line:84%
The use of crystals
to uplift humanity

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:55.170 align:middle line:84%
has been going on for
thousands of years.

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:57.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm a Vedic
gemologist, which means

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:58.760 align:middle line:84%
that I work with
gems and crystals

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.940 align:middle line:84%
to channel very specific
light and cosmic rays

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.440 align:middle line:90%
into the wearer.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.230 align:middle line:84%
I have people calling me from
all over the world looking

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:08.210 align:middle line:84%
to make their lives better
and the lives better

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:09.380 align:middle line:90%
of those around them.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And when our intentions
are in alignment

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:14.600 align:middle line:84%
with the best possible outcome
for everybody involved,

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.800 align:middle line:84%
not only do the gems
work a lot better,

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.160 align:middle line:84%
it's a lot more fun
for me to do it.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Intention is very important
when working with crystals,

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:26.000 align:middle line:84%
perhaps not so much in guiding
the crystals to do their work,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.110 align:middle line:84%
but in being very clear about
what we want to accomplish with

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.910 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:33.170 align:middle line:10%
For example, someone is
dealing with a lot of anxiety.

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:36.320 align:middle line:10%
There are many stones that
can be used to treat anxiety.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.240 align:middle line:90%
So how do I differentiate?

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:42.290 align:middle line:84%
Why would I choose amethyst
over chrysocolla, for example?

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Specifically, I need to
know, does this person

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:49.130 align:middle line:84%
have anxiety because they're
overworked and stressed?

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:51.500 align:middle line:84%
I would use amethyst
in that case.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.870 align:middle line:84%
Or does this person have
anxiety because they

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:56.330 align:middle line:84%
have a fundamental
fear of the world?

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:59.300 align:middle line:84%
In that case, I would
use chrysocolla.

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.730 align:middle line:84%
Understanding the root
cause of the anxiety

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:05.240 align:middle line:84%
helps to clarify our intention
and to choose a stone that will

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.400 align:middle line:90%
best support that intention.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, when
we're working as healers,

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.600 align:middle line:84%
our underlying
intention is always

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.550 align:middle line:84%
to try to help our client
in the best way possible.

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:17.150 align:middle line:84%
>> I often tell people that
I'm in the karma business.

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:19.520 align:middle line:10%
What we do is going
out in the world,

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.320 align:middle line:10%
and coming back around, and
making a significant impact.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:26.270 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody is going to use
a gemstone for something that

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:28.010 align:middle line:84%
is out of alignment
with the greater good

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:31.130 align:middle line:84%
or with an ill intention,
that really can backfire.

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:33.290 align:middle line:84%
It can come back
around and cause

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:35.390 align:middle line:84%
types of karma and
repercussions that

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:39.573 align:middle line:84%
are even worse than the original
intention could have predicted.

00:19:39.573 --> 00:19:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>> The best advice that I have
for people who want to work

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:46.400 align:middle line:84%
with crystals is to treat
those crystals like friends,

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.110 align:middle line:90%
even treat them like people.

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:49.520 align:middle line:90%
Talk to them.

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.410 align:middle line:90%
Connect with them.

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:52.550 align:middle line:90%
Hold them.

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:53.750 align:middle line:90%
Care for them.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:56.570 align:middle line:90%
And work with them intuitively.

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:58.050 align:middle line:90%
They are unique.

00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:01.640 align:middle line:10%
So we want to get to know each
one just like you're trying

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.200 align:middle line:10%
to get to know a unique person.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.850 align:middle line:10%
Who is this person?

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:07.850 align:middle line:84%
So this is the best way
to work with crystals.

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:11.062 align:middle line:84%
And you may be drawn to
a particular crystal,

00:20:11.062 --> 00:20:12.020 align:middle line:90%
and you don't know why.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.570 align:middle line:84%
But as you connect
with that crystal

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:17.340 align:middle line:84%
and develop a relationship
with that crystal,

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:20.690 align:middle line:90%
you will learn why in time.

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:23.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Our lives are being
improved, and we're beginning

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:26.510 align:middle line:10%
to understand a deeper
relationship to ourselves

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:29.610 align:middle line:10%
and to the cosmos through the
use of crystals and crystalline

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:30.410 align:middle line:10%
