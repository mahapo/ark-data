00:01:45.885 --> 00:01:48.690 align:middle line:10%
there are so many different
ways that they can form,

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.760 align:middle line:10%

different classifications.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.360 align:middle line:84%

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And those classes are
made from crystal systems.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.410 align:middle line:90%
And there are seven.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>> These seven are based
on the actual lattice types

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:05.980 align:middle line:90%
of structures.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.720 align:middle line:84%
So the lattice structure
is the specific geometry

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.950 align:middle line:84%
that the atoms or molecules
will arrange themselves around.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.580 align:middle line:10%
And this type of
geometry then determines

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.410 align:middle line:10%
the family, or the sort of
group, of crystal types.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.080 align:middle line:84%
For example, one of them
is called triclinic,

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.780 align:middle line:90%
such as kyanite and turquoise.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.090 align:middle line:84%
There's one that's
called monoclinic.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.970 align:middle line:84%
So, for example,
malachite and moonstone

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.920 align:middle line:90%
are monoclinic crystals.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.600 align:middle line:84%
Another is orthorhombic,
such as topaz and sulfur.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.490 align:middle line:90%
There's rhombohedral.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.220 align:middle line:84%
Or sometimes, rhombohedral
is also called trigonal.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And so like calcite and ruby
and sapphire are rhombohedral.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And the hexagonal
crystals are, for example,

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.000 align:middle line:90%
quartz, all the quartz crystals.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And emerald is another
example of a hexagonal.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they even
form with six sides

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.160 align:middle line:84%
because of that hexagonal
lattice structure.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And then the final one is
cubic, or sometimes they

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.260 align:middle line:90%
call it isometric.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.230 align:middle line:90%
So for example, pyrite is cubic.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And diamond is a
particular type of cubic.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So each of these seven
crystal classes has many

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.990 align:middle line:90%
subclasses that are used.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.220 align:middle line:84%

the symmetry, the internal
symmetry within the crystals

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.450 align:middle line:90%
themselves--

metamorphic, or sedimentary,
knowing how and where a stone

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:07.230 align:middle line:84%
was formed is important to have
a better understanding of how

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:08.820 align:middle line:90%
to use it.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.990 align:middle line:90%
Obsidian is a good example.

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:13.470 align:middle line:84%
At some point in the
very distant past,

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:16.500 align:middle line:84%
when the Earth was going through
one of its tumultuous periods

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.670 align:middle line:84%
of change, superheated
magma started building up

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:22.740 align:middle line:90%
under the crust of the Earth.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.820 align:middle line:84%
More and more, the heat and
the pressure intensified.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And then a point of weakness
in the crust began to give way,

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:33.240 align:middle line:84%
and all that magma was
finally able to move

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.250 align:middle line:84%
from deep within the Earth
up through the crust.

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And finally, still
intensely hot and pushed

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:44.640 align:middle line:84%
by tremendous pressure, it
burst up and out into the air.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.760 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, the very hot
material was subjected

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.800 align:middle line:90%
to a very cold temperature.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.720 align:middle line:90%
It was shocked by the cold.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.650 align:middle line:84%
It changed from molten,
liquefied, silica-rich material

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:56.820 align:middle line:90%
to glass.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.690 align:middle line:84%
So what does this
tell us about its use?

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Obsidian retains the energetic
history of what happened to it

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.260 align:middle line:84%
and communicates that
story to the body.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.130 align:middle line:84%
It helps bring warmth
from deep inside the body

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:12.270 align:middle line:90%
toward the surface.

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:15.960 align:middle line:84%
Because the stone was subjected
to such radical change,

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.030 align:middle line:90%
it understands shock.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:20.610 align:middle line:84%

acutely traumatized,

their energy is in
a state of stasis.

It's like they're frozen.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Holding obsidian will help
move and warm their energy

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:30.900 align:middle line:84%
so that it can begin
to circulate again.

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:35.130 align:middle line:84%
The stone has other uses,
as well, but almost all

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.500 align:middle line:84%
are somehow related
to bringing energy

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.620 align:middle line:84%
to the surface of the body,
which ultimately helps

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.240 align:middle line:10%

My boundaries got
so strong, I started

being a little bit
rude to people.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.890 align:middle line:84%

But by that time, I was pretty
much done with the work.

where the crystal was

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:41.630 align:middle line:90%
connected to the Earth matrix.

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:44.660 align:middle line:84%
Single generators are
excellent programming crystals

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:46.340 align:middle line:90%
to place on the altar.

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.250 align:middle line:84%
The crystal will project
and amplify your prayers

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:50.700 align:middle line:90%
into the universe.

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:54.680 align:middle line:84%
It is important to only
work with good thoughts,

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.800 align:middle line:84%
as the crystal will
magnify your intentions

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.830 align:middle line:84%
and will return the
energy back to you.

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:03.680 align:middle line:84%
Double-terminated
crystals like this one

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:07.130 align:middle line:84%
have two termination
points on opposite ends,

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:10.280 align:middle line:84%
and energy can move
through them rapidly.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.650 align:middle line:84%
On a crystal healing
layout on the body,

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:15.319 align:middle line:84%
they are ideal for
placing in between chakras

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:19.950 align:middle line:84%
when you would like to connect,
bridge, and move energy.

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:24.839 align:middle line:84%
Double-terminated crystals have
balanced polarity, teaching us

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:26.520 align:middle line:90%
how to maintain balance.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:31.210 align:middle line:84%
They're also practical tools
for developing telepathy.

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:37.300 align:middle line:84%
Clusters are many single
generators living together,

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.400 align:middle line:90%
sharing a common base.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.190 align:middle line:84%
They create a strong
energetic field as light

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:45.610 align:middle line:84%
bounces off of each other,
reflecting a lot of light

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:47.560 align:middle line:90%
into the room wherever they are.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:51.100 align:middle line:84%
They act as a negative ionizer
and can be placed in a room

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:56.290 align:middle line:84%
to clear the energetic
aftermath of an argument or just

00:17:56.290 --> 00:18:00.010 align:middle line:84%
bringing in more light
and joy into a room.

>> So in modern times, one
of the pioneers in opening

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:24.670 align:middle line:10%
the door to our
relationship with crystals

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:28.030 align:middle line:10%
and the technological age was
from a brilliant innovator.

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:29.510 align:middle line:90%
His name was Marcel Vogel.

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:31.750 align:middle line:90%
He was an IBM scientist.

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:34.630 align:middle line:84%
When he began to
understand the properties

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:36.970 align:middle line:84%
of crystalline
substances and what

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:40.690 align:middle line:84%
they mean in terms of
electrical information, in terms

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:42.880 align:middle line:84%
of electromagnetic
information, and, specifically,

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.140 align:middle line:90%
in terms of light.

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:46.120 align:middle line:84%
He was fascinated by
the way that light

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:49.330 align:middle line:84%
would move through very
specific quartz crystals.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And he began to optimize
those, eventually building

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:56.330 align:middle line:84%
his own crystals, growing his
own, cutting his own crystals,

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:59.950 align:middle line:84%
and what is now called
the Vogel quartz crystal.

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:04.090 align:middle line:84%
It is a double-terminated quartz
crystal, a point on both ends.

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And he began using these
not only in technology,

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.510 align:middle line:84%
as we understand
it today, but he

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:14.080 align:middle line:84%
began to relate the idea
of the quartz crystal

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:17.900 align:middle line:84%
as a transducer of energy
to facilitate healing

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.990 align:middle line:84%
in the human body, mirroring
what many of our most

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:23.360 align:middle line:84%
ancient and cherished
spiritual traditions

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:29.240 align:middle line:84%
have always alluded to and have
continued to practice today.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.420 align:middle line:84%
Now the science is
catching up with why

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.840 align:middle line:84%
this might be effective
and how it can be even more

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.550 align:middle line:90%
effective in our lives today.

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:40.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Marcel Vogel was a scientist.

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:42.470 align:middle line:84%
He got lots of
patents for his work.

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:45.590 align:middle line:10%
And he realized that
the crystals, not only

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:48.620 align:middle line:10%
do they have these amazing
properties of conductance

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.720 align:middle line:10%
and piezoelectric and
whatnot, but he also

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.310 align:middle line:10%
realized that the
internal lattice

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:55.520 align:middle line:10%
structure of the crystals was
according to the tree of life.

00:19:55.520 --> 00:20:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And he then realized that
they will store energy

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:02.420 align:middle line:90%
within that crystal structure.

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:05.540 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to find a
way to harness what

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:08.750 align:middle line:84%
he called ether physics
and directing that

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:10.590 align:middle line:90%
through the crystals.

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:14.090 align:middle line:84%
He cut different numbers--
so he brought in numerology--

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:16.722 align:middle line:84%
and the facets, or the
sides, of the crystal

00:20:16.722 --> 00:20:17.930 align:middle line:90%
would have different numbers.

00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:20.390 align:middle line:90%
So sometimes it's 16 sides.

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:22.700 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's 22 sides.

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.070 align:middle line:10%
Vogel believed
that it was drawing

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:29.660 align:middle line:10%
in the pure energy from the
ether, or that original source,

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:34.310 align:middle line:10%
and then responding, as well, to
the intention that we give it,

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:37.740 align:middle line:10%
to the energy that we put
in with our own vibration.

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And then it took all of that
and amplified that power

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:44.190 align:middle line:84%
to send it out with
both the sacred geometry

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:47.130 align:middle line:90%
and the numerology involved.

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:50.880 align:middle line:84%
>> A Vogel crystal is a
superior instrument of healing.

It is a quartz
crystal precisely cut

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:58.440 align:middle line:84%
into a double-terminated,
dipyramidal, geometric form,

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:02.280 align:middle line:84%
the female end cut precisely
to the same 51 degrees

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:05.400 align:middle line:84%
as the slope of the
Great Pyramid of Giza.

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.770 align:middle line:84%
This form was
inspired by a vision

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:11.640 align:middle line:84%
Marcel received of the tree
of life from the Kabbalah.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.250 align:middle line:84%
Marcel believed that
love was the glue which

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:17.790 align:middle line:84%
held the universe together and
that our primary responsibility

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:19.860 align:middle line:90%
was to love.

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:23.160 align:middle line:10%
At his psychic research
lab, he discovered

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.710 align:middle line:10%
that thought is
connected to energy

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:28.980 align:middle line:10%
and that the inhaling
and exhaling of breath

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:32.910 align:middle line:10%
is connected to the receiving
and transmitting of thought.

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:35.580 align:middle line:10%
He further discovered that
human thought projects

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:38.250 align:middle line:10%
most powerfully with
a pulse of breath,

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:40.350 align:middle line:10%
like in a yoga Fire Breath.

as well as for structuring
crystallized water.

Refashioning the crystal
into this proper shape

00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:00.720 align:middle line:84%
transformed the crystal
into a quantum converter

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.880 align:middle line:84%
that would extend the
thought and intention

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.800 align:middle line:90%
of the user for healing.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Marcel believed that when these
crystals were used with love,

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:11.100 align:middle line:84%
it made the energy
of the mind coherent

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:15.870 align:middle line:84%
