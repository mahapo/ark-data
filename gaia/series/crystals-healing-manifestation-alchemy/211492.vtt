>> Crystal grids, a
great buzzword nowadays.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.490 align:middle line:84%
We see elaborate, spectacular
layouts of colorful crystals

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.330 align:middle line:84%
pop on almost every
conscious social media page.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Grids are becoming
increasingly trendy

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.990 align:middle line:84%
and are often an unmissable tool
during a new moon manifestation

Not only do grids
look beautiful,

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.350 align:middle line:84%
but they serve a great
amplification purpose

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.810 align:middle line:90%
in any intentional practice.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.870 align:middle line:84%
You can create one

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.150 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, you'll
learn all about crystal grids

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.240 align:middle line:84%
and how they can be
phenomenal collaborators when

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.700 align:middle line:84%

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.870 align:middle line:10%
>> A crystal grid is when
you take various crystals,

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.960 align:middle line:10%
and you'll lay them out
according to a particular

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.270 align:middle line:10%
sacred geometry pattern.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Typically, they are going
to be two-dimensional

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.210 align:middle line:90%
in their patterns.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.470 align:middle line:84%
So for example, you might
pick the four directions,

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:25.850 align:middle line:90%
or you might do a circle.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And you would lay those crystals
in that pattern, that geometry.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And the crystals will draw
the Earth's energy up.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.040 align:middle line:90%
So they'll draw it up.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll create a
container within the room

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.730 align:middle line:84%
or within the space
that is gridded by them.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.570 align:middle line:90%
And they hold that energy.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.620 align:middle line:84%
So as long as that
crystal remains in place

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.290 align:middle line:84%
where it was put, according
to its instruction

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.290 align:middle line:84%
and its intention and the
geometry that was laid down,

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.965 align:middle line:84%
it will hold it in that space
so long as that crystal remains

00:01:55.965 --> 00:01:56.765 align:middle line:90%
undisturbed.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.950 align:middle line:84%
>> A simple way to create a
grid is to have a board or cloth

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.970 align:middle line:84%
with sacred geometry
designs on it,

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.410 align:middle line:84%
such as the Flower of
Life or the Seed of Life,

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.990 align:middle line:84%
as you can place the crystals
you are working with onto

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.020 align:middle line:84%
the points of the design
and create a beautiful grid.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.810 align:middle line:10%
Creating a grid is
kind of like cooking.

If you're familiar with
the metaphysical properties

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.870 align:middle line:10%
of the crystals you are using,
place them with intention.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.420 align:middle line:84%
For example, you may
place rose quartz

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.750 align:middle line:84%
for bringing in more
self-love, self-acceptance,

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.920 align:middle line:90%
and self forgiveness.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.720 align:middle line:10%
And you may place
black tourmaline

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.820 align:middle line:10%
and other dark grounding
stones around it

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.620 align:middle line:10%
so that that
intention is grounded

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.100 align:middle line:10%
into the physical reality.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.540 align:middle line:84%
>> When we make a crystal grid,
we really want to use clear

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.860 align:middle line:84%
quartz crystals, and typically
single-terminated clear quartz

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.030 align:middle line:84%
crystals where the crystals can
be pointing from the Earth up

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.350 align:middle line:84%
so they can draw
that Earth energy up.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that we want
to just use clear quartz

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.670 align:middle line:84%
is we just want to bring
through that pure source

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.660 align:middle line:90%
energy, that pure light.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.040 align:middle line:84%
We just want to anchor
the light into the space.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And the more we can bring
through that pure light

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.960 align:middle line:84%
straight from source, which
the quartz crystals are

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.350 align:middle line:84%
fantastic at doing, the
clear quartz in particular,

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.040 align:middle line:84%
that is going to be the optimal
way to anchor a crystal grid.

rarely use crystal grids,

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.030 align:middle line:84%
except in very specific
ceremonies after which the grid

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.440 align:middle line:90%
is dismantled.

One needs to be very careful

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.430 align:middle line:10%
They have a huge effect on
the electromagnetic field.

of three crystalline components.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.120 align:middle line:84%
The medicine wheel that
I use comes from Sunbear,

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.440 align:middle line:90%
which was a mentor to me.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.080 align:middle line:84%
He was a very important
man in my life.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.180 align:middle line:84%
We start with a
center stone which

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.280 align:middle line:90%
represents the great spirit.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And then we put seven rocks
around the great spirit

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.600 align:middle line:84%
and that is for the sun and
for the moon and for the stars

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.430 align:middle line:84%
and for the Earth People that
we identify with the turtle,

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.820 align:middle line:84%
for the wind people that we
identify with the butterfly,

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.880 align:middle line:84%
for the water people that
we identify with the frog,

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.900 align:middle line:84%
and for the fire people that we
identify with the Thunderbird.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And then we place
the four directions,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.450 align:middle line:84%
which are very important,
starting with the east,

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.410 align:middle line:84%
a stone to the south, a stone to
the west, a stone to the north.

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.370 align:middle line:90%
And then we do these animals.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.800 align:middle line:90%
There's 12 animals.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.620 align:middle line:84%
Within each direction,
there are three animals,

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.450 align:middle line:90%
three spokes, three stones.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.250 align:middle line:90%
And so that makes for 12.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And then they're going
towards center stone

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.030 align:middle line:84%
from each direction stone
you have three stones.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And these stones are the
attributes of that direction.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And then when all of them
have been put into place,

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.630 align:middle line:84%
well, we awaken
that medicine wheel.

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.790 align:middle line:10%
And then the energy
comes from all around.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.410 align:middle line:10%
It's like a microcosm.

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.780 align:middle line:84%
It's like the universe
in a smaller space.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
you go for healing.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.450 align:middle line:84%
That's where you go for
meditation and the ceremony

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.060 align:middle line:90%
and rituals.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.060 align:middle line:84%
>> There's different ways
to make crystal grids.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.510 align:middle line:84%
But the methods that I have
learned through the Mystery

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:59.150 align:middle line:84%
School tradition is that we will
hold the crystals in our hands

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.390 align:middle line:84%
that we want to be
anchoring within the space.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.480 align:middle line:90%
And we have particular chants.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.540 align:middle line:84%
These chants are drawn
from ancient language.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And then based on that
purpose of that grid,

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:16.010 align:middle line:84%
we'll have a particular chant
to instruct the crystals which

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.970 align:middle line:90%
sacred form are they anchoring.

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.440 align:middle line:84%
We walk the particular
geometry out.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.950 align:middle line:84%
We say the particular chant
and those sacred words.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And then we anchor the
crystal in each spot

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.470 align:middle line:84%
that will help then anchor
that particular grid.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.950 align:middle line:84%
So the whole time you're
holding this energy

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.590 align:middle line:84%
as you are charging
up and instructing

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.360 align:middle line:90%
those crystals on what to do.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.980 align:middle line:90%
And then you anchor them.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.120 align:middle line:90%
And you leave them there.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.320 align:middle line:90%
You don't remove them.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.771 align:middle line:90%

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.810 align:middle line:84%
When these crystal grids
are in place within a space,

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.510 align:middle line:84%
it really expands the
energy of the space.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.840 align:middle line:84%
It expands what you can do
within that space as well.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.670 align:middle line:84%
So for example, when I have
anchored sacred geometry

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:05.180 align:middle line:84%
and have anchored the
crystal grids into my space,

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.230 align:middle line:90%
I can do so much more.

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.840 align:middle line:84%
I can work for longer
periods of time.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.470 align:middle line:84%
It gives me a lot more
energy to be able to access.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.818 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like you're
anchoring this container.

00:07:14.818 --> 00:07:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And you've built the energy
up in that container.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.670 align:middle line:84%
So rather than the water
just running through and then

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:21.170 align:middle line:84%
running right out
the drain, it's

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:22.890 align:middle line:90%
being held within that space.

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.440 align:middle line:90%
So it's an amplified field.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And then everything that we
can do within this space,

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:30.650 align:middle line:84%
it will amplify the magic that
we're creating inside of it.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And it will help amplify
and draw the divine energy

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:38.130 align:middle line:84%
into support you in
your creative efforts.

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:43.130 align:middle line:84%
So it will definitely amplify
any process of manifestation

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:44.400 align:middle line:90%
within that space.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.250 align:middle line:84%
So it's amazing to
have it in your home,

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:48.750 align:middle line:84%
in your healing
space, in your office,

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:50.895 align:middle line:84%

for a certain purpose.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:09.930 align:middle line:84%
So today, I am doing a grid for
the healing of Mother Earth.

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:13.681 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:13.681 --> 00:08:15.660 align:middle line:90%


00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.640 align:middle line:84%
In the center is a
chrysocolla sphere

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.260 align:middle line:90%
representing our Mother Earth.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.320 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.110 align:middle line:90%


00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And the rainbow rays
around it, the white ray

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:30.990 align:middle line:84%
is the cosmic ray
coming from the cosmos,

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:33.450 align:middle line:84%
from the great
central sun, bringing

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:37.169 align:middle line:90%
in this white light of healing.

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:40.919 align:middle line:84%
And the black ray
is for taking in all

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:43.080 align:middle line:84%
the heavy, dense
energies from Earth

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.990 align:middle line:84%
and digesting it because
that's what Mother Earth does.

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:50.460 align:middle line:84%
She digests all the heavy energy
that we release into Earth.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.790 align:middle line:84%
The amethyst's
purple violet rays

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:58.020 align:middle line:84%
for bringing in more
wisdom, inspiration,

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.140 align:middle line:84%
higher knowledge,
connection to the soul

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.380 align:middle line:90%
and to our higher selves.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:10.950 align:middle line:10%
The red ray is for bringing in
vitality but in a balanced way,

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:12.990 align:middle line:10%
bringing creativity
for Mother Earth,

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:17.010 align:middle line:10%
for everybody to express their
creativity as best as they can.

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:21.120 align:middle line:84%
The yellow ray is for
the will and for bringing

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.180 align:middle line:84%
in manifestation for everybody
so that they can really

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:27.990 align:middle line:84%
fully manifest their
highest intentions coming

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:31.430 align:middle line:90%
from the violet ray.

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:34.700 align:middle line:84%
The blue ray is for the Earth
as well as for everybody

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:38.180 align:middle line:84%
to express their
truth, to really

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:40.670 align:middle line:84%
be able to speak their
truth, and communicate

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:42.560 align:middle line:90%
what they really mean.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.010 align:middle line:10%
The green ray is for
all the emotions,

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:48.710 align:middle line:10%
the turbulent emotions
going on around the world

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:51.740 align:middle line:10%
that it may be healed, with
the healing green energy

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:55.310 align:middle line:10%
of the trees, of nature.

00:09:55.310 --> 00:10:00.950 align:middle line:10%
And the pink ray is for bringing
in more love to the Earth, more

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:04.790 align:middle line:10%
compassion, forgiveness,
and just unconditional love

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:08.870 align:middle line:10%
for everybody, that everybody
can just be from their heart

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:12.770 align:middle line:10%
and express their love
and unconditional love.

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>> An important part of working
with crystals and creating

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:19.190 align:middle line:84%
grids with them is knowing
how to take care of them.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:23.240 align:middle line:84%
Let's learn how we can best
clean, clear, and charge

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.663 align:middle line:90%
crystals.

00:10:24.663 --> 00:10:27.080 align:middle line:84%
>> The very first thing that
must be done when you receive

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.870 align:middle line:90%
a crystal is to purify it.

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:32.070 align:middle line:90%
Crystals contain information.

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:35.730 align:middle line:84%
It has recorded all the
energies, peoples, events,

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.650 align:middle line:84%
circumstances, and
places where it

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:42.030 align:middle line:84%
has been in contact with
since the moment it was born.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:46.270 align:middle line:84%
If you are using a crystal for
healing, this is not useful.

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:49.440 align:middle line:84%
You need to know exactly
what's in the crystal

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.500 align:middle line:84%
to be able to use it
for healing purposes.

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.890 align:middle line:84%
There is only one
way of doing this.

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:58.750 align:middle line:90%
You take a bowl of water.

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:02.160 align:middle line:84%
It has to be a glass or a
ceramic or a wooden bowl.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.840 align:middle line:90%
You don't want plastic.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.130 align:middle line:90%
You don't want metal.

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:08.980 align:middle line:84%
You have to put pure water or
distilled water or spring water

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:09.780 align:middle line:90%
into that.

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And then you add a pinch
of natural gray sea salt.

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:17.250 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
gray sea salt, you

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:19.770 align:middle line:84%
will notice that it's
all cubes because they

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:21.750 align:middle line:90%
are crystals, soft crystals.

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And when they dissolve in
the water, what this does

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.320 align:middle line:84%
is create an electrical
charge in the water

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.900 align:middle line:84%
molecule that is stronger
than the charge in the crystal

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:32.700 align:middle line:90%
matrix.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.150 align:middle line:84%
This is what will erase
the memory of the crystal.

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:40.260 align:middle line:84%
The first time requires
seven days and seven nights.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.960 align:middle line:84%
This will erase all the
memory of the crystal.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.970 align:middle line:84%
If a crystal is sitting
in one place, for example,

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:47.850 align:middle line:84%
in your home, then
you can purify it

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:49.710 align:middle line:84%
once every month
or every season.

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:51.600 align:middle line:84%
They don't take
on energy as much

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.090 align:middle line:84%
as when you use it
directly with a person.

00:11:54.090 --> 00:12:00.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can use essential
oils to purify the energy

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.850 align:middle line:90%
field around a crystal.

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:07.320 align:middle line:84%
But it won't purify what's
in the crystal, what

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.820 align:middle line:90%
the memory of the crystal is.

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.478 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:11.478 --> 00:12:12.370 align:middle line:90%


00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>> When you receive
or purchase a crystal,

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.650 align:middle line:84%
it's a good idea to
cleanse the crystal first.

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:21.010 align:middle line:84%
There are many ways to cleanse a
crystal, and the most important

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.140 align:middle line:84%
is your intention
of purification.

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.990 align:middle line:10%
One method is the
Marcel Vogel technique

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:28.730 align:middle line:10%
of cleansing the crystal
with your breath,

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:32.240 align:middle line:10%
with a vigorous
exhale, just like that,

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:36.250 align:middle line:10%
making sure you have the
intention, and exhaling.

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.530 align:middle line:84%
Another way of
cleansing crystal is

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:41.890 align:middle line:84%
with burning sage or
sweetgrass or Palo Santo

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:44.390 align:middle line:84%
under the crystal,
moving it back and forth.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:48.310 align:middle line:84%
You can also wash your crystals
in water, in the river,

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:51.350 align:middle line:84%
in the sea, or in any
moving body of water.

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:53.680 align:middle line:84%
But just make sure you
check because some crystals

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:54.580 align:middle line:90%
don't like water.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:57.690 align:middle line:90%
And they may dissolve.

00:12:57.690 --> 00:12:59.340 align:middle line:84%
Placing the crystal
in the morning

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:03.870 align:middle line:84%
sun for not more than two
hours is also a wonderful way,

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.910 align:middle line:90%
or using sound.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.910 align:middle line:84%
You can use a musical
instrument, a crystal bowl,

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:13.600 align:middle line:84%
or a crystal tuning fork
or even your own voice.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.610 align:middle line:84%
For deep cleansing
a crystal, it is

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:18.250 align:middle line:84%
nice to bury the crystal
in the Earth for a few days

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:22.910 align:middle line:84%
or however long you feel
it needs to restore itself.

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:25.840 align:middle line:84%
>> It takes a lot to get
stones out of a mine.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.440 align:middle line:84%
They've been touched by
machines and miners, shippers,

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.530 align:middle line:90%
stone cutters, store employees.

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:35.170 align:middle line:10%
When you get a new stone,
the first thing to do

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:36.520 align:middle line:10%
is cleanse it.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.340 align:middle line:10%
Generally, the recommendation
is to cleanse our stones

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:40.630 align:middle line:10%
with running water.

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:43.960 align:middle line:84%
The running water
continually hitting the stone

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:47.980 align:middle line:84%
energetically jostles
the typical ionic bonding

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:49.750 align:middle line:84%
holding the molecules
of the stone

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:53.860 align:middle line:84%
together, helping them to
release dirty energy that

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.810 align:middle line:90%
may be held inside.

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:58.480 align:middle line:84%
If we are using water
to cleanse our stones,

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.600 align:middle line:84%
we also have to know which
stones can't tolerate water.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.910 align:middle line:84%
Soft stones that
are finely polished,

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:08.350 align:middle line:84%
like a selenite massage tool
or a septarian nodule sphere,

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:11.170 align:middle line:84%
will lose their
smooth, shiny surface

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:13.790 align:middle line:84%
if you leave them in
the water too long.

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:16.490 align:middle line:84%
The sheet micas,
like lepidolite,

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:20.400 align:middle line:84%
will swell and possibly
separate if they're in water.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.690 align:middle line:84%
Some people recommend salt
water to cleanse stones.

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:27.170 align:middle line:84%
The cautions here are for
stones with high water content,

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:32.060 align:middle line:84%
like opal, which can
be killed by the salt.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:34.910 align:middle line:84%
Another method of
cleansing is to use sound.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:39.140 align:middle line:84%
We can use Tibetan cymbals,
singing bowls, or tuning forks.

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:42.440 align:middle line:84%
The sound waves have a similar
effect as flowing water,

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.810 align:middle line:84%
to break up accumulated
energy deposits

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:47.090 align:middle line:90%
in the structure of the stones.

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:49.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Salt water is a
great way to reset gems.

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:51.860 align:middle line:84%
They can absorb a
lot of our energy

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:54.020 align:middle line:84%
and also draw out
a lot of karma.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.880 align:middle line:90%
They can become very heavy.

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:59.490 align:middle line:84%
A quick salt water soak can
reset a gem very quickly.

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:01.790 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
wearing a gemstone

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:05.900 align:middle line:84%
to uplift human consciousness
is not exactly a small job.

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And we find that astrological
gemstones shouldn't

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.630 align:middle line:84%
be transferred to another
owner without a great deal

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:12.740 align:middle line:90%
of resetting.

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.290 align:middle line:84%
We completely recut
out a gemstone

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:17.240 align:middle line:90%
if somebody sells it back to us.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Even then, some gems
make it obvious to us

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.610 align:middle line:84%
that they are retired
from astrological use.

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:25.400 align:middle line:84%
It's subtle, but
it's clear if a gem

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.680 align:middle line:90%
is done with these purposes.

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.710 align:middle line:84%
>> There's three crystals that
I'm aware of that don't need

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:32.510 align:middle line:90%
clearing.

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And these crystals
then become really

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:38.990 align:middle line:84%
good for using them to
help clear other crystals.

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:44.630 align:middle line:84%
So for example, calcite,
selenite, and kyanite

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:47.000 align:middle line:84%
don't really need clearing
because they're just

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.140 align:middle line:90%
kind of self clearing.

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:51.300 align:middle line:84%
So if you get a big slab
of selenite, for example,

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:54.470 align:middle line:84%
you can place your crystals
on that slab of selenite.

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And it will help clear
them, or a slab of calcite

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:57.905 align:middle line:90%
or a slab of kyanite.

00:15:57.905 --> 00:16:01.070 align:middle line:90%

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:06.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Once you have
purified the crystal,

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:09.160 align:middle line:84%
then you need to
energize the crystal.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, energizing the
crystal, you need

to bring it to running water.

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:19.430 align:middle line:84%
You have, in the running water,
an action on the energy field,

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:23.270 align:middle line:84%
the ionic energy field of the
crystal, that will energize it.

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And so you just
let the ocean waves

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:28.780 align:middle line:84%
run over it or the lake waves
or the stream or the river.

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.640 align:middle line:84%
If you're working
with running water,

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.430 align:middle line:84%
you're energizing
it in a neutral way

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:35.320 align:middle line:84%
that only the
crystal is energized,

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.710 align:middle line:84%
not with lunar energy,
not with sun energy, just

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:40.900 align:middle line:84%
neutral energy, exactly
what you need when

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:44.690 align:middle line:90%
you're working with healing.

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:48.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Wearing gems in accordance
with a Muhurta or an auspicious

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:52.040 align:middle line:84%
astrological transit
will amplify its effects.

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:55.520 align:middle line:10%
Chanting the Sanskrit mantras
for that planet when first

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.850 align:middle line:10%
wearing the gem will also
help to make it stronger.

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:03.860 align:middle line:10%
But most importantly, being
100% clear on the intentions

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:07.430 align:middle line:10%
and the predicted results
will make it work the best.

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And lastly, I'm fascinated
with charging gems

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:14.660 align:middle line:84%
on sacred geometrical plates
made out of conductive elements

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.310 align:middle line:90%
like gold or copper.

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:19.310 align:middle line:84%
The Sri Yantra symbol
is very powerful.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And gems seem to really
enjoy spending time

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:23.074 align:middle line:90%
on top of this symbol.

>> Generally, most stones can
be charged by being placed

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:38.280 align:middle line:84%
on a large quartz crystal or
on a cluster of quartz crystal

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.240 align:middle line:90%
for a period of 24 hours.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:44.940 align:middle line:10%
The points of the quartz crystal
come up and give lots of energy

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:47.280 align:middle line:10%
into whatever the stone
is that you put on it.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.560 align:middle line:84%
There are several other
methods of charging

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.030 align:middle line:90%
stones and crystals.

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:53.040 align:middle line:84%
Choosing which one
depends somewhat

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.420 align:middle line:90%
on the nature of the stone.

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:58.140 align:middle line:84%
For example, moonstone, with
its Yin-nourishing quality,

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:01.020 align:middle line:84%
might best be charged
overnight in the moonlight.

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.690 align:middle line:84%
Pearls also benefit
from moonlight.

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And sunstone, with
its very Yang nature,

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:09.360 align:middle line:84%
can be charged for several
hours in the sunlight.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.940 align:middle line:84%
Some stones that have
a relationship to blood

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.030 align:middle line:84%
will benefit from being charged
with a piece of hematite

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:18.840 align:middle line:84%
or in a bowl containing small
tumbled pieces of hematite.

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:21.595 align:middle line:10%
The iron in the hematite
strengthens the stone's effect

00:18:21.595 --> 00:18:22.395 align:middle line:10%
on the blood.

>> After purifying and
energizing your crystal,

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:35.390 align:middle line:84%
you want to wrap
them in red cloth.

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:38.660 align:middle line:84%
The red cloth makes a
natural energy barrier

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:42.710 align:middle line:84%
which will protect your
crystal from all outer energy.

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:45.590 align:middle line:10%
When you put the crystal
into the red cloth

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:48.500 align:middle line:10%
and into the specific
bag so you can recognize

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.410 align:middle line:10%
which crystal is in
that bag, you also

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:53.120 align:middle line:10%
tell the crystal to go to rest.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.700 align:middle line:84%
When you take it out,
you also say, wake up,

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.580 align:middle line:84%
so that the crystal knows
that it starts to work again.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.230 align:middle line:90%
These are conscious beings.

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:01.550 align:middle line:90%

>> The crystals that you are
going to use for healing,

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:13.370 align:middle line:84%
you really want to treat them
well because these crystals are

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:14.330 align:middle line:90%
going to work.

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And they're here
to serve, but there

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.333 align:middle line:84%
needs to be a good
relationship that you

00:19:19.333 --> 00:19:20.750 align:middle line:84%
have with your
crystals, otherwise

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:24.170 align:middle line:84%
they won't be as strong
for doing the healing

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:25.330 align:middle line:90%
work with you.

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:30.660 align:middle line:10%
So the best way to really
take care of your crystals

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:35.950 align:middle line:10%
is to store them on either
an altar or a sacred space.

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:38.730 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to put
them in a box, that's fine.

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:43.060 align:middle line:84%
But make sure it's natural
material, like wood or even

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:43.860 align:middle line:90%
glass.

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:47.060 align:middle line:90%


00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:50.300 align:middle line:10%

ideally we avoid keeping them

in plastic containers.

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:55.580 align:middle line:84%
If possible, store them in
clear glass or wooden containers

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:59.690 align:middle line:84%
or any other container made
from a natural substance.

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:02.810 align:middle line:84%
We have to take care of
our stones with respect.

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:05.870 align:middle line:84%
They're hard, but they're
not indestructible,

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:08.300 align:middle line:84%
especially terminated
crystals can

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.510 align:middle line:84%
be chipped at the termination,
damaging their ability

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:13.010 align:middle line:90%
to project energy.

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:14.690 align:middle line:10%
If we're taking
them on the road,

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:18.050 align:middle line:10%
we have to carefully wrap them
so that they'll be cushioned.

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Also some stones will fade
if left in the sun too long.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.630 align:middle line:90%
Amethyst is a prime example.

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And the Granny Smith
apple green of chrysoprase

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:30.250 align:middle line:90%
also fades in the sun.

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:32.290 align:middle line:84%
>> As our experts
have described,

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:36.070 align:middle line:84%
crystals aren't just phenomenal
for creating powerful grids.

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:39.070 align:middle line:84%
They are also conscious,
living beings.

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:43.090 align:middle line:84%
They must be cared for with the
utmost reverence and respect.

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:47.020 align:middle line:84%
As amplification partners in
any healing or manifestation

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:50.650 align:middle line:84%
practice, it's up to us to
make sure we take care of them

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:54.220 align:middle line:84%
in ways that allow them
to truly take care of us.

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:57.100 align:middle line:84%
Since they are pretty
low-maintenance companions,

00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:01.360 align:middle line:84%
the most important ingredient
and truly the universal thread

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.220 align:middle line:84%
of it all is to
infuse them with love.

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:05.200 align:middle line:90%
Love them.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Invite them to aid you in
your process of evolution

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:12.220 align:middle line:84%
