00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Myths and mysteries shroud
crystals with elusive power

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.810 align:middle line:84%
and purpose, tales of
wish-fulfilling jewels,

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.500 align:middle line:84%
elixirs of life, and advanced
technology of ancient

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.420 align:middle line:90%
civilizations.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.090 align:middle line:84%
What was behind the
obsession with crystals

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.760 align:middle line:84%
like the philosopher's
stone and the Chintamani?

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.040 align:middle line:84%
Were they actual
gems, or were they

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.060 align:middle line:84%
metaphors for an internal
type of treasure?

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Why has it been said that
ancient civilizations

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.900 align:middle line:84%
like Atlantis and
Lemuria ran on crystals?

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.030 align:middle line:84%
Let's follow the
trail of these myths

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.560 align:middle line:84%
to discover the origins
of crystal power.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Native Americans have a
special relationship with

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.610 align:middle line:90%
crystals.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.480 align:middle line:84%
It's important to know that
our oral history here in North

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.900 align:middle line:90%
America goes back 127,000 years.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.770 align:middle line:84%
We are one of the oldest
cultures on Earth.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.370 align:middle line:10%
In Native belief, everything
that is created in the world

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.410 align:middle line:10%
comes from a crystal.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.720 align:middle line:84%
A Cherokee foundation
myth, the one

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.060 align:middle line:84%
that described what
creates the universe,

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.670 align:middle line:84%
places at the very
center of the created

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.980 align:middle line:90%
worlds an enormous crystal.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.440 align:middle line:84%
From every corner
of this crystal

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.310 align:middle line:84%
are seven strands reaching
out into seven other strands

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.280 align:middle line:84%
that each reach out into
seven other strands,

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.940 align:middle line:84%
and thus continuing
into infinity.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.530 align:middle line:84%
What the crystal matrix is doing
is it's holding information.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.470 align:middle line:84%
The whole universe is
based on information.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.850 align:middle line:84%
What you dream about for your
life is often what manifests.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.450 align:middle line:84%
With your thoughts and dreams,
you have given information

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.350 align:middle line:90%
to the world.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.650 align:middle line:84%
That information creates
favorable circumstances

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.840 align:middle line:84%
to manifest what you
want in your life.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.750 align:middle line:84%
Thus the crystals are
dreaming the world

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.770 align:middle line:84%
as they communicate the
information coming from the one

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:15.880 align:middle line:90%
source.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.630 align:middle line:84%
That one source, you can
call it the one light, God,

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.520 align:middle line:84%
great spirit, the
primordial intelligence,

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.750 align:middle line:84%
but what this intelligence
needs to create the world

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.690 align:middle line:84%
is a transmitter,
and the transmitter

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.170 align:middle line:84%
at the center of the universe
is this primordial crystal.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.830 align:middle line:84%
Thus all things
come from crystals.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.480 align:middle line:84%
>> The Atlanteans were said
to have crystal technology.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.080 align:middle line:10%
They used these giant
crystals as power supplies,

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.550 align:middle line:10%
as generators.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And there is one
warning that comes

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.260 align:middle line:84%
with the legends of
Atlantis, because they

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.910 align:middle line:90%
use crystals for everything.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.490 align:middle line:84%
So they really learned how
to harness these crystals.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.180 align:middle line:84%
But because of the greed,
they pushed it too far,

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.180 align:middle line:84%
and the crystals
actually destabilized

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.670 align:middle line:84%
the Earth's magnetic
grid, which then

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.870 align:middle line:84%
led to the Earth changes that
sunk the continent of Atlantis.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.380 align:middle line:10%
And some say that
the strange anomalies

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.810 align:middle line:10%
that happen around the
Bermuda Triangle, where

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.430 align:middle line:10%
the magnetics go all
awry, and ships disappear

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.270 align:middle line:10%
and so forth, is a remnant
of the ancient Atlantean

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.660 align:middle line:10%
technology of crystals
that went awry.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.750 align:middle line:10%
>> The main stone Edgar
Cayce mentioned in relation

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.450 align:middle line:10%
to Atlantis he called Tuaoi.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.910 align:middle line:10%
It was a white ray
opalescent six-faceted stone,

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.880 align:middle line:10%
which guided the
activities generated

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.360 align:middle line:10%
from the temple in
the Atlantis era.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.870 align:middle line:10%
It is said that this
temple was in the Atla,

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.130 align:middle line:10%
in the central
circle of Atlantis.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.460 align:middle line:84%
The light of this stone appeared
as the means of communication

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.410 align:middle line:84%
between infinity and the finite,
like the heaven and the Earth,

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.810 align:middle line:84%
or whereby they
received communications

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.180 align:middle line:84%
with outside
forces, which sounds

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.030 align:middle line:90%
to me like extraterrestrials.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.900 align:middle line:84%
The Tuaoi stone acted as
the central power station,

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.230 align:middle line:84%
radiating energies and
guiding transportation systems

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.710 align:middle line:84%
of levitation, which
would travel through air,

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.970 align:middle line:84%
on water, or under the
water just the same.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.520 align:middle line:84%
It is said that
before Atlantis sank,

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.130 align:middle line:84%
sages and initiates of
the Atlantean mystery

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.890 align:middle line:84%
realized the fate
of the civilization

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.680 align:middle line:84%
and departed to other
lands, carrying with them

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.620 align:middle line:90%
the secret doctrines.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Throughout history, there
has been this obsession with

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.190 align:middle line:90%
magical stones.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.100 align:middle line:84%
You can find it in
Eastern legends as well as

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.210 align:middle line:90%
Western legends.

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.030 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
alchemy, they talk

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.740 align:middle line:90%
about the philosopher's stone.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And the philosopher's stone was
said to be able to transform--

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.450 align:middle line:84%
instantly transform
lead into gold.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.100 align:middle line:84%
It represents the
perfection of the great work

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.190 align:middle line:84%
of the process of transformation
and transmutation.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And they thought that
anyone who possessed

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.040 align:middle line:84%
this philosopher's stone
would be able to heal

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.930 align:middle line:90%
all ailments, any sickness.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.850 align:middle line:90%
They would have eternal life.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.690 align:middle line:84%
They would be able to become
immortalized and perfected

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:18.710 align:middle line:90%
like a god.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.110 align:middle line:84%
So the philosopher's
stone was highly

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.080 align:middle line:84%
sought after because
people wanted eternal life.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.460 align:middle line:90%
People wanted health.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.410 align:middle line:90%
People wanted riches.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And it was almost like
that Midas touch--

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.940 align:middle line:84%
whatever that philosopher's
stone touched,

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.750 align:middle line:84%
it would instantly
transform it and perfect it.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.300 align:middle line:84%
So there's very many
legends like this.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.690 align:middle line:84%
The philosopher's
stone is one example.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Other myths and legends talk
about the Lemurians who escaped

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.140 align:middle line:84%
into the Inner Earth to
restart their civilizations.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:52.700 align:middle line:10%
The mythical city of Shambhala
and the Crystal City of Tomasis

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.050 align:middle line:10%
are both said to exist in giant
caverns within Mother Earth.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.560 align:middle line:84%
It is said there are hidden
entrances, for example

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.230 align:middle line:84%
under the Bucegi
mountain in Romania,

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.590 align:middle line:84%
and portals to access the
advanced transportation

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.130 align:middle line:84%
levitation vehicles, which
travel through tunnels

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.950 align:middle line:84%
and atmosphere generated
by crystal technology

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.410 align:middle line:90%
and advanced knowledge.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.860 align:middle line:84%
The Lemurian crystals were
said to be programmed, hidden,

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.230 align:middle line:84%
and rematerialized
into the Earth

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.180 align:middle line:84%
to resurface for
the right people who

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.220 align:middle line:84%
could attune to the sacred
knowledge stored within them.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.830 align:middle line:84%
Another reading by
Edgar Cayce revealed

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.080 align:middle line:84%
that portions of the
Temple of Atlantis

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.500 align:middle line:84%
may still be discovered off
the coast of Bimini island

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.750 align:middle line:90%
in the Caribbean Sea.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.620 align:middle line:84%
In 1970, near the Bimini
island, Dr. Ray Brown,

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.500 align:middle line:84%
a physician and adventurer,
was on an expedition

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.980 align:middle line:84%
searching for sunken
Spanish galleon treasures.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.700 align:middle line:84%
After a storm and big
hurricane, he was scuba diving,

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.550 align:middle line:84%
and he stumbled upon
ruins and columns,

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:59.470 align:middle line:84%
and saw the top of a pyramid
protruding out of the sand.

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.290 align:middle line:84%
Inside the pyramid,
he discovered a room

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.540 align:middle line:90%
which held a crystal sphere.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.460 align:middle line:84%
The sphere in the
center of the room

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:11.470 align:middle line:84%
was cradled in two metal hands
on top of a pedestal column.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And from the
ceiling, a golden rod

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.950 align:middle line:84%
tipped with a red crystal
pointed at the crystal ball.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.140 align:middle line:84%
Surrounding the
crystal in a circle

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.740 align:middle line:84%
were seven chairs with one
being higher than the rest.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And on the wall was a falcon
holding the sun in its talon

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.730 align:middle line:84%
with seven beings sitting
on top of each wing.

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And on its breast were 14
gemstones in a two, three,

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.760 align:middle line:90%
four, three, two pattern.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.700 align:middle line:84%
The one object Dr.
Brown could retrieve

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.670 align:middle line:84%
was the crystal sphere,
and demonstrates

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:46.460 align:middle line:90%
powerful mysterious properties.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.000 align:middle line:84%
When a metal rod is placed
into the field of the crystal,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.790 align:middle line:84%
at a certain angle, the rod
would begin to float above it.

00:07:56.790 --> 00:08:00.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Many crystals actually
have myths behind them.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.530 align:middle line:84%
There's legends of
where they came from.

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And so for example,
diamonds, where

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.060 align:middle line:90%
do the diamonds come from?

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.930 align:middle line:10%
Well, the diamonds in
an ancient Greek legend

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:14.730 align:middle line:10%
were said to have come from the
God Kronos, the primordial god

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:19.680 align:middle line:10%
of time, who changed a young
man who was named Adamas,

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:25.800 align:middle line:10%
and he transformed him into a
very immensely strong stone.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, the name Adamas
actually means invincible.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.400 align:middle line:84%
So it was thought
that this stone that

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.830 align:middle line:84%
comes from Adamas,
the diamond, brought

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:39.450 align:middle line:84%
the power of invincibility
and almost like immortality.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And so it was seen
potentially as an antidote

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.240 align:middle line:84%
even for poisons,
because it would

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.820 align:middle line:84%
make the person who
consumed it invincible

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.890 align:middle line:90%
or who wore the talisman of it.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:52.920 align:middle line:84%
But it was also then
where our whole tradition

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.510 align:middle line:84%
of getting the wedding
ring of a diamond

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:58.720 align:middle line:84%
came from was all the way back
to this ancient Greek legend

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.660 align:middle line:84%
where it said that the
diamond had the power

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:05.770 align:middle line:84%
to reinforce the bond of
love between two people,

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:09.190 align:middle line:84%
so that it was invincible
and indestructible.

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:11.810 align:middle line:90%


00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>> The name of amethyst is
derived from a Greek word

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:17.860 align:middle line:90%
meaning sober.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.450 align:middle line:84%
There is a mist that
in ancient times,

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:24.190 align:middle line:84%
people would drink wine from
goblets made of amethyst to be

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:26.320 align:middle line:84%
able to drink as
much as they wanted

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.330 align:middle line:90%
without becoming intoxicated.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.850 align:middle line:84%
In Chinese medicine,
amethyst is used

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:32.230 align:middle line:90%
to clear heat in the blood.

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:34.390 align:middle line:84%
When we drink too much,
one of the results

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:35.530 align:middle line:90%
is heat in the blood.

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, Chinese medicine
does note the use of amethyst

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:40.930 align:middle line:90%
for acute alcohol poisoning.

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:43.270 align:middle line:10%
So maybe they didn't
have amethyst goblets

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:45.610 align:middle line:10%
in ancient Greece,
but who's to say

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:47.500 align:middle line:10%
they didn't put
little amethyst points

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.960 align:middle line:10%
into their goblets,
whatever they were made of?

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:54.380 align:middle line:10%
Why name the stone "sober"
in the first place?

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:58.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Emeralds also have a really
interesting myth or legend

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:02.660 align:middle line:84%
behind them, which relates to
the Emerald Tablets of alchemy.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:06.560 align:middle line:84%
It is said that Thoth, the
Egyptian God of Wisdom,

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:13.280 align:middle line:84%
was able to alchemically melt
emerald into this liquid form,

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:18.020 align:middle line:84%
and then the Emerald Tablets,
the formula that he then

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:21.560 align:middle line:84%
transcribed contained
all the secrets on how

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.140 align:middle line:84%
to perform all the
magical transformations

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.990 align:middle line:84%
and transmutations of
the alchemical tradition

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:29.360 align:middle line:84%
were then inscribed
into this emerald.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.150 align:middle line:84%
But rather than
them being etched in

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:35.180 align:middle line:84%
as if you were scratching
it into an emerald stone,

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:39.380 align:middle line:84%
they were actually protruding
from the Emerald Tablet, which

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:44.000 align:middle line:84%
meant that the emerald had to
have been melted into a mold,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.670 align:middle line:84%
and then the mold was removed
after the emerald solidified.

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:51.400 align:middle line:90%


00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And I just love the legend
that is behind the labradorite.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:59.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, this one comes to us
from the Native Canadian Inuit

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:00.560 align:middle line:90%
tribe.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And it said that there
was an Inuit warrior who

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:06.340 align:middle line:84%
was walking along, and
he found that there

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:09.250 align:middle line:84%
was light that was trapped
deep within the Earth

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:10.780 align:middle line:90%
within some stones.

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And to try and free this
light, he took his spear,

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:17.000 align:middle line:84%
and he pierced into the
Earth to pierce the stone,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.570 align:middle line:84%
and he was able to
free most of the light.

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:22.540 align:middle line:10%
And as that light
escaped, it formed

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:25.030 align:middle line:10%
what we now know of as
the beautiful Aurora

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:27.310 align:middle line:10%
borealis, the Northern Lights.

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:31.220 align:middle line:84%
But some of that light remained
trapped within the stone.

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And those fragments
of light that

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:36.010 align:middle line:84%
remain trapped within the
stone then formed the stone

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:38.350 align:middle line:84%
that we now call
labradorite, which

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:40.150 align:middle line:84%
is why the labradorite
has so much

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:43.210 align:middle line:84%
of this rainbow color in
it, and looks very much

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:44.335 align:middle line:90%
like the Northern Lights.

00:11:44.335 --> 00:11:48.250 align:middle line:90%


00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:52.990 align:middle line:84%
There's one myth about
the Icelandic sunstone.

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:55.840 align:middle line:84%
It's in the Icelandic
sagas, and it

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.710 align:middle line:84%
mentions that the Vikings
used this sunstone

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:02.530 align:middle line:84%
to help them navigate
the seas and locate

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:07.400 align:middle line:84%
where the sun was at even
on completely cloudy days.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, since then we've
found enough information

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:16.010 align:middle line:84%
from their mythology pointing
to a large, clear, calcite stone

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:18.830 align:middle line:84%
crystal that they were
able to hold up to the sky.

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And because it
polarized the light,

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:25.250 align:middle line:84%
they were able to locate exactly
where the sun was coming from,

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:27.380 align:middle line:84%
even if it was
behind the clouds.

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.330 align:middle line:84%
So there's an example
of one of these myths

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:30.425 align:middle line:90%
that has been verified.

00:12:30.425 --> 00:12:34.900 align:middle line:90%


00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:38.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Deeply interwoven with the
origin myths of crystals are

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:42.220 align:middle line:84%
the mystical properties
that come with them.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.560 align:middle line:84%
Crystals have a long
history of being

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.800 align:middle line:84%
used to foretell the
future to contact the dead

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.500 align:middle line:84%
and to develop
psychic abilities.

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.740 align:middle line:84%
Ancient tales point at
the multidimensionality

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:57.850 align:middle line:84%
of crystals, where they can
dematerialize and rematerialize

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:01.510 align:middle line:84%
at will, and be used to
enter into altered states

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:04.940 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness and
connect to higher beings.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:08.230 align:middle line:84%
So what is the spiritual
function of crystals?

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:10.690 align:middle line:84%
Why are they here,
and how can they

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:13.750 align:middle line:84%
be used to strengthen the
connection between our physical

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:14.905 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual world?

00:13:14.905 --> 00:13:17.450 align:middle line:90%


00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Nature spirits,
also called devas,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.740 align:middle line:84%
are the etheric counterparts or
spirit essence of each living

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:25.670 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.610 align:middle line:84%
There is a general deva
of the mineral kingdom,

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:32.840 align:middle line:84%
but there are also specific
devas for, say, rose quartz

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.610 align:middle line:90%
or larimar.

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:38.030 align:middle line:84%
There are many distinct families
of nature spirits coexisting

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:41.420 align:middle line:84%
in our reality in the
ether, like living

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:44.930 align:middle line:84%
in parallel universes where
humans may not necessarily

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:48.810 align:middle line:84%
perceive them, for they exist
at different frequencies.

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:52.160 align:middle line:84%
However, it is possible
under proper conditions

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.050 align:middle line:84%
and with sensitivity
to communicate

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:56.630 align:middle line:84%
with the elemental
kingdom, especially when

00:13:56.630 --> 00:14:00.470 align:middle line:84%
one is ready to invite them
in by communicating with them

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:03.540 align:middle line:90%
or making offerings.

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Crystals are multidimensional
and can shift into different

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.190 align:middle line:90%
dimensions.

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:11.460 align:middle line:84%
I've heard of
inexperienced crystals

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:14.170 align:middle line:84%
dematerializing and
then coming back.

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:16.770 align:middle line:84%
They don't do that
frequently, but they

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:21.150 align:middle line:84%
can do it under the influence of
higher beings to help train us.

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:24.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Crystals have been used for
divination since ancient times.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:28.350 align:middle line:84%
For example, scrying,
crystal balls,

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:31.260 align:middle line:84%
we've all heard of the
psychics using crystal balls

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:32.760 align:middle line:90%
to foresee the future.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.620 align:middle line:84%
There is actually
something to this,

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:38.280 align:middle line:84%
but crystals for readings for
example and for divination

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.380 align:middle line:90%
get twin crystals.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.170 align:middle line:84%
What a twin crystal
is is two crystals

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:46.570 align:middle line:84%
that are almost identical, and
they come from the same source.

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:51.930 align:middle line:84%
They actually grow off of the
same little seed, for example.

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And just like twins,
they have this sort

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.690 align:middle line:84%
of connection
between them, almost

00:14:57.690 --> 00:14:59.670 align:middle line:84%
like a psychic
connection between them.

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:01.350 align:middle line:90%
They're entangled in some way.

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.920 align:middle line:84%
Energetically, they
resonate with each other.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.970 align:middle line:84%
So you could hold one
crystal, one of the twins,

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:10.930 align:middle line:84%
and then you can give the other
crystal to a person that is

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.792 align:middle line:90%
having a reading done for them.

00:15:12.792 --> 00:15:13.750 align:middle line:90%
And this will help you.

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.840 align:middle line:84%
Then through the crystal, it'll
communicate to the crystal

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:17.893 align:middle line:90%
that you're holding.

00:15:17.893 --> 00:15:19.810 align:middle line:84%
They're holding one;
you're holding the other,

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:23.530 align:middle line:84%
and it'll help transmit some
information in a more amplified

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:27.100 align:middle line:84%
signal to help you tune in
to what it is that needs

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:29.030 align:middle line:90%
to be read for this person.

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:33.280 align:middle line:84%
So this is one way that
divination can happen.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>> On the subject
of crystal balls,

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:39.430 align:middle line:84%
Western culture often thinks
Native Americans had no

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:40.620 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:44.020 align:middle line:84%
This is false, the difference
being that our technologies

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:46.270 align:middle line:90%
were spiritual technologies.

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:49.420 align:middle line:84%
Some people called
skywalkers could really fly.

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:50.950 align:middle line:90%
Others could teleport.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:54.040 align:middle line:10%
We could build
pyramids and skulls out

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.360 align:middle line:10%
of hard crystal stones.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.150 align:middle line:84%
We could also make
crystal balls.

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:01.750 align:middle line:84%
It's important that people know
how to work with the crystal

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:05.200 align:middle line:84%
balls because if you gaze
too long into a crystal ball,

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.330 align:middle line:84%
you can really harm
your optic nerve.

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:11.920 align:middle line:84%
Crystal balls really need more
purification than other stones.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.073 align:middle line:84%
You will need to
purify them often

00:16:14.073 --> 00:16:16.240 align:middle line:84%
because you don't want them
to hold any information.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.080 align:middle line:84%
They have to be
completely neutral.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And then you want to find
a place where there's

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:23.500 align:middle line:90%
a light reflecting into it.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.840 align:middle line:84%
And then you gaze at
that specific place,

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.210 align:middle line:90%
and you diffuse your vision.

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:30.460 align:middle line:90%
And with time, you'll see mist.

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And in that mist,
something will happen.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.030 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe you'll
see it in the ball.

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:36.100 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is different
at that level.

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.310 align:middle line:84%
But in the beginning,
you gaze five minutes.

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:40.420 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:43.910 align:middle line:84%
Then after a while, you can go
10 minutes, then 20 minutes.

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:46.150 align:middle line:84%
You want to stop at 20
minutes because you can really

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.370 align:middle line:90%
harm your optic nerve.

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:51.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Crystals have historically
been used to develop psychic

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:52.910 align:middle line:90%
abilities.

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:56.410 align:middle line:10%
For example, through
black obsidian mirrors,

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:58.450 align:middle line:10%
although technically
obsidian is not

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:02.260 align:middle line:10%
a crystal but a glass, which has
been used since ancient times

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.660 align:middle line:10%
by the Mayan
peoples, and I'm sure

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:07.450 align:middle line:10%
other ancient Earth-based
cultures to access one's

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:11.050 align:middle line:10%
shadow self, their feminine
or masculine sides,

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:13.540 align:middle line:10%
or other parallel
past life selves,

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:16.569 align:middle line:10%
as they practiced
scrying and journeying

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:20.710 align:middle line:10%
into the black obsidian
mirror by candlelight.

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:23.230 align:middle line:84%
We can also use
double-terminated crystals

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:26.859 align:middle line:84%
with a partner, each holding
a double-terminated crystal

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:30.370 align:middle line:84%
to practice telepathy
and sending and receiving

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:31.790 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Another important stone for
your personal development are

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:38.200 align:middle line:84%
Herkimer diamond
crystals for dream work.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.990 align:middle line:84%
Actually, they come from
the region of Herkimer

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:43.810 align:middle line:84%
in New York State, and
they're not diamonds;

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:47.140 align:middle line:84%
they're clear quartz crystals
with the particularity

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.720 align:middle line:90%
that they have bi-termination.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.250 align:middle line:90%
You see they have two points.

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:53.230 align:middle line:90%
You travel through that.

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:55.180 align:middle line:84%
It's like a vortex
through which you

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:59.510 align:middle line:84%
travel to be able to do
out-of-body experiences.

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:02.740 align:middle line:84%
So what you happen
to experience when

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:06.310 align:middle line:84%
you start working with a
proper prepared Herkimer

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:09.550 align:middle line:84%
is that it will accompany
you in the dream world.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:11.500 align:middle line:84%
It will travel with you;
it will protect you.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.000 align:middle line:90%
It's clear light.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.670 align:middle line:84%
Quartz crystals are clear
light, and so they protect you

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:18.730 align:middle line:90%
from anything that's dark.

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:22.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Crystals can be such
important allies for us

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:26.470 align:middle line:10%
as humans because they have so
many gifts and so much support

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:28.640 align:middle line:10%
that they can bring
into our lives,

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.240 align:middle line:10%
whether it's for healing,
for helping us raise

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:36.310 align:middle line:10%
our consciousness, for becoming
more in tune with the kingdom

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:41.500 align:middle line:10%
of nature, and the mineral
kingdom, and Mother Earth.

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:45.040 align:middle line:10%
Or whether it's for opening
up our psychic abilities

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.770 align:middle line:10%
and dreaming, creating
more sacred space,

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:50.800 align:middle line:10%
anchoring sacred geometry,
all of these things,

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.230 align:middle line:10%
there's so many amazing
things that crystals

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:54.740 align:middle line:10%
can bring into our lives.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.730 align:middle line:84%
So make them your
ally, get to know them,

00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:00.040 align:middle line:84%
build relationship
with them, and let

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.390 align:middle line:90%
them go to work for you.

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:05.710 align:middle line:90%


00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:08.040 align:middle line:84%
>> It's important to understand
the spiritual function

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.990 align:middle line:84%
and purpose of the
mineral kingdom.

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:12.930 align:middle line:84%
That is to hold
important information

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:15.960 align:middle line:84%
and transmit
important information.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.750 align:middle line:84%
The crystals were placed
here at the beginning

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:21.810 align:middle line:84%
of the creation of
the planet to transmit

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:24.990 align:middle line:84%
the fundamental primordial
laws of the universe

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:26.700 align:middle line:90%
and to hold them there.

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they are
so important, because they

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:34.590 align:middle line:84%
can hold them for millennia
upon millennia upon millennia,

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:42.300 align:middle line:84%
and they hold the basic, pure
information of the universe.

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.180 align:middle line:84%
As we purify
ourselves and we work

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:46.980 align:middle line:84%
on our spiritual
mission in life,

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:49.780 align:middle line:90%
we become more and more evolved.

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And if we do that, we become
more and more beautiful

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:54.720 align:middle line:90%
in everything we do.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
call the beauty way.

00:19:56.790 --> 00:20:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And the crystals, they
are reminding us of that,

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.940 align:middle line:90%
because they are beauty.

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:07.440 align:middle line:84%
They have beautiful form,
and they're all different.

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.420 align:middle line:84%
Crystals are there
to show us, look,

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:11.460 align:middle line:84%
if you evolve, you
become beautiful.

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:14.160 align:middle line:10%
And so we learn to
walk on the beauty way,

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.080 align:middle line:10%
and the crystals are there
to remind us of this.

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.845 align:middle line:10%
And so as such, they
are precious friends.

00:20:19.845 --> 00:20:23.710 align:middle line:90%


00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:27.880 align:middle line:84%
>> From foundation myths and
cosmic origins to ancient

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:31.570 align:middle line:84%
crystal technology gone awry,
and mythical subterranean

00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:36.280 align:middle line:84%
kingdoms to magical gems,
crystals seem to be a common

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:40.600 align:middle line:84%
and primordial motif in many
legends from across the world.

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.720 align:middle line:84%
The esoteric power
embedded in crystals

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:47.470 align:middle line:84%
has been utilized for eons
by shamans and initiates

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:51.850 align:middle line:84%
across the globe to bridge the
physical and spiritual worlds.

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:55.510 align:middle line:84%
As these precious stones
fall back into our hands, may

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:59.140 align:middle line:84%
they inspire us to bring forth
the light, the brilliance,

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.170 align:middle line:84%
and lucidity within
ourselves as we refine

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:04.600 align:middle line:90%
our own crystalline natures.

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.690 align:middle line:84%
May we treasure their gifts
and make them our allies

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:10.090 align:middle line:84%
in our conscious
evolution so we can

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:15.370 align:middle line:84%
co-create a more beautiful,
harmonious, and luminous world.
