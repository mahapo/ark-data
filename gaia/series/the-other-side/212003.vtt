From ancient sacred

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.500 align:middle line:84%
these are significant
places sometimes lost

in the midst of time,
mysterious treasures waiting

much better than we can

But it is possible to
rediscover that by engaging

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.010 align:middle line:84%
in the kind of work I
do-- just to reawaken

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.820 align:middle line:84%
the intuition and the
feeling for the land, which

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.520 align:middle line:84%
in the concrete jungle
we've kind of forgotten

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.630 align:middle line:90%

My name is my Charl,
my surname, Pienaar,

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.420 align:middle line:84%
and we're in a very special
place in the Western

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.790 align:middle line:84%
Cape of South Africa,
a place called

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.800 align:middle line:90%
Paarl, which means pearl.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.520 align:middle line:84%
My predecessor-- first
one came here in 1694.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.960 align:middle line:84%
I've been living
in this valley--

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.210 align:middle line:84%
it's called Drakenstein
Valley, meaning

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.980 align:middle line:90%
the Valley of the Dragons.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.300 align:middle line:90%
And this is my place.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm very deeply rooted here.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.790 align:middle line:84%
My profession is in
agriculture, and I'm

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.900 align:middle line:84%
very interested in the
softer side of agriculture--

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.950 align:middle line:84%
biodynamic agriculture, organic,
regenerative, all those things.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And that brings us
to the work for today

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.310 align:middle line:84%
is to chat about the
energy of the land--

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.060 align:middle line:84%
the ley lines, the
electromagnetic grid

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.050 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to make a jump
to long before 1694, which

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.170 align:middle line:84%
we're talking thousands and
tens of thousands and hundreds

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.820 align:middle line:90%
of thousands of years.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.770 align:middle line:84%
My interest is in
the prehistory,

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.440 align:middle line:84%
much further back
than recorded history

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.800 align:middle line:90%
that we normally look at.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.600 align:middle line:84%
My interest in
ancient sacred sites

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.420 align:middle line:84%
didn't start that long
ago, although I think we

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.800 align:middle line:84%
all have it in us to feel
the energy of the Earth,

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.290 align:middle line:90%
but we've unlearned that skill.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.110 align:middle line:10%
My skill, to be able
to work with the land,

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.130 align:middle line:10%
started developing
about 15 years ago

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.580 align:middle line:10%
after a visit to a very
significant ancient sacred site

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.610 align:middle line:10%
in South Africa, a place
called Adam's Calendar

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:53.990 align:middle line:10%
in modern times.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And that visit, which
I got invited to,

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.510 align:middle line:84%
just fired me up
completely-- made

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.260 align:middle line:84%
me really, really interested
in ancient sacred sites.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.200 align:middle line:84%
But more than that,
developing the skills

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.510 align:middle line:84%
to find and explore and
protect, and to be the guide

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.995 align:middle line:90%
to these ancient sacred sites.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.589 align:middle line:10%
So from the beginning of my
work with ancient sacred sites,

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:25.240 align:middle line:10%
I intuited, I knew that
it's not the heritage

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.890 align:middle line:10%
of our modern people.

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.520 align:middle line:84%
The heritage goes back to the
Bushmen people of the country.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.960 align:middle line:10%
So part of my mission
has been to introduce

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.410 align:middle line:10%
the descendants of the Bushmen
people to their heritage.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.360 align:middle line:84%
It happened two years ago,
and I met Julian Arendse.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.760 align:middle line:90%
He is a chief in a local tribe.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.810 align:middle line:84%
He's also a shaman,
and we connected.

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.070 align:middle line:10%
And since then, we've been
doing this work together.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And more often than
not on the full moon,

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.960 align:middle line:84%
we are up on the mountain to
enjoy that beautiful energy

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.310 align:middle line:90%
of the full moon.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.240 align:middle line:84%
They actually do use that
site on an active basis

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.750 align:middle line:84%
to do initiation,
go and sit, absorb,

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.590 align:middle line:84%
and just connect with their
past, which has largely

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.400 align:middle line:90%
been lost that connection.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.640 align:middle line:84%
But I think through the work we
do with ancient sacred sites,

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.120 align:middle line:84%
we can become a
part of this rebirth

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.740 align:middle line:84%
of the nation of the Bushmen
people in modern times.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.610 align:middle line:90%
And I'm very grateful.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.685 align:middle line:84%
I'm very privileged to
be part of that process.

This valley is part
of the prehistory.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a very fertile
valley, and that

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.620 align:middle line:84%
is where the Sun people
and the Khoi people

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.680 align:middle line:90%
lived for thousands of years.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.750 align:middle line:84%
The Sun and the Khoi
people lost their heritage.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
only in recent times

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.830 align:middle line:84%
that they are starting to
rediscover their roots.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And through working
with guys like Julian

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.390 align:middle line:84%
and the local paramount
chiefs and so on,

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.410 align:middle line:84%
we can really do
reparation, in my opinion,

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:13.400 align:middle line:84%
for all the damage that was done
over the last couple of hundred

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.560 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.990 align:middle line:84%
I'll just point out
the lay of the land

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.820 align:middle line:90%
before we head up the mountain.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.830 align:middle line:90%


00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.020 align:middle line:90%
So this is also my workplace.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very privileged
to come here every day

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.310 align:middle line:84%
to experience the
valley, and just

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.840 align:middle line:84%
to soak in this vista

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.400 align:middle line:90%
on that side of the valley.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And those mountains over
there, they're called

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.570 align:middle line:90%
the [NON-ENGLISH] mountains.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And in our local
language, Afrikaans,

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:49.410 align:middle line:84%
[NON-ENGLISH] means
the end, the edge.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:52.500 align:middle line:84%
I've been in this valley
for many, many years,

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.370 align:middle line:84%
and it's a real
privilege to introduce

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.060 align:middle line:84%

by the Khoisan, is a 500-million
year old granite rock and is

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.220 align:middle line:84%
the second largest granite
outcrop in the world.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.810 align:middle line:84%

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.910 align:middle line:84%

the two highest peaks

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:26.710 align:middle line:84%
forming the female gateway,
an inverted V-shaped triangle,

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:29.200 align:middle line:90%
representing the female Ngoni.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.300 align:middle line:84%

Alchemy has been handed down
through centuries, from Egypt

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:07.130 align:middle line:84%
and Arabia to Greece and
Rome before appearing

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:08.720 align:middle line:90%
in Western and Central Europe.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.605 align:middle line:84%
It is an ancient practice rooted
in a complex spiritual world

view, shrouded in
mystery and secrecy.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Alchemy is a practice of
working with natural materials

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.380 align:middle line:84%
where the alchemist
practices a mix of chemical

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.510 align:middle line:90%
science and natural philosophy.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:26.000 align:middle line:84%
At its core, it is a
connection to the Earth

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.040 align:middle line:84%
and uses energy
and other methods

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.975 align:middle line:90%
to manipulate natural minerals.

>> We're now in my
workspace inside,

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:41.620 align:middle line:84%
and this is what I call
my alchemical laboratory.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And I do alchemy
as a profession,

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:49.360 align:middle line:84%
and that is to
concentrate, find, purify,

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.380 align:middle line:84%
charge the minerals
mostly from sea sources.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.900 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very comfortable
in my space here.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.330 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a
protected holy space,

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.300 align:middle line:84%
and try to keep
the energy clean.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:05.440 align:middle line:10%
There is, for instance, a
shield through this foil

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:11.020 align:middle line:10%
that protects the emission of
electricity onto my workspace.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:15.010 align:middle line:10%
The work here, like I mentioned,
is about the minerals.

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:20.140 align:middle line:10%
And my work as alchemist
is to bring the minerals

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:25.270 align:middle line:10%
in a transformed state, which
is alchemy's definition.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And then we do lots
of agricultural work,

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:29.380 align:middle line:90%
which happens outside--

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:33.440 align:middle line:84%
bigger volume-- and that
is to fix the soil--

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.090 align:middle line:84%
applying to soil and
the leaves of plants,

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:41.030 align:middle line:84%
it enhances the
microbial life in soils.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:45.210 align:middle line:84%
There is a beautiful symbiosis
between plants and microbes

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:46.010 align:middle line:90%
in the soil.

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:50.120 align:middle line:84%
The landscape work has got
application in agriculture.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.660 align:middle line:10%
It's what we call the
art center of a farm.

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:57.380 align:middle line:10%
It's not the same necessarily
as an ancient sacred site,

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:01.820 align:middle line:10%
but that's the place that I've
learned to find and to point

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:06.500 align:middle line:10%
out to the farmer, which
is similar to when you put

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:11.450 align:middle line:10%
a pebble into a pond, that
ripple effect on the landscape,

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:13.580 align:middle line:10%
where that point
of the strongest

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:15.800 align:middle line:10%
energy within the
farm boundaries

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.440 align:middle line:10%
can serve as the place
where the farmer can

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:25.340 align:middle line:10%
go and sit and ponder and
plan and bring his energy

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.020 align:middle line:10%
to integrate into the farm.

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.296 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:31.240 align:middle line:90%


00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:35.660 align:middle line:10%
So even though we talk about
ancient prehistoric stuff,

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.800 align:middle line:10%
it is handy to work
with modern technology.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.670 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to move into
my office now on that side,

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:46.180 align:middle line:10%
and I'm just going to give
a little bit of a background

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:49.300 align:middle line:10%
on how we use modern
technology to be

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.300 align:middle line:10%
able to do the exploration
for ancient sacred sites

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:57.070 align:middle line:10%
and farm art centers,
which makes things

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:59.110 align:middle line:10%
a lot easier because
we don't have

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:01.720 align:middle line:10%
to walk the whole farm
or the whole mountain

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:02.920 align:middle line:10%
to find those places.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:09.130 align:middle line:84%
We can narrow down the
area to something specific

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:13.540 align:middle line:84%
that is practical to walk
and to find the exact spot.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:23.170 align:middle line:90%


00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:26.710 align:middle line:84%
We're now in my office,
where I employ technology

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:31.240 align:middle line:84%
to be able to do this work of
finding ancient sacred sites.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:35.770 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite tools in
this regard is Google Earth.

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And on the screen, I do have
a picture on Google Earth

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:44.620 align:middle line:84%
which basically covers the whole
of Paarl Mountain, or Tortoise

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.070 align:middle line:90%
Mountain, as we call it.

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And the map is what
we call a resonator.

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:51.670 align:middle line:84%
It connects me
with the landscape.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:56.770 align:middle line:84%
An innovation that we do is
to put a grid onto the map.

00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:00.310 align:middle line:10%
So the work is to
copy this image,

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:05.890 align:middle line:10%
switch over to PowerPoint,
copy the map over,

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:12.100 align:middle line:10%
and then superimpose
a grid onto the map.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:15.790 align:middle line:10%
The work then to find
an ancient sacred site

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:21.410 align:middle line:10%
on this fairly large scale
involves these grid positions.

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:24.680 align:middle line:84%
Then it's about
using a pendulum.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.960 align:middle line:90%
This is my favorite pendulum.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.390 align:middle line:10%
You use a pendulum
to interrogate, ask

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:33.440 align:middle line:10%
questions about this
particular landscape.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.540 align:middle line:10%
And it's a skill
I needed to learn,

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:40.040 align:middle line:10%
and I'm now pretty
proficient in using

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:43.790 align:middle line:10%
map dowsing to
interrogate the landscape

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:48.820 align:middle line:10%
and to find these
ancient sacred sites.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.750 align:middle line:10%
So it's about tuning in.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:56.980 align:middle line:10%
I use this designation, which
I got from the internet,

00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:01.750 align:middle line:10%
a beautiful little eBook
called "A Letter to Robin."

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And with a map on this side
and my pendulum swinging,

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.900 align:middle line:84%
I do interrogate each one
of these relevant places

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:14.390 align:middle line:84%
on the map, just asking
a simple question like,

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:18.421 align:middle line:84%
is there an ancient
sacred site in A?

00:13:18.421 --> 00:13:21.400 align:middle line:90%
And my pendulum would say no.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Is there an ancient sacred
site in B, ancient site in C,

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.480 align:middle line:90%
and it swings to yes.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.480 align:middle line:84%
So I'll then note
down rectangle C

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.730 align:middle line:84%
as a potential
ancient sacred site.

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And so move through this
map, and on the first round

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:42.370 align:middle line:84%
of interrogation
way back many years

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:46.300 align:middle line:84%
ago I found three
ancient sacred sites.

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And the ancient sacred site when
using the pendulum on this map

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:53.930 align:middle line:84%
is then indicated as
rectangle C, which

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:56.915 align:middle line:84%
is the place where we're heading
as we go up the mountain.

00:13:56.915 --> 00:14:00.056 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:00.056 --> 00:14:01.008 align:middle line:90%


00:14:01.008 --> 00:14:01.910 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:03.500 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to the mountain.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Charl has a connection to the
land through various mediums,

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:10.610 align:middle line:84%
whether it's alchemy, working
in biodynamic and regenerative

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:13.100 align:middle line:84%
agriculture, searching
for ley lines,

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:17.000 align:middle line:84%
dowsing to find sacred sites,
or assisting people like Julian

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.930 align:middle line:84%
to reconnect with his heritage
and the places his ancestors

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:22.100 align:middle line:90%
held sacred.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:26.105 align:middle line:84%
It's clear Charl has a passion
for this place and this land.

00:14:26.105 --> 00:14:29.480 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:33.320 align:middle line:84%
Coming up next, we meet Julian,
a Khoisan shaman and fellow

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.990 align:middle line:84%
alchemist who tells us
more about the Khoisan

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:38.240 align:middle line:84%
and their ancient
cultural practices.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.670 align:middle line:84%
We also follow as
he and Charl head

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:43.610 align:middle line:84%
to Paarl rock for a
full moon ceremony.

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:47.500 align:middle line:84%
Join us as we journey with
them to the other side.

>> Hey.

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:52.480 align:middle line:90%
Good, man.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.360 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you again.

I'm ready.

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:56.370 align:middle line:90%

My name is Julian,
Julian Arendse.

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:49.950 align:middle line:84%
My descendancy-- I'm from
the Bushmen descendancy.

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:52.350 align:middle line:84%
Also, the San
descendancy, but more

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:55.410 align:middle line:84%
of the Southern tip of
Africa to the Western Cape.

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:57.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm a sixth ascendant in
this beautiful valley.

00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:02.100 align:middle line:84%
This valley historically used
to be sort of like the birthing

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:05.460 align:middle line:84%
place of all the animals when
they came down seasonally

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:09.600 align:middle line:84%
from the Great Karoo over the
mountains down to the valley.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And this used to be the
summer grazing areas

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:14.310 align:middle line:90%
for the big herds of animals.

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:16.110 align:middle line:84%
The ancient people,
they came here

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.300 align:middle line:84%
after they saw the
abundance of animals.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And then the formations
of the granite rock

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:23.080 align:middle line:90%
itself, that's shelter for them.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And after a while, it became
a sacred site for them.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:29.250 align:middle line:84%
Births started happening
here during seasonal times,

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:31.380 align:middle line:90%
during animal migrations.

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:34.590 align:middle line:10%
And at the later
stage, also became

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:38.520 align:middle line:10%
part of the practice of temples
and could possibly also have

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.290 align:middle line:10%
led to the first churches.

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:43.390 align:middle line:84%
>> These granite
rocks are like teeth.

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:46.060 align:middle line:90%
They go deep into the Earth--

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:47.590 align:middle line:90%
volcanic action.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And through their penetration
into the Earth's crust,

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:56.260 align:middle line:84%
the Earth's electromagnetic
forces are concentrated.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And the ancient
people could feel

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.550 align:middle line:90%
that attraction and that force.

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And that is why a
site such as this

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:06.250 align:middle line:84%
was used over thousands
of years as the place

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:09.280 align:middle line:84%
to come do ceremony
and to connect

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.670 align:middle line:84%
with the underworld
and the higher powers

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:15.660 align:middle line:90%
that they perceived.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:20.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Part of our culture is
before we go up sacred sites,

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:24.240 align:middle line:84%
we actually need to totally
redress ourself as to respect

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:28.230 align:middle line:84%
part of our ancient
customs, but also as respect

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:29.670 align:middle line:90%
for our ancestors.

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:34.110 align:middle line:84%
They went up here dressed
in skins, always bare feet.

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And today, I'm an attire
respecting my ancient culture,

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:43.560 align:middle line:84%
customary for all Indigenous
nations within the world.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:47.610 align:middle line:84%
Once you are about to
enter a sacred site,

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:52.470 align:middle line:84%
there's always a passage
or a ritual of right

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:55.050 align:middle line:84%
before one can enter
those sacred sites.

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just only
got to do with the respect

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:02.310 align:middle line:84%
of the guardians
of the sacred site

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:middle line:84%
or the gatekeepers
of the bushes,

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:09.790 align:middle line:84%
but it's also a means of
protection for oneself,

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:13.140 align:middle line:84%
to bring oneself in
the state of awareness

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:16.340 align:middle line:84%
that you are entering a
special state-- a place.

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:17.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:20.770 align:middle line:84%
Now that everything is
done, we having a look

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:21.850 align:middle line:90%
at where the sun set.

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:23.530 align:middle line:84%
We want to catch
the moon up there

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:24.690 align:middle line:90%
rising over the mountains.

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:26.090 align:middle line:90%
So I think, Charl, ready to go.

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:26.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's go.

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:28.090 align:middle line:90%

OK.

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:13.180 align:middle line:84%
We now are in the art of
the ancient sacred site.

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And this rock at
the back of me it's

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:21.670 align:middle line:84%
called a womb rock because this
rock envelops you like a womb,

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:23.870 align:middle line:84%
like a baby in a
mother's stomach.

Yeah, the light is
fading fast now,

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:49.960 align:middle line:84%
and we've come to enjoy
the full moon as it rises.

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:55.420 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to sit now facing
the East where the moon will

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.520 align:middle line:90%
rise in a couple of minutes.
