00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>> The holistic world of healing
includes plants and herbs,

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.440 align:middle line:84%
channeling energy, as well as
both spiritual and physical

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.530 align:middle line:90%
modalities.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.910 align:middle line:84%
Healers are
multidimensional beings,

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.080 align:middle line:84%
who dance between the realms
of the seen and unseen.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.200 align:middle line:84%
These individuals
have the ability

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.250 align:middle line:84%
to facilitate a shift in
people, offering them insight

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.860 align:middle line:84%
and support, reconnecting people
with themselves and the greater

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.020 align:middle line:84%
collective, healing the
world one person at a time,

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.285 align:middle line:90%
healing from the other side.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Four years ago, I
finally found my calling,

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.710 align:middle line:84%
which is womb healing
and fertility massage.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.850 align:middle line:84%
I went through to London from
South Africa in October 2017

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.410 align:middle line:84%
to do a specialized course
in fertility and womb healing

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.310 align:middle line:90%
massage.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.960 align:middle line:10%
And while I was in England,
my life changed completely.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.870 align:middle line:90%
I finally did find my calling.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And three weeks after actually
completing the course,

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.385 align:middle line:84%
I fell pregnant with
my incredible blessing

00:02:00.385 --> 00:02:01.185 align:middle line:90%
of a daughter.

00:02:01.185 --> 00:02:04.910 align:middle line:90%


00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.110 align:middle line:84%
I am a holistic therapist
and semitologist,

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.240 align:middle line:84%
and I've been in the industry
for about 16 years now.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.420 align:middle line:90%
I do reflexology.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.550 align:middle line:90%
I do energy healing.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.540 align:middle line:90%
I do sand bowls over the body.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.000 align:middle line:90%
I rebalance the chakras.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.020 align:middle line:84%
I pick up different
imbalances when I'm actually

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.790 align:middle line:90%
working physically on the body.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.740 align:middle line:84%
I can tell when
there's an imbalance.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.330 align:middle line:84%
My nose'd actually
twinge, tickles.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.760 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm working
on my clients,

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.673 align:middle line:84%
I know when to actually focus
on a specific area, when

00:02:45.673 --> 00:02:46.715 align:middle line:90%
my nose actually twinges.

00:02:46.715 --> 00:02:52.640 align:middle line:90%


00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.370 align:middle line:10%
What I've been
finding a lot nowadays

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.490 align:middle line:10%
is that I've been
working a lot with women.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Because, obviously, with
the womb healing, as well

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.470 align:middle line:84%
as the fertility side
of things, it's mainly

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.970 align:middle line:90%
guided towards the women.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And we found that--
well, I find that there's

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.060 align:middle line:84%
a lot of past
traumas that actually

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.040 align:middle line:90%
are stored in the womb itself.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.850 align:middle line:10%
And that's-- manifests into
different types of disorders

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.870 align:middle line:10%
and diseases, like your
endometriosis or your PCOS

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:27.390 align:middle line:10%
or heavy bleeds or anything to
do with the actual womb itself.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.930 align:middle line:84%
I've incorporated
crystal singing

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.720 align:middle line:90%
bowls into my treatments.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, just for relaxation,
to raise your vibration,

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.470 align:middle line:84%
to help just completely
rebalance the whole body.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:59.280 align:middle line:90%


00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.000 align:middle line:84%
>> In Eastern philosophy,
the womb is also referred

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.520 align:middle line:90%
to as the sacral chakra.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.670 align:middle line:84%
It is thought that
blockages in this chakra

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.660 align:middle line:84%
are directly linked to the
outcomes in one's life.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.640 align:middle line:84%
Modalities, like song bowls, are
used by Bronwyn and many others

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.640 align:middle line:90%
to help clear stuck energy.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.360 align:middle line:90%
>> So when I am--

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.060 align:middle line:84%
have an appointment
with a client,

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.320 align:middle line:84%
I do an intensive
consultation with them

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.720 align:middle line:84%
to see what is going on with
them spiritually, emotionally,

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.360 align:middle line:84%
if there's any traumas, as
well as physically as well.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.400 align:middle line:84%
So because I'm an attached
therapist, a holistic touch

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.390 align:middle line:84%
therapist, I will be
massaging the body.

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'll pick up different
types of imbalances,

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.140 align:middle line:90%
as I work with my clients.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Once I've completed
the actual massage,

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:03.870 align:middle line:84%
I bring out my tools, which are
my singing bowls, my shakers,

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.370 align:middle line:90%
my Tibetan bowls.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And I will do a treatment
around the energetic field

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:17.790 align:middle line:84%
and work through the aura
around, do some chanting.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.300 align:middle line:84%
It just depends
specifically on the client,

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.070 align:middle line:90%
what their needs are.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:30.120 align:middle line:90%


00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.980 align:middle line:84%
So my client that's going to
be arriving in a few minutes.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.600 align:middle line:90%
Her name is Dinel.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm very excited to
actually meet her.

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.730 align:middle line:90%
I haven't met her before yet.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to have
a quick chat with her

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.260 align:middle line:84%
to see what we can work
with, with the tools.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I'm excited to
actually get my hands on her.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Coming up, on the
other side, we meet Dinel,

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.690 align:middle line:84%
who is seeking answers for the
pain and trauma in her life.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.170 align:middle line:90%


00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.290 align:middle line:84%
Feeling lost and
overwhelmed, she

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:11.840 align:middle line:84%
comes to Bronwyn in search of
an alternative path forward.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.190 align:middle line:84%
Join us, as we journey
to the other side.

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.460 align:middle line:84%
Often being pulled
into darkness is what

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.145 align:middle line:90%
compels many to seek the light.

00:06:22.145 --> 00:06:25.970 align:middle line:90%


00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Later on today I
will be meeting Bronwyn.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.710 align:middle line:84%
With everything that I've
been going through, especially

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.450 align:middle line:84%
considering that there's
stress and I've lost myself

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.880 align:middle line:84%
during the process,
I'm looking forward

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.665 align:middle line:90%
to receiving the healing.

00:06:42.665 --> 00:06:49.090 align:middle line:90%


00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:50.830 align:middle line:84%
Basically, I've
never experienced

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.460 align:middle line:84%
this in terms of the process
or techniques that she uses.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm very excited because I
really do have a lot going on.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:02.050 align:middle line:84%
So this is a moment that
would be a life changing one,

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:07.950 align:middle line:84%
I believe, because it is a
time to heal body, mind, soul,

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:08.750 align:middle line:90%
and spirit.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.470 align:middle line:84%
So it would be very
interesting to find out

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.590 align:middle line:84%
how she'd be able to guide me
through this whole process.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:25.150 align:middle line:90%


00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Right now, I'm going to ask
you just to have a seat for me

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:29.280 align:middle line:90%
on the bed.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.262 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:07:30.262 --> 00:07:32.595 align:middle line:84%
>> We're just going to go
through a few things together.

00:07:32.595 --> 00:07:35.240 align:middle line:90%


00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.240 align:middle line:84%
All right, so tell me,
Dinel, how old are you?

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.260 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm 33.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.790 align:middle line:90%
>> 33.

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:41.660 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.320 align:middle line:90%
And when's your birthday?

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.120 align:middle line:90%
Valentine's Day.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.610 align:middle line:90%
So that'll be 14th.

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:50.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So tell me, Dinel,
what's going on?

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Where are you sitting
emotionally at the moment,

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.020 align:middle line:84%
if you've got any tension
stress, so tell me

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:02.670 align:middle line:84%
a little bit about you, where
you are right at this moment.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:06.050 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm feeling-- how can I say--

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:09.620 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I want to give
up because a lot is happening

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:14.360 align:middle line:84%
in terms of looking for
work, having broken up

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.910 align:middle line:90%
with my husband.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:18.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, we were married
traditionally,

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:22.100 align:middle line:84%
so after 7 and 1/2 years
now, I'm left with a daughter

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.080 align:middle line:90%
that I need to raise alone.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.250 align:middle line:90%
Financially, I'm not stable.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:29.390 align:middle line:84%
So everything is
just overwhelming.

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:31.799 align:middle line:90%
And I just feel like, why?

00:08:31.799 --> 00:08:32.599 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:08:32.599 --> 00:08:38.730 align:middle line:90%


00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:43.010 align:middle line:90%
>> So heart chakra is--

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:47.870 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I tapped into your energy
bin before I even met you,

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:51.020 align:middle line:84%
and I kept on seeing
the color green, which

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.250 align:middle line:90%
is your heart chakra.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And even though
you're wearing yellow,

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.920 align:middle line:90%
which is your solar plexus.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:02.690 align:middle line:84%
But solar plexus is right
here underneath your heart.

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And that is where you
store all of your emotions.

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:10.250 align:middle line:84%
So I can see that you are quite
heartbroken at the moment.

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:14.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, quite raw, stressed out.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:14.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:15.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:16.610 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Where are you
holding your stress?

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.187 align:middle line:84%
Are you feeling it in your
back, in your lower back?

00:09:20.187 --> 00:09:22.460 align:middle line:90%
>> My lower back, my shoulders.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:25.430 align:middle line:90%
>> The world on your shoulders.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And how long ago did you
break up with your ex?

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.120 align:middle line:84%
>> This is only
three months ago now.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so that's
very, very fresh.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:37.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:39.380 align:middle line:84%
We're going to work
with this energy.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:40.920 align:middle line:90%
We're going to shift it.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And yesterday was a
new moon in Scorpio,

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.910 align:middle line:90%
and Scorpio is a water sign.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I can see
you're getting quite emotional.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.550 align:middle line:90%
And let's let the waters flow.

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:57.300 align:middle line:84%
It's really, really,
really cathartic

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.370 align:middle line:84%
to actually have
a proper good cry.

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:01.260 align:middle line:90%
Have you cried?

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.560 align:middle line:84%
>> I have to hold it in because
my daughter needs to see that

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.240 align:middle line:90%
strong mother.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And when I do cry, I just don't
need to dwell on it for long.

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.968 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're doing it
in secret from her.

00:10:12.968 --> 00:10:14.010 align:middle line:90%
How old is your daughter?

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.910 align:middle line:90%
>> She's three years old.

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:16.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Three, OK.

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:20.880 align:middle line:84%
I personally know what
you're going through.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:25.950 align:middle line:84%
I have got divorced
three years ago

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:28.470 align:middle line:84%
and split up with
my ex-husband when

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:30.270 align:middle line:90%
I was four months pregnant.

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:36.360 align:middle line:84%
So I feel your sense of that
you need to be powerful,

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.820 align:middle line:84%
and you need to stand in
your power for your daughter.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:42.760 align:middle line:84%
But you can also show her
your vulnerability as well.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.660 align:middle line:84%
So she needs to know
what's going on with you.

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:55.340 align:middle line:90%


00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm just tired, I've
been looking for you.

00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:00.530 align:middle line:90%
>> But you're not.

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:01.760 align:middle line:90%
You're really not.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:08.270 align:middle line:90%


00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:10.290 align:middle line:84%
Everything happens the
way it's supposed to.

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:14.570 align:middle line:84%
So you were meant to be
coming here to me today.

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:15.380 align:middle line:90%
Let's help you.

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to help you
heal your heart, OK?

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:21.190 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
shift this energy.

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:27.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to break the cycle
and heal this trauma, OK?

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Because you are a
beautiful, beautiful woman.

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:31.450 align:middle line:90%
You know that?

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:33.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Sometimes.

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:34.870 align:middle line:90%
I know sometimes.

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>> I know it doesn't feel
like it, but you are.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, things happen
the way they supposed to.

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:44.375 align:middle line:90%
And you will get over this.

00:11:44.375 --> 00:11:52.000 align:middle line:90%


00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.940 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to do a bit of
breathwork with you today.

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:59.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to release this
energy, this hurt, this trauma,

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:01.810 align:middle line:90%
and we're going to shift it, OK?

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:03.070 align:middle line:90%
>> OK

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:03.950 align:middle line:90%
>> You ready?

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:04.750 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm ready.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Are you ready to receive?

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:07.540 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm ready to receive.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:08.485 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:08.485 --> 00:12:09.610 align:middle line:90%
I need to start a new page.

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:15.990 align:middle line:90%


00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:18.360 align:middle line:84%
OK, Dinel, so what I'm
going to get you to do now

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.940 align:middle line:84%
is we're going to be doing
a massage to start off with.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going to get you
to get undressed for me,

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:27.750 align:middle line:84%
and you can leave your underwear
on, so you're not exposed.

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:29.803 align:middle line:84%
And you can cover
yourself with these towels

00:12:29.803 --> 00:12:31.720 align:middle line:84%
because I'm going to do
a back massage on you.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.095 align:middle line:84%
And then, we're
going to be using

00:12:33.095 --> 00:12:38.040 align:middle line:84%
my beautiful singing bowls
to raise your vibration, OK?

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.710 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to be playing
them over your body as well.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
be playing bells

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.800 align:middle line:84%
and little shakers and
all the different things

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.380 align:middle line:90%
to shift this stagnant energy.

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:50.520 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And then I'm going to get
you to roll over onto your back,

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:58.240 align:middle line:84%
and we'll have all the towels
and everything in its place.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going to do a neck
and shoulder massage for you

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:02.820 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:03.750 align:middle line:90%
>> OK

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.550 align:middle line:90%
>> So let's do this.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:09.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Coming up on the other
side, through touch and sound

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:14.910 align:middle line:84%
therapy, Bronwyn helps Dinel
let go of past events and awaken

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:16.480 align:middle line:90%
to a brighter future.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:38.690 align:middle line:90%


00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:40.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Just shifting your
energy a little bit,

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:42.440 align:middle line:84%
getting you into
your physical body.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:51.020 align:middle line:90%


00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.460 align:middle line:90%
Take a deep breath in for me.

00:13:52.460 --> 00:14:09.770 align:middle line:90%


00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:13.550 align:middle line:84%
Ex-husband is sitting here
right in your shoulder.

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:15.590 align:middle line:90%
You get headaches at all?

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:16.522 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:19.300 align:middle line:90%


00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Straight up your neck.

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:24.580 align:middle line:84%
What colors do you see when
I'm pushing her over here?

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:27.155 align:middle line:90%


00:14:27.155 --> 00:14:28.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Dark blue.

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:29.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Dark blue.

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:38.570 align:middle line:90%


00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:41.140 align:middle line:84%
Are you feeling a little
bit fluish at the moment?

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:46.640 align:middle line:84%
>> It's sitting in
your throat, sinuses.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:51.290 align:middle line:90%


00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.390 align:middle line:84%
Sinuses is all the
emotion of irritation.

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:56.450 align:middle line:90%


00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:58.550 align:middle line:90%
He irritated with aches.

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:48.550 align:middle line:90%


00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:53.142 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure your throat chakra
just opened up completely.

00:15:53.142 --> 00:15:56.620 align:middle line:90%
Can you feel that?

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.430 align:middle line:90%
It's reverberating.

00:15:58.430 --> 00:15:59.230 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:03.480 align:middle line:90%


00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:07.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to ask you to
take a deep breath in for me.

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:12.280 align:middle line:10%
And imagine a light coming
through your crown chakra

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:16.660 align:middle line:10%
to your third eye, throat,
and down to your heart.

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:52.080 align:middle line:90%


00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.700 align:middle line:90%
How are you feeling?

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:57.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Lighter.

00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:58.020 align:middle line:90%
A little lighter.

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:14.599 align:middle line:90%


00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:17.579 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm going to get you
just to hold the stone.

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:19.790 align:middle line:90%
It's a little hot.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:21.410 align:middle line:90%
This is a carnelian.

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:23.720 align:middle line:90%
It's the womb stone, OK?

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.810 align:middle line:84%
It's to release any stuck trauma
that's stuck in your womb.

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:28.290 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's give your womb
a little bit of love.

00:17:31.020 --> 00:18:47.208 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah

00:18:47.208 --> 00:18:48.750 align:middle line:10%
>> She's just gone
through a breakup.

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:51.750 align:middle line:84%
She's getting
divorced from her ex,

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:53.850 align:middle line:84%
and she's got a
three-year-old daughter.

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And there's lots of
stress and tension

00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:00.810 align:middle line:84%
that was sitting all in this
almost like a cloud on that

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:01.810 align:middle line:90%
area.

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:08.670 align:middle line:10%
And when I tapped into
her grief energy spot,

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:14.940 align:middle line:10%
I could feel there was a
male energy that was like--

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:18.420 align:middle line:10%
It was very, very hot,
so my heart actually

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:21.870 align:middle line:10%
started feeling sore
when I was massaging it.

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:25.722 align:middle line:10%
And I did the clearing,
and it lifted,

00:19:25.722 --> 00:19:27.180 align:middle line:10%
like almost
immediately, when I was

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:32.730 align:middle line:10%
doing the green heart, the
sand bowl, the singing bowl.

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:38.250 align:middle line:10%
When I would-- completed
the treatment, my carnelian

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:41.490 align:middle line:10%
crystal, that's in
the shape of a heart,

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:44.640 align:middle line:10%
it was shouting at
me to be picked up.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And I picked it up, and I asked
her to hold it on her womb,

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:48.950 align:middle line:90%
just to send her love--

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:50.260 align:middle line:90%
send some love to her womb.

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And after doing the treatment
on Dinel, she was sitting there.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:58.720 align:middle line:90%
And I asked her.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:05.440 align:middle line:10%
I said, what is this
male energy that

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.240 align:middle line:10%
was sitting in your shoulder?

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:11.770 align:middle line:10%
I said to her, it didn't feel
like an old-- like an adult

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:13.270 align:middle line:10%
energy.

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh,
yeah, in 2017, she

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:20.470 align:middle line:90%
had actually had a miscarriage.

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And she had a stillborn
baby, which was a little boy.

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And it really, really
rocked her so much

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.760 align:middle line:84%
that she felt like her
life would not continue,

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.650 align:middle line:84%
if she did not
have another baby.

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's when she fell
pregnant with her daughter

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:35.580 align:middle line:90%
straight after.

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:38.870 align:middle line:90%


00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:43.070 align:middle line:84%
>> When we first started, I felt
a bit of pain on my lower back

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:44.360 align:middle line:90%
and my shoulders.

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.060 align:middle line:84%
And then as you went
through with the sounds,

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:50.540 align:middle line:90%
I lost myself in the sound.

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:51.710 align:middle line:90%
I was relaxed.

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:52.940 align:middle line:90%
I took a journey.

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:54.710 align:middle line:84%
It felt like I was
taking a journey, just

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:58.250 align:middle line:84%
walking through the sound
and just lost myself in it.

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:00.410 align:middle line:84%
By the time we were
done, I felt new.

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:06.380 align:middle line:90%


00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:09.530 align:middle line:84%
My message to Bronwyn is
I wish you all the best,

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:13.850 align:middle line:84%
and may you continue to heal a
lot of souls, a lot of bodies.

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I guess
the world would

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:20.420 align:middle line:84%
be a much better place and a
very positive space for people

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:24.170 align:middle line:84%
to be in the state
that I'm in right now.

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:25.140 align:middle line:90%
I can't explain it.

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:26.510 align:middle line:90%
I really can't describe it.

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:27.650 align:middle line:90%
I came in here.

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:30.080 align:middle line:90%
I felt very heavy.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.240 align:middle line:90%
My heart had gone through a lot.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And right now, I feel like
I can tackle the world.

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:38.960 align:middle line:90%


00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:45.070 align:middle line:84%
>> I think after the treatments,
the proof is in the pudding.

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:48.430 align:middle line:10%
Dinel said the first thing was
that she feels so much happier,

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:51.430 align:middle line:10%
and she even looked lighter.

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:55.720 align:middle line:10%
Her eyes were glowing, and
she didn't have this puffiness

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:59.840 align:middle line:10%
around her eyes when I first
started doing the treatments.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:03.010 align:middle line:84%
She felt this like
cloud around her.

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:06.670 align:middle line:84%
But I have recommended that
she do come for a room healing

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:08.780 align:middle line:90%
massage with me as well.

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:12.790 align:middle line:84%
So I hope to see her for
a future appointment.

>> Life can pose many seemingly
unanswerable questions.

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:19.990 align:middle line:84%
The known may cast shadows
on our perspective.

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:24.700 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes, it is helpful to look
beyond what is, to look at life

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:30.190 align:middle line:10%
from another perspective,
to look from the other side.
