to facilitate a shift in
people, offering them insight

sweating is very common.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.640 align:middle line:84%

blood flowing and connecting to
these kinds of sacred spaces.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.670 align:middle line:84%
For our ancestors,
it's very common,

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.300 align:middle line:84%
and it's withering away
in societies and culture.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.500 align:middle line:84%
I think that's important
that we remember

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.160 align:middle line:84%
when we come back to the Earth
and that we do things together.

And the sweat lodge
is an old tradition.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.160 align:middle line:84%
It's been practiced
for hundreds of years

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.750 align:middle line:90%
by many, many cultures.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And the sweat lodge
that I facilitate

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.910 align:middle line:84%
is linked to Native
American Indians.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.750 align:middle line:84%
What the sweat signifies is
essentially birth and rebirth.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.350 align:middle line:84%
The process for everybody
going through a sweat

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.700 align:middle line:90%
is obviously different.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.312 align:middle line:84%
Each person gets
something unique to them.

00:03:08.312 --> 00:03:09.770 align:middle line:84%
It's important when
doing the sweat

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.680 align:middle line:84%
that you're very clear if
you're entering as a couple

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.070 align:middle line:84%
or with a loved
one that you still

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.320 align:middle line:84%
sing to yourself because
the sweat is for you.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.460 align:middle line:90%
It's an individual thing.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And the transformation, the
teachings, the healings,

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.410 align:middle line:84%
as I say is very
unique to each person.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.600 align:middle line:90%
Some people will cry.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.280 align:middle line:90%
Some people will laugh.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Some people might go into a
very deep form of meditation.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.740 align:middle line:84%
Others might go into a
deep form of hallucination.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.550 align:middle line:84%
It gets quite hot, especially
as each of the levels

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.150 align:middle line:84%
as we add more rocks, and we
also sprinkle a lot of water

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.310 align:middle line:84%
onto the rocks, which
creates a steam.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.730 align:middle line:84%
We put herbs and
incense and everything

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.770 align:middle line:84%
onto it as well, which
gives a different kind

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.420 align:middle line:90%
of a smell at each round.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And that process
for people unlocks

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.410 align:middle line:84%
all sorts of magical evolutions
and teachings and learnings.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.950 align:middle line:84%
So when we speak to people
afterwards, they'll come out,

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.190 align:middle line:84%
and they just want to
have a hug or give a hug.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.900 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, people
are like totally

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.760 align:middle line:90%
blown away by the experience.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.655 align:middle line:84%
Before going in,
especially people

00:04:09.655 --> 00:04:11.030 align:middle line:84%
that haven't done
a sweat before,

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.610 align:middle line:90%
have no real expectation.

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.360 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, people
will say to me, oh,

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.250 align:middle line:84%
is it like getting into a
sauna and in a way, it is.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.787 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually nature
sauna because you're going in.

00:04:19.787 --> 00:04:21.079 align:middle line:90%
You're sweating with the rocks.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.520 align:middle line:84%

sounds around you,

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.090 align:middle line:84%

are very profound.

>> Sweat lodges can be
found all around the world.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.820 align:middle line:84%
Although they hold
varying significance

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.500 align:middle line:84%
depending on the culture, there
are common threads that exist.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.530 align:middle line:84%
Sweat lodges signify
and symbolize

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.290 align:middle line:90%
purification and rebirth.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.200 align:middle line:84%
Through a ceremony and
used in conjunction

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.450 align:middle line:84%
with other modalities
and techniques,

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.450 align:middle line:84%

normally about four to five

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.580 align:middle line:90%
hours in advance.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.800 align:middle line:84%
A big fire is made
obviously, all

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.350 align:middle line:84%
about intention, the
wood that we use,

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.300 align:middle line:90%
the heat, the preparation.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And then the rocks that we're
going to put into the fire

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.630 align:middle line:84%
are dolomite rocks,
very native to the area,

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.410 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of healing energy
also a lot of wisdom and truth

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.563 align:middle line:84%
ancient knowledge because
the rocks have been here

00:05:37.563 --> 00:05:38.980 align:middle line:84%
for millions and
millions of years

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.340 align:middle line:90%
from part of the mountains.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.090 align:middle line:84%
So we take these rocks,
we put them into the fire,

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.820 align:middle line:84%
and we heat these rocks
over a number of hours.

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.550 align:middle line:84%
The fire keeper is
the person who's

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.327 align:middle line:84%
responsible for
managing the fire,

00:05:50.327 --> 00:05:52.660 align:middle line:84%
making sure that the rocks
are at the right temperature.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:06:03.830 align:middle line:90%


00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.910 align:middle line:84%
You get different
types of shaped sweats.

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.410 align:middle line:84%
This particular sweat
is a dome-shaped sweat

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.390 align:middle line:84%
which has been built
and constructed out

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.210 align:middle line:90%
of wattle wood and willow.

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And the wood is basically wet,
put into a permanent shape,

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.180 align:middle line:84%
and then it's dried
in that shape.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.110 align:middle line:84%
So when you see it in
most instances, it's bare,

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.580 align:middle line:84%
it's uncovered, and
it's not in ceremony.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.670 align:middle line:10%
But when we are
preparing the sweat,

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:30.680 align:middle line:10%
and we cover the
sweat in blankets

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.950 align:middle line:10%
to keep all of the
heat inside as well as

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.570 align:middle line:10%
to make it as dark as possible.

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And also, outside of the
door, we've got the fire pit.

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.080 align:middle line:84%
So the door of the
sweat is facing the east

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.130 align:middle line:90%
where the sun rises.

00:06:43.130 --> 00:07:08.250 align:middle line:90%

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:45.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, the process or the
practice of smudging, again,

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.770 align:middle line:84%
being practiced for many,
many years by many spiritual

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:50.030 align:middle line:84%
traditions and many,
many spiritual beliefs.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.280 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, we use a
variety of different things.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.572 align:middle line:90%
So it could be a smudge bundle.

00:08:53.572 --> 00:08:55.960 align:middle line:84%
It could be sage,
any natural herbs.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.630 align:middle line:84%
Also, Palo Santo which
is a sacred wood that

00:08:58.630 --> 00:08:59.680 align:middle line:90%
comes from South America.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And what we then
essentially do is

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.630 align:middle line:84%
we're going to either use a
feather or dust the person

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:08.110 align:middle line:84%
with a smoke from the smudge,
and that essentially signifies

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:11.110 align:middle line:84%
removing any negative
energy, any dark energies,

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:14.410 align:middle line:84%
any negative forces, and it
really just kind of clears

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:17.140 align:middle line:84%
the person's space so that
they can then into the sweat

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.175 align:middle line:90%
and be protected.

00:09:18.175 --> 00:09:19.300 align:middle line:90%
We're going to be chanting.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:20.980 align:middle line:90%
We're going to be talking.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.380 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be
giving stuff away.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.030 align:middle line:90%
We're going to be saying things.

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:28.840 align:middle line:84%
Again like the firework,
this is your personal sweat.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.320 align:middle line:84%
So you're sweating for you and
for various other components,

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.860 align:middle line:84%
but it's about you and your
connection to the room,

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.300 align:middle line:90%
to the sweat, to Mother Earth.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.790 align:middle line:84%
If you can imagine
the sweat whilst it

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:42.940 align:middle line:84%
looks like it's a
semi-circle from the top,

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.840 align:middle line:90%
it's actually a full circle.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.160 align:middle line:84%
So as the ground
is here, so this

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.200 align:middle line:84%
is the sweat that
is above the ground,

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.530 align:middle line:84%
but underneath in a
perfect circle matching,

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:56.200 align:middle line:84%
this is the sweat that
is beneath the ground.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.340 align:middle line:84%
So we're sitting within
a dome, within a sphere.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And the most important thing
is go as deep as you can.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.030 align:middle line:84%
You find as the
rounds intensify,

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:09.790 align:middle line:84%
the heat intensifies,
and that's where you

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:11.750 align:middle line:90%
will start to really connect.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:15.490 align:middle line:84%
So if you can, stay in
the whole five rounds.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:16.490 align:middle line:90%
That will be perfect.

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:21.070 align:middle line:84%
Once the smudging is done, we
will then draw the spirit line.

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And the spirit line is very
significant of the link

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:28.510 align:middle line:84%
between the fire, the rocks,
and the entrance to the sweat.

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.790 align:middle line:84%
So very important that
once that spirit line

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:33.730 align:middle line:84%
has been drawn that nobody
crosses the spirit line.

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:36.580 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is then led to
the entrance of the sweat,

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:38.860 align:middle line:90%
and we walk around the sweat.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And then, in entering, go down
onto your hands and knees.

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:43.810 align:middle line:90%
Put your forehead on the ground.

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And then really just announce
yourself to the universe.

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, you're
going to crawl into the sweat

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.890 align:middle line:84%
and crawl it on
the inside and then

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:53.200 align:middle line:84%
you're going to make
yourself comfortable.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.000 align:middle line:84%
Once everybody's
inside the sweat,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.070 align:middle line:84%
the sweat poorer--
that will be myself.

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:59.445 align:middle line:84%
I will enter the sweat make
sure that I've got everything

00:10:59.445 --> 00:11:00.245 align:middle line:90%
that I need.

00:11:00.245 --> 00:11:01.270 align:middle line:90%
There'll be a rattle.

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:04.810 align:middle line:84%
There'll be a big bucket of
water and a ladle or a spoon,

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:07.870 align:middle line:84%
and we are then ready
to start the process.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:10.570 align:middle line:84%
At this point, I call
for the firekeeper

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:14.570 align:middle line:84%
to bring anything between
five to seven rocks or tunkas

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:15.370 align:middle line:90%
as we call them.

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:17.230 align:middle line:84%
Tunka is Native
American for rock.

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And we look at the
tunka as bringing

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.640 align:middle line:84%
that knowledge and that
wisdom and that teaching

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.140 align:middle line:90%
into the sweat with us.

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:27.230 align:middle line:84%
Once the rocks have been brought
in, the fire keeper will leave,

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:29.140 align:middle line:84%
and the door is
closed, and the sweat

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:32.630 align:middle line:90%
is then put into darkness.

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:35.560 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going to be
running the sweat line now.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.340 align:middle line:84%
OK, everybody, prepare
yourself and have a good sweat.

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:59.902 align:middle line:90%


00:11:59.902 --> 00:12:01.360 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to
enter like this.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.300 align:middle line:90%


00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:10.900 align:middle line:84%
All right, whoever wants to
go first, align yourselves up.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:11.870 align:middle line:90%
Whoever is next?

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:22.910 align:middle line:90%


00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:24.964 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH CHANTING]

00:12:24.964 --> 00:12:30.998 align:middle line:90%


00:12:30.998 --> 00:12:34.491 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:34.491 --> 00:13:12.848 align:middle line:90%


00:13:12.848 --> 00:13:13.648 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome to camp.

00:13:13.648 --> 00:14:05.670 align:middle line:90%


00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:10.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, there are five rounds or
levels that we go through with

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:10.800 align:middle line:90%
the sweat.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.050 align:middle line:84%
The first round will
essentially be there

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:16.170 align:middle line:84%
to signify the welcoming
of the ancestors,

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:19.560 align:middle line:84%
the welcoming of the rocks,
grandfather sky, grandmother

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.080 align:middle line:84%
Earth, and then also calling
in your spirit animal

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.020 align:middle line:84%
who's going to then be there
as a form of protection

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:27.540 align:middle line:84%
to guide you and support
you through your learning

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.170 align:middle line:90%
and your process.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.920 align:middle line:84%
So once that round is
finished, we'll call door.

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.240 align:middle line:90%
The door gets opened.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.910 align:middle line:84%
We then invite the
fire keeper to bring

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:38.640 align:middle line:84%
another round of rocks,
and we then close the door,

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.990 align:middle line:90%
and we start the second around.

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:56.360 align:middle line:90%


00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.190 align:middle line:84%
The second round
will basically be

00:14:58.190 --> 00:14:59.722 align:middle line:90%
sending healing to the planet.

00:14:59.722 --> 00:15:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And the way we send
healing to the planet

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:03.530 align:middle line:84%
is we acknowledge the
two-leggeds, that's

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:05.420 align:middle line:84%
being the people, the
four-leggeds, being

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:06.380 align:middle line:90%
all of our animals.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.420 align:middle line:84%
We look at the fins
being the fish,

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:10.490 align:middle line:84%
and then the winged
being the birds.

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:11.990 align:middle line:84%
And really, what
we're looking to do

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:14.270 align:middle line:84%
at this point is collectively,
within the sweat,

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:15.890 align:middle line:84%
we're sending healing
to the planet,

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:18.020 align:middle line:84%
removing any of the
negative energy.

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.870 align:middle line:84%
Once this round is finished,
we call door again.

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:23.750 align:middle line:84%
The firekeeper will bring
another seven rocks in.

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:27.020 align:middle line:84%
The door is closed, and we
then begin the third around.

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:39.320 align:middle line:90%


00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.170 align:middle line:84%
The third round is
where we send healing

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:45.080 align:middle line:84%
to any family members
any loved ones, obviously

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.160 align:middle line:90%
with their permission.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.000 align:middle line:90%
We send them love.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.130 align:middle line:84%
We send them healing, and
then we go into that process.

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the third
round, we open the door.

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:56.330 align:middle line:84%
We invite seven more rocks or
tunkas back into the sweat.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Once the fire keeper leaves,
and we closed the door.

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:06.450 align:middle line:90%


00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:09.050 align:middle line:84%
We are then in the fourth
round, and the fourth round

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:10.430 align:middle line:90%
is the round of self.

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is the round where we
ask for healing for ourselves.

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.490 align:middle line:84%
We've done all the work in
terms of healing the planet

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:18.500 align:middle line:84%
and healing family and
friends, and now it's

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.830 align:middle line:84%
about going within and
asking to either be

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:24.440 align:middle line:84%
able to release things
that no longer serve us

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:28.513 align:middle line:84%
or drawing and accessing and
asking for strength to give us

00:16:28.513 --> 00:16:29.930 align:middle line:84%
the support for
the things that we

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:32.240 align:middle line:84%
need when we go
into Mother Earth

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.220 align:middle line:90%
and reintegrate ourselves.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:38.720 align:middle line:84%
Once that round is finalized
and finished, we open the door.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.490 align:middle line:84%
We'll pass water
around for everybody

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:41.750 align:middle line:90%
who wants water to drink.

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And we then close
the door again.

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:45.560 align:middle line:84%
We don't introduce
any new rocks.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is the fifth
round, and this is also

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:51.147 align:middle line:84%
known as the silent round as
well as the ancestor round.

00:16:51.147 --> 00:16:52.730 align:middle line:84%
So this is the round
where we will now

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:55.610 align:middle line:84%
sweat with our ancestors who've
been with us the entire time,

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:56.760 align:middle line:90%
and it's really for them.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.163 align:middle line:84%
We want to honor them and
thank them for being present,

00:16:59.163 --> 00:17:00.830 align:middle line:84%
thank them for showing
up and thank them

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:03.590 align:middle line:84%
for the teachings and the
lessons and the healing.

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And once we're finished,
we then call door again,

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:11.160 align:middle line:84%
and whoever wants to leave can
leave, exiting in the same way.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.520 align:middle line:84%
You get on your hands and
knees, and you would crawl out

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:17.240 align:middle line:84%
in reverse, honoring and
respecting the sweat lodge,

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:20.300 align:middle line:84%
putting your forehead on the
ground and giving thanks.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:23.000 align:middle line:84%
The exiting of the sweat
and coming back into Earth

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.579 align:middle line:84%
is essentially the
same process, or it

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:29.600 align:middle line:84%
signifies the process of exiting
the womb and being reborn.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.472 align:middle line:84%
And that is such a
significant point

00:17:32.472 --> 00:17:34.430 align:middle line:84%
because we take the
teachings and the learnings

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:36.590 align:middle line:84%
and everything that we've
gathered from the sweat,

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:39.080 align:middle line:84%
and we now need to be
able to bring that back

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.970 align:middle line:84%
into the real world
and take it with us

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:43.940 align:middle line:90%
and do the work that we can do.

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:45.800 align:middle line:84%
Invite your spirit
animal to join you.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:53.350 align:middle line:90%


00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:56.770 align:middle line:84%
Tunkas, give her energy and
their wisdom and knowledge

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:59.740 align:middle line:90%
to share with us.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:03.340 align:middle line:84%
I advise grandfather sky
and grandmother Earth Gaia

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:08.480 align:middle line:84%
to come and join us
and sweat with us

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:12.660 align:middle line:84%
and just connect with yourself,
bring yourself centered,

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:13.460 align:middle line:90%
be one.

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:19.870 align:middle line:90%


00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:23.945 align:middle line:84%
We've just completed a
one-and-a-half hour sweat

00:18:23.945 --> 00:18:24.745 align:middle line:90%
lodge.

00:18:24.745 --> 00:18:33.740 align:middle line:90%


00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:37.100 align:middle line:84%
We started just before
sunrise this morning.

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:40.640 align:middle line:84%
The rocks were prepared at
about 2 o'clock this morning.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:41.930 align:middle line:90%
We made a big fire.

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Had the rocks put in there,
about 30 different dolomite

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:47.300 align:middle line:84%
rocks, which heats
up beautifully.

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:50.600 align:middle line:84%
The rocks are only really used
once, and then after the sweat,

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.800 align:middle line:90%
they aren't used again.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.410 align:middle line:84%
They are then discarded,
put back into the Earth,

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:55.730 align:middle line:90%
giving gratitude and thanks.

00:18:55.730 --> 00:19:02.580 align:middle line:90%


00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:05.490 align:middle line:84%
There were about 12 of us
this morning that went in.

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:10.260 align:middle line:84%
We built the spirit line, which
essentially connected the fire

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.000 align:middle line:90%
to the sweat.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Everybody walked
around the outside

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:15.690 align:middle line:84%
and then got on their
hands and knees,

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:18.015 align:middle line:84%
put their foot down on the
ground and then crawled in.

00:19:18.015 --> 00:19:20.910 align:middle line:90%


00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:22.920 align:middle line:84%
The concept of coming
out of the sweat

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.920 align:middle line:84%
is like entering or exiting
the womb and entering Earth.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And in the same way,
we are reintegrated

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.390 align:middle line:84%
with Earth, reintegrated
with the planet,

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:33.240 align:middle line:84%
and we are then
reintegrated into society.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.870 align:middle line:84%
We take our lessons and our
teachings with us into life,

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:39.090 align:middle line:90%
and we do the best that we can.

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:42.960 align:middle line:84%
>> I find it most
liberating and refreshing.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm always up on my spiritual
journey to try new things.

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.400 align:middle line:90%
That was my first.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Very similar to
kind of heated yoga

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:52.350 align:middle line:84%
but more spiritual,
maybe in a way.

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:54.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I can highly recommend it.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.700 align:middle line:84%
I've heard a lot about
it, and I have never

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.710 align:middle line:90%
had the opportunity to try.

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:00.810 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just
an important time

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:04.620 align:middle line:84%
we're living in now is to break
barriers and try new things,

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:08.130 align:middle line:84%
break out of our
egoistic little boxes

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:14.070 align:middle line:84%
and embrace other
cultures, learning them.

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the first time
I've tried the sweat.

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.590 align:middle line:90%
What an awesome experience.

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:19.260 align:middle line:90%
I can't explain it.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.840 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.730 align:middle line:90%
I feel rejuvenated.

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:28.620 align:middle line:90%
I feel as if I'm reborn.

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Sweat lodge
was quite intense.

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.230 align:middle line:84%
This is the second one
I'd be doing in a week,

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:37.260 align:middle line:84%
and the first one I did was
with the same facilitators,

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:41.370 align:middle line:84%
and the first one we did
was with 24, 25 or plus

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:43.260 align:middle line:90%
minus coming in and out.

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:44.580 align:middle line:90%
Sangoma.

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And it was the most special and
hyper-spiritualized experience

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:49.450 align:middle line:90%
I've ever had in my life.

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:51.930 align:middle line:84%
The second one kind of
felt like a solidifying

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:55.080 align:middle line:84%
of that nature, just a
feeling of understanding

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.240 align:middle line:84%
that as I get birthed
out once again

00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:01.410 align:middle line:84%
covered in the natal
feces of the Earth,

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:03.840 align:middle line:84%
I find myself
continuously asking

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:07.200 align:middle line:84%
what is it that makes us when
we come and when we begin.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And how that beginning comes
as through the umbilical cord

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:11.970 align:middle line:84%
that we connect to through
the Earth, and the only way

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:14.910 align:middle line:84%
we can connect to that umbilical
cord is if we take our time,

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:20.040 align:middle line:90%
slow down, sit down, get quiet.

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Once we're quiet,
then we start singing.

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:23.950 align:middle line:90%
And we get loud.

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:24.750 align:middle line:90%
We get louder.

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:25.550 align:middle line:90%
We get quiet.

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:26.370 align:middle line:90%
We sing Yogi Bear.

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:27.870 align:middle line:84%
We sing Twinkle
Twinkle Little Star,

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:30.310 align:middle line:90%
and we also sing my best song.

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:31.600 align:middle line:90%
We go deep.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.600 align:middle line:84%
We go shallow because
the water is us.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.150 align:middle line:90%
We are the water.

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:39.210 align:middle line:84%
It's beautiful,
beautiful, unbelievable

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:40.442 align:middle line:90%
Earth-shattering feeling.

00:21:40.442 --> 00:21:42.900 align:middle line:84%
If you haven't done it before,
I would highly recommend it.

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Before you start trying
your plant medicines,

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:46.750 align:middle line:84%
before you start
taking psychedelics,

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:48.750 align:middle line:84%
I'd recommend that you
find experiences that are

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:50.940 align:middle line:90%
able to use you and your body.

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:54.850 align:middle line:84%
You and your body, first
and foremost, start there.

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:56.920 align:middle line:90%
Then see what happens.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Alternative healing
is all around us,

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:05.710 align:middle line:84%
from sweat lodges to fireworks,
hypnotherapy and reiki.

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:08.340 align:middle line:84%
They are all a way
for us to look inward

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.070 align:middle line:90%
and, if you allow it, to heal.
