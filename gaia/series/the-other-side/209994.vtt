come to understand is being

since 2005.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.260 align:middle line:84%
My heritage is a
little bit convoluted

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.200 align:middle line:84%
because of the I suppose
history of South Africa.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.380 align:middle line:90%
So I would be--

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.200 align:middle line:84%
on a document,
government document,

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.970 align:middle line:84%
classed as Colored although
I would describe myself

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.770 align:middle line:84%
as being of Khoi
and San descent,

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.560 align:middle line:84%
which would have been the
first people of South Africa.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.040 align:middle line:84%
So for me the history
of the Khoi and the Saan

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.470 align:middle line:84%
is not actually something
that I grew up with.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.230 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the very
opposite of it.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.460 align:middle line:84%
It-- I feel like with the
history of South Africa,

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.060 align:middle line:84%
there is such a deep-seated
trauma I want to say.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.960 align:middle line:84%
I remember the specific
instance of seeing

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.860 align:middle line:84%
a picture of Saan people with
a bow and arrow and me being

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.640 align:middle line:90%
like, whoa, that's not me.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there's definitely
an element of, like,

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.420 align:middle line:84%
wanting to distance myself or
having done that in the past.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And so what has happened now
recently is for the maybe past

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.510 align:middle line:84%
five, six years since I've
been on my spiritual journey is

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.510 align:middle line:90%
that it has actually found me.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.510 align:middle line:84%
The spirit of the
ancestors seems

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.730 align:middle line:84%
to want to use me as
a sort of mouthpiece

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.420 align:middle line:84%
for an ancient way
of being, and I

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.980 align:middle line:84%
find that for me I have found
my sense of belonging ever

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.640 align:middle line:84%
since I started identifying
as Khoi and Saan.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Khoi, of course, means human,
which I undisputedly am.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And then the Saan,
I have recently

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.850 align:middle line:84%
started to connect with more on
a sort of spiritual level, more

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.690 align:middle line:84%
getting in touch with the
dancing and trance dancing

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.050 align:middle line:84%
around the fire and
through making music

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.020 align:middle line:90%
that is trance dance inspired.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.645 align:middle line:84%
It's been done for
thousands of years

00:05:03.645 --> 00:05:08.220 align:middle line:84%

were a nomadic people.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.030 align:middle line:84%
If there was an illness in
the family, in the tribe,

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.180 align:middle line:84%
they would dance for
days, hours upon end.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I seem
to be able to tap in

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:25.390 align:middle line:84%
or tune into that frequency
or power more frequently now,

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.880 align:middle line:84%

really profound, a really

>> I was a musician, a
singer-songwriter called--

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.620 align:middle line:84%
and I called myself
Khoisan boyMan,

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.550 align:middle line:84%

of, the Khoi and the Saan.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.250 align:middle line:84%

a reference to the boy

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.920 align:middle line:84%
that I was who
was misunderstood,

And then last year when
hard lockdown happened,

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.760 align:middle line:84%
I was like who am
I without music

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.830 align:middle line:84%
and who am I
without this guitar,

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.590 align:middle line:90%
and all these questions came up.

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And so I actually ended
up discovering the bow.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.300 align:middle line:84%
But instead of using
it as a weapon,

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.300 align:middle line:84%
I use it as an
instrument, and that

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:23.990 align:middle line:84%
has rekindled something that
was missing for me definitely.

purpose to me doing music

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:47.060 align:middle line:84%
a sangoma in the past--
we did a divination--

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:52.460 align:middle line:84%
and one of my ancestors
my father's mother,

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.590 align:middle line:84%

through and she said to me--

through, and she said

music is your
medicine, just not in

took me a while to

doing sound journeys rather

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:21.320 align:middle line:84%
than the conventional song
sung by song format has crossed

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.510 align:middle line:90%
a threshold I would say.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.760 align:middle line:84%
Because we live in
a modern day society

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.120 align:middle line:84%
where there isn't people just
simply living in the Bush

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:34.549 align:middle line:84%
and doing trance dance, I've had
to adapt my own version of it.

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:39.110 align:middle line:84%
I hope to one day still go to
a trance dance in the Kalahari

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:44.580 align:middle line:84%
or Botswana, but for now,
this is a way that I've found.

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:48.370 align:middle line:84%
So how it has come to
fruition for me is it's--

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:52.430 align:middle line:84%
it started as full
moon ceremonies, which

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:55.010 align:middle line:90%
was for me also life changing.

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:58.130 align:middle line:84%
The difference
that it makes in--

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:03.020 align:middle line:84%
certainly in my life to
align myself to the moon

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:08.720 align:middle line:90%
cycles has been transformatory.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.840 align:middle line:84%
So it started off as
full moon ceremonies,

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:14.660 align:middle line:84%
but then I was like it's--
something's missing.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:18.230 align:middle line:84%
Then it was now we're going
to go do retreat spaces,

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.290 align:middle line:84%
so then you leave
the city in order

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:24.280 align:middle line:84%
to be away from
the distractions.

Also working with medicine
whether it's cacao

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:30.010 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's psilocybin
or whether it's just

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:33.160 align:middle line:84%
completely sober in the trance
and the dance and the music

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.670 align:middle line:84%
is the medicine, that's
always a different process.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:39.100 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's giving
the offering,

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.010 align:middle line:84%
asking for guidance
and assistance,

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:45.340 align:middle line:84%
and then leaving
myself open to be

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.770 align:middle line:84%
guided by the
spirit of the music

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:52.120 align:middle line:84%
and the trance
and the ancestors.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:56.110 align:middle line:84%
Definitely the trance
dance has massively

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:59.560 align:middle line:84%
helped me find a
place of belonging.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:04.270 align:middle line:84%
It comes with a sense of lament
because trance dance definitely

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:07.850 align:middle line:84%
I feel there's something
else that takes over

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:11.140 align:middle line:84%
and I have these visions
of being around the fire

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:13.750 align:middle line:84%
whether I'm looking
at a physical fire

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:18.640 align:middle line:84%
but then I realize that this
is actually a different fire.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:22.120 align:middle line:84%
So there's this
element of deep sadness

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.950 align:middle line:84%
that comes along
with it as well.

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:26.390 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes that's
been the experience.

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:29.230 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the intention is
to dance through heartbreak

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:34.300 align:middle line:84%
and trauma into bliss, but some
of the experiences that I've

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:42.670 align:middle line:84%
had has been lament and deep
sadness for that sense of tribe

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:45.880 align:middle line:84%
or communion or healing
that has been taken away

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:49.840 align:middle line:84%
or should I rather say doesn't
feature in our day-to-day lives

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:15.710 align:middle line:84%
There are many
rituals and ceremonies

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:19.910 align:middle line:84%
used by various cultures
to connect to ancestors,

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:22.670 align:middle line:90%
go within, and find healing.

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:26.150 align:middle line:84%
But Saan trance dance
is amongst the oldest

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:30.360 align:middle line:84%
as the Saan people come from
the oldest lineages of mankind.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:36.910 align:middle line:90%


00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:41.170 align:middle line:84%
When connecting to elders,
ancestors, or simply

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:44.185 align:middle line:84%
the spirit world, an
offering is generally made.

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:04.740 align:middle line:84%
So usually when you're working
with traversing between worlds

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:06.810 align:middle line:84%
and you're communing
with the ancestors,

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:10.965 align:middle line:84%
there's always a form of
offering that is required.

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:29.840 align:middle line:84%

like bushman's bed stuff,

And that is a herb that
is used as an invocation.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.110 align:middle line:90%
So I would call in my guides.

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:02.460 align:middle line:90%
I would call in my ancestors.

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.490 align:middle line:84%
I would call in the

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:49.120 align:middle line:90%
that they are waiting.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:57.900 align:middle line:84%
They are waiting for the new
form of Bushman to incarnate,

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:03.020 align:middle line:84%
the spirit of the
Saan, Bushman, is

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:10.830 align:middle line:84%
waiting to incarnate in a
new space and a new time

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:19.410 align:middle line:84%

new space, in a new time,

and the message has been
received that it's good,

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:10.260 align:middle line:84%
then I will go to the
location where I will stump

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:18.450 align:middle line:84%

offering of my talent or gift

in South Africa,

there are numerous sacred sites.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.960 align:middle line:84%
This cave is special
for many reasons,

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:25.730 align:middle line:84%
but the main ones is because
it's actually an ancient burial

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:30.350 align:middle line:84%
site where the remains
of 14 bodies were found,

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:32.450 align:middle line:84%
ancient people that
lived in this valley

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:35.660 align:middle line:84%
when it looked very different
to how it does today.

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And then the other reason is
because there's a beautiful sun

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:45.250 align:middle line:90%
path alignment that happens.

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:49.590 align:middle line:84%
So what happens there
is that at the summer

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:54.870 align:middle line:84%
solstice in the
southern hemisphere

00:16:54.870 --> 00:17:01.530 align:middle line:84%
is when the sun reaches its
southernmost tip, and basically

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:04.290 align:middle line:84%
the rays of the
light shoot straight

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:08.180 align:middle line:90%
through the cave on that day.

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:11.839 align:middle line:84%
It's also a beautiful
yoni cave, so it's

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:16.430 align:middle line:84%
a tribute to the divine
feminine and quite beautifully

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:18.859 align:middle line:84%
and significantly
and symbolically.

00:17:18.859 --> 00:17:24.589 align:middle line:84%
It's as if the sun impregnates
the rock or the cave

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:29.060 align:middle line:84%
with light, and that is what
marks the summer solstice.
