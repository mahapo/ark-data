as being a part of all

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.830 align:middle line:10%
I used to eat up to
nine chocolates a day,

needed heart medicine.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.160 align:middle line:10%
And Cacao came in,
and she's really just

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.430 align:middle line:10%
assisted me so deeply
with opening my heart,

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.820 align:middle line:10%

Which is quite interesting.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.560 align:middle line:84%
So I think I was born with the
blessing of knowing my path.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think we all are
here for the same reason,

I didn't realize that
chocolate was part of Ixcacao.

And I went to the ceremony.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.480 align:middle line:10%
And I had the most
profound experience.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.820 align:middle line:90%
I literally felt everything.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.600 align:middle line:84%
I felt everything, and I
just felt all the tears

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.980 align:middle line:90%
that had been building up.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.680 align:middle line:84%
I'd been in a really
tough space with myself.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.930 align:middle line:84%
I'd been crying a
lot, was finding

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.460 align:middle line:84%
things difficult. I was
finding processing difficult.

I just wasn't connecting with
myself the way I wanted to.

And I was doing all the work,
and I was doing all the stuff.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.560 align:middle line:84%
But I was missing the
spirit of the heart.

in the creation of humanity.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.450 align:middle line:84%

actually open and heal my heart.

And I was blown away
because, in that ceremony,

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.050 align:middle line:10%
I started purging.

I was on the loo, just
letting everything out.

00:04:23.785 --> 00:04:26.470 align:middle line:84%
that that was me
letting go of trauma.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And Ixcacao can actually assist
to remove those blockages.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Ixcacao was a goddess
from the Mayan times.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.590 align:middle line:84%
She used to be known as
the goddess of abundance.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.340 align:middle line:84%
She used to bring fertility
to the farms and the crops.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.860 align:middle line:10%
And when all changed
in that area,

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.550 align:middle line:10%
she became the goddess
who used to walk

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.150 align:middle line:10%
the children of the crops--

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.960 align:middle line:10%
the families' children of the
crops-- to their sacrifice.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very, very
traumatic and difficult job

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.940 align:middle line:84%
for her to do because
she was all about love.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, one day,
she ran off into the forest,

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.720 align:middle line:84%
and she married a man she didn't
want to marry in the commerce.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.810 align:middle line:84%
That's how cacao got
everywhere, through the ships

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.180 align:middle line:84%
and traveling and
becoming an income.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.560 align:middle line:84%
She ran into the
forest, and she said

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.560 align:middle line:84%
that the people will call
her when the planet is

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.150 align:middle line:90%

So I recommend, find out where
you can get Ixcacao, get it

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.520 align:middle line:10%
into your body, and
start your healing,

start your deep healing.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.320 align:middle line:84%
I was told she would,
and I didn't expect it.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.200 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't expect
to that degree.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.000 align:middle line:84%
My heart is so much more
open and so much more willing

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.950 align:middle line:90%
to be vulnerable.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And that, for me,
is deep healing.

more of that in.

And I sing to her again.

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And then I stir her, and then
I taste her, and she tells me,

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:56.050 align:middle line:90%
we are good to go.

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:56.920 align:middle line:90%
And then I'm ready.

She is ready.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:20.770 align:middle line:84%
So now all I need to do
is take her to the stove.

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:23.445 align:middle line:84%
And I put the gas
on a little bit.

00:10:23.445 --> 00:10:27.850 align:middle line:84%
Need to heat up a little bit so
those spices can get in there

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:30.490 align:middle line:90%

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:31.810 align:middle line:90%

We'll be serving

and I couldn't say no.

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:50.800 align:middle line:10%
It is indeed my first time
attending such ceremony.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.050 align:middle line:90%
And I'm looking forward to it.

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And I really believe that
the very best is yet to come.

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:57.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm so open to
this new existence,

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:58.650 align:middle line:90%
and I'm looking forward to it.

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And I could not be more
grateful for the invite.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:01.920 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

of all that no longer serves.

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:14.850 align:middle line:84%
It's just super
special to be here.

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:22.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Like you say, it's definitely
new beginnings and new moving

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.750 align:middle line:84%
forward, opening up
to the new in my life.

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And so many things are revolving
and changing again in my life.

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is the
right moment on the ceremony

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.160 align:middle line:90%
to do it.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>> I just love Ixcacao.

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so grateful that we
can do this together because it

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.820 align:middle line:90%
is a healing of the heart.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And the medicine of Ixcacao
is to get the blood flowing.

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:48.420 align:middle line:84%
So it helps with
high blood pressure,

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:52.020 align:middle line:84%
it helps with diabetes,
it helps with cholesterol,

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.780 align:middle line:84%
helps with anxiety,
stress, depression.

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:58.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's got a lot of physical
properties of healing.

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.710 align:middle line:84%
But then, when we
go a deeper level,

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:04.620 align:middle line:84%
it goes into the
spirit of our chakras.

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.590 align:middle line:84%
We tend to-- when we get
into a healing space,

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:08.880 align:middle line:90%
we get hard on ourselves.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.610 align:middle line:84%
But Ixcacao teaches you
that the anger and the

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:16.060 align:middle line:84%
hurt you have is hiding
what is really happening.

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.650 align:middle line:84%
So as you sit here and
you're taking her in,

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:22.050 align:middle line:84%
visualize her working
on your frequency

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:24.810 align:middle line:84%
and helping you to shift the
blockages in your body that

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:27.330 align:middle line:84%
is stopping you
from moving forward.

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Let her work her magic, trust
her, and ask her to give you

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:33.555 align:middle line:90%
the courage to heal.

one of the red, two

So a beautiful way is, you
can touch your forehead

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.070 align:middle line:84%
so you can just take her
in, just acknowledge her

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:18.020 align:middle line:84%

to connect to her spirit

what we wish they would do.

Because when I get angry
or upset, I become weak.

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.840 align:middle line:84%
But it's not their fault.
They could have said it

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.340 align:middle line:84%
to somebody else, and the person
would have had no reaction.

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:06.460 align:middle line:84%
But because they said it to
me and because it's my story,

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:09.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm reacting instead of saying,
thank you for bringing it up

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:11.230 align:middle line:90%

I literally had
to think about it

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:26.250 align:middle line:90%
and just try calm myself down.

Like, literally.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.510 align:middle line:84%
I think, around 10:00 or 12:00,
I got a call from my friend.

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And something
really triggered me,

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:36.310 align:middle line:84%
so I had to come to my own
senses and deal with it.

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And we also need to trust our
own emotions because sometimes,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.420 align:middle line:84%
we put our emotions on the
illusion of the story when,

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:45.300 align:middle line:84%
in actual fact, there's a deeper
reason why we're going through

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:46.680 align:middle line:84%

what's showing.

And for the first
week and a half,

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:07.819 align:middle line:84%
I've called for help
to guide me more

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:12.770 align:middle line:90%
and to just not feel so alone.

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:18.560 align:middle line:84%

so busy.

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:22.460 align:middle line:90%
And they help us in.

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:24.560 align:middle line:90%
They've just come into my space.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:26.990 align:middle line:90%
And I'm actually following it.

if we want to look
at it like that.

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:52.040 align:middle line:84%

moving to the west.

The energy today
was quite intense.

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:02.910 align:middle line:84%

to each and every one of you for
having the courage to be here

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:08.530 align:middle line:90%
with me.

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
start showing itself

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:12.920 align:middle line:90%
because she works subtly.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.600 align:middle line:90%
She doesn't work obviously.

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And then, when she
comes through subtly,

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:20.880 align:middle line:84%
then you see how
obvious she works.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:21.830 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:22.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:23.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, guys.

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:24.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:26.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for
being in this space.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:27.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, thank you.

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:29.090 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:30.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Very nice.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So yeah, just blessing
the sacred space,

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:35.180 align:middle line:84%
thanking our ancestors
that have come to join us,

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:40.340 align:middle line:84%
thanking the masters, thanking
Ixcacao for her medicine,

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:45.290 align:middle line:84%
for her beauty, for her
gentleness, and for her wisdom.

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:50.600 align:middle line:84%
From my own presence to your
own presence, we are done.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:54.870 align:middle line:84%
By the power of three, a
perfect trinity, I thank you.

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:57.470 align:middle line:84%
It is done, it is
done, it is done.

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:58.770 align:middle line:90%
Amen.

00:18:58.770 --> 00:18:59.800 align:middle line:90%
We thank you.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.752 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:02.752 --> 00:19:06.196 align:middle line:90%


00:19:06.196 --> 00:19:11.610 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we just complemented
one another in such a awesome

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:17.010 align:middle line:90%
way in space.

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And every time I took a
piece of the chocolate,

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:25.350 align:middle line:84%
I had a different
flavor in my mouth.

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:31.290 align:middle line:84%
So from a heavy, muddy feeling
in my mouth, to a very--

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:35.220 align:middle line:84%
next piece was very
tangy, succulent.

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:37.530 align:middle line:90%
But it would like, lock my jaw.

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:40.170 align:middle line:90%
And it was so empowering.

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:43.890 align:middle line:84%
My tongue and everything
just flayed up and burnt.

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:47.640 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, there is
definitely an opening.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And I just thank Caryn for
giving us this opportunity

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:55.670 align:middle line:90%
to do the Ixcacao.

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:57.670 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel very blessed
to have shared the space.

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:59.378 align:middle line:84%
It was my first time
sitting with Cassie,

00:19:59.378 --> 00:20:03.920 align:middle line:90%
and she holds remarkable space.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:04.830 align:middle line:90%
She's so confident.

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:05.630 align:middle line:90%
She's a warrior.

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:07.210 align:middle line:90%
She's a goddess.

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:08.960 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I walk away today
feeling empowered,

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.720 align:middle line:84%
feeling supported
by my ancestors,

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.805 align:middle line:84%
by my beautiful
family, by my guides.

00:20:13.805 --> 00:20:18.460 align:middle line:90%


00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:22.660 align:middle line:90%
>> So for me, it was grounding.

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:24.730 align:middle line:90%
It was super grounding today.

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:26.920 align:middle line:84%
Normally, I find
myself with spirit.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm quite up in the air.

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And I think with the process
that needed to unfold,

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:39.550 align:middle line:84%
we had to be grounded, and
we had to come into the now.

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:40.760 align:middle line:90%
She was beautiful.

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.130 align:middle line:90%
She was gentle.

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:43.120 align:middle line:90%
She was kind.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.994 align:middle line:84%
This is Ixcacao
I'm talking about.

00:20:45.994 --> 00:20:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And she just brought me
into a place of rest.

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'm feeling lighter,
whereas, when I started,

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:55.720 align:middle line:90%
I was feeling quite heavy.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:59.290 align:middle line:84%
So the two cards that
I got-- and that's

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:03.130 align:middle line:84%
why I know that today
is the feminine.

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:08.980 align:middle line:84%
Got Fatimah, and that is
about religion and about love.

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:14.180 align:middle line:84%
And our lineage is love, and
our religion is gratitude.

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:17.350 align:middle line:84%
So if we can come into a
place of gratitude every day,

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:18.920 align:middle line:90%
we can reach love every day.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:23.240 align:middle line:84%
So I found that pretty profound
as she came forward for us.

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And then, the other
card that I drew--

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.250 align:middle line:84%
because I get to draw the card
for all of us-- was Inanna.

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And Inanna is the queen
of heaven and earth.

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And she says, get naked, get
raw, show yourself to yourself.

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:41.380 align:middle line:84%
Go to the shadow, go to
the light, see it all.

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Be the high priestess you are,
use your intuition, manifest.

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:47.350 align:middle line:90%
And it was just beautiful.

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:49.240 align:middle line:90%
It was a very intimate ceremony.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.630 align:middle line:90%
There were four of us.

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:52.840 align:middle line:84%
We got to be on the north,
south, east, west, which

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:53.740 align:middle line:90%
was wonderful.

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:55.990 align:middle line:90%
And we were like angels.

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:58.510 align:middle line:90%
We came in with no emotion.

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:01.720 align:middle line:84%
We came in with
discernment, with clarity.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And we came in for a
process of healing.

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:09.340 align:middle line:84%
So thank you again for
allowing me the opportunity

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.740 align:middle line:84%
to share the magic
of Ixcacao with you

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:13.870 align:middle line:90%
and the magic of spirit.

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Many seeking spiritual
guidance turn to the ancient

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:18.880 align:middle line:90%
teachings.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:22.510 align:middle line:84%
They look for answers
through the realms of time.

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Often, it is helpful to
look beyond what it is,

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:30.520 align:middle line:84%
to look for answers
from the other side.

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.570 align:middle line:10%
