00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.410 align:middle line:84%
>> The holistic world of healing
includes plants and herbs,

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.460 align:middle line:84%
channeling energy, as well as
both spiritual and physical

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.600 align:middle line:90%
modalities.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.950 align:middle line:84%
Healers are
multidimensional beings

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.450 align:middle line:84%
who dance between the realms
of the seen and unseen.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.600 align:middle line:84%
These individuals
have the ability

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.650 align:middle line:84%
to facilitate a shift in
people, offering them insight

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.260 align:middle line:84%
and support, reconnecting people
with themselves and the greater

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.510 align:middle line:84%
collective, healing the
world one person at a time,

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.760 align:middle line:90%
healing from the other side.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:35.430 align:middle line:90%


00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Dreams are a guidance to
this particular space to grow

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.520 align:middle line:84%
and to have an understanding
about the other worlds.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And this way, the universe
is explored at the same time,

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.970 align:middle line:90%
as you unravel the dreams.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.850 align:middle line:90%


00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:03.140 align:middle line:10%
So my dream was to go
ahead, to go deep inside me.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.320 align:middle line:10%
But however, there was a
lot of procrastination.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.009 align:middle line:84%
But one day, all my
buttons were pressed,

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.450 align:middle line:84%
when I suffered severe
back pain, back problems.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And as opposed to have
surgery, all these things,

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.270 align:middle line:90%
but I didn't get to it.

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.910 align:middle line:84%
A miracle came through an
American doctor called Isa

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.780 align:middle line:90%
Lindwall and his wife Yolanda.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.030 align:middle line:84%
They were practicing
releasing work.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And in that process,
I learned how

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.990 align:middle line:90%
to release burdens and problems.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And I was completely
freed from that burden,

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.430 align:middle line:84%
having a lot of fear
about back problem

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.290 align:middle line:90%
and not being able to work.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And a spiritual
experience, I just

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.030 align:middle line:90%
flipped when I released enough.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.200 align:middle line:84%
One says, it's like a
balloon that wants to rise,

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.270 align:middle line:84%
but something is
holding it back.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And I was held back by
a few little problems.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.660 align:middle line:84%
When I released
that, I took off.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.980 align:middle line:84%
So being on a spiritual
path at the time meditation,

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.300 align:middle line:84%
I had a spiritual master,
and I met that master

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.890 align:middle line:84%
on the other side
in the other world.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And so, there was a link created
between the spiritual world

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.750 align:middle line:90%
and me being here.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.240 align:middle line:90%


00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:42.410 align:middle line:84%
This was a process that flung
me into the higher worlds.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:48.110 align:middle line:84%
During this process, I met my
higher self and also guiding

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.240 align:middle line:84%
entities, as well as
the releasing masters

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.700 align:middle line:84%
who got internal guidance
on where to go, what to do,

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.440 align:middle line:90%
and what to attend to.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And one of the projects
which were cut out for me

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.470 align:middle line:84%
was to learn about
angelic concepts.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And the dream world
is part of it.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.650 align:middle line:84%
So I attended to what they
call angelic script, which

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.540 align:middle line:84%
is they call it light script,
which is part of the higher

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:28.040 align:middle line:84%
world type of communication
system and also,

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.050 align:middle line:84%
how this relates to
being here on Earth

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.860 align:middle line:84%
and how it relates
to dream worlds.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.390 align:middle line:84%
It was a complete
retraining of everything.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.800 align:middle line:84%
So I never really read
any books on dreams,

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.550 align:middle line:84%
but it became such a
fascinating subject for me.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.900 align:middle line:84%
So I started to
interpret my dreams,

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.120 align:middle line:84%
and I got inner help also
how to decipher things.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And this was my first step
into the world of dreams.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Dreams have long
been regarded as a map

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.840 align:middle line:90%
to the subconscious mind.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Dream interpreters
take this further,

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.510 align:middle line:84%
seeing them as a
channel of communication

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.870 align:middle line:84%
between our world and
the spirit realms,

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.870 align:middle line:84%
transmitting messages
ready to be decoded.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.360 align:middle line:90%


00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So most people on
this planet dream.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.060 align:middle line:90%
Some don't, but most people do.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.010 align:middle line:90%
And there's an amazing--

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.680 align:middle line:84%
I discovered, it's an
amazing importance to it.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.770 align:middle line:84%
Because there is this
part in ourselves

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.990 align:middle line:84%
that would like to connect
to the other worlds.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.290 align:middle line:84%
So we live by
assumption what is it

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.350 align:middle line:84%
like in the heavens, what is
it like in the astral worlds.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And we read books,
this and that,

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.110 align:middle line:90%
and different information.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.180 align:middle line:84%
But doing it yourself
is very different.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.110 align:middle line:84%
One very important aspect
of dream interpretation

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.300 align:middle line:84%
is one often gets referred
back to life purpose

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.280 align:middle line:90%
and also healing.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.670 align:middle line:84%
If your neighbor is not
well, your child is not well,

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.590 align:middle line:84%
the husband or the
wife is not well,

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.470 align:middle line:84%
there is definite information
what the problem is.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And so, through the
dreams, you might

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:23.310 align:middle line:84%
connect with ancient karmas,
which say this is the problem,

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.160 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.630 align:middle line:90%
And it needs to be resolved.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:32.470 align:middle line:84%
Another one is that before
one would fall ill of any sort

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:36.820 align:middle line:84%
or has an accident,
there's the dream that

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.980 align:middle line:84%
will hint at something
is going to happen.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And so, the miracle
is, of course, what

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:44.800 align:middle line:90%
do you do with the dream?

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.008 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of people
who write down and jot down

00:06:47.008 --> 00:06:51.310 align:middle line:84%
the dream but still don't
know what it actually means.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:07:04.670 align:middle line:90%


00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:09.940 align:middle line:84%
So today, we have a little
business with Natalie.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Natalie had a dream, and she's
wondering what to do about it.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.530 align:middle line:90%
She will give me the dream.

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:18.530 align:middle line:90%
I will look at it.

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:21.940 align:middle line:84%
I'll jot down all the
different elements

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:28.100 align:middle line:84%
and then decipher the exact
meaning of a dream, which is,

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:32.330 align:middle line:84%
of course, angelic language,
angelic symbolism, and also

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:33.130 align:middle line:90%
colors.

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:36.460 align:middle line:84%
So we do that as an
exercise, and we will

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.980 align:middle line:90%
see what happens in the end.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:43.310 align:middle line:90%


00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:47.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Coming up on the other
side, we meet Natalie,

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:51.410 align:middle line:84%
who is searching for the
meaning behind one of her most

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:53.075 align:middle line:90%
significant dreams yet.

00:07:53.075 --> 00:08:08.220 align:middle line:90%


00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:13.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Dreams have always been
sacred to me from family

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.930 align:middle line:90%
lineage heritage.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:19.410 align:middle line:84%
I've always been
guided by my dreams.

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:21.190 align:middle line:90%
I've listened to them.

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:25.650 align:middle line:84%
I've learned to know
them and remember them.

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And I really believe in
the sacredness of dreams.

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:34.080 align:middle line:84%
When we were children, we were
asked to write down our dreams

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.500 align:middle line:84%
and hand them in
for interpretation.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.530 align:middle line:10%
And I developed a
culture, over the years,

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:43.830 align:middle line:10%
of really paying
attention to my dreams.

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And in the past,
I've been gifted

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.260 align:middle line:84%
with prophetic dreams
which have guided me,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.180 align:middle line:84%
warned me, assisted
me over the years.

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And I actually had a dream
just recently, the other day.

00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:00.600 align:middle line:84%
It was a prophetic dream,
and it announced the arrival

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.670 align:middle line:84%
of a long lost friend that
I hadn't seen in more than a

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:04.470 align:middle line:90%
year.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:05.598 align:middle line:90%
And I dreamed him--

00:09:05.598 --> 00:09:07.140 align:middle line:84%
I dreamed about him
the night before.

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And the very next day, he
walked up here at the house.

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And I just looked at
my husband, and we both

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.030 align:middle line:84%
chuckled because I told
him about the dream.

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.590 align:middle line:90%
So for me, dreams are special.

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:23.140 align:middle line:90%
They are sacred in a sense.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And if we pay enough
attention, a lot

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:31.230 align:middle line:84%
of our answers or
conflicts or dilemmas

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:33.750 align:middle line:90%
can be answered by our dreams.

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:39.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Dreams are a vital part
of the human experience.

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:44.020 align:middle line:84%
Many of us dream in vivid
imagery, rich colors,

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:46.900 align:middle line:90%
and powerful emotion.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:51.505 align:middle line:84%
Yet, few of us understand
what it all means.

00:09:51.505 --> 00:09:54.440 align:middle line:90%


00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>> I had a dream a while ago
that involved a very beautiful

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.940 align:middle line:84%
and special part of the
area in which I live.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:09.260 align:middle line:84%
So I was asked to share this
particular dream by spirit.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:13.940 align:middle line:84%
I was walking down a
pathway from the shore

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:20.400 align:middle line:84%
towards the beach, and I
was at a friend's house.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And I came across
these newly built

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:29.600 align:middle line:90%
but unfinished construction.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.620 align:middle line:84%
They were unfinished,
but inhabited.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.760 align:middle line:90%
There were tables.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:40.580 align:middle line:84%
There were chairs, clothing,
but no one was around.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:43.250 align:middle line:90%
It was empty and quiet.

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:44.630 align:middle line:90%
And I walked through.

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:48.840 align:middle line:84%
I announced my presence when I
came to the entrance, saying,

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:49.640 align:middle line:90%
hello.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.515 align:middle line:90%
Is there anyone here?

00:10:50.515 --> 00:10:52.320 align:middle line:90%
Hello?

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.610 align:middle line:90%
And no one responded.

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:57.390 align:middle line:84%
So I continued to
walk through the home.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And I walked
through the building

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.400 align:middle line:84%
and onto the rest
of the beach, and I

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:08.850 align:middle line:84%
came across these tropically
decorated cabanas.

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And these were all
people that I knew.

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:17.070 align:middle line:84%
They were old family, friends,
and it wasn't any special event

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:18.270 align:middle line:90%
or gathering.

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:20.250 align:middle line:90%
It was just everyday life.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And people were happy,
and they were all sharing.

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And it was quite this lovely
African word I like to use--

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:34.530 align:middle line:84%
[NON-ENGLISH]---- which means
festive and with people around.

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And I was saying hello,
greeting everybody.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
I saw Jason Momoa.

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:45.780 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I am a fan.

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And he arrived,
but he had wings.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.840 align:middle line:90%
And he landed flying.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.810 align:middle line:84%
He was flying, and he
landed on the beach.

00:11:54.810 --> 00:12:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him if he was
involved in the new buildings.

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:01.530 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yes, we are.

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:02.370 align:middle line:90%
We've landed.

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:04.660 align:middle line:90%
We are here now.

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, you
can't just land here.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:10.230 align:middle line:84%
You can't be here
without speaking

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.070 align:middle line:90%
to the people who live here.

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:17.940 align:middle line:84%
You have to ask or make yourself
acquainted with the people

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:19.470 align:middle line:90%
that live here.

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:23.370 align:middle line:84%
I remember seeing him
fly up the Robberg.

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:26.070 align:middle line:84%
Because the setting of the
dream was on the beach,

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:29.880 align:middle line:84%
and the Robberg, which is a very
well known landmark in our part

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.520 align:middle line:90%
of the world, is right there.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And I remember him flying
with wings, up the Robberg,

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:39.060 align:middle line:90%
and then flying down.

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:41.730 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't any
adulation on my part.

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:45.780 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to him as if
he was just another person

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.030 align:middle line:90%
coming to visit.

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And I remember vividly him
flying up on the Robberg

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:53.390 align:middle line:90%
and then flying down.

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And there were lots of kids,
and it was very beautiful.

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And I felt that I was,
somehow, in the dream,

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:06.050 align:middle line:84%
welcoming him and
trying to introduce him

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:08.510 align:middle line:84%
to the people that were
already on the beach.

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:13.970 align:middle line:84%
So I haven't had that specific
dream opened up for me

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:15.440 align:middle line:90%
or interpreted.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And I usually do have people
who interpret dreams for me.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And that particular
one stuck out

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:25.080 align:middle line:84%
because it involves a
very special place to me

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.400 align:middle line:84%
and I think most people
who live in this area.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:31.580 align:middle line:84%
It's a very special beach
and a very special landmark,

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:35.600 align:middle line:84%
so I'm very keen to have
this dream interpreted

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.800 align:middle line:90%
and opened up for me.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:46.190 align:middle line:90%


00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:51.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So we have Natalie here, and
Natalie will present me with

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.240 align:middle line:90%
a dream.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very important
dream, and we're

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:59.110 align:middle line:84%
going to go through the entire
system and decipher what

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:02.860 align:middle line:90%
the spirit world is telling her.

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:09.320 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a dream that I haven't
actually had interpreted to me.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And I'm glad I'm getting
this opportunity now.

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And also, because it
involves a little bit

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:17.650 align:middle line:84%
of our beautiful
area that we live in.

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:19.450 align:middle line:90%
And it was colorful.

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:23.710 align:middle line:84%
It was a very beautiful,
festive, colorful feeling

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:27.800 align:middle line:84%
that I had, but like I said,
it wasn't a special gathering

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:28.600 align:middle line:90%
or event.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.340 align:middle line:90%
It was just normal.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:36.430 align:middle line:90%


00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>> The semi-finished building,
did it look like brick?

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>> It was gray, like
plastered, but not painted.

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:47.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:48.270 align:middle line:90%
Oh, got it.

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:50.890 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'll be working
with this dream.

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:51.690 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:53.950 align:middle line:90%
>> And it won't take long.

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:54.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:56.580 align:middle line:90%
>> It will take you to another--

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:58.020 align:middle line:90%
to different heights.

00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:59.820 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:01.920 align:middle line:90%
With Jason Momoa.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:02.828 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:02.828 --> 00:15:06.040 align:middle line:90%


00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:11.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Coming up on the other side,
Peter unveils the messages

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.945 align:middle line:90%
hidden within Natalie's dream.

00:15:13.945 --> 00:15:23.830 align:middle line:90%


00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:28.045 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you're mentioning
there's the beach.

00:15:28.045 --> 00:15:30.760 align:middle line:90%


00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.700 align:middle line:84%
So the ocean and
Plettenberg Bay stands

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.970 align:middle line:84%
for your financial or
business activities,

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:38.800 align:middle line:90%
which are run the divine way.

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:42.220 align:middle line:84%
So the beach, there's
the ocean out there.

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.240 align:middle line:90%
You're not in the ocean.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.800 align:middle line:90%
You're not making money as such.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:49.070 align:middle line:84%
But again, you got
the cabana setup.

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:49.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:52.810 align:middle line:90%
>> So this is so much like you.

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:53.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:54.760 align:middle line:90%
Informal.

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:55.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:55.560 --> 00:16:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Very informal, that little
bit of healing it would need is

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:04.600 align:middle line:84%
surrendering and
releasing the sand,

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:08.740 align:middle line:84%
doing the same thing again
without actually going

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:10.180 align:middle line:90%
to the divine.

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:13.330 align:middle line:84%
Because doing the
next step, going

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:16.960 align:middle line:84%
within-- meeting your
higher self or your master,

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.355 align:middle line:90%
it needs divine grace.

00:16:18.355 --> 00:16:22.440 align:middle line:90%


00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:26.910 align:middle line:84%
So you are having a good
time, the way you are.

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:28.030 align:middle line:90%
It's all positive.

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:30.630 align:middle line:90%
Then Jason Momoa comes.

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:32.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Jason Momoa comes.

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:33.540 align:middle line:90%
He flies.

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:35.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly him,
out of all people.

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:38.280 align:middle line:90%


00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:43.110 align:middle line:84%
So there wasn't another name tag
on it that said it's so-and-so.

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:45.780 align:middle line:90%
It's the president or whatever?

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>> No, but I did feel that
he was a person of authority

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:55.240 align:middle line:84%
in the dream besides being me
recognizing him as that person.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:58.410 align:middle line:84%
But in the dream, I felt that
he was a person of authority.

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And I was completely
awestruck by him.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>> So here's a twist an
angelic projection of a person.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Because this person is no
other than your higher self.

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:12.690 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:15.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's the
way he showed himself.

00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:16.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:21.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So it appears you're
not guided by the soul,

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:22.960 align:middle line:90%
but higher self.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.089 align:middle line:90%
It's another higher frequency.

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:27.270 align:middle line:90%
So there's this information.

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:28.500 align:middle line:90%
And he's happy.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:32.100 align:middle line:84%
He's very joyful how things
go, how you run your life,

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:33.270 align:middle line:90%
and what you do.

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:35.520 align:middle line:90%
This is the flying.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:39.030 align:middle line:84%
So if you dream about
flying, it means

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:42.180 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have a
very joyous occasion,

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:43.630 align:middle line:90%
this sort of thing.

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:46.780 align:middle line:84%
But here's the point,
also, which needs healing.

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:47.580 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:48.380 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:53.340 align:middle line:84%
>> The next step, which would
be to give your higher self

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:57.510 align:middle line:84%
permission, to enter
you completely,

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:59.910 align:middle line:84%
and to connect with
you completely.

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Because it's like
holding your heart.

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:02.880 align:middle line:90%
Hey, what are you doing here.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm having time and
doing everything right.

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:10.560 align:middle line:84%
So the next step
would be to open up.

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:11.850 align:middle line:90%
>> And surrender.

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:14.340 align:middle line:90%
>> And surrender.

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.400 align:middle line:84%
So dreams offer the
eye of the needle

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.250 align:middle line:84%
for this particular
breakthrough for you

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:30.210 align:middle line:84%
to become a much bigger
person, releasing more clutter.

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:31.830 align:middle line:90%
This is your dream.

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:33.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:34.110 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:35.850 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:37.350 align:middle line:90%
That's very beautiful.

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:47.710 align:middle line:90%


00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:51.750 align:middle line:84%
>> So to sum it all up,
this particular session with

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:57.060 align:middle line:84%
Natalie, which, she says,
was very interesting and very

00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:58.330 align:middle line:90%
helpful.

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And just to point
out, the points

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:06.460 align:middle line:84%
of healing through dreams,
aspects of herself,

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:09.630 align:middle line:84%
still wandering
about in this world

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:15.370 align:middle line:84%
without actually connecting
to another wish she has,

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:20.250 align:middle line:84%
which is her divine,
her higher self.

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:28.030 align:middle line:84%
There is also healing for the
higher self in the form of--

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:32.110 align:middle line:84%
he's separate to his
female higher self.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And so this takes another
work, which, I'm sure,

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:40.480 align:middle line:84%
it's true, Natalie,
it can happen,

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:45.100 align:middle line:84%
where both male and female
higher self are merging.

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:56.140 align:middle line:90%


00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:00.520 align:middle line:84%
>> It was a beautiful
session, quite revealing,

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.940 align:middle line:90%
a lot of deep healing needed.

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:06.710 align:middle line:90%
I was completely blown away.

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:11.030 align:middle line:84%
But everything that I'd heard
and discovered about myself,

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:15.620 align:middle line:84%
as we do when we have our
dreams opened, but not

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:18.440 align:middle line:84%
surprised because
it's something that's

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.960 align:middle line:84%
been lingering in
the back, I think,

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.840 align:middle line:84%
something that I maybe didn't
really want to look at.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:29.800 align:middle line:90%


00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:34.300 align:middle line:84%
I would really advocate
people, if you are struggling

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:39.370 align:middle line:84%
with dreams or if something
disturbing you about a dream,

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:43.180 align:middle line:84%
find someone that can do a dream
interpretation because I really

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:45.700 align:middle line:84%
do believe that a
lot of our messages

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:48.550 align:middle line:84%
and guidance for a
lot of people who

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:52.090 align:middle line:84%
can't sit quietly and
meditate or take the time

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:56.950 align:middle line:84%
needed to discover their higher
selves or their spiritual path,

00:20:56.950 --> 00:21:00.490 align:middle line:84%
dreams are a good way to
access the other side.

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:03.200 align:middle line:90%


00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.860 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to say
thank you to Peter.

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:11.200 align:middle line:84%
He's always been an amazing
source of counseling, wisdom.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.020 align:middle line:90%


00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:15.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm grateful for
the work that he

00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:18.400 align:middle line:84%
does, because it is
about the healing,

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:23.440 align:middle line:84%
and it's about reconnecting
with self and your higher self.

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:31.720 align:middle line:90%


00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>> One could think of, OK,
what's the whole point of all

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:34.940 align:middle line:90%
this?

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:38.410 align:middle line:84%
But so the point
is growth, growing.

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:39.760 align:middle line:90%
It's the evolution.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.830 align:middle line:84%
Our evolution here
on this planet--

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:45.580 align:middle line:84%
to grow, to shed the
past through releasing,

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.850 align:middle line:84%
surrendering, adapting
to a higher frequency,

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:52.270 align:middle line:90%
and that brings freedom.

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Having connection
to the other world,

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:57.550 align:middle line:84%
understanding the soul
world, the spirit world,

00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:00.280 align:middle line:84%
and the divine world,
this is our destiny.

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:05.155 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the
healing of dreams.

00:22:05.155 --> 00:22:10.510 align:middle line:90%


00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:13.660 align:middle line:84%
>> For those like Peter,
the seemingly nebulous world

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:17.900 align:middle line:84%
of dreams is, in fact, carrying
meaning in every shape, color,

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:21.790 align:middle line:84%
and place, a portal that
lies within the collective

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:25.210 align:middle line:84%
subconscious, transmitting
information and knowledge

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:30.450 align:middle line:84%
through symbols, carrying
messages from the other side.

00:22:30.450 --> 00:23:30.000 align:middle line:90%
