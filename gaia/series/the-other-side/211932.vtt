00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>> The holistic world of healing
includes plants and herbs

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.830 align:middle line:84%
channeling energy as well as
both spiritual and physical

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.510 align:middle line:90%
modalities.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Healers are
multi-dimensional beings

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.970 align:middle line:84%
who dance between the realms
of the seen and unseen.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.220 align:middle line:84%
These individuals
have the ability

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.269 align:middle line:84%
to facilitate a shift in
people, offering them insight

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.880 align:middle line:84%
and support, reconnecting people
with themselves and the greater

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.150 align:middle line:84%
collective, healing the world
one person at a time healing

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.425 align:middle line:90%
from the other side.

00:01:18.425 --> 00:01:22.570 align:middle line:90%


00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I am the last member
left of our family.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.620 align:middle line:90%
And I am the baby.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.215 align:middle line:84%
I have lost my mother,
my father, and my sister,

00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:31.015 align:middle line:90%
and my brother.

00:01:31.015 --> 00:01:34.690 align:middle line:90%


00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.270 align:middle line:84%
So being the last
one is not fun.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.140 align:middle line:84%
You can't pick up a
phone to say please help.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.545 align:middle line:84%
So that's where Elmarie steps
in to help a lot of my issues.

00:01:44.545 --> 00:01:49.360 align:middle line:90%


00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Everybody brings a
different issue to the table.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.080 align:middle line:84%
There is a big, big
difference individually

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.545 align:middle line:84%
of how people experience
and feel things.

00:01:59.545 --> 00:02:25.520 align:middle line:90%


00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm here to help
people become more

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.450 align:middle line:84%
aware of what is
happening in their lives,

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.845 align:middle line:90%
to become more present.

00:02:33.845 --> 00:02:37.180 align:middle line:90%


00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm a transpersonal
healer and a life coach.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.210 align:middle line:84%
When I see clients or
speak to people online,

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.640 align:middle line:90%
I connect energetically.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
is very important.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.210 align:middle line:84%
I do apply a
combination of therapies

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.250 align:middle line:84%
to assist the issue that
they bring to the table.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.430 align:middle line:84%
If you want to change
anything in your life today,

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.090 align:middle line:84%
a combination of
hypnotherapy and access bars

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.300 align:middle line:84%
or either of the
two works perfectly.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.500 align:middle line:84%
So what I do is I will start
with an energetic assessment

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.140 align:middle line:84%
after the intake of
the client and then

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.480 align:middle line:84%
talk about how the
energy in the body

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.970 align:middle line:84%
is affecting their
lives today, what

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.830 align:middle line:84%
they need, where they lack,
where they have too much of.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.090 align:middle line:84%
It is a holistic
approach that I do.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.600 align:middle line:84%
Regarding the
hypnotherapy, people

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.760 align:middle line:84%
have this idea that
hypnosis is bad or scary.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.720 align:middle line:84%
the only thing it is is talking
to the subconscious which never

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.540 align:middle line:90%
grows old, never leaves you.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.570 align:middle line:90%
It's part of the higher self.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.310 align:middle line:84%
When we talk to the
you, the real you,

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.930 align:middle line:84%
it actually influences and
changes things in your life

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.030 align:middle line:84%
because the mind is a
very, very powerful thing.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And mostly people suffer
today because they

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.730 align:middle line:84%
are victim to the mind that
is actually just trying

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.450 align:middle line:84%
to protect them with whatever
it has been programmed

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.730 align:middle line:90%
with in their lifetime.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.310 align:middle line:84%
If there is anything
in your life

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.810 align:middle line:84%
that you would like to change,
hypnosis is an awesome modality

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.700 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.360 align:middle line:84%
>> In addition to hypnotherapy,
Elmarie is an access

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.540 align:middle line:90%
consciousness practitioner.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.740 align:middle line:84%
Access consciousness is a set of
transformational, life-changing

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.780 align:middle line:84%
tools and processes one of
which is access bars, a healing

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.990 align:middle line:84%
technique that acts
as a release and a way

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.020 align:middle line:84%
to let go making space
for joy and calm.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Access bars is 32
points on your head.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And when lightly
touched, it forms

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.990 align:middle line:90%
a bar between the fingers.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And it resets and defrags
everything that you don't need

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.640 align:middle line:84%
and that doesn't
serve you anymore.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.870 align:middle line:84%
The combination that I do
as a metaphysical healer

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.790 align:middle line:90%
includes everything.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.280 align:middle line:84%
I try to keep it
light, and I try

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.120 align:middle line:84%
to have fun while
healing at the same time.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:25.030 align:middle line:84%
Today, I will be treating Mandy,
seeing her as a follow up.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.400 align:middle line:84%
We've known each other
for quite some time,

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:33.610 align:middle line:84%
and she also has experienced
most of what I do.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:39.910 align:middle line:84%
Today, we will focus on a little
access bars, a short taster

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:45.670 align:middle line:84%
of access bars just to
calm her down and also do

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:51.430 align:middle line:84%
parts therapy, which
will be a final closure

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.970 align:middle line:84%
for her regarding trauma
that she experienced before

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:56.770 align:middle line:90%
in her life.

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.640 align:middle line:84%
So we will symbolically
work with that trauma

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.770 align:middle line:90%
in a hypnosis session.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I have met
Elmarie about seven,

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.680 align:middle line:84%
eight years ago that I was
introduced by a friend to help

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.890 align:middle line:84%
me with issues with anxiety
and with the death of my family

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.740 align:middle line:90%
members to try and cope with it.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And she has been
absolutely phenomenal.

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:26.380 align:middle line:84%
She has really,
really helped me.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.930 align:middle line:84%
I am in sales being for the
last 25 years of my life.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.740 align:middle line:84%
It is quite stressful and
a lot of time consuming

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.090 align:middle line:84%
and let's say, energy
demanding as well because I'm

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.950 align:middle line:90%
like a little sponge.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:45.430 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, I am
a migraine sufferer.

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And going to Elmarie really
has actually helped with that.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:51.860 align:middle line:90%
I have seen the results myself.

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to use so
much medication anymore.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And she's also
showed me that I am

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.590 align:middle line:84%
more than what I
think I am because I'm

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.960 align:middle line:90%
the biggest critic of myself.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And she is phenomenal
by actually showing me,

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.550 align:middle line:84%
you know what, you have a
huge purpose in this universe.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:14.210 align:middle line:84%
What I'm expecting from
her today with the hypnosis

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.790 align:middle line:84%
is to get rid of a lot
of trauma that I've

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.390 align:middle line:84%
been through as a
child into adulthood.

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.850 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, I had
an alcoholic father

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:25.520 align:middle line:90%
that has done a lot of damage.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.560 align:middle line:90%
I basically grew up as a loner.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And there were other
things that also

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:36.080 align:middle line:84%
has happened to me that is
quite horrific that Elmarie

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.210 align:middle line:90%
has already assisted me with.

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.550 align:middle line:84%
But there still little
bits of gaps and pieces

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:41.990 align:middle line:90%
that we need to put together.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:45.410 align:middle line:84%
It's like a puzzle to
actually make me move forward

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:50.750 align:middle line:84%
from these traumas and make it
better for me to go forward.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>> And how did you manage
your trauma and your approach

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.400 align:middle line:84%
to things after
our last session?

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Much better.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm coping with it better.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:04.310 align:middle line:84%
There are still days
that I do get down,

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:05.960 align:middle line:90%
and it does affect me.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:10.880 align:middle line:84%
But I have the way that you have
taught me how to overcome it.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:11.870 align:middle line:90%
>> With your breath?

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:16.130 align:middle line:84%
>> With my breathing
and letting it go.

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:18.480 align:middle line:90%
And it has helped a lot.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.280 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.040 align:middle line:90%
Just breathe in for me.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.300 align:middle line:90%
Where do you feel your breath?

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.100 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:29.720 align:middle line:84%
You have to practice
breathing below--

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.620 align:middle line:90%
>> The diaphragm.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:31.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.289 align:middle line:90%
And that will help with your--

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:38.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Anxiety, stress, all
of that going around me.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.669 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know whether it
will help with your OCD,

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:41.914 align:middle line:90%
but it will definitely.

00:08:41.914 --> 00:08:43.229 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:08:43.229 --> 00:08:45.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I think she's
also calling me OCD.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Because your
OCD makes you tick.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:47.980 align:middle line:90%
That's who you are.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:48.780 align:middle line:90%
>> That's who I am.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.140 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's the wonderful
person that you are showing

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:51.980 align:middle line:90%
to the world.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:52.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>> The scar on your head, has
that been playing up again?

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:59.010 align:middle line:84%
>> No, it hasn't, not
since our last session.

00:08:59.010 --> 00:08:59.810 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And then the migraines
where it starts at the back.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:05.330 align:middle line:90%
>> It's actually--

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.095 align:middle line:90%
>> Where does it start now?

00:09:07.095 --> 00:09:07.895 align:middle line:90%
Did it stop?

00:09:07.895 --> 00:09:12.230 align:middle line:84%
>> It's still in the same area,
but I can get rid of it much

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:13.680 align:middle line:90%
easier now than before.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.930 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you do?

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I take--

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.680 align:middle line:90%
I have migraine medication.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And some days, I would actually
have migraines for four days

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.050 align:middle line:90%
constant with meds or no meds.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And now it's just once off, 10
minutes later migraine is gone.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.665 align:middle line:84%
So obviously something
has shifted and changed

00:09:31.665 --> 00:09:32.465 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:09:32.465 --> 00:09:34.190 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the belief in self.

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:37.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And belief in self
that it can be controlled.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:40.020 align:middle line:84%
>> And you are
grounding yourself.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:40.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I am.

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:41.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm walking barefoot--

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:43.180 align:middle line:90%
>> You're doing your homework.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.980 align:middle line:84%
>> --I'm walking barefoot
outside so that I ground with

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.050 align:middle line:90%
the energy of Mother Earth.

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:48.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Fantastic.

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:51.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I do that regularly.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.130 align:middle line:90%
>> What are we doing today?

00:09:55.130 --> 00:10:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm a bit concerned
about my career moving forward

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:01.790 align:middle line:90%
and where it's going.

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:04.580 align:middle line:10%
Am I in the right job?

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.590 align:middle line:90%
Am I doing the right thing?

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:08.720 align:middle line:84%
Or is there something
else out there

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.940 align:middle line:90%
that I should concentrate on?

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:14.270 align:middle line:10%
Because I have a feeling I can
offer the world more than what

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:15.890 align:middle line:10%
I'm doing now at the moment.

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.080 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:24.140 align:middle line:10%
Regarding your career,
for now, it's a good thing

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:27.920 align:middle line:10%
to not make any sudden changes.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Sudden changes.

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:36.080 align:middle line:10%
>> I do feel that you need to
just go through the motions

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.760 align:middle line:10%
and relax, use your breathing,
do the homework that I gave you

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.290 align:middle line:10%
to do.

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:45.140 align:middle line:10%
It is a lesson in your
life and a process

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.060 align:middle line:10%
that you have to
follow and as well,

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:50.640 align:middle line:10%
the contract that keeps
you where you are.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.110 align:middle line:84%
That's the message
I get for you.

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:54.420 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:11:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Today, I think, to resolve
the last trickles of trauma,

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:09.000 align:middle line:84%
a lifetime of that, we
will work symbolically.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.110 align:middle line:90%
And that is how healing happens.

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:15.510 align:middle line:84%
You are not going
to trigger your mind

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:18.210 align:middle line:90%
to remember old stuff.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:22.440 align:middle line:84%
We can just transmute and
transform it energetically.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.050 align:middle line:10%
And you are at the
stage now where

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:28.140 align:middle line:10%
it will happen anyway
because you are amazing,

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:29.940 align:middle line:10%
and you can heal yourself.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:36.150 align:middle line:10%
And I can walk away here knowing
that you can heal yourself

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:38.430 align:middle line:10%
and that you know
that you are strong

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:40.920 align:middle line:10%
and that you
believe in yourself.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.490 align:middle line:10%
And that you can open your
arms, open your chakras--

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:46.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Chakras.

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:49.020 align:middle line:10%
>> --and receive, receive.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:52.050 align:middle line:84%
The only person you
can change is you.

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And in doing that, it
ripples out energetically

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:59.730 align:middle line:84%
and everything around
you starts changing.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:00.720 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:05.040 align:middle line:10%
So let's get rid of all the
trauma, all the guilt, all

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.500 align:middle line:10%
the fear, all the tears.

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.280 align:middle line:84%
It can still come and
visit for a little while,

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:14.350 align:middle line:90%
but it won't overwhelm you.

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:15.150 align:middle line:90%
>> It's happy.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:15.990 align:middle line:90%
It's happy tears.

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:17.730 align:middle line:90%
>> It won't be overwhelming.

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:18.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:23.310 align:middle line:84%
>> So you need to
allow yourself to be.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And you need to
allow others to be.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:32.010 align:middle line:84%
I suggest we do parts
therapy or hypnosis.

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And just to settle that
repetitive figure-eight

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.070 align:middle line:84%
of stuff that you
don't need anymore,

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:44.820 align:middle line:84%
we're going to reset and defrag
a little bit of that with

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.760 align:middle line:84%
a very short access
bar session opening up

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.990 align:middle line:90%
for your subconscious to--

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:50.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Fixing the chakra.

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:51.210 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:53.755 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:53.755 --> 00:12:54.630 align:middle line:90%


00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:58.500 align:middle line:84%
We're not fixing anything
we're just allowing,

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.840 align:middle line:90%
allowing the process.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:06.150 align:middle line:84%
So what we will do is we
will start in a safe space

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:12.600 align:middle line:84%
like before and go with
the flow, see what pops up,

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.630 align:middle line:84%
and work with it
as it comes along.

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And you are welcome to
voice, to speak, to stop

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.160 align:middle line:90%
the session at any time.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:29.940 align:middle line:84%
You are also probably
going to feel like crying,

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.010 align:middle line:90%
like talking, like laughing.

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:35.160 align:middle line:84%
Whatever comes up
for you is fine.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.210 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:37.590 align:middle line:90%
Please don't hold back.

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:39.210 align:middle line:90%
You are in a safe space.

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:42.060 align:middle line:10%
OK, darling, so shall we start?

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.020 align:middle line:90%
>> We can start.

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:43.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:43.560 align:middle line:90%
Come.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.580 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:48.120 align:middle line:84%
What I would like to do is
just do an energetic assessment

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.340 align:middle line:84%
to see where we
are at the moment.

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'll start your
base chakra and go up.

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:58.820 align:middle line:90%


00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:01.950 align:middle line:90%
That looks good.

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And then crown and tie
yourself, et cetera.

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:06.660 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:10.830 align:middle line:90%
Open better than before.

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:14.670 align:middle line:90%
You know the story.

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:17.010 align:middle line:84%
You can stop the
session at any time.

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:19.980 align:middle line:90%


00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:23.110 align:middle line:90%
You are in a safe space.

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And just in your
mind, repeat after me.

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:36.830 align:middle line:84%
I am living my abundance, and I
only absorb clean, pure energy.

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And everything that doesn't
allow that, we now destroy.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Toxic parts in you, what
were bad or hurtful,

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:50.650 align:middle line:90%
are now just poison pills.

00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:55.720 align:middle line:84%
Subconscious, I want you to
make Mandy feel in her body

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:59.560 align:middle line:84%
where you hold the
pain and trauma since.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:06.410 align:middle line:84%
You can take your hand and
show me where in your body

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:10.190 align:middle line:84%
the dark place
lies that you need

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:14.525 align:middle line:90%
to take out and get rid of.

00:15:14.525 --> 00:15:15.685 align:middle line:90%
And the other one.

00:15:15.685 --> 00:15:20.370 align:middle line:90%


00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Now take that hand
and absorb and make

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.270 align:middle line:84%
that darkness flow
out of your body

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:37.540 align:middle line:84%
and into the bowl on your hand
and feel it stuck there moving.

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Just allow the healing
light flowing down

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:50.880 align:middle line:84%
through your crown, through
your chest, and your right hand,

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:57.090 align:middle line:84%
and make a big bowl of
healing golden light.

00:15:57.090 --> 00:16:02.040 align:middle line:84%
So now you have darkness on
the left palm and healing

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.200 align:middle line:90%
light on your right palm.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And light always
disperses darkness.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:12.330 align:middle line:84%
When you have only golden
light in your hands,

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:17.301 align:middle line:90%
from all that dark murky is one.

00:16:17.301 --> 00:16:22.170 align:middle line:84%
With only golden healing
light, take that light

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:27.120 align:middle line:84%
and place it into the space
where you took the dark into.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Breathe it in and
allow it to heal.

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And when you are
really good, next.

now is permanent

receive positive
prosperity, positive energy.

up a lot of emotions.

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:04.110 align:middle line:84%
where the problem areas were,
it was actually like a burning

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:07.690 align:middle line:90%
sensation, aching sensation.

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I brought
the golden light to it

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:15.340 align:middle line:84%
and took the darkness away
from it, it all dissipated.

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:16.510 align:middle line:90%
It feels amazing.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:18.040 align:middle line:90%
I really do feel amazing.

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:21.840 align:middle line:84%
I feel more positive,
more energized,

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:26.010 align:middle line:84%
and I know I will achieve what
I want to achieve in life now.

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:27.630 align:middle line:90%
I know what my path is about.

>> So in recap of the
session with Mandy,

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:42.650 align:middle line:84%
she released a lot of debris
that she didn't need anymore.

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:47.840 align:middle line:84%
The emotional
release was amazing.

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.900 align:middle line:90%
And I do connect with my client.

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And that is why I also
either yawn or cry

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:58.490 align:middle line:90%
or release for them.

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:01.910 align:middle line:84%
It was as if with
this specific session,

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:05.000 align:middle line:84%
I had to open the
door for her first

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.790 align:middle line:84%
because she was so
stuck in her head.

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:09.980 align:middle line:90%
That was holding her back.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.860 align:middle line:84%
When I work, I just
become a channel

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:15.020 align:middle line:84%
for whatever needs
to come through

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:18.560 align:middle line:84%
for that specific
time and person.

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:22.190 align:middle line:84%
With Mandy, we had
an audience today.

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:23.990 align:middle line:90%
Mandy's mommy came through.

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:26.210 align:middle line:90%
And Mandy could smell her.

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:32.580 align:middle line:10%
And she also had this amazing
presence of being nurtured,

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.290 align:middle line:10%
and that it's OK.

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:36.540 align:middle line:90%
It's OK to cry.

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:39.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I should mention
this, but Mandy doesn't cry.

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And today she cried,
which was amazing.

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>> To the people out
there watching this--

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.910 align:middle line:84%
I know there are a
lot of skepticals,

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:50.310 align:middle line:90%
they don't believe in this--

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:53.580 align:middle line:90%
but I am the walking evidence.

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:57.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm the walking
advertising board for her.

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:59.340 align:middle line:84%
As a lot of people
feel, I would say

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:02.040 align:middle line:84%
95% of the people
walking on this earth,

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:06.750 align:middle line:84%
you always wonder what is
my purpose of being here.

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:09.930 align:middle line:84%
People like Elmarie,
she is your guide.

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:12.750 align:middle line:84%
She can actually
assist you in helping

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:19.290 align:middle line:84%
you to find where you belong and
where your help and your talent

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:21.330 align:middle line:90%
is needed one day.

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:26.820 align:middle line:84%
She has helped me a lot in that
direction, especially today.

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:30.090 align:middle line:84%
>> It is very important for
people to know that there is

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:31.320 align:middle line:90%
help out there.

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:34.950 align:middle line:84%
Everything is
changing in the world.

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:39.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's as if there is
a new world being born.

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:41.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Our planet is alive.

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:44.520 align:middle line:84%
Energy coursing
through it, pulsing

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:57.080 align:middle line:84%
powerful transformational magic
all around us and within us.
