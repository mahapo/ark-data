is that my ancestors

If one comes through, a whole
lot of them they come through.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.320 align:middle line:84%
So I needed my sister to
come and calm them down a bit

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.640 align:middle line:84%
and tell them that not to come
all at once because then I'd

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.240 align:middle line:90%
I went into a trance.

for the whole year in 2003.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.040 align:middle line:84%
I did not understand that
because before then, I

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.300 align:middle line:84%
had never been exposed to
healers at all because I come

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.750 align:middle line:84%
from a Christian background,
although we're not staunch

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.870 align:middle line:84%
because we still would do
an annual ancestral ceremony

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.040 align:middle line:84%
at home, which I only
later discovered that it

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.510 align:middle line:84%
was my father's way of asking
ancestors to give me more time.

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.290 align:middle line:84%
So it was when he stopped doing
the annual ceremonies that they

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.700 align:middle line:90%
came through actually.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.770 align:middle line:84%
I come from a
lineage of healers.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.460 align:middle line:84%
But in my family,
it's bigenerational.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.880 align:middle line:84%
Normally from on my maternal
side, it skips a generation.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And then on my
father's side, it's

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.980 align:middle line:84%
a mess because a
whole lot of them

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.665 align:middle line:84%
ran away from the calling,
a whole lot of them

00:05:09.665 --> 00:05:11.520 align:middle line:84%
Escaped with my
great grandfather,

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.300 align:middle line:84%
who is one of my
main ancestors who

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.890 align:middle line:90%
is bringing forward my gifts.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And my other aunt, my
father's sister opted to die.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.580 align:middle line:84%
Her thinking was that
their father ran away

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.740 align:middle line:84%
from their calling, leaving
them with these things,

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.510 align:middle line:90%
and he's not interested.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.160 align:middle line:84%
So in the beginning
of my journey,

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.290 align:middle line:84%
it was very difficult
because I think they also

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.980 align:middle line:84%
recognized that the
reason that I was sick

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.325 align:middle line:84%
and my calling was
as intense as it was

00:05:37.325 --> 00:05:39.650 align:middle line:84%
was because they ran
away from their gifts.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.900 align:middle line:84%
My family did not
understand because it

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.440 align:middle line:90%
had skipped many generations.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.770 align:middle line:90%
So they did not understand--

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.290 align:middle line:84%
they did not understand
me going into a trance

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.840 align:middle line:84%
because I would speak in
a male voice, I would cry,

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.100 align:middle line:90%
and I would scream.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.450 align:middle line:84%
It has been a journey which has
taken me to different places,

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.370 align:middle line:84%
because I've been
exposed to healers

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.590 align:middle line:84%
who are traditional healers
who have gone through--

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.520 align:middle line:84%
who have gone through
initiations, who

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.770 align:middle line:90%
have been initiated by people.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.810 align:middle line:84%
I've also been
exposed to healers

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.050 align:middle line:84%
who had stayed up in the
mountains for years being

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.070 align:middle line:90%
initiated by their ancestors.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.750 align:middle line:84%
So a better part of my
journey has been solely

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.650 align:middle line:84%
guided by ancestors
because I was never

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.140 align:middle line:84%
one who was supposed to
go to initiation school

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.730 align:middle line:90%
to be initiated by anyone.

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.550 align:middle line:84%
So the moment I
finished my initiations,

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.670 align:middle line:84%
my ancestors undertook
for me to complete.

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still not
even done half of--

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.470 align:middle line:90%

>> Tabitha came in for a reading
beginning of the year 2000.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And it was a lot actually
what she was going through.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.940 align:middle line:84%
The moment I saw
her, I said to her,

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.800 align:middle line:84%
"Girl, something
is wrong with you."

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And she would get
burns around her skin.

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.110 align:middle line:84%
She was being
spiritually attacked.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:01.970 align:middle line:84%
But as well, it
was because she had

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:04.200 align:middle line:84%
gone through an initiation
that didn't go well.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:08.810 align:middle line:84%
So that we needed to put
her ancestors properly.

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:13.110 align:middle line:84%
We needed to heal them because
her calling had been messed up.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:16.100 align:middle line:84%
So as a result, it opened her
up to a lot of spiritual attacks

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.080 align:middle line:90%
because she was not grounded.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.920 align:middle line:84%
It was very humbling to
heal her because I had never

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.200 align:middle line:84%
healed someone who
was going through what

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.520 align:middle line:90%
she was going through.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the
first day that we

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.550 align:middle line:84%
went to do her cleansing,
we got into a car accident.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And the chicken that
was supposed to help

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:35.970 align:middle line:90%
to cleanse her with ran away.

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:38.120 align:middle line:90%
So it was a bit of a journey.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:42.270 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, she's
OK, although she's still

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:45.420 align:middle line:84%
going through a bit of
issues, but she's much better.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.890 align:middle line:90%
She has healed.

I had not seen
Tabitha in a while.

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:51.030 align:middle line:84%
She had been
avoiding me actually.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:53.670 align:middle line:84%
She had been avoiding me
because she resigned from work

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:55.320 align:middle line:90%
after I told her not to.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.840 align:middle line:84%
So when I needed to take a
client to the river and client

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.530 align:middle line:84%
that didn't have a
car and asked Tabitha

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:05.740 align:middle line:84%
to come to help me with that, to
help me drive her to the river.

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:08.820 align:middle line:84%
So this is only when she managed
to come through and tell me

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.950 align:middle line:84%
what has been
happening in her life.

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:15.810 align:middle line:84%
So what we will be doing today
is we will be actually trying

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:18.810 align:middle line:84%
to figure out how to help her,
because she has been struggling

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:23.100 align:middle line:84%
to find a job for a while, to
see where the blockages are,

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.100 align:middle line:84%
and what do we need
to do to move forward?

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.940 align:middle line:84%
But already, she has been
told that she needs to go back

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.340 align:middle line:84%
to Manguzi, which
is [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:37.920 align:middle line:84%
This is where I took
her in 2019 for prayers.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.110 align:middle line:84%
So just before she
lost her job, she

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:42.750 align:middle line:84%
was told that we needed to go
back to Manguzi for prayers

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.670 align:middle line:90%
and rituals and ceremonies.

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.650 align:middle line:84%
So we are going to
have to figure out

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:51.540 align:middle line:84%
a way to have our ancestors
show some mercy on her

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.895 align:middle line:84%
so that she gets a job
because it's Manguzi

00:09:53.895 --> 00:09:55.590 align:middle line:90%
is about eight hours away.

00:09:55.590 --> 00:10:00.810 align:middle line:84%
It's on the border of
Northern KZN and Mozambique.

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Often, sangomas believe
that physical ailments are

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:07.620 align:middle line:84%
a manifestation of a
spiritual upset or neglect

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:08.860 align:middle line:90%
of the ancestors.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:11.650 align:middle line:84%
So that is what they
would address first.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:14.620 align:middle line:84%
After that, once the
ancestors have been heard,

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:17.290 align:middle line:84%
the sangoma is guided
by the ancestors

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:21.550 align:middle line:84%
on what the physical illness
is and how to treat it.

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:25.240 align:middle line:84%
The sangoma will also ask the
candidate a lot of questions

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.880 align:middle line:84%
so they can find out
if the illness is also

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:32.410 align:middle line:84%
related to social or
environmental factors.

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:35.680 align:middle line:84%
>> So I was following her
on Facebook for some time.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:39.970 align:middle line:84%
I finally got to know
her in person in 2019

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:44.110 align:middle line:84%
when she advertised her
business on Facebook.

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:46.840 align:middle line:10%
When we met, she told
me-- she asked me

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.510 align:middle line:10%
what was wrong with
my skin because I

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:52.840 align:middle line:10%
had these red blotches all
over my skin, especially

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:56.650 align:middle line:10%
my face and the arms in
all the sun exposed areas.

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And then I told her
that it's the side

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:02.140 align:middle line:84%
effects of the medication
that I was taking.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:05.260 align:middle line:84%
And then she told me that
no, she doesn't think so.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.270 align:middle line:10%
But it's up to me.

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:10.000 align:middle line:10%
What do I think about it?

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.070 align:middle line:10%
And then we did
our first reading,

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:18.172 align:middle line:10%
and then she actually
confirmed that

00:11:18.172 --> 00:11:19.130 align:middle line:10%
it was actually a curse

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:21.740 align:middle line:10%
We went through my
reading, and what

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.470 align:middle line:10%
actually made me
come to her it was

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:27.368 align:middle line:10%
after a series of misfortunes.

00:11:27.368 --> 00:11:28.910 align:middle line:10%
I'm not sure whether
it's misfortunes

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.185 align:middle line:10%
of the things that were not--

00:11:30.185 --> 00:11:32.552 align:middle line:90%


00:11:32.552 --> 00:11:34.010 align:middle line:10%
Things that weren't
understandable.

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:35.670 align:middle line:10%
And then we took it from there.

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:39.020 align:middle line:10%
And then I also had
this thing, this itch

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:40.760 align:middle line:10%
from underneath my skin.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.610 align:middle line:10%
It felt like I was burning
underneath my skin.

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:45.782 align:middle line:10%
And then I would scratch it.

00:11:45.782 --> 00:11:47.240 align:middle line:10%
And then when I
scratch it, I would

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:51.320 align:middle line:10%
get some blister-like things
on my skin all over my body.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.630 align:middle line:10%
And then they would
quickly turn into dirt.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.640 align:middle line:10%
That was the beginning
of our journey.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:12:01.040 align:middle line:10%
It took us the whole of
2019 to do all of that.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.830 align:middle line:10%
There was just a lot
that was happening

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:06.390 align:middle line:10%
trying to treat everything.

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:10.820 align:middle line:84%
So today, I'm going to
have a session with Ms. K.

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:14.150 align:middle line:10%
To find out properly
what is happening.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.910 align:middle line:10%
And because there's
actually been

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:19.240 align:middle line:10%
things that aren't working.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.712 align:middle line:90%

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Indigenous and traditional
medicine often involves herbal

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:43.170 align:middle line:90%
concoctions and infusions.

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:47.280 align:middle line:84%
Although sangomas heal on a
psychological and interpersonal

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.000 align:middle line:84%
level, they also use the
guidance of the ancestor

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.660 align:middle line:90%
spirits to prescribe muti.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:59.370 align:middle line:84%
This muti is a combination of
herbs or natural substances

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:02.430 align:middle line:84%
that are prepared
in a specific way.

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:06.430 align:middle line:84%
The brew is then
taken as prescribed.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:10.410 align:middle line:84%
There are muti markets around
South Africa where sangomas

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:13.650 align:middle line:90%
can go to stock up on supplies.

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:17.100 align:middle line:10%
Coming up next, Keketso
channels the ancestors

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.280 align:middle line:10%
and provides our candidate
with some insights

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.190 align:middle line:10%
through the divination
of bone throwing.

00:14:32.521 --> 00:14:35.185 align:middle line:84%
>> The song they are
singing speaks of

00:14:35.185 --> 00:14:37.183 align:middle line:90%
how being ill is so painful.

00:14:37.183 --> 00:14:40.409 align:middle line:84%
That is the only part of
the song I understand.

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:51.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Often during a divination, a
sangoma may burn an herb called

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.380 align:middle line:84%
impepho to assist in
communicating with

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:55.940 align:middle line:90%
the ancestor's spirits.

found objects.

Each bone has a
meaning and represents

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.300 align:middle line:90%
part of the candidate's life.

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:12.215 align:middle line:84%

what to say, through the bones.

That every single thing, every

to unblock things,
it does not help.

00:15:51.015 --> 00:15:53.390 align:middle line:84%
Your people are saying that
we are trying to communicate,

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:55.490 align:middle line:84%
we are trying to show
her a lot of things

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:57.380 align:middle line:84%
that she needs to do
in order to fix what's

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:59.390 align:middle line:84%
happening in her
life, but it feels

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:02.600 align:middle line:90%
like she does not hear us.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.350 align:middle line:84%
It feels like what has been
done it's like a separation when

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:07.220 align:middle line:90%
somebody has--

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.053 align:middle line:84%
when you have been
separated from your luck,

00:16:09.053 --> 00:16:11.060 align:middle line:84%
that you're no longer
accessing your luck.

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:14.240 align:middle line:84%
But you can see that there
is a lot of light there,

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.740 align:middle line:90%
but you are not reaching it.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:17.100 align:middle line:90%
You're not accessing it.

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:17.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:22.540 align:middle line:84%

it has opened you up a lot

the amount of battles that you
were fighting and the amount

of battles that we have
fought to get you here.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:41.760 align:middle line:10%
It feels like you have
survived, but you've

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:45.150 align:middle line:10%
survived to suffer
and to struggle

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:47.970 align:middle line:10%
not necessarily to thrive.

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:54.794 align:middle line:90%
But all will be right [CHANTING]

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:06.869 align:middle line:10%
The bones say you need to
go where two roads meet,

00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:09.790 align:middle line:10%
so you need to find
a place like that

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:12.361 align:middle line:10%
so that you get there and
and do all your prayers

00:17:12.361 --> 00:17:13.319 align:middle line:10%
and your rituals there.

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:16.470 align:middle line:10%
Even if it's not a
road per se, but it

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:18.569 align:middle line:10%
has to be-- as long
as people walk there

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:20.970 align:middle line:10%
and there roads meet.

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:23.730 align:middle line:84%
You always find
places like that, yes.

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:27.210 align:middle line:84%
So you should speak to
them to open up your path.

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:28.470 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:30.240 align:middle line:90%
>> So we threw some bones.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.070 align:middle line:84%
We had a bone
reading with Tabitha,

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:34.140 align:middle line:84%
which is quite new for
her because I normally

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.250 align:middle line:90%
use my intuition.

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And she believes that
the bones limit me.

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:44.160 align:middle line:84%
So when she first came in, as
I was doing the incantations

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.680 align:middle line:84%
inviting the ancestors
to come through

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.640 align:middle line:84%
and asking my ancestors to
bring forward her ancestors so

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.150 align:middle line:84%
that we can have a conversation
so I can see that and get

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:57.270 align:middle line:84%
messages and get clear messages
and communications from them,

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:58.980 align:middle line:90%
she went into a trance.

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And she said that she could hear
them singing one of the songs,

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:09.450 align:middle line:84%
one of the healing songs that
says [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] which

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:13.020 align:middle line:84%
means that most of her
issues are around her calling

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:16.650 align:middle line:84%
because when one has a calling,
it manifests differently.

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Other people get
really physically ill.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.210 align:middle line:90%
Other people go into trances.

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Other people have problems and
ending issues in their lives.

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.830 align:middle line:84%
So her ancestors
were coming through

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:33.480 align:middle line:84%
to say that much as there are
other issues that she still

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.420 align:middle line:90%
needs to attend to her calling.

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And there are a
lot of ceremonies

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.350 align:middle line:84%
that she needs to perform
at home to bring them

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:43.470 align:middle line:84%
forward so that they give her
clarity in terms of what needs

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:46.350 align:middle line:84%
to happen along her journey
because she has a calling,

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:48.240 align:middle line:84%
and she's gone
through initiations.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.460 align:middle line:84%
So she went into
a trance, and she

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:53.400 align:middle line:84%
could hear them singing in
the background, which was also

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.700 align:middle line:84%
positive because it also shows
that her ancestors are also

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.250 align:middle line:90%
very comfortable in my space.

00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:00.000 align:middle line:84%
They're comfortable
enough to come through

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.670 align:middle line:84%
and to also communicate
and send messages.

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:05.010 align:middle line:84%
It was beneficial
because then she

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:09.270 align:middle line:84%
knew something was
not right but did not

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:12.430 align:middle line:84%
know how to go about
sorting out the issues.

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:15.480 align:middle line:84%
So we figured out
the gaps that need

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.100 align:middle line:84%
to be filled in order
for her to move forward

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:19.560 align:middle line:90%
to find another job.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of traveling
and spiritual journeys,

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:25.860 align:middle line:84%
to remove a few obstacles
along her way though,

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.260 align:middle line:84%
she said that she
gets a bit of clarity.

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:31.110 align:middle line:84%
So basically what
we just did today

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:33.360 align:middle line:84%
was just to see
where everything is

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:37.170 align:middle line:84%
and what work needs to
be done in order to help

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:39.420 align:middle line:90%
her sort out her issues.

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:42.960 align:middle line:84%
>> We did a bones
reading with Miss K.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.990 align:middle line:84%
I actually prefer her doing
the other side than the bones

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:49.560 align:middle line:84%
because I feel like the
bones they just limit her.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.100 align:middle line:10%
However I got what
I wanted to hear.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.764 align:middle line:10%
She gave me herbs
or medicine to use,

00:19:54.764 --> 00:20:08.087 align:middle line:10%
to help where I am right now.

00:20:08.087 --> 00:20:09.670 align:middle line:10%
So that things can
get back to normal.

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:11.545 align:middle line:10%
So that I will be able
to get work and remove

00:20:11.545 --> 00:20:17.610 align:middle line:10%
all the bad energies
that hinder my progress.

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:20.025 align:middle line:10%
I've seen that in
reality, being spiritual

00:20:20.025 --> 00:20:28.040 align:middle line:10%
can stall your
progress in life, when

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.400 align:middle line:10%
you don't take it seriously.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.397 align:middle line:10%
You have to open your
heart when you practice,

00:20:33.397 --> 00:20:37.402 align:middle line:10%
do it wholeheartedly so
that that they see you

00:20:37.402 --> 00:20:44.380 align:middle line:10%
have given in to your calling.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:47.560 align:middle line:10%
I did get a lot of
help and healing.

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:51.340 align:middle line:10%
And now I know what
to do going forward.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:54.195 align:middle line:10%
The steps that she
has told me to take.

00:20:54.195 --> 00:20:56.320 align:middle line:10%
I need to go to to the
forest and doing my rituals,

00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:00.220 align:middle line:10%
and do all those things so
that I'm aligned and balanced

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.180 align:middle line:10%
with my people.

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:06.130 align:middle line:10%
Also she said, if you don't
practice you leave open up

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:08.800 align:middle line:10%
yourself to other things,
mostly negative things

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:09.700 align:middle line:10%
such as bad energies.

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:13.340 align:middle line:10%
And it's not necessarily
they're picking on you.

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:16.300 align:middle line:10%
It's just that the space that
you are in at that particular

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.152 align:middle line:10%
moment they cannot see you.

00:21:18.152 --> 00:21:21.260 align:middle line:10%
Your ancestors can't see you or
access you due to interference.

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:24.920 align:middle line:10%
They cannot access you because
of the energies and everything

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:29.370 align:middle line:10%
the shadows or bad
energy around you.

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:33.420 align:middle line:10%
So we will work on
that going forward.

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:36.245 align:middle line:10%
And I know that there
will be progress

00:21:36.245 --> 00:21:39.908 align:middle line:10%
and that something positive will
come out of it, because it's

00:21:39.908 --> 00:21:41.550 align:middle line:10%
something I've done before.

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:43.190 align:middle line:10%
It's just that you
get sidetracked

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:46.100 align:middle line:10%
along the way because
of various things.

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:52.190 align:middle line:10%
As much as it's hard to
have your ancestors here,

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:55.040 align:middle line:10%
there are a lot of positives.

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:59.840 align:middle line:10%
Things are better like this.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.990 align:middle line:10%
So yeah, we just need
to balance everything.

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:05.030 align:middle line:10%
By cleansing myself,
I'm also cleansing them

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:09.150 align:middle line:10%
so that they can function
better in my space.

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>> There are over 200,000
sangomas in South Africa,

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:18.710 align:middle line:84%
and a large percent of the
population confide in them

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:25.620 align:middle line:84%
to overcome illness and social
problems and challenges.

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:28.530 align:middle line:84%
Across the world,
healers and shamans

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:31.470 align:middle line:90%
have varying forms and methods.

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:34.980 align:middle line:84%
But one thing weaves
them together,

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:40.480 align:middle line:84%
their ability to tap into
energy and the spirit world

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:43.300 align:middle line:84%
to channel it and
use it to heal.

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:46.950 align:middle line:10%
