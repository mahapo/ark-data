00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.660 align:middle line:84%
>> It is said that this world
is an illusion and beyond,

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.910 align:middle line:90%
it lies our real existence.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.240 align:middle line:90%


00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.370 align:middle line:84%
There are many ancient accounts
of other worldly experiences,

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.970 align:middle line:84%
parallel universes and
alternate dimensions.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Some have the ability to
move between these worlds.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And some have unconsciously
slipped away from here

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:17.470 align:middle line:84%
and managed to return,
sharing with us

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.110 align:middle line:84%
their experiences
from the other side.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:46.100 align:middle line:90%


00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.580 align:middle line:90%
My name is Vicki Frick.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm from Cape Town.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.740 align:middle line:84%
A few years ago, I crossed
over to the other side.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.300 align:middle line:10%
And for some other
reason, I was sent back.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.800 align:middle line:84%
Needless to say,
since then, it's

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.920 align:middle line:84%
been a one way,
roller coaster, ride

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.240 align:middle line:84%
ticket with a crazy
amount of things happening

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.860 align:middle line:90%
that are inexplicable.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's just been a
journey of awakening

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.760 align:middle line:90%
of experiences and growth.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Cultures and ethnicities
may vary and be worlds apart.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.200 align:middle line:84%
There is a common denominator
that awaits us all.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.150 align:middle line:90%
For some, it is dark and scary.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.100 align:middle line:90%
While others, welcome it.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.520 align:middle line:84%
Death is inevitable
to all living beings.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Some people shy away
from reflecting on death,

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.170 align:middle line:90%
not wanting to face it.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.350 align:middle line:84%
Some, celebrate the
spiritual crossing over.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Lining up in hospital, it
was discovered that I needed

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.020 align:middle line:90%
to have surgery.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And in that time, I was
very specific in letting

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.740 align:middle line:84%
all the nursing
staff and the doctors

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.250 align:middle line:84%
know that I was
allergic to opioids.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And during the procedure,
my blood pressure dropped

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.710 align:middle line:90%
and my oxygen levels dropped.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And when they brought me
out to the recovery room,

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.360 align:middle line:84%
they gave me copious
amounts of morphine.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.210 align:middle line:84%
I was quite conscious
in the sense

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.720 align:middle line:84%
of hearing what their
plans were at that stage--

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.480 align:middle line:84%
up the morphine dose--
because it wasn't working.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And I heard the nurses
saying, we're losing her.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.890 align:middle line:84%
At that time, I was
standing outside of my body

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.730 align:middle line:84%
watching the nurse force my
hand away from the oxygen mask,

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.370 align:middle line:84%
while I was trying to
tear it from my face

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.768 align:middle line:84%
to say to her that I'm
allergic to morphine

00:03:39.768 --> 00:03:41.060 align:middle line:90%
and you're actually killing me.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.330 align:middle line:84%
The next thing I
knew, I was in what

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.210 align:middle line:84%
felt like a warm hug,
incredibly bright light

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.940 align:middle line:84%
almost like a mist,
and an essence.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.660 align:middle line:90%


00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.040 align:middle line:84%
All I kept thinking
was, I want to stay.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Nothing else mattered
at that point.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And then, this
conscious awareness

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.690 align:middle line:84%
of the fact that
I must have died.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.910 align:middle line:84%
I must be outside of the
realm of the physical world.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And I started hearing very
soft voices and things.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.180 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like
a knowing that these

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.710 align:middle line:84%
were the voices
of people that I'd

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.020 align:middle line:84%
known from my childhood,
my past, people

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.890 align:middle line:90%
that had passed on.

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.040 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't see anything.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.950 align:middle line:90%
It was incredibly bright.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And my thoughts
fell onto my son who

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.010 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't had a chance to
spend a lot of time with.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.100 align:middle line:84%
It didn't sit well with me
that I didn't get a chance

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.390 align:middle line:90%
to say goodbye to him.

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And it was supposed
to be a knee up.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.590 align:middle line:90%
And here I am.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:59.230 align:middle line:84%
I was taken to this area where
there was these vast gardens--

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.820 align:middle line:84%
more flowers than I could
ever count in a lifetime--

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.120 align:middle line:84%
incredible colors,
flowing rivers--

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.550 align:middle line:84%
colors that I'd also
never seen before.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And nothing mattered
at that point--

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.720 align:middle line:90%
no stress, no financial things.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.680 align:middle line:84%
None of the bonds that
we have here mattered,

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.690 align:middle line:90%
because I didn't need anything.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.830 align:middle line:84%
I'd left it all behind,
but there was my son.

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Many people around the world
share experiences of crossing

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.980 align:middle line:84%
over to the other side and
returning to this life once

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:34.780 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.080 align:middle line:84%
This is called a
near-death experience.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>> I went out to Somerset
West with a friend of mine.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And we went to his farm,
which he actually had

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.180 align:middle line:90%
a swimming pool at the farm.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.080 align:middle line:84%
So when we arrived
there, I basically jumped

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.650 align:middle line:84%
into my bathing, ran to
the pool, and I dived.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.880 align:middle line:84%
The impact of the water
bent my neck over.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.830 align:middle line:90%
And it broke my neck.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.270 align:middle line:90%
So I was paralyzed.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.690 align:middle line:84%
When I came around, I was
lying next to the pool.

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And I had an experience
of crossing over.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:23.130 align:middle line:84%
And I was floating, and going
up, and going through a tunnel.

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.530 align:middle line:84%
As I'm going through
the tunnel, I

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.220 align:middle line:84%
saw that there was light on
the other side of this tunnel.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:35.090 align:middle line:84%
We actually went into
this pure, white light.

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And all the while, going through
there, I had two angels--

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.405 align:middle line:90%
one on each side going with me.

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:54.260 align:middle line:90%


00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.340 align:middle line:84%
The angels, they then asked
me if I wanted to cross over

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.850 align:middle line:84%
or if I wanted to
go back to my life.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.860 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes, please.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.870 align:middle line:84%
I want to go back, because
there's unfinished business,

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:07.670 align:middle line:90%
which I have.

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.760 align:middle line:90%


00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.090 align:middle line:90%
And then everything went dark.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.420 align:middle line:90%
And I woke up next to the pool.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And found out afterwards, that
I'd actually broken my neck

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.380 align:middle line:90%
and that I was paralyzed.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:28.050 align:middle line:90%
And I landed up in hospital.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Basically, I battled for
months on end to actually walk.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:40.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Accounts of NDEs or
near-death experiences are

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:44.460 align:middle line:84%
ambiguous and can vary from
scientific to religious

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.330 align:middle line:84%
to spiritual perspectives,
although the actual experiences

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.160 align:middle line:90%
share many details.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.950 align:middle line:84%
Neuroscience
research hypothesizes

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:56.430 align:middle line:84%
that an NDE is a subjective
phenomenon resulting

00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:00.510 align:middle line:84%
from disturbed bodily,
multi-sensory integration that

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:03.030 align:middle line:84%
occurs during
life-threatening events.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:05.910 align:middle line:84%
While some transcendental
and religious beliefs

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:08.760 align:middle line:84%
about an afterlife
include descriptions

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:13.290 align:middle line:90%
similar to many documented NDEs.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Whatever spiritual gifts, I
was naturally supposed to have,

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:22.900 align:middle line:84%
have all kind of
come into fruition.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And the people that I held
quite dear to me at that point,

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:31.600 align:middle line:90%
I've lost some along the way.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.500 align:middle line:84%
I've held onto those
that I've found

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:41.530 align:middle line:84%
are what I call my tribe, my
spiritual sisters and brothers.

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And I've had some
incredible experiences

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:50.800 align:middle line:90%
that have changed who I am.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.300 align:middle line:90%
I've grown.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.910 align:middle line:84%
I've learned understanding,
and compassion,

00:08:54.910 --> 00:09:00.190 align:middle line:84%
and unconditional
love, forgiveness,

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:04.310 align:middle line:90%
the true meaning of purpose.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:09.226 align:middle line:84%
Where I'm currently at, now,
definitely for the better.

00:09:09.226 --> 00:09:14.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't have the same time
constraints and pressures

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.790 align:middle line:84%
that I used to
place myself under.

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:17.290 align:middle line:90%
I enjoy life.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:19.430 align:middle line:90%
I connect with nature.

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:22.280 align:middle line:84%
I know when it's
time to recharge.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.350 align:middle line:84%
I understand the things
that are important to me

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:26.450 align:middle line:84%
are the things that
I missed when I left

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:30.680 align:middle line:84%
and everything
else is irrelevant.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'm starting to realize
that I hold the power to the way

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:37.880 align:middle line:84%
that I see life, the way that
I accept things, the way that I

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.500 align:middle line:90%
acknowledge certain things.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:44.840 align:middle line:90%
And it's been life changing.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.180 align:middle line:84%
The scary thing
is sometimes, you

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:51.050 align:middle line:84%
have to die to realize what
it feels like to really live

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:55.070 align:middle line:84%
and not just merely exist in a
space where you're a character.

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:59.150 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I couldn't
tell anybody my experience,

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.840 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't know that
people even listen to me

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.000 align:middle line:84%
or believe what I
actually told them.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And it just happened
that one day--

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:14.360 align:middle line:84%
this is now about 30 odd years
afterwards, 32 years later--

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.260 align:middle line:90%
I was driving.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And I was listening
on the radio.

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And I heard other people that
also had the same experience.

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
started talking about it.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.410 align:middle line:90%
And I actually told my wife.

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:31.400 align:middle line:84%
It took me all those
years to actually tell her

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.160 align:middle line:84%
what the experience
was that I had.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.740 align:middle line:90%
Then I told some friends.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And it happened that one of my
friends actually said to me,

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:45.320 align:middle line:84%
it's so strange as
you talk about it,

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.020 align:middle line:90%
because he had an experience.

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And he thought that
it was a dream,

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:53.910 align:middle line:90%
that it actually happened.

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:55.280 align:middle line:90%
And I said to him, no, no.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.510 align:middle line:90%
Mine wasn't a dream.

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:59.930 align:middle line:84%
Mine was for real,
because I felt it.

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And when I actually
came around, I

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:08.820 align:middle line:90%
was like, what happened to me?

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:10.010 align:middle line:90%
I didn't get to see heaven.

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:13.370 align:middle line:90%
But I did see the angels.

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And it was the most
beautiful feeling.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to let the
people know that there

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:30.140 align:middle line:90%
is life on the other side.

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And when people tell you
they've also crossed over,

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:34.220 align:middle line:90%
you can believe them.

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:38.720 align:middle line:84%
>> In terms of perspective,
what shifts for most people that

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:43.040 align:middle line:84%
come back is the
existence of heaven.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And how it's kind of
frowned upon inside

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:53.210 align:middle line:84%
of a religious
constraint that, heaven

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:55.940 align:middle line:84%
is something different to
every person out there.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:59.690 align:middle line:90%
But it really is home.

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:02.400 align:middle line:84%
It's the place
that you came from.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.660 align:middle line:84%
It's a place that you
are going to return to.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:06.560 align:middle line:90%
It's real.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:14.030 align:middle line:84%
Experiencing angels,
miracles, prayer, that works.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:16.010 align:middle line:84%
Getting on your knees
and praying for something

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:20.150 align:middle line:84%
and knowing, learning,
developing ways and means

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:22.190 align:middle line:90%
to pray for other people.

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And standing back and
watching fantastic things

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:31.520 align:middle line:84%
happen in their life,
because faith is stronger.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And hope is something
that you strive towards.

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:42.770 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that
happens is, you've

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:46.320 align:middle line:84%
gone through something that is
very, very hard to talk about.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.120 align:middle line:90%
It's unbelievable.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.500 align:middle line:90%
It's outrageous.

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And what you find
is there are people

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.820 align:middle line:84%
that are sent across
your path that you just

00:12:55.820 --> 00:13:00.170 align:middle line:84%
have this natural
attraction and affinity to.

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:02.660 align:middle line:84%
That you look at
them and you think--

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:07.010 align:middle line:84%
something deep inside of you
says, you know what I know.

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:08.360 align:middle line:90%
I can open up to you.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.750 align:middle line:90%
I can feel safe here.

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:12.560 align:middle line:90%
I can feel at home here.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.120 align:middle line:90%
And I can share with you.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.635 align:middle line:84%
And there's going
to be no judgment.

00:13:15.635 --> 00:13:21.020 align:middle line:90%


00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.330 align:middle line:90%
>> We started sharing.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And she then asked me
about my grandmother.

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:31.780 align:middle line:10%
And I don't really talk about
my grandmother who raised me.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, she's
standing right next to you.

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:36.910 align:middle line:90%
And she's smiling at you.

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:40.030 align:middle line:90%
And I was shocked at first.

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:41.740 align:middle line:90%
And she says, she loved you.

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And she gave you the
best that she could,

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.600 align:middle line:90%
because you were her pearl.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.890 align:middle line:90%
And I started crying.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:51.010 align:middle line:90%
And we started holding hands.

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:54.530 align:middle line:84%
Then, the next day,
she called me and said,

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:55.960 align:middle line:84%
listen, my husband
just called me.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.040 align:middle line:90%
And he's filing for a divorce.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.600 align:middle line:90%
And I need someone to speak to.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And we went to this place--
and we don't even know it.

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:03.520 align:middle line:90%
And we started praying.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And then a gentleman that
was passing by with his car,

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:08.590 align:middle line:84%
he reversed back,
got out of his car,

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:11.380 align:middle line:84%
and actually stood
next to Vicki.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And another woman was passing
by, which was shocking,

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.413 align:middle line:90%
started praying as well.

00:14:17.413 --> 00:14:18.580 align:middle line:90%
And she didn't even know us.

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And afterwards, she just
said, Amen and everything

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:21.770 align:middle line:90%
will be well.

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And she asked me,
what happened to you?

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And I told her, well, there is
this day where I was sleeping.

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And as I was sleeping,
I could slowly

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:37.610 align:middle line:90%
feel myself lifting off the bed.

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:42.380 align:middle line:84%
But what was funny is that
I'm looking at myself.

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:43.310 align:middle line:90%
But I allowed it.

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:44.540 align:middle line:90%
At first, I was fighting it.

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And then something
said, I must allow it.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:52.250 align:middle line:84%
While I was going up, I was
shown with a deep voice saying,

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.520 align:middle line:84%
this is the life
that I want for you.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.080 align:middle line:90%
I was scared at first.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, the only life
I want if I can join my grand,

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.140 align:middle line:84%
because I cannot live
without my grand.

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:06.090 align:middle line:90%
And he said, walk with me.

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And while I was
walking with him,

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:12.770 align:middle line:84%
I went back to when I was very
tiny, when I was really small.

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And he said, the
first day I saw you,

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:18.500 align:middle line:84%
this is the first
day I had plans.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:22.520 align:middle line:90%
And I could see my life--

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:27.410 align:middle line:84%
my granny taking me to school,
walking me to my creche,

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:30.740 align:middle line:84%
walking me to ballet
lessons, coming back.

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Her boss, Mrs.
DeCork, smiling at me

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:37.640 align:middle line:84%
and saying, I want to
raise her with you,

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.410 align:middle line:90%
Euphemia, which was my grand.

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:41.310 align:middle line:90%
And said, I want to raise her.

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:43.610 align:middle line:84%
There's just some--
there's just this light.

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And he said, that day that
Mrs. DeCork took you in

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:49.310 align:middle line:90%
is the day I brought light.

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:50.910 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:52.370 align:middle line:90%
And we started walking.

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:55.340 align:middle line:84%
But while he's walking
me through my life,

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:58.200 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know it
was the next day.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:05.150 align:middle line:84%
So the next day, my father's
sister is waking me up.

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:07.850 align:middle line:90%
And I was not moving.

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:10.010 align:middle line:84%
She says, I could
feel your pulse.

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:12.020 align:middle line:90%
But you're not moving.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.570 align:middle line:84%
She then started
calling the neighbors.

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And my sisters were
saying, hey, she's dead

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:19.970 align:middle line:90%
or something's happening.

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:21.140 align:middle line:90%
And people were coming.

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, they called
my pastor and he came through.

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:29.230 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no, she's not dead.

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:31.060 align:middle line:90%
She's living, feel her pulse.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And but I could hear
the voices speak to me.

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:39.640 align:middle line:84%
But I was more interested in,
what is this I'm going through?

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:44.560 align:middle line:84%
We started walking through
my life and how I got there.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And he was talking to me, in
a comforting voice, saying,

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:48.400 align:middle line:90%
it's OK.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And I said, but why
can't I see my body?

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.950 align:middle line:90%
Why are they praying around me?

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:55.700 align:middle line:90%
Why are they-- am I dead?

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:56.500 align:middle line:90%
Are you taking me?

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.970 align:middle line:84%
Not yet, or wait,
I'm not quite sure.

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:00.610 align:middle line:90%
And he said, relax.

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And afterwards, he said,
it is now up to you,

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:08.589 align:middle line:84%
whether you take
three directions.

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:11.200 align:middle line:90%
It is the direction of fruit.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.390 align:middle line:90%
It's the direction of health.

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:15.040 align:middle line:90%
It's the direction of happiness.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.380 align:middle line:84%
So I went to the
direction of fruit first.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:20.859 align:middle line:84%
And when I got there,
it was just fruits

00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:21.970 align:middle line:90%
that I've never seen.

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:24.700 align:middle line:84%
It was fruits that
I wanted to taste.

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:28.089 align:middle line:84%
But when I touched them,
I couldn't pick them up.

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And he said, your
life will be fruitful.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you see, the
first choice that you made is,

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:37.750 align:middle line:84%
how you're going
to live your life.

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:39.955 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, I got
back into my body.

00:17:39.955 --> 00:17:47.920 align:middle line:90%


00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.800 align:middle line:90%
Vicki then started singing--

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.660 align:middle line:90%
Oh touch me now my Savior--

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:56.950 align:middle line:84%
which nobody knew
that was the song.

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:58.330 align:middle line:90%
I heard.

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:00.020 align:middle line:90%
And I started crying.

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And she said, God
loves you so much.

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:05.170 align:middle line:90%
You need to start living.

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:07.300 align:middle line:90%
And you need to be fruitful.

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:11.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
knew that, OK, Vicky,

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:14.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm never going to leave
your sight ever again.

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:15.170 align:middle line:90%
I will be by your side.

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And we have been in each
other's presence, like I could

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:20.120 align:middle line:90%
feel when she is not happy.

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.820 align:middle line:84%
And she knows when she's
not happy, she calls me.

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:25.130 align:middle line:90%
I will literally take my son.

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And we will go to her
house and live there

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.090 align:middle line:90%
for weeks or two weeks.

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And my son will travel to and
from just because she's, OK.

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Knowing that you've got a
crowd in your corner that are

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:39.080 align:middle line:90%
for you--

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:44.240 align:middle line:84%
people that are praying,
that have good intentions--

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:48.230 align:middle line:84%
is worth more than
its weight in gold.

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And we need to be very
careful to guard ourselves,

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:55.070 align:middle line:84%
to protect our energy,
to surround ourselves

00:18:55.070 --> 00:19:01.910 align:middle line:84%
with beautiful, life
enhancing moments and things.

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:05.150 align:middle line:90%
And dive into good poetry.

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:07.130 align:middle line:90%
Listen to good music.

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:09.980 align:middle line:90%
Go dip your feet in the ocean.

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.860 align:middle line:90%
Get out in between flowers.

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And enjoy the simple things
in life with good people.

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Obviously, Vicki
being my daughter,

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:26.340 align:middle line:84%
we've never actually spoken
about our experiences.

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And I've only heard
it now, today,

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:34.770 align:middle line:84%
that she's had a very
similar experience, where

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:37.150 align:middle line:90%
it has happened to her as well.

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:42.060 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very interested
to hear what her side is.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, I will
tell her what happened

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:47.520 align:middle line:90%
to me and my experience.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:51.180 align:middle line:84%
>> The universe has merged Vicki
and her father's paths together

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:54.360 align:middle line:84%
in such a fantastical
and wondrous manner,

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:57.150 align:middle line:84%
that it is almost
impossible to understand.

00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:00.450 align:middle line:84%
Join us, after the break,
when Vicki and her father

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:03.630 align:middle line:84%
share with each other
for the first time, both

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:06.330 align:middle line:84%
having experienced
life altering,

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:09.280 align:middle line:90%
near-death experiences.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:16.290 align:middle line:84%
>> The first time that I heard
that you had died was a couple

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:20.010 align:middle line:84%
of months ago when you
mentioned it in the kitchen.

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:22.140 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't want to ask.

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:25.050 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of waiting
for that moment where

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:26.700 align:middle line:84%
you felt comfortable
enough to tell me,

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:29.490 align:middle line:84%
because it's such a
personal experience.

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:31.710 align:middle line:90%
And it's life changing.

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's so hard to tell someone
that this is what happened,

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:42.150 align:middle line:84%
because most people look at you
like you have lost the plot.

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:50.797 align:middle line:84%
So how did it feel for you
to realize that you died?

00:20:50.797 --> 00:20:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, you said
you had a choice.

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:55.260 align:middle line:84%
You were given the
choice to come back.

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:57.330 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel like you've
fulfilled your purpose

00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:01.560 align:middle line:84%
and lived out the life
that you had planned?

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:05.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, personally, I can
tell you now that I think

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:07.125 align:middle line:90%
I've fulfilled my purpose.

00:21:07.125 --> 00:21:09.950 align:middle line:90%


00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:16.980 align:middle line:84%
I've had the joy, the
kids, my beautiful wife.

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
Lord wanted me here,

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:29.370 align:middle line:84%
to be here for all those things
that I wanted in my life.

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:32.250 align:middle line:90%


00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I'm very
thankful for it.

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:40.170 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, it's me.

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:43.320 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, glad you came back.

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, when I heard that
it actually happened to you,

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:55.560 align:middle line:84%
because I hadn't
heard of it before,

00:21:55.560 --> 00:22:01.590 align:middle line:84%
it is very nice
to experience it.

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's also very
nice to be back.

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:07.260 align:middle line:90%


00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:08.775 align:middle line:90%
I'm very happy you're back.

00:22:08.775 --> 00:22:09.615 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:22:09.615 --> 00:22:10.650 align:middle line:90%
>> I love you, dad.

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:18.800 align:middle line:90%


00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:21.920 align:middle line:84%
I know that heaven's
waiting for me.

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:28.310 align:middle line:84%
So there's no fear of
going or passing on.

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:30.200 align:middle line:84%
It's an incredible place,
an incredible place

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.640 align:middle line:90%
to exist and be.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.350 align:middle line:90%
But obviously, I wasn't ready.

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And I still have some things
that I need to do this side.

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:38.450 align:middle line:90%
So I'm patient.

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:40.450 align:middle line:90%
And I'm waiting.

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:43.410 align:middle line:90%
But I'm excited to go back.

00:22:43.410 --> 00:23:47.000 align:middle line:90%
