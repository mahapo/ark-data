who dance between the realms
of the seen and unseen.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.350 align:middle line:84%
These individuals
have the ability

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.459 align:middle line:84%
to facilitate a shift in
people, offering them insight

and support, reconnecting people

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Chakra Natha was
founded in 2014.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.050 align:middle line:84%
When I realized that my personal
development practices had

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.590 align:middle line:84%
helped me to overcome the
traumas of being adopted,

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.890 align:middle line:84%
of being beaten, and
sexually assaulted,

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.170 align:middle line:84%
I overcame the traumas of eating
disorders, divorce, addiction,

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.590 align:middle line:84%
and self-mutilation
by being consistent

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.240 align:middle line:90%
with these practices.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so blessed
to be a survivor who

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.150 align:middle line:90%
is creating more survivors.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>> There's definitely a sense
of lightness after going through

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.670 align:middle line:84%
meeting, or you're
in a spirit guide.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.430 align:middle line:84%
I think there's also a sense
of consciousness and awareness

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.170 align:middle line:90%
that comes from that.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.370 align:middle line:84%
I remember just being so
grounded and very much in tune

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.150 align:middle line:84%
with myself, most importantly,
but also my family, the people

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.670 align:middle line:84%
around me, the spaces
that I find myself in,

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.260 align:middle line:84%
and the people
that I come across

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.290 align:middle line:84%
with I have to help them with
it through a psychological

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.440 align:middle line:84%
perspective or through an
energy healing perspective.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.400 align:middle line:84%
So I met Kaye at
our private practice

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.780 align:middle line:90%
where we both used to work.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.840 align:middle line:84%
I remember her coming in, and
we just immediately connected.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.360 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to say that
our energies connected.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And at that point in time,
I knew that she was probably

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.770 align:middle line:84%
going to be someone quite
important in my life

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.030 align:middle line:90%
from a spiritual perspective.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
our journey started.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.390 align:middle line:84%
I did my first guided
meditation with her, our journey

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.060 align:middle line:84%
with her, where I did
meet my inner shaman.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.510 align:middle line:84%
I did meet my spirit guides
that was quite, I must say,

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.320 align:middle line:90%
a moving experience for me.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think it helped me ground
and just feel quite connected.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.810 align:middle line:90%


00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>> But when it comes
to alternative healing,

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.430 align:middle line:84%
the connection between the
healer and the patients is one

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.550 align:middle line:90%
of such valuable importance.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.160 align:middle line:84%
So the reason I brought
Boitumelo with us today

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.280 align:middle line:84%
is that we actually had
a very special meeting.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.180 align:middle line:84%
I began a new practice,
and I was in a space

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.670 align:middle line:84%
where I was quite
unsure, and Boit

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.360 align:middle line:84%
was dealing with some very
heavy information from family

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.410 align:middle line:90%
and clients.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And we connected
so well together

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.190 align:middle line:84%
that she provided me with
healing as I was providing her

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.330 align:middle line:90%
with healing.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And so this has been a very
special journey for the two

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.390 align:middle line:84%
of us because, in
working together,

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.180 align:middle line:84%
we've actually both come
to new spaces of healing

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.530 align:middle line:90%
within our lives.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And this connection
is what allows

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.680 align:middle line:84%
us to have the trust between
us that we need in order

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.270 align:middle line:90%
to enter the spirit world.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.700 align:middle line:84%
The work that I am
very privileged to do

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.630 align:middle line:84%
has everything to do with
Native American, Indian healing.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.269 align:middle line:84%
And it's incredibly
exciting for me

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.500 align:middle line:84%
because this is a space in which
we can work where people can

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.470 align:middle line:84%
heal from the
subconscious as opposed

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.200 align:middle line:84%
to having to relive any of
their negative experiences.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.730 align:middle line:84%
I was given my first year of
study as a wedding present,

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.430 align:middle line:84%
and it was at a point in
my life where I really

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.420 align:middle line:84%
desperately needed that
because I had no idea of how

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.210 align:middle line:90%
to work with who I was.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.450 align:middle line:84%
So after my first
year of study, I then

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.930 align:middle line:84%
got actively onto a course
of studying more alternative

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:49.800 align:middle line:90%
healing.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And I've gone through
transpersonal psychology,

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.830 align:middle line:84%
the shamanic Indian
ways of healing.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And then I also
do energy healing,

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.530 align:middle line:90%
which is very similar to Reiki.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.330 align:middle line:84%
The shamanic ways of healing
all use plant guides or animal

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.780 align:middle line:84%
guides, or we use
drumming to entrain

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.620 align:middle line:84%
the brainwaves to help the
person reach a trance state.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's within
this trance state

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.090 align:middle line:90%
that the healing takes place.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.680 align:middle line:90%

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:31.250 align:middle line:90%


00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.590 align:middle line:84%
Working in the
environment with horses

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.750 align:middle line:90%
has absolutely changed my life.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.660 align:middle line:84%
They have been a
part of my existence

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.390 align:middle line:84%
since I was three
years old, and they

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.760 align:middle line:84%
will be a part of my existence
for as long as I am here.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.650 align:middle line:84%
Part of the reason why I love
practicing on a property where

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.760 align:middle line:84%
there are horses is because
the energy of the horse

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.650 align:middle line:90%
is very far-reaching.

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.390 align:middle line:84%
It protects the actual property
that I work on, and, in turn,

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.390 align:middle line:84%
the sessions that I offer
are purer and stronger

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:03.320 align:middle line:90%
because of them.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:10.220 align:middle line:90%


00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.850 align:middle line:84%
So as a shaman,
by definition, I'm

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.910 align:middle line:84%
a person who can alter
their consciousness

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.550 align:middle line:84%
or leave the body in
order to bring healing

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.340 align:middle line:90%
for somebody else.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:26.350 align:middle line:84%
My background includes many
different healing modalities.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.990 align:middle line:84%
But today, we are
going to be focusing

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.790 align:middle line:90%
on the shamanic journey process.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:36.680 align:middle line:84%
So this involves drumming,
and we do a guided journey

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.220 align:middle line:84%
so that the person can go
and meet their spirit guide.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.010 align:middle line:90%

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:58.750 align:middle line:90%


00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.730 align:middle line:84%
In the world of
shamanic healing,

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:03.820 align:middle line:84%
we use a large
amount of symbolism

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.100 align:middle line:90%
throughout our practices.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.230 align:middle line:84%
You can put a lot
more information

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:10.300 align:middle line:84%
into a small amount
of symbolism.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:14.230 align:middle line:84%
So this makes our practices
much, much richer.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.630 align:middle line:90%
We work with the medicine wheel.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And in the medicine
wheel, we take

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.930 align:middle line:84%
notes of the four
directions, the elements,

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.660 align:middle line:84%
certain animal
archetypes, and we

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:30.070 align:middle line:84%
have our symbols to describe
each direction as well.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:34.450 align:middle line:84%
When we open the medicine
wheel, we start in the East,

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:36.980 align:middle line:90%
and that is the element of air.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.820 align:middle line:84%
This is the direction
in the medicine wheel

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.790 align:middle line:84%
where we call in the
eagle and the condor

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.910 align:middle line:84%
to take us on their wings
to the place of spirit.

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Then moving from the
East into the South,

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.280 align:middle line:90%
this is the place of fire.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And our animal archetype in
this direction is the serpent.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:58.420 align:middle line:84%
She comes along to
teach us how to shade

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:02.150 align:middle line:84%
our stories as she
can shade her skin,

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:04.210 align:middle line:90%
but we are not our stories.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:07.360 align:middle line:84%
Then moving from the
South into the West,

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.760 align:middle line:90%
this is our element of water.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And the archetype that
we call in the West

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.730 align:middle line:84%
is the Otorohanga,
the black jaguar.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And we called the black jaguar
to cross the Rainbow Bridge

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:23.140 align:middle line:84%
to be present with us in the
healing space to teach us

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.090 align:middle line:90%
how to live without fear.

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:28.510 align:middle line:84%
Then we move from the
West into the North,

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:30.610 align:middle line:90%
and this is the place of earth.

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:34.150 align:middle line:84%
This is the dwelling place
of all of our ancestors

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.559 align:middle line:90%
where all the wisdom comes from.

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And in this direction,
we call in the owl,

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.840 align:middle line:84%
the one who sees through the
darkness and into the light.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.410 align:middle line:84%
After we finished calling in
our archetypes from the North,

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:50.620 align:middle line:84%
we then go to the center
of our medicine wheel,

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.590 align:middle line:84%
and we thank
Pachamama, our earth,

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:56.320 align:middle line:90%
for being solid under our feet.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And we thank all the sky
and all of the cloud spirit

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:03.730 align:middle line:84%
and wind nations for
their level of wisdom

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:05.350 align:middle line:90%
that they bring to us.

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:08.920 align:middle line:84%
At the end of every session,
we do close the medicine wheel

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:09.790 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And in closing, we would
start in the North,

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.870 align:middle line:84%
then we would go to the
West, then to the South,

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:18.400 align:middle line:90%
and then to the Middle East.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And finally, releasing
Mother Earth and Father Sky.

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.410 align:middle line:84%
So this is the symbolism that
you will always see whenever

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:28.480 align:middle line:90%
you go for shamanic healing.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.740 align:middle line:84%
This is the structure that we
use to set up our protections

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.710 align:middle line:84%
and to focus our intentions
for the session ahead.

00:09:38.998 --> 00:09:51.830 align:middle line:90%


00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:55.070 align:middle line:84%
Today, in our presence, we
will have a very good friend

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:57.380 align:middle line:90%
of mine, Boitumelo Boikhutso.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.200 align:middle line:90%
She is actually a psychologist.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.380 align:middle line:84%
So she comes from a
Western path of medicine.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And with the psychology that
she gives to other people,

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.110 align:middle line:84%
there's always a
lot that she has

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:13.710 align:middle line:84%
to process out of her own system
after having worked with them.

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:15.590 align:middle line:84%
So this is something
we'll be focusing

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:17.300 align:middle line:90%
on today with Boitumelo.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:23.100 align:middle line:90%


00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:27.480 align:middle line:84%
This process normally takes
around 40 minutes to 1 hour.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.220 align:middle line:90%
And it's a very gentle process.

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:33.630 align:middle line:84%
So the patient lies
down flat on their back,

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:37.350 align:middle line:84%
and we just talk them
into very deep relaxation,

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:40.410 align:middle line:90%
which then leads into hypnosis.

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And shamanic healing
is practically

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:47.320 align:middle line:84%
the beginning of modern
hypnosis as we know it today.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.020 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
journey that we will

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:50.760 align:middle line:90%
be taking with Boitumelo today.

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.078 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:54.078 --> 00:11:05.146 align:middle line:90%


00:11:05.146 --> 00:11:09.210 align:middle line:84%
>> As a young energy healer, I
think the journey was in itself

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:14.490 align:middle line:84%
for me, I was able to also just
attach it to my upbringing what

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:17.370 align:middle line:84%
I've been exposed to spiritually
as well from a religious

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:21.870 align:middle line:84%
perspective as well, having to
lay hands on people and healing

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:25.200 align:middle line:84%
people through energy, being
able to also help people align

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.020 align:middle line:90%
their trackers.

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think that it links
quite beautifully in terms

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:31.620 align:middle line:84%
of psychology being a
psychology graduate being

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.810 align:middle line:84%
a registered counselor
and that a lot of people

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:37.110 align:middle line:84%
that come into my practice
being able to read

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:40.350 align:middle line:84%
the energies, which I
was already in tune with,

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:43.030 align:middle line:84%
but I think it's just
been fine-tuned now.

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:45.210 align:middle line:10%
I'm just from a
helping and a healing

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:46.530 align:middle line:10%
process at the end of the day.

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think helping people also
understand their own energies

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:51.930 align:middle line:84%
and other people's
energies around them

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:53.910 align:middle line:90%
and how that impacts us.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:56.040 align:middle line:84%
I am a registered
trauma counselor

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.440 align:middle line:84%
by profession with the
Health Professions Council

00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.640 align:middle line:90%
of South Africa.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.500 align:middle line:90%
I am a broadcaster.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm an energy healer.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:05.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm a mental health
practitioner as well as

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:08.520 align:middle line:84%
the founding director
of Boitshoko Consulting.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.770 align:middle line:84%
So why I'm here
today is, again, I'll

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:13.170 align:middle line:84%
be embarking on the
spirit guide journey

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:15.450 align:middle line:84%
with Kaye, where again,
you get into quite

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:17.010 align:middle line:90%
a deep meditative state.

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, what
Kaye does is guides me

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:21.630 align:middle line:90%
through that journey.

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:23.490 align:middle line:84%
Like I'd said, it's
not my first time

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:26.160 align:middle line:84%
going through the
spirit guide journey,

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.510 align:middle line:90%
would be my second time.

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:30.357 align:middle line:84%
What it entails is about
meeting you in a spirit guide.

00:12:30.357 --> 00:12:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think that might
mean different things

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:33.070 align:middle line:90%
for different people.

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:35.610 align:middle line:10%
For me personally, because
I can only speak for myself,

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:39.270 align:middle line:10%
we can always kind of link it
from an ancestral perspective,

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:42.390 align:middle line:10%
a spirit perspective, and
I think a lot of things

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:45.270 align:middle line:10%
for me started to make
sense after my spirit guide,

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:46.770 align:middle line:10%
whether it be my
core, whether it

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:48.750 align:middle line:10%
be how I relate with
the external world,

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:50.970 align:middle line:10%
how relate with myself as well.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And having to go through
that journey really

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:55.230 align:middle line:84%
just solidified
that relationship

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:57.990 align:middle line:84%
with self, that
relationship with spirit.

00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
physical benefits of it,

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:04.380 align:middle line:84%
I must say, that sleep was
no longer a rumor after going

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:05.470 align:middle line:90%
through that journey.

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:07.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm now sleeping much better.

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm also more in tune in terms
of just what my body needs.

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:12.720 align:middle line:84%
Mindful meditation
also became something

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.550 align:middle line:84%
that was quite prominent
and prevalent at that time.

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:19.110 align:middle line:84%
So there were quite a few
benefits that I can recall.

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:22.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm super excited
about this session

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:24.960 align:middle line:84%
because it's been a
few months since I've

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.150 align:middle line:84%
gone down this
journey with Kaye,

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:30.240 align:middle line:84%
I think, just again,
just to reacquaint myself

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.010 align:middle line:90%
with my spirit guide.

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And I also love to see
from a growth perspective,

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:36.690 align:middle line:84%
from our initial
session to our session

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:40.410 align:middle line:84%
now, how much more has
kind of grown and developed

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:41.220 align:middle line:90%
within that space.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you so much for
joining me today, Boit.

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:46.620 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going to do,
I'm going to start you off

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:49.920 align:middle line:84%
as I normally do
with a good smudging.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.440 align:middle line:84%
So the smudge that
I have here today

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.550 align:middle line:84%
is North American
white sage, and this

00:13:56.550 --> 00:14:00.060 align:middle line:84%
clears all of the negative
energy out of your field.

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.730 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH CHANTING]

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:13.830 align:middle line:90%


00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:19.800 align:middle line:84%
It is now time to enter
the shamanic dream

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:32.020 align:middle line:84%
time to shift your awareness
into an altered state

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.140 align:middle line:90%
of perception.

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:37.390 align:middle line:90%


00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:45.370 align:middle line:84%
Relax even further and
feel yourself drift off

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:50.020 align:middle line:90%
to an imaginary place in nature.

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:55.480 align:middle line:84%
You can visualize
or feel yourself

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.740 align:middle line:90%
laying in an open meadow.

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:01.030 align:middle line:90%


00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And every way you
look nature abounds

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:08.720 align:middle line:90%
in rich contrasting colors.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.740 align:middle line:90%


00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And all the sounds of this
world enticing you to descend

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:24.430 align:middle line:90%
into the magical realm below.

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:31.070 align:middle line:84%
You can feel yourself
moving downwind

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:42.120 align:middle line:84%
deeper and deeper into the lower
world of the subconscious mind.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:45.986 align:middle line:84%
Take a moment to explore
your surroundings.

00:15:45.986 --> 00:15:50.540 align:middle line:90%


00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:57.185 align:middle line:84%
At the far end, you can feel the
clearing calling towards you.

00:15:57.185 --> 00:16:00.630 align:middle line:90%


00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:04.160 align:middle line:90%
And you can hear running water.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:11.540 align:middle line:84%
You can sense the presence of
your spirit guide patiently

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:13.280 align:middle line:90%
waiting for you.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:17.280 align:middle line:90%


00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:22.350 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes if your
guide is an animal,

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:25.730 align:middle line:84%
it may just brush
itself across your legs.

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:28.270 align:middle line:90%


00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And if you feel
that sensation, just

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:38.340 align:middle line:84%
imagine reaching
down to touch it.

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:45.150 align:middle line:84%
Feel the love being
emanated from your guide.

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:52.650 align:middle line:84%
Ask your guide what is
the wisdom you will share

00:16:52.650 --> 00:17:00.110 align:middle line:84%
with me today, and take
notes of everything

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:08.579 align:middle line:84%
in your surroundings, for the
answer may not come in words.

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And as we prepare to
return, ask your guide

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.870 align:middle line:90%
to come back with you today.

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:20.310 align:middle line:90%


00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And so it has come time
to return to the passage,

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:32.960 align:middle line:84%
leaving the clearing in
the distance behind you,

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:41.660 align:middle line:84%
and you will begin coming
back to the present moment

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:42.942 align:middle line:90%
into the body.

00:17:42.942 --> 00:17:45.540 align:middle line:90%


00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:46.756 align:middle line:90%
Come back now.

00:17:46.756 --> 00:17:50.270 align:middle line:90%


00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:55.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use the singing
ball to ground your energies.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.605 align:middle line:90%
Welcome you back to the body.

00:17:57.605 --> 00:18:12.010 align:middle line:90%


00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:18.035 align:middle line:84%
And take a nice deep breath
in again for me and all

00:18:18.035 --> 00:18:18.835 align:middle line:90%
through the mouth.

00:18:18.835 --> 00:18:22.780 align:middle line:90%


00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Today's session with
Boitumelo was actually

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.170 align:middle line:90%
a really powerful one.

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:30.310 align:middle line:84%
So as we spoke her
down into relaxation,

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:34.000 align:middle line:84%
she is a person who drops
down into the subconscious

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.240 align:middle line:90%
very quickly.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And once we were in the actual
parts of the journey where

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:42.820 align:middle line:84%
she's communing with the guides,
I cannot actually see what

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:45.340 align:middle line:84%
the person is seeing,
but very often,

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:49.310 align:middle line:84%
I can feel what is
in our near vicinity.

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And I can also pick up on the
emotions of the person who

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.200 align:middle line:90%
is doing the journey.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:57.040 align:middle line:84%
So this time with
Boitumelo, there

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:00.430 align:middle line:84%
was a lot of
goosebumps, which means

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:03.820 align:middle line:84%
that the feeling of the
guides was incredibly strong.

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And she asked before
the session that she

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000 align:middle line:84%
wanted to commune
with the water spirits

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.700 align:middle line:84%
that she had made
last weekend when

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.900 align:middle line:90%
she went for sangoma training.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:18.550 align:middle line:84%
So these spirits actually
came through very powerfully

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:21.970 align:middle line:84%
for her, and they wrapped
her in their arms,

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:24.370 align:middle line:84%
and this is why she could
feel the goose flesh.

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:28.570 align:middle line:84%
The changes from the session
will go with her in the weeks

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:29.420 align:middle line:90%
to come.

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:32.140 align:middle line:84%
So she will find that
new understandings come

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:35.920 align:middle line:84%
to the surface or
there's something that's

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:38.000 align:middle line:90%
been healed within the body.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.570 align:middle line:84%
So for the next
couple of weeks, she

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:43.720 align:middle line:84%
will still be benefiting
from this process

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:47.320 align:middle line:84%
as things unfold in her life
according to the spirit guides.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:52.150 align:middle line:10%
>> My experience in the session
was a tad bit different from

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:54.670 align:middle line:10%
my initial session with Kaye.

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:56.770 align:middle line:84%
This time, they weren't
as many animals.

00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:59.230 align:middle line:84%
I remember my first
journey there was--

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:02.470 align:middle line:90%
I actually saw my inner shaman.

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:05.530 align:middle line:84%
In this particular journey,
there was much more feeling.

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:09.700 align:middle line:84%
So I had goosebumps for
most of the journey.

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:13.450 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it just felt quite
deep lots of ground.

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:15.970 align:middle line:84%
It felt like I needed
to kind of go deeper

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:21.160 align:middle line:84%
in terms of just walking through
that particular narrative.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:25.360 align:middle line:84%
I think just a lot of
energies and a lot of stuff

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.360 align:middle line:90%
kind of came up.

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.910 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately,
I feel very good.

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>> So with the shamanic
world of healing,

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:36.160 align:middle line:84%
as you've all seen today, this
is work that happens in a very

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.930 align:middle line:90%
ethereal world.

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Most of our healing
happens in a dream state

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:44.860 align:middle line:84%
or in deep meditation
or, like you saw today,

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:46.930 align:middle line:90%
in actual hypnosis.

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:50.830 align:middle line:84%
So what happens with these
journeys is we release,

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:53.650 align:middle line:84%
and we are able to look
at what is happening

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:55.510 align:middle line:90%
in our subconscious minds.

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:58.870 align:middle line:84%
You can then identify
where the issues are,

00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:03.490 align:middle line:84%
and you have a way of receiving
guidance going forward with how

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:05.300 align:middle line:90%
to deal with those issues.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:09.280 align:middle line:84%
So this is the reason why I love
my work so much because many

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.790 align:middle line:84%
people with psychology
cannot actually talk about

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:14.900 align:middle line:84%
the experiences
they've been through.

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:17.920 align:middle line:84%
But when they come for a
journey process like this one,

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:21.610 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like watching the
trauma from somebody else's

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:23.210 align:middle line:90%
point of view.

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:26.260 align:middle line:84%
So these patients are really
able to bring those things

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:30.310 align:middle line:84%
to the surface and to deal
with them and to release them.

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And this brings
about the balance

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.530 align:middle line:90%
between body, mind, and spirit.

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And when we balance
all three of those

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.810 align:middle line:84%
then we work in harmony
with the planets around us

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:43.980 align:middle line:90%
and the people around us.

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Body, mind, and spirit.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.090 align:middle line:90%
They are all connected.

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:50.790 align:middle line:84%
Practices like
shamanism are a tool

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:54.940 align:middle line:84%
that allows us to delve deeper
into the world of spirituality

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:58.410 align:middle line:84%
so that we can enable our
physical and mental state

00:21:58.410 --> 00:21:59.970 align:middle line:90%
to live in harmony.

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:03.320 align:middle line:90%
