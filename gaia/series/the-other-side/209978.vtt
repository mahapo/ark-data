who dance between the realms

These individuals
have the ability

to facilitate a shift in
people, offering them insight

>> To see from my heart is much
more clearer than seeing with

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.460 align:middle line:84%
my eyes and with my
brain cells, as they say.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And I could see the
beauty in everything.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.210 align:middle line:90%
Everything was very profound.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.520 align:middle line:84%
The visions I got of like an
iboga shaman that came to me,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.430 align:middle line:84%
and he was talking to me
about what I need to do.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And I need to toughen
up, and I need

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.030 align:middle line:90%
to make the right decisions.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And it was like a
conversation with this person.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.900 align:middle line:84%
But the most important
thing in my journey for me

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.310 align:middle line:84%
was that I could see
physically my body healing

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.560 align:middle line:90%
from all my injuries.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's just taught me so much
about me that I didn't know.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.440 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know I had these faults
and these positive qualities.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.990 align:middle line:10%
And how can I use both of
these to go through life

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.140 align:middle line:10%
being my authentic self?

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And then at the
end of the journey,

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.760 align:middle line:84%
I saw my authentic
self looking at me,

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.560 align:middle line:90%
and realized that it's there.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.540 align:middle line:90%
I just need to access it.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>> I realized that chasing after
money was not what I wanted

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.340 align:middle line:90%
to do for the rest of my life.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.850 align:middle line:10%
Making other people happy
and throwing my own life

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:04.680 align:middle line:10%
away by forgetting myself
and just always chasing

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.810 align:middle line:10%
after money in 2014.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.210 align:middle line:84%
There was also two burglaries,
traumatic events, a rape.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.650 align:middle line:84%
So there was a lot of trauma
that I had to work through,

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.870 align:middle line:84%
and I could feel
myself slipping away

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.930 align:middle line:84%
and my life just going
down the drain, up to 2014

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.750 align:middle line:84%
when I lost my job in
the corporate world

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.100 align:middle line:84%
and did my first iboga journey
at the previous retreat.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.530 align:middle line:84%
It had such an amazing
effect in my life

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.260 align:middle line:84%
that I realized that
this is what I wanted

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260 align:middle line:90%
to do for the rest of my life.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.430 align:middle line:84%
>> The experience of ibogaine
occurs in two phases termed

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.700 align:middle line:84%
the visionary phase and
the introspection phase.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.010 align:middle line:84%
The journey can last
four to six hours

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.770 align:middle line:84%
and can enable people
to conquer their fears

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.930 align:middle line:90%
and negative emotions.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.470 align:middle line:84%
Ibogaine catalyzes an altered
state of consciousness,

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.380 align:middle line:84%
reminiscent dreaming while
fully conscious and aware

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.670 align:middle line:84%
so that memories, life
experiences, and issues

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.260 align:middle line:90%
of trauma can be processed.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.400 align:middle line:84%
>> I've worked at two other
retreats again as well,

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.130 align:middle line:84%
up to 2017 when I met Marouf at
a Buddhist retreat, actually.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And we joined the
same retreat again.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.220 align:middle line:90%
We worked together again.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And up to 2018 we
decided to break away

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.190 align:middle line:84%
and to have a more holistic
approach after the iboga

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.130 align:middle line:90%
medicine.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And that is when Exclusive
Ibogaine Retreat was born.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>> I would like to add that the
biggest reason for us to open

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.110 align:middle line:84%
this retreat was the fact that
the iboga retreat that we were

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.180 align:middle line:84%
working at, it was a lot
of people coming in and out

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.030 align:middle line:84%
in a way that it
is like a ghost.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.340 align:middle line:84%
You come in and then
go out, and there

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.060 align:middle line:84%
was no family
connections and vibes

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.190 align:middle line:84%
and feel like you can have that
support with the facilitator.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.250 align:middle line:84%
We felt it was just
like a grocery shopping.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Like a numbers--

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.230 align:middle line:90%
like numbers.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Numbers.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Three to six people
came in per week.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And we felt that people
didn't get enough healing

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.540 align:middle line:90%
and attention.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>> As we only do one or
two clients at a time,

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:34.046 align:middle line:84%
we feel that you can get much
more from the medicine than

00:05:34.046 --> 00:05:35.780 align:middle line:90%
just a quick detox.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And we felt that with
ibogaine especially,

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.980 align:middle line:84%
when it's done in its
natural environment,

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:48.200 align:middle line:84%
in Gabon or Cameroon, it is like
the whole family comes together

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.680 align:middle line:84%
for that one person
and everybody

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.170 align:middle line:84%
assists them to heal
throughout this hard journey

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.700 align:middle line:90%
of self-discovery.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.470 align:middle line:84%
When first, we can
carry this motto

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:06.420 align:middle line:84%
with our retreat to give people
the best that they can have.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I was just telling
my daughter, actually--

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:13.720 align:middle line:84%
she's in King's College and
my son-- my son is in MIT.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.290 align:middle line:84%
So we were chatting
with him on the phone,

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.630 align:middle line:84%
and then I was telling
her-- she did her SATs

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.480 align:middle line:90%
and she got a 1440.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.760 align:middle line:90%
So I told her, you got your IQ--

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.920 align:middle line:90%
you got your IQ from your dad.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.660 align:middle line:84%
That's 100% different
from your mom.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.230 align:middle line:10%
And she said, yeah, Dad, you're
the smartest person I've ever

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.410 align:middle line:10%
met, but you do the
dumbest things I've ever

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.450 align:middle line:10%
seen sometimes, you know?

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:39.870 align:middle line:84%
So you wake up and think, these
are kids that are grown up.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:43.460 align:middle line:10%
And you start looking back
and thinking, you know?

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.150 align:middle line:84%
My son was telling me, why
don't you make a list of people

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.790 align:middle line:90%
and write them all down?

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:49.830 align:middle line:10%
And those people
that you hang around

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.610 align:middle line:10%
with every weekend,
this guy and this guy

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:52.693 align:middle line:10%
and this guy and this guy.

00:06:52.693 --> 00:06:55.230 align:middle line:10%
And if push comes
to shove, would they

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:59.460 align:middle line:10%
be there after the binge and
after your party and what.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.660 align:middle line:84%
>> The fast-paced world is rife
with voyeuristic temptations

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:08.100 align:middle line:84%
that occasionally lure us into
shadowy places where light is

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.990 align:middle line:90%
absent from self.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:15.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Iboga, it's called
Tabernanthe iboga,

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.920 align:middle line:84%
and it's a shrub that grows
in Gabon and Cameroon in West

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:27.420 align:middle line:84%
Africa that was discovered by
the ancient people by going

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:31.500 align:middle line:84%
into the jungle and eating
a porcupine, you know?

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.420 align:middle line:84%
So this person
ate that porcupine

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.400 align:middle line:84%
that ate from the
tree and had this very

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.320 align:middle line:90%
profound truth in him.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And then when they went back
to where the porcupine came,

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.150 align:middle line:90%
they found this plant.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:47.226 align:middle line:84%
So this plant only
grows in that side

00:07:47.226 --> 00:07:49.020 align:middle line:90%
of the world in West Africa.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.540 align:middle line:90%


00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.900 align:middle line:84%
The iboga tree has been
used for thousands of years.

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:58.920 align:middle line:84%
They even discovered
some at the pyramids,

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:03.480 align:middle line:84%
at the pharaohs' tombs,
some of the iboga.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And what the Bwiti tribe used
it for is for initiation.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:13.650 align:middle line:84%
It's to give it to
adolescents and young adults

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:18.000 align:middle line:84%
so they can shed the stories
of the past, the trauma

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.150 align:middle line:84%
of the childhoods and
all that conditioning,

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:25.050 align:middle line:84%
and be their true selves so
they can help the tribe survive.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:28.230 align:middle line:84%
So over thousands of
years, that evolved.

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And then in the
1960s, Howard Lotsof

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:37.289 align:middle line:84%
discovered the iboga as a
treatment for his heroin

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:42.179 align:middle line:84%
addiction by one of his
friends sending him a sample.

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And he says, after 36
hours he was addiction-free

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.840 align:middle line:90%
and he felt great.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's how iboga translated
from a shamanic practice

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.130 align:middle line:90%
into the Western medicine world.

00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:00.790 align:middle line:84%
So after the discovery of
it in the Western world,

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:04.020 align:middle line:84%
it has expanded and
expanded and started

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:09.090 align:middle line:84%
having a major effect on people
as alternative treatments

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.260 align:middle line:90%
for drug addiction.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.770 align:middle line:90%
That's how it started.

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And then with time, people
discovered that it actually

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:19.920 align:middle line:84%
has a lot to do with resetting
the body and the mind

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.940 align:middle line:90%
and the spirit.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:26.533 align:middle line:84%
>> Visibly, I am a novice
to the whole herbal thing.

00:09:26.533 --> 00:09:27.450 align:middle line:90%
I've never tried this.

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:28.800 align:middle line:90%
I've never tried rehab.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.425 align:middle line:84%
I don't really believe
I had any problem.

00:09:31.425 --> 00:09:34.170 align:middle line:10%
I just thought that
became habitual

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:39.540 align:middle line:10%
and I was going down a
lane with the crowd I'm in.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.150 align:middle line:10%
And eventually, you start
realizing that it's not

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:43.810 align:middle line:10%
so easy to come out of it.

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:49.350 align:middle line:84%
But every day you wake up after
your hangover and after a binge

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:51.610 align:middle line:84%
and you start thinking,
I'm better than this.

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:52.660 align:middle line:90%
I want to change.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:54.280 align:middle line:90%
I want to be better.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.160 align:middle line:90%
I want to be better for my kids.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:00.810 align:middle line:10%
And so you start setting your
predetermined moral journey

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:01.870 align:middle line:10%
forward.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:04.960 align:middle line:10%
And then the next weekend, you
drop back into that hole again.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.260 align:middle line:10%
And this is what the
consultant was saying,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:11.610 align:middle line:10%
that if you set your plan
and you go to a rehab,

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:16.200 align:middle line:10%
it's just the mental
talk, the chat,

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.700 align:middle line:10%
and how they can
get you through it.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:21.000 align:middle line:10%
But your body after 20 years
of abuse or 20-something years

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:21.960 align:middle line:10%
has changed.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:22.980 align:middle line:10%
It has altered.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.300 align:middle line:10%
Your receptors have altered.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.010 align:middle line:10%
And then you change
into such a mode

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:28.830 align:middle line:10%
that there's a physical
change in your receptors

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:30.840 align:middle line:10%
that needs to be readjusted.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I think the
chemical ibogaine-- ibogaine

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:38.890 align:middle line:84%
itself comes in and helps you
physically make that change.

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:41.580 align:middle line:10%
So I mean, we have the
mindset that I'd really

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.470 align:middle line:10%
like to get back
to the normal life

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:47.370 align:middle line:10%
where running with the kids
and jogging with the dog is fun

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:52.690 align:middle line:10%
and having a soccer game
in the garden is exciting.

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:54.570 align:middle line:10%
And you can discover
a nice part,

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.070 align:middle line:10%
and watch Netflix
in the evening.

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:59.820 align:middle line:10%
It's OK on a Friday night,
rather than the urge to go out

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.810 align:middle line:10%
and binge and party
with my friends.

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:04.950 align:middle line:10%
So the intention is to get
back to the normal life

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:07.500 align:middle line:10%
that we normally know
before all of this stuff.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.720 align:middle line:10%
And hopefully, I began,
without reset it.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.550 align:middle line:10%
You have to mentally
be prepared for this.

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:13.350 align:middle line:10%
I am.

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:18.930 align:middle line:10%
I've started a pre-detox,
pre-mental disposition

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:22.458 align:middle line:10%
on my own before this.

00:11:22.458 --> 00:11:25.000 align:middle line:10%
And then hopefully, after this
I'll be able to continue that.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.330 align:middle line:90%


00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>> So we use the iboga
Tabernanthe strain, specie,

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:40.980 align:middle line:84%
which is a big shrub of
about two meters tall.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:46.860 align:middle line:84%
Big, shiny leaves with
fruit, orange fruit.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:50.670 align:middle line:84%
The plant needs to be
between 15 to 25 years old

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:56.250 align:middle line:84%
before the roots get the
psychoactive properties.

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:59.210 align:middle line:90%


00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:02.900 align:middle line:84%
People come to us to
use and experience

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:08.310 align:middle line:84%
the iboga journey for
different reasons, which

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:11.280 align:middle line:84%
I would say about a
third of our clients

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:16.500 align:middle line:84%
come for addiction
of illegal drugs.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:22.320 align:middle line:84%
A third of them come to us
for pharmaceutical abuse.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And about a third of
our clients come to us

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:31.320 align:middle line:84%
to lift the anxiety and
depression, suicide, especially

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.140 align:middle line:84%
now in the times
that we are living

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:38.590 align:middle line:84%
in now with the lockdown,
people with severe anxiety,

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:41.790 align:middle line:84%
depression, and
suicidal tendencies.

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:46.650 align:middle line:84%
So that's the different
reasons, psychospiritual reasons

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:53.760 align:middle line:84%
for people that sometimes when
they reach 40 come to realize--

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:56.370 align:middle line:84%
they come to a crossroads
in their lives of,

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:58.350 align:middle line:84%
what have they done
so far in the past,

00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:59.980 align:middle line:90%
and where are they going?

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.680 align:middle line:90%
Are they on the right track?

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.390 align:middle line:90%
Where is my life going?

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:06.110 align:middle line:90%
And they are in turmoil.

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:08.450 align:middle line:84%
So by doing the
iboga journey, you

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:12.500 align:middle line:84%
get the opportunity
to sit with yourself

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:16.800 align:middle line:84%
and let go of everything in your
past that is holding you back,

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.850 align:middle line:84%
everybody that has done you
wrong, that has done you in,

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:23.680 align:middle line:84%
and that you are
keeping grudges against.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>> What we do for them is we
first have a consultation with

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.030 align:middle line:90%
them to make them--

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:33.790 align:middle line:84%
to understand what
is the situation.

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And what is it that
they need help with?

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:40.060 align:middle line:84%
And we usually do
a video interview

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.700 align:middle line:84%
to start building
that trust between us.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And then we ask them to complete
our online application form

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:52.530 align:middle line:84%
and do the certain
tests, which are the--

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:55.120 align:middle line:84%
it's heart tests and
liver test, the kidney

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:59.080 align:middle line:84%
test to make sure
that their body is

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:03.220 align:middle line:84%
able to cope with the detox
that they are going to have.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:07.930 align:middle line:84%
Once they did all the admin
and got the test results,

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:12.220 align:middle line:84%
our doctor will assess
these test results

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:14.500 align:middle line:84%
and see if it's
OK, and what we can

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:20.330 align:middle line:84%
do to make the person
adequate for the treatment.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's our protocol
that way to make people

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.220 align:middle line:84%
understand that this is
a commitment process that

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:30.580 align:middle line:90%
goes on, hence the steps.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And afterwards, we ask
them to do counseling

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.480 align:middle line:90%
with our ibogaine counselor.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.700 align:middle line:84%
She specializes
in helping people

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:43.390 align:middle line:84%
to understand what they
are going to go through.

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And what is it that they need
to work on to get the best out

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:49.090 align:middle line:90%
of their ibogaine treatment?

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:51.670 align:middle line:84%
It is usually between
two and six sessions.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:53.750 align:middle line:90%
It depends on the person.

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And after they've
done the counseling,

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:58.120 align:middle line:84%
we are with them
through that process.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And we speak to them about
it and we get feedback

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.830 align:middle line:84%
from them about it,
and we just keep

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:07.550 align:middle line:84%
building that trust and family
relationships with them.

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:12.680 align:middle line:84%
Before they come, we ask them
to start to detox for at least

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:13.530 align:middle line:90%
a week.

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:15.620 align:middle line:90%
We usually require even longer.

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.040 align:middle line:90%
It depends on the person.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.900 align:middle line:84%
But for a week we send them
guidelines how to eat healthy,

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:28.880 align:middle line:84%
what to drink, what to not
do, to rest, to start putting

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:32.090 align:middle line:84%
your mind and set
of intention on,

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:34.730 align:middle line:84%
what do I want from
this medication?

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:38.940 align:middle line:84%
What is it that I
actually want to be?

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:42.425 align:middle line:84%
And that just helps people
that when they come here,

00:15:42.425 --> 00:15:43.550 align:middle line:90%
they know your faces.

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:44.720 align:middle line:90%
They trust you.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:49.280 align:middle line:84%
They trust the fact that
you are looking after them

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:54.360 align:middle line:84%
and making sure that they get
the best out of this process.

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And then once they come
here, we welcome them and we

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:00.710 align:middle line:90%
have lunch together.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.530 align:middle line:84%
Before the treatment,
there is a little bit

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:06.060 align:middle line:84%
of medical procedures
that we do,

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:10.340 align:middle line:90%
which is a drug test on site.

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And then we also do what they
call a hydration drip, which

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:21.170 align:middle line:84%
is just to give them
a little bit of power

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:23.300 align:middle line:90%
throughout the journey.

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And after that, the drip
is done and the person

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:32.810 align:middle line:84%
feels that it's ready, we
start with the treatment.

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And we go throughout
the night with them

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:40.760 align:middle line:84%
with administering ibogaine
to them on our protocols

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.370 align:middle line:90%
with the help of our paramedic.

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:47.150 align:middle line:84%
>> With the iboga medicine,
it really opens oneself up

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:51.590 align:middle line:84%
to really connect with your
deep subconscious mind.

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:54.560 align:middle line:84%
It's also been
called in the jungle

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:59.900 align:middle line:84%
to break the head open,
to wipe the slate clean.

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:03.440 align:middle line:10%
Very big ego death
to really be stripped

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:09.560 align:middle line:10%
of all cultural conditioning,
trauma, violence, abuse,

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.470 align:middle line:10%
to really be stripped of
what has happened to you

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:16.160 align:middle line:10%
and to really connect with
your own real around your feet

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.670 align:middle line:10%
or voices in your
ear, ultimately

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:24.890 align:middle line:10%
for the person to really fall
in love with themselves again.

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:29.090 align:middle line:10%
>> I embarked on this
journey last night,

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:31.970 align:middle line:10%
and it's still going on now.

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:35.660 align:middle line:10%
And most probably the effect
of this journey should--

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:39.200 align:middle line:10%
the physical effects should
finish by tomorrow morning.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:44.510 align:middle line:10%
It was a mixture full of
waves and ups and downs,

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:45.770 align:middle line:10%
but an amazing--

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:48.350 align:middle line:10%
an amazing night, I would say.

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Flashbacks, memories, dropping
into an abyss, vibrating,

00:17:56.140 --> 00:18:01.120 align:middle line:84%
and then just being awake
within a split second.

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.910 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult
for me to even explain.

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:06.850 align:middle line:10%
It was principally my life--

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:09.290 align:middle line:10%
my life flashing back
all the way from the back

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:12.010 align:middle line:10%
and highlighted
in certain points.

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:14.290 align:middle line:10%
Principally, it's
been a bit hectic

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:19.360 align:middle line:10%
because you have to be up,
but very, very interesting.

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.570 align:middle line:10%
The crazy thing is
in the morning--

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:25.760 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I'm not trying to say
what the final results will be,

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.420 align:middle line:10%
but in the morning
I can actually

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:31.000 align:middle line:10%
see without my glasses.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And principally
sitting in the garden,

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:39.910 align:middle line:84%
you can hear every single
sound, every bird independently

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:41.530 align:middle line:84%
while there are,
like, 20 of them.

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:45.130 align:middle line:10%
So I definitely feel some
improvement in my eyesight

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:49.750 align:middle line:10%
and in my hearing
abilities, but I'm still

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:53.530 align:middle line:10%
a bit hazy and only able to
tell the difference maybe

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:54.585 align:middle line:10%
a day or two.

00:18:54.585 --> 00:18:57.230 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't as tough
physically for me.

00:18:57.230 --> 00:19:01.760 align:middle line:10%
I still managed to
be coherent, and I

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.520 align:middle line:10%
was able to still help myself.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.200 align:middle line:10%
But I mean, the
body's a bit tired.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.440 align:middle line:10%
This is like nonstop
without sleep.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:14.900 align:middle line:10%
So physically, I'm a little
bit drained, but I'm awake.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:18.660 align:middle line:10%
I'm home, so it'll ease off.

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.650 align:middle line:10%
Like Anita said, a
small price to pay.

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:24.980 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, when
she came for last dosing,

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:26.750 align:middle line:90%
I was-- is this the last one?

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:29.288 align:middle line:90%
I started to enjoy the journey.

00:19:29.288 --> 00:19:30.830 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning I
was a bit worried.

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:32.930 align:middle line:10%
It was a bit dark
because you're starting

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:35.120 align:middle line:10%
to be drawn, like
dropping into something

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.160 align:middle line:10%
and then trying to pull out.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:40.190 align:middle line:10%
But eventually, I went with
it and I could feel the wave,

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:44.900 align:middle line:10%
and I was enjoying every moment
of closing your eyes and things

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:47.000 align:middle line:10%
popping up that
you open them again

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.620 align:middle line:10%
and you think of something
else, and the same.

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:52.860 align:middle line:10%
So it felt great.

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:53.660 align:middle line:10%
It was intense.

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:55.040 align:middle line:10%
Definitely, it was intense.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:59.190 align:middle line:10%
Things I never-- were lost
in my mind came back up.

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:02.030 align:middle line:84%
But I think in a
fine way because now

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:05.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking about them,
they don't bother me as much.

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:07.320 align:middle line:90%
They don't bother me as much.

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.960 align:middle line:84%
But it'll be a bit
more time to tell.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:13.885 align:middle line:84%
>> I have to say, this
morning I woke up,

00:20:13.885 --> 00:20:17.560 align:middle line:84%
I was feeling great about
our client, you know?

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.370 align:middle line:90%
He's up.

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:22.030 align:middle line:84%
You see that there's
a lot of peace

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:28.006 align:middle line:84%
in his heart, a lot of
reflection for the future.

00:20:28.006 --> 00:20:31.180 align:middle line:84%
So we decided that we
would go visit and then

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:35.530 align:middle line:84%
have a conversation to see,
what is his thought pattern?

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:40.450 align:middle line:84%
If we felt that he is going
through the old patterns,

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:45.430 align:middle line:84%
we try to change that
by saying something out

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:49.000 align:middle line:84%
of his comfort
zone, which is how

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:55.820 align:middle line:84%
iboga works for us humans, is
to make us think differently.

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:58.840 align:middle line:84%
I have to say, he's
doing very well today.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And because he's
a strong guy, he

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:05.380 align:middle line:84%
was trying to be
brave and go up and be

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:08.890 align:middle line:90%
excited for the world and chat.

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:13.375 align:middle line:84%
But we felt that
he wasn't really--

00:21:13.375 --> 00:21:15.310 align:middle line:90%
it's more about pride.

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:18.610 align:middle line:90%
So we told him, you know, OK.

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:22.360 align:middle line:84%
It's time for you to take
time and go back to bed

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:26.050 align:middle line:84%
and try to think about all of
the stuff that we discussed.

00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:29.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Last night's journey was
a magnificent experience with

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:30.400 align:middle line:90%
our client.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:36.250 align:middle line:84%
He went into very deep process,
relived some of his child life

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:43.690 align:middle line:84%
experiences, and almost had
like a live review this morning

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:47.110 align:middle line:84%
when the sun came up and
the birds were singing.

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:50.080 align:middle line:84%
He was like a child,
bouncing up and down

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.870 align:middle line:84%
with all this excitement
and the deep healing that

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:55.190 align:middle line:84%
has happened and
is still happening.

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's with such
gratitude that I'm

00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.950 align:middle line:84%
living my life
purpose of giving back

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:08.140 align:middle line:84%
to humanity the gift of
self-love, self-actualization,

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:11.650 align:middle line:84%
transformation, and to
give people the opportunity

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:14.560 align:middle line:84%
to really connect with their
true inner selves, who they

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:18.310 align:middle line:84%
really, really are deep
down inside, without filters

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:21.820 align:middle line:90%
and expectations of society.

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:23.770 align:middle line:84%
It's a big
responsibility as well

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:27.830 align:middle line:84%
to be part of people's
transformational process.

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:32.500 align:middle line:84%
But it is with such
a big reward that we

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:36.760 align:middle line:84%
partake in each person's journey
together, from the beginning,

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:39.710 align:middle line:84%
during, and even afterwards
to walk the path together

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:40.510 align:middle line:90%
with them.
