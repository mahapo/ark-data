NARRATOR: Some places
have a feeling about them,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:55.680 align:middle line:84%
a sense in the air, something
that reaches out and grabs you.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.800 align:middle line:84%
From ancient sacred
sites to haunted houses,

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.290 align:middle line:84%
these are significant
places, sometimes lost

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.290 align:middle line:90%
in the mists of time.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Mysterious treasures
waiting to be rediscovered.

Places where ancients
gather, where worlds collide,

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.235 align:middle line:84%

Oh, a lot of people

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.580 align:middle line:84%
died at that time,
a lot of people.

But everywhere, you
can feel it everywhere.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, Matjiesfontein, but for
all these years, all of us

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.420 align:middle line:90%
know if you walk, you can feel.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.800 align:middle line:84%
There is someone next to
you or at the back of you.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.300 align:middle line:90%
You can feel that feeling.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.118 align:middle line:90%
You are not alone.

I am coming from Laingsburg.

I work for the last 21 and a 1/2
years at Matjiesfontein Hotel.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.850 align:middle line:84%
I changed to day shift,
because I see a lot of things

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.332 align:middle line:90%
happen during night shift.

- My name is Johnny.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.100 align:middle line:84%
I was born here in this little
town, and I worked for 36 years

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.340 align:middle line:90%
now here.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.000 align:middle line:84%
My mom worked for
the old Logan family,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.500 align:middle line:84%
and then I started to work for
the Rawdon family for 36 years.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.320 align:middle line:84%
But that was the normal stuff,
climbing trees and playing

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.640 align:middle line:84%
soccer and running around
and follow the ghosts

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.165 align:middle line:84%
in the night and lots
of ghosts in this hotel.

00:03:37.165 --> 00:03:42.190 align:middle line:90%


00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.570 align:middle line:84%
It was a hospital during
the Boer War, 1899-1902.

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And when you walk
up to the mountain,

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.850 align:middle line:84%
you still found the old empty
bullets and [INDISTINCT]

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.710 align:middle line:90%
from the British soldiers.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And then from 1904, they
changed it into a hotel.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.670 align:middle line:84%
So when you sit on the
veranda, rooms, here upstairs,

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.050 align:middle line:84%
and quiet in the night, at about
one o'clock in the morning,

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.120 align:middle line:84%
you can still hear the horses
running and British soldiers

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.670 align:middle line:84%
walk, and it sounds
like people talking.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.540 align:middle line:84%
So the soldiers and the
horses are still running,

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.260 align:middle line:84%
try to fight the Battle
of Matjiesfontein.

LUCIANO HERDER: My name is

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.680 align:middle line:84%
Staff member at the
Lord Merlin hotel.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.350 align:middle line:84%
I've been working here
for almost four years now.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.710 align:middle line:84%
As a little kid,
went here to school,

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.070 align:middle line:84%
went to go finish
school in [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.020 align:middle line:84%
When I started working
here at the hotel,

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.410 align:middle line:84%
that's when my life changed
and everything was always

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:53.280 align:middle line:90%
good to me.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.000 align:middle line:10%
But then I experienced
some things.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
experience, I want

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.060 align:middle line:84%
people to experience themselves,
as I've experienced it.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.960 align:middle line:84%
I've been working
a lot of nights.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.470 align:middle line:90%
So that's when I experience it.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.630 align:middle line:84%
When I'm especially
on nights out there,

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.985 align:middle line:84%
when I'm alone in the bar,
here at 9:00 or past nine,

00:05:10.985 --> 00:05:12.360 align:middle line:84%
when I'm alone in
the bar, then I

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.652 align:middle line:90%
experience a lot of that stuff.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.840 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: The town
of Matjiesfontein

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.460 align:middle line:84%
was founded in 1884 by the
legendary Scottish railwayman,

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.130 align:middle line:90%
James Douglas Logan.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.560 align:middle line:84%
It became established as a
fashionable Victorian health

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.360 align:middle line:90%
spa.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.510 align:middle line:84%
The town itself owes its
existence to the Cape

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.820 align:middle line:84%
government railways,
the railway line

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.430 align:middle line:84%
connecting Cape Town's
port to the diamond

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.680 align:middle line:90%
fields of Kimberley.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.010 align:middle line:84%
Matjiesfontein is a feast
for the imagination,

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.500 align:middle line:84%
as it has a very
colorful history.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.770 align:middle line:10%
During the Anglo-Boer
war Matjiesfontein

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.560 align:middle line:10%
became the headquarters of
the British Cape command

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.780 align:middle line:10%
with some 12,000 troops
camped around the village.

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.070 align:middle line:10%
The Lord Milner Hotel was built
at the end of the 19th century.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.860 align:middle line:84%
The hotel was named
after Lord Alfred Milner,

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.565 align:middle line:84%
who was the governor of the
Cape during the Anglo-Boer war.

00:06:07.565 --> 00:06:10.840 align:middle line:90%


00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.200 align:middle line:84%
During the war, it
was also home to one

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.420 align:middle line:84%
of the British-operated
concentration

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.420 align:middle line:84%
camps that held mainly
women and children,

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.350 align:middle line:84%
since most male prisoners
of war were sent overseas.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:26.940 align:middle line:84%
Many women and children
perished in these camps.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.940 align:middle line:84%
Over the years, this place
has become a hot spot

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.700 align:middle line:84%
for ghost sightings and
other paranormal experiences.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.463 align:middle line:90%


00:06:36.463 --> 00:06:38.130 align:middle line:84%
LUCIANO HERDER: I
heard a lot of stories

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.110 align:middle line:84%
about Matjiesfontein,
and especially

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.030 align:middle line:84%
here at the Lord Milner
Hotel, about ghosts

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:44.160 align:middle line:90%
out walking around there.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.993 align:middle line:84%
And that story that I
didn't want to believe

00:06:45.993 --> 00:06:48.133 align:middle line:90%
until I experienced it myself.

00:06:48.133 --> 00:06:50.598 align:middle line:90%
[EERIE MUSIC]

00:06:50.598 --> 00:07:10.820 align:middle line:90%


00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.210 align:middle line:84%
Like, I've explained
before, I was in the bar.

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:15.920 align:middle line:84%
The TV was on, but
it wasn't loud.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And it just went
louder and louder.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:19.620 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
is there somebody?

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:20.420 align:middle line:90%
I went to go check.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.530 align:middle line:90%
There was nobody.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:25.010 align:middle line:84%
That was my worst
experience that I had.

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.830 align:middle line:84%
When we have functions here,
like weddings, birthday

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:32.390 align:middle line:84%
parties, or anything like that,
then I get a lot of friends

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.400 align:middle line:90%
to help out here in the bar.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Two of my friends have told
me they have experience,

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.760 align:middle line:84%
they saw a ghost
and all of that.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.845 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, where?

00:07:41.845 --> 00:07:43.470 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell me where
did you see them?

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:47.570 align:middle line:84%
He told me, I saw one in the
main building of the hotel,

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:52.310 align:middle line:84%
in a room that is very scary,
that room right in front,

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:53.990 align:middle line:90%
and that is a room 21.

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:56.270 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes you just hear noises.

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And that noises that I
hear, it's not good noises,

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.510 align:middle line:84%
because it's almost like that
person want to speak to you

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:05.060 align:middle line:84%
but you don't know where
is the voice coming from?

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.100 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I'm just feeling
the door, feeling the door.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.530 align:middle line:84%
But when you go to the
door, there's nobody.

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:14.070 align:middle line:84%
Or when you maybe go
to bed, you go to bed

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:18.390 align:middle line:84%
to go sleep, when you wake
up, then your blanket isn't

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:19.240 align:middle line:90%
on the bed anymore.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.040 align:middle line:90%
It's on the ground.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.610 align:middle line:90%
Then you pick it up.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:22.680 align:middle line:90%
You go to sleep again.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Then you experience,
when you wake up,

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.030 align:middle line:90%
my blanket, again, on the floor.

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:30.070 align:middle line:84%
She won't harm you, but she
used to live in that room.

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.870 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:34.950 align:middle line:84%
That's why she always checks
if everything is all right

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:36.120 align:middle line:90%
in the room and all that.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:42.059 align:middle line:90%


00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:44.760 align:middle line:84%
- The last thing,
which I was involved

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:48.630 align:middle line:90%
was with a lady, and a child.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Me and my colleague,
I was writing

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:54.880 align:middle line:90%
our OB book, our security book.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:59.550 align:middle line:84%
It was at about 25
past 11:00 that night.

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And while I was
writing the book,

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:07.560 align:middle line:84%
we heard footsteps
on the red carpet.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And then the colleague
looked into my eyes,

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.140 align:middle line:84%
and he said, Jerry,
do you hear that?

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:15.490 align:middle line:90%
I said, yes.

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, a lady
and this little girl

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:23.450 align:middle line:84%
appeared in the door,
and she asked me,

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:27.250 align:middle line:90%
why is there so big noises?

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:30.010 align:middle line:90%
And I asked them, where?

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:34.240 align:middle line:84%
She said where she was
sleeping, there was noises.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And I said, no, there is
nothing there in the kitchen.

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:43.300 align:middle line:84%
It's only me and the security,
who is now in the hotel.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.580 align:middle line:90%
And then she said, OK.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:49.240 align:middle line:84%
She turned a bit
and go to the room.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And I said to the
security, Lincoln,

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:56.260 align:middle line:84%
we must have a look
there, because there

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.270 align:middle line:90%
is nobody in the hotel.

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:03.490 align:middle line:84%
We go to that room, and we
were standing next to the door.

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Then I said to him,
Lincoln, go and fetch

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.250 align:middle line:90%
the key, the spare key.

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:11.270 align:middle line:90%
And the key was there.

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:15.470 align:middle line:84%
We opened the door, and there
was nothing in the room.

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:18.830 align:middle line:84%

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.810 align:middle line:90%


00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:42.490 align:middle line:84%
You hear a breath,
and adrenaline

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:45.410 align:middle line:90%
rushes through your veins.

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:48.110 align:middle line:84%
Fear is often our
natural reaction

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:50.750 align:middle line:90%
when our senses fail us.

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:52.990 align:middle line:84%
It is hard to control
when it grabs you.

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:55.760 align:middle line:90%


00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes entities
appear as apparitions

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:02.350 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes they are sensed.

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:05.470 align:middle line:84%
There are also reports
of entities crossing over

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:09.430 align:middle line:90%
and making physical contact.

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:14.580 align:middle line:84%
Some report a pressure
holding them down.

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.220 align:middle line:84%
The fact is that there
are countless reports

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:20.910 align:middle line:84%
of experiences with ghosts
that cannot be denied.

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:24.630 align:middle line:84%
Some entities are friendly
and others are more hostile.

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:28.800 align:middle line:84%
Either way, it is hard to
argue that ghosts in some form

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:29.895 align:middle line:90%
do not exist.

00:22:29.895 --> 00:22:34.340 align:middle line:90%


00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Are we walking this
path alone, or are we

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:42.130 align:middle line:84%
walking alongside our ancestors,
like so many cultures believe?

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:45.040 align:middle line:10%
And who else is here?

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.790 align:middle line:10%
