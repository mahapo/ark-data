numbers.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And when I remember
writing the numbers one

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.180 align:middle line:84%
through nine as a small child,
I remember thinking five

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.140 align:middle line:90%
is so blue.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.030 align:middle line:84%
I have such an affection
for number five.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.130 align:middle line:90%
It was so round and friendly.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.950 align:middle line:84%
Eight is green and nine is
warm, like orange or red.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that
was everybody.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.990 align:middle line:84%
I thought everybody had
an affection for numbers

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.960 align:middle line:84%
and had a color associated
with a number, a taste,

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.800 align:middle line:90%
even a smell.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.760 align:middle line:84%
Some numbers have
a smell for me.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
I wasn't alone,

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.490 align:middle line:84%
but it wasn't as
common as I thought.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.180 align:middle line:84%
I remember looking at
numbers with fond affection,

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.510 align:middle line:84%
simply because we have
phone numbers, we have ages,

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.090 align:middle line:84%
we age, and we have
a number that we

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.650 align:middle line:90%
own each year of our life.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.410 align:middle line:10%
And every time I
met a new person,

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.410 align:middle line:10%
I'd ask them either what
their phone number was,

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.702 align:middle line:10%
where they lived, what number
on the street they lived.

00:02:29.702 --> 00:02:31.790 align:middle line:84%
I would play with
numbers in the traffic,

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.100 align:middle line:90%
in terms of your number plates.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And I just so enjoyed
messing around with numbers,

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.530 align:middle line:84%
subtracting them,
adding them, and seeing

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.820 align:middle line:90%
what other numbers came up.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And what I learned to
do quite organically

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.340 align:middle line:84%
is I'd take a big number like
15, and I'd add one and five

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.210 align:middle line:90%
and get six.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And then I would hold
onto that number,

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.010 align:middle line:84%
and that number would be
how I would remember 15

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.910 align:middle line:90%
in a sequence.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And I became really good
at remembering long number

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:56.630 align:middle line:90%
sequences.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.670 align:middle line:84%
So phone numbers
became simple for me.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.220 align:middle line:84%
Every single person
I met, I would

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.540 align:middle line:90%
memorize their phone number.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.310 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, today we
don't need to do that,

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.500 align:middle line:84%
because we have cell phones
that do it all for us.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.034 align:middle line:84%
But I really, really enjoyed
testing my brain on that level.

The more I grew in
affection for numbers,

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.250 align:middle line:84%
the more I realized that I
had an intuitive connection

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.300 align:middle line:90%
to each number.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And I understood from
some of my readings

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.910 align:middle line:84%
that the universe
hangs in lawful balance

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.390 align:middle line:84%
against the number nine, and
all numbers reduced to nine.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.580 align:middle line:90%
And that really excited me.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.120 align:middle line:84%
It made me look deeper into
the meaning of each number.

looking at everybody

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.250 align:middle line:84%
their birthdays, the
year they were born.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And I started looking
at systems that

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.693 align:middle line:84%
would help me read
people more effectively

00:05:00.693 --> 00:05:01.610 align:middle line:90%
through their numbers.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And today, I'm super

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:10.860 align:middle line:90%
as I put it.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.010 align:middle line:84%
Everyone needs
mediation, and everybody

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.410 align:middle line:84%
looks for guidance
somewhere along the line.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that numbers
can give you insight

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.410 align:middle line:84%
into the way you experience
the world and a fairly

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.210 align:middle line:90%
objective approach, actually.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.880 align:middle line:84%
So I find numbers
nonprescriptive.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.380 align:middle line:90%
It's not about fortune telling.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.140 align:middle line:84%
It's more about knowing
and looking at yourself

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.010 align:middle line:84%
and seeing how you
show up in the world,

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.330 align:middle line:84%
so that you can best use your
numbers to your advantage

My name is Rob.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:57.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm 52 years old, and recently,
I made some major life changes.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.070 align:middle line:10%
So I thought I'd
come today and maybe

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.965 align:middle line:10%
get some guidance with the
changes that I've made.

00:06:02.965 --> 00:06:06.180 align:middle line:90%


00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.850 align:middle line:84%
When I had my numbers done
before, a friend of mine

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.460 align:middle line:84%
did it for me, but she didn't
really go into much depth.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.130 align:middle line:84%
So I thought today,
especially having

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.730 align:middle line:84%
made these changes in my life
that maybe we can get some more

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:21.450 align:middle line:84%
depth and some guidance
having made these changes

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.210 align:middle line:84%

to read somebody new's numbers.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.110 align:middle line:84%
A total stranger,
somebody you love--

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.210 align:middle line:84%
just to be able to use
numbers as a system,

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:39.630 align:middle line:90%
an objective system.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I love so
much about number systems,

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:46.190 align:middle line:84%
because they're able to
help you navigate so much

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.440 align:middle line:84%
emotional terrain that
sometimes you don't want

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.020 align:middle line:90%
to burden anybody else with.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.520 align:middle line:84%
Just by looking at
the numbers, you

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.660 align:middle line:84%
have tools to look at
things more abstractly,

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.560 align:middle line:84%
and in that way, we can deal
with very emotional topics

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.760 align:middle line:90%
and very deep topics.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.760 align:middle line:90%


00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.110 align:middle line:84%
So I found numbers super
healing in my life.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And for those that I
speak to and consult with,

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.400 align:middle line:84%
in terms of mediating how
they step into the world.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.810 align:middle line:84%
Because numbers,
they're nonprescriptive.

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:20.930 align:middle line:84%
They don't delineate how
you're to do your next step.

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.600 align:middle line:10%
They simply give
you a set of tools

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.510 align:middle line:10%
to make better and more
informed decisions about how

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.695 align:middle line:10%

your future or your fortune.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm really just
looking at numbers

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:15.640 align:middle line:84%
to assist you with your

it from someone else just

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:32.770 align:middle line:90%
makes the difference, right?

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:34.539 align:middle line:84%
So off the bat, I'm
looking at this,

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:36.340 align:middle line:84%
and I'm saying, OK,
so you're a complex.

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.605 align:middle line:90%
You're a complex eight.

00:08:38.605 --> 00:08:40.315 align:middle line:90%
17 adds up to 8.

00:08:40.315 --> 00:08:41.409 align:middle line:90%
1 and 7 is 8.

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:43.210 align:middle line:90%
So that's your you number.

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And the system that I'm
using today is Dan Millman.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.820 align:middle line:84%
So I love the Dan Millman system
because each of these numbers

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:49.820 align:middle line:90%
mean something.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And we read them in
relation to each other.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And we also read them
in relation to the year

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.208 align:middle line:84%
that you're having,
next year, and in

00:08:59.208 --> 00:09:00.250 align:middle line:90%
relation to other people.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:03.650 align:middle line:90%


00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:05.660 align:middle line:84%
So really, you're
a complex eight.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.340 align:middle line:84%
You'd have a raw
eight in the month.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.510 align:middle line:84%
You would have the 8th
of March, for example.

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:11.135 align:middle line:84%
You'd have the 18th
of March, and you'd

00:09:11.135 --> 00:09:12.350 align:middle line:90%
have the 26th of March.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:16.700 align:middle line:84%
So you are the 17th, making
you a fairly complex eight,

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.220 align:middle line:90%
made up of a one and a seven.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:22.310 align:middle line:84%
So one stands for
origination and creativity

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:25.610 align:middle line:84%
and profound confidence
and oration, so speaking.

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:29.450 align:middle line:84%
So actually, there's an
aspect of authority there.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:30.500 align:middle line:90%
You like to be the boss.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.167 align:middle line:84%
You would prefer not
to work for others.

00:09:32.167 --> 00:09:33.320 align:middle line:90%
You'd prefer to work alone.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.450 align:middle line:84%
That's one aspect
of who you are.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.340 align:middle line:90%
The seven is trust and openness.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.470 align:middle line:84%
So you actually face
the world with a sense

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:43.405 align:middle line:84%
of trust and openness, which can
get you into trouble at times.

00:09:43.405 --> 00:09:45.560 align:middle line:84%
OK, so there's a
sweetness to seven

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.520 align:middle line:84%
but also a profound journey,
primarily spiritual journey.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.160 align:middle line:84%
Actually, seven is associated
with spiritual learning,

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.500 align:middle line:84%
spiritual understanding,
and growth

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.790 align:middle line:84%
on a spiritual
journey of some kind.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:58.640 align:middle line:90%
So you're eight up top.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.920 align:middle line:84%
Innately, eight stands
for abundance and power.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.470 align:middle line:84%
So if you know that
about yourself,

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:07.560 align:middle line:84%
you can say, oh, I step into
today in abundance and power.

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And if we divide it up into
your one and your seven,

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:14.360 align:middle line:84%
you can say, all right, how do
I offer my experience in my one

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.470 align:middle line:90%
and seven?

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:18.570 align:middle line:84%
How do I make
meaning out of today,

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.260 align:middle line:84%
which is the spiritual depth
that comes from your seven?

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.525 align:middle line:90%
The three is your family number.

00:10:23.525 --> 00:10:28.970 align:middle line:90%


00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:32.280 align:middle line:84%
So this looks like a typical
star of David or a Magen David.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.660 align:middle line:84%
So we're doing your
archetypal numbers and then

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:37.250 align:middle line:84%
your shadow numbers
at the same time,

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:39.440 align:middle line:84%
because all numbers
reduce to nine.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.160 align:middle line:84%
So when I look at this system of
three in your family quadrant,

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.960 align:middle line:84%
I say what adds up
to nine with three?

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:46.760 align:middle line:90%
Six.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.010 align:middle line:90%
So six is the shadow number, OK?

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:53.810 align:middle line:84%
So in your family space, I know
that if six is in the shadow,

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:56.630 align:middle line:84%
six stands for vision
and acceptance and also

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:58.290 align:middle line:90%
family responsibility.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.620 align:middle line:84%
So I know you have a lot
of family responsibility

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:01.970 align:middle line:90%
already, OK?

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:04.460 align:middle line:84%
The three, however,
in a family space

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.540 align:middle line:90%
is expression and sensitivity.

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.050 align:middle line:84%
So that's how you show
up in your family.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:11.570 align:middle line:84%
You express yourself and
you're not must be heard.

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:13.370 align:middle line:90%
You don't like to not be heard.

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And you have a great
depth of sensitivity

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:19.180 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to the people
you love, and the lack thereof,

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:19.980 align:middle line:90%
at times.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.032 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody
really upsets you,

00:11:22.032 --> 00:11:23.240 align:middle line:90%
you can just switch them off.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.910 align:middle line:84%
So the three is a
passionate expressive.

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:28.610 align:middle line:84%
It's throw a plate on
the floor if I'm angry.

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:31.080 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:37.996 align:middle line:90%


00:11:37.996 --> 00:11:39.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.040 align:middle line:84%
In the world, we
add one and nine

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.690 align:middle line:84%
is 10, plus 6 to 16,
which is 7 plus 9 is

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:47.886 align:middle line:90%
16, which is the seven.

00:11:47.886 --> 00:11:49.510 align:middle line:90%
Seven plus what gives us nine?

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:50.310 align:middle line:90%
Two.

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:51.900 align:middle line:90%
So you have two in the shadow.

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.270 align:middle line:90%
So your world number is a seven.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:57.540 align:middle line:84%
So you show up in the world
in trust and openness.

00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:59.430 align:middle line:84%
Remember, seven,
we've established,

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:01.500 align:middle line:84%
is the number of
trust and openness,

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.280 align:middle line:84%
according to Dan
Millman's system.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.960 align:middle line:84%
So this tells me you need to
go into the world with more

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.040 align:middle line:90%
caution.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:11.340 align:middle line:84%
You need to watch your security,
your personal security.

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:12.610 align:middle line:90%
You need to watch your back.

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:14.400 align:middle line:90%
You need to be vigilant, OK?

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.670 align:middle line:84%
So these things are
interesting, because a seven

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.630 align:middle line:90%
has eyes on them.

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:22.260 align:middle line:84%
So you need to be
aware of that, OK?

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.180 align:middle line:84%
A seven also makes a
difference in the world.

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:25.860 align:middle line:90%
They like humanitarian causes.

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:27.210 align:middle line:90%
They like to give back.

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:29.700 align:middle line:90%
They have a soft spot, OK?

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.080 align:middle line:90%
They are softies, actually.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.310 align:middle line:90%
They're deep softies.

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:35.550 align:middle line:84%
They're also often accused
of being secretive,

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:37.470 align:middle line:84%
when actually they just
have some things that

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:38.610 align:middle line:90%
are sacred to them.

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:39.870 align:middle line:90%
Some things are just for you.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:41.100 align:middle line:90%
They're your tabernacle.

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.870 align:middle line:90%
Nobody must trespass.

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:44.700 align:middle line:90%
Trespassers will die, you know?

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.665 align:middle line:84%
So that's the interesting
part about a seven.

00:12:46.665 --> 00:12:51.580 align:middle line:90%


00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.210 align:middle line:90%
So let's do one more thing.

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:55.300 align:middle line:90%
Let's say 2022.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:13:00.760 align:middle line:84%
What's your year number on
the 17th of the third, 2022.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.350 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
what number year?

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:03.433 align:middle line:90%
So we add it all together.

00:13:03.433 --> 00:13:08.270 align:middle line:84%
We go 1 and 7 is 8,
plus 3 is 11, plus 2.

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:09.070 align:middle line:90%
>> 13.

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:10.610 align:middle line:90%
>> 13 plus 4.

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:11.410 align:middle line:90%
>> 17.

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:12.210 align:middle line:90%
>> 17.

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:13.090 align:middle line:90%
So 1 and 7 is 8.

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:16.880 align:middle line:84%
OK, at your birthday, you
click into a year eight cycle.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.040 align:middle line:84%
So you've been in a year
seven cycle this year,

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.880 align:middle line:84%
which will tell me that you've
actually had a need to rest

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.340 align:middle line:90%
and recover and recoup.

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Seven is a year of
rest and recovery.

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:29.680 align:middle line:84%
As much as it stands
for trust and openness,

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:34.450 align:middle line:84%
it's acknowledging that you need
time to take that sabbatical,

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:38.230 align:middle line:84%
that Sabbath, that moment,
just to restore yourself, OK?

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:39.670 align:middle line:90%
So it's a restorative year.

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:42.370 align:middle line:84%
Two years ago, I lost
sight in this eye,

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:43.660 align:middle line:90%
and then I broke my hip.

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:47.020 align:middle line:84%
So it was two years,
really, of hell.

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.360 align:middle line:90%
And then I moved down here.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:53.725 align:middle line:84%
And the last year has very
much been just to regroup.

00:13:53.725 --> 00:13:54.525 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:54.525 --> 00:13:56.380 align:middle line:90%
Restore.

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:57.712 align:middle line:90%
>> Restore, yeah.

00:13:57.712 --> 00:14:00.172 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:00.172 --> 00:14:10.020 align:middle line:90%


00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>> When you hit eight, you're
going to look at things like

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:13.560 align:middle line:90%
endings and beginnings.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.870 align:middle line:84%
You're going to look at
what's coming to an end

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:17.760 align:middle line:90%
and what's newly starting.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.670 align:middle line:84%
But you're also going to look
at financial opportunities.

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:23.040 align:middle line:84%
So eight's always about
abundance and power

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.060 align:middle line:90%
in the pocket.

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:25.350 align:middle line:90%
Power in the pocket--

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:26.320 align:middle line:90%
big deal.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:30.630 align:middle line:84%
We need to know that in a year
eight, we make some big cash.

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:32.708 align:middle line:84%
Invariably, people make
big cash in year eight.

00:14:32.708 --> 00:14:34.500 align:middle line:84%
In year nine, they
really enjoy the spoils,

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.210 align:middle line:84%
and then you start
a new chapter.

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:39.480 align:middle line:84%
So you're either at a place
in your own career trajectory

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.790 align:middle line:84%
where you've already
planted all the seeds

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:44.940 align:middle line:84%
and now you're
starting to reap what

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.770 align:middle line:90%
you've sown in a year eight.

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:50.190 align:middle line:84%
Or a nice financial
opportunity comes your way

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:51.510 align:middle line:90%
after your birthday.

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:53.460 align:middle line:90%
So you can coast till March.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:54.480 align:middle line:90%
Restore yourself.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.860 align:middle line:90%
Recover as much as you can.

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:57.450 align:middle line:90%
Take those long beach walks.

00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:59.370 align:middle line:84%
But by the time
your birthday comes,

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:01.320 align:middle line:84%
you're in a new financial
cycle, and you're

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.760 align:middle line:90%
looking for opportunity.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:07.230 align:middle line:90%


00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:11.970 align:middle line:84%
So 8 plus 3 plus 7 is
10 plus 8 is 18, right?

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:14.115 align:middle line:90%
And 18 makes a 9.

00:15:14.115 --> 00:15:15.300 align:middle line:90%
1 plus 8 is 9.

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:16.530 align:middle line:90%
You're a core nine.

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:20.280 align:middle line:84%
So I know instantly, a core
nine with these numbers

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:23.850 align:middle line:84%
around your nine, you
are innately empathic.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:26.280 align:middle line:84%
So you might need
to protect yourself

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:29.460 align:middle line:84%
from narcissistic type
energies-- people who

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:31.445 align:middle line:90%
want a lot of praise.

00:15:31.445 --> 00:15:32.820 align:middle line:84%
What we would also
do is we would

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.980 align:middle line:84%
say, from a physical
point of view,

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.350 align:middle line:84%
what's the best way to
help your physical body?

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:39.717 align:middle line:84%
Because this is a lot of
metaphysics happening here.

00:15:39.717 --> 00:15:41.800 align:middle line:84%
We look at your number,
and it's a complex number.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.092 align:middle line:84%
So we say the biggest number
minus the smallest number.

00:15:44.092 --> 00:15:46.860 align:middle line:90%
We say a 7 minus 1 is a 6.

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:51.150 align:middle line:84%
A six, the best way that they
recover their physical body

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:53.173 align:middle line:90%
is contact with others.

00:15:53.173 --> 00:15:54.840 align:middle line:84%
So for you, it's
actually very important

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.730 align:middle line:90%
to force socialization.

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:57.720 align:middle line:90%
Go and socialize.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:01.030 align:middle line:84%
Go and have a
drink with someone.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And I can understand why
while you were recovering,

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.020 align:middle line:84%
you needed to put all your
energy to your recovery.

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:07.978 align:middle line:84%
But now it's time to
get back out there.

00:16:07.978 --> 00:16:09.520 align:middle line:84%
You've got three
months, and then you

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:10.645 align:middle line:90%
need to get back out there.

00:16:10.645 --> 00:16:12.430 align:middle line:84%
Part of your
moneymaking experience

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:13.840 align:middle line:90%
is about socializing.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:16.400 align:middle line:84%
So there's people you're
going to meet in 2022.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.275 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:16:17.275 --> 00:16:20.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, completely.

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:24.520 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's, in a nutshell,
a Dan Millman quick read.

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:25.320 align:middle line:90%
Ponder on that.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.580 align:middle line:84%
If you've got any
questions, feel

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.260 align:middle line:84%
free to phone me at
some stage and just

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:29.760 align:middle line:84%
chat to me about
what you've learned

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:34.570 align:middle line:84%
and what you might be doing
with yourself after March,

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:35.370 align:middle line:90%
after March.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:36.703 align:middle line:90%
You've got a little grace there.

00:16:36.703 --> 00:16:39.080 align:middle line:90%
Just a little grace, so indulge.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.860 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.690 align:middle line:90%
>> This is-- it's mind blowing.

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:44.131 align:middle line:90%

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.570 align:middle line:84%
So reading Robbie's
numbers was super

00:16:54.570 --> 00:17:00.510 align:middle line:84%
fulfilling, because I could see,
as he related to his numbers,

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:05.307 align:middle line:84%
him take a new step forward
in his own outlook of himself.

00:17:05.307 --> 00:17:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the
power behind numbers.

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:10.180 align:middle line:84%
Is it's a way of identifying
yourself in the world,

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:12.119 align:middle line:84%
and it's also a way of
helping you experience

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:13.560 align:middle line:90%
the world in a richer way.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:17.819 align:middle line:84%
And reading Robbie
was just a lot of fun.

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:20.718 align:middle line:84%
And I can see he's going
to take those numbers

00:17:20.718 --> 00:17:23.550 align:middle line:84%
and really take them to heart,
especially the quick read

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:26.280 align:middle line:84%
we did with Dan Millman,
where he's a 36, 9.

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.520 align:middle line:84%
He can live in his 36
and express himself more,

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:33.180 align:middle line:84%
exercise more sensitivity, and
really check in with himself.

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:34.620 align:middle line:84%
Or he can live in
his nine, where

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:36.900 align:middle line:84%
he exercises wisdom
and integrity

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:40.140 align:middle line:84%
in his daily experience and
acknowledging his talents more

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:40.980 align:middle line:90%
rigorously.

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And that self-awareness, to be
conscious of the unconscious,

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:45.990 align:middle line:84%
when someone else
mediates for you,

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:47.970 align:middle line:90%
is the power behind numbers.

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:50.970 align:middle line:84%
So for example, for
Robbie, in 2022,

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:54.300 align:middle line:84%
he's stepping into a year
eight after his birthday, which

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:58.110 align:middle line:84%
suggests that he's going to step
into his abundance and power

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:00.390 align:middle line:90%
and possibly make a ton of cash.

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:01.800 align:middle line:90%
Ever hopeful.

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.250 align:middle line:84%
He's also going to enjoy
putting some things to bed,

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:07.630 align:middle line:84%
closing chapters, and
opening new things.

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:09.600 align:middle line:84%
So having some new
beginnings in his life

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.970 align:middle line:84%
might be just the thing
he needs, especially

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.310 align:middle line:84%
given that he had a few
sixes in his triangle, which

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:16.124 align:middle line:90%
was the social aspect.

>> This whole experience
for me was mind blowing.

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:37.280 align:middle line:84%
There were so many things that
I knew but had almost forgotten

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:41.960 align:middle line:84%
about the way I look at life,
the way I approach things.

Having listened to
what she had to say,

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:48.980 align:middle line:84%
I can readjust and
sort of get back

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:53.900 align:middle line:84%
onto maybe a solid footing,
so the way I approach things

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:58.160 align:middle line:84%
and how to approach
the future, knowing

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.130 align:middle line:84%
what she's told me
about myself and how

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:02.510 align:middle line:90%
to interact with others.

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Even though I sort
of intrinsically

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:09.950 align:middle line:84%

how I view things.

>> A Dan Millman quick
read, in terms of numbers,

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.840 align:middle line:10%
is a super skill to
have in your pocket,

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.790 align:middle line:10%
because when you
newly meet somebody,

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:35.510 align:middle line:10%
you can know quickly what
they are, in a nutshell,

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:37.760 align:middle line:10%
in terms of how they operate
in the world and how they

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.700 align:middle line:10%
experience the world and what
their innate talents are,

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:44.360 align:middle line:10%
just by doing a number
reduction from their birthday.

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And that, for me, has
been an invaluable tool.

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:47.960 align:middle line:84%
It's certainly not
a prescription,

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.980 align:middle line:84%
and it's certainly not something
that you can walk around

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:55.490 align:middle line:90%
and essentialize people over.

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:58.130 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of the
day, those numbers

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:00.860 align:middle line:84%
become a vehicle
and an entry point

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.840 align:middle line:84%
into knowing a person's
talent set and skill set

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:06.680 align:middle line:84%
so that off the bat there they
can head off into the world

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:09.590 align:middle line:84%
and use those numbers
and their various tools

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:12.320 align:middle line:90%
to their advantage.

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:16.770 align:middle line:84%
When we read numbers in
concert with other numbers,

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:20.900 align:middle line:84%
we glean great insight as to
how they pertain to our lives

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:25.430 align:middle line:84%
or how they can offer
us insight into how

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:26.910 align:middle line:90%
we experience the world.

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:30.080 align:middle line:84%
So when we look at numbers
in relation to one another

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.510 align:middle line:84%
in our own readings,
our own number charts,

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:37.550 align:middle line:84%
we see how our tool kits become
so visceral and available to us

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:39.530 align:middle line:84%
and that makes the
world of difference.

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:41.750 align:middle line:84%
Being able to say
I operate my three,

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:45.470 align:middle line:84%
means I operate in expression
and creativity and sensitivity.

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:47.810 align:middle line:84%
Or I operate my
seven, which is I

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:50.030 align:middle line:84%
step into the world
with trust and openness.

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:51.800 align:middle line:84%
If you were to
operate your five,

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.960 align:middle line:84%
for example, if you were
a core five, perhaps,

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.670 align:middle line:84%
in a Dan Millman
reading, you would

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:59.420 align:middle line:84%
need to operate in a balance
of discipline and freedom.

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.580 align:middle line:84%
You need enough discipline
to have enough freedom.

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:03.560 align:middle line:84%
So your fives
often need to dance

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.900 align:middle line:90%
between those two sentiments.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:09.770 align:middle line:84%
So numbers harness
sentiments that

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:14.750 align:middle line:84%
often give us insight into how
we operate within the world,

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:17.090 align:middle line:84%
and that, for me,
is so refreshing.
