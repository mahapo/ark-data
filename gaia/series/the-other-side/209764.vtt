who dance between the realms

That's how I choose
to call myself.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And monk because
I'm still learning.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.765 align:middle line:90%
The master is a breath itself.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.050 align:middle line:84%
A poet and Indian
mystic called Kabir,

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.350 align:middle line:84%
said "God is in the
breath within the breath."

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.250 align:middle line:10%
So there's so much to learn
although I'm a specialist

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.520 align:middle line:10%
and I've been doing breath
work every morning consistently

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.550 align:middle line:10%
for at least 45 minutes
to an hour and a half.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes the second
and third time in the day.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And although I've been
doing it consistently

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.590 align:middle line:84%
for 3 and 1/2 years, and
have been doing breath work

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.450 align:middle line:90%
since the age of 12, actually--

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.490 align:middle line:84%
I asked my buddies to come
have a friendly competition.

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.380 align:middle line:84%
Filled a bucket of
water, and so who

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.840 align:middle line:84%
could keep our head under
water for the longest.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And I did that remarkably
longer than the rest.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.900 align:middle line:84%
So some 40 years later, I'm
now a breath specialist,

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.325 align:middle line:90%
and that's kind of called me.

00:02:27.325 --> 00:02:31.810 align:middle line:90%


00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Then about 23 years ago,
I changed my lifestyle.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.290 align:middle line:84%
I used to be in
front of the camera.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.550 align:middle line:84%
I used to be a model and did
some really amazing work.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And then I felt it didn't serve
me to promote product that's

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.370 align:middle line:84%
more commercially driven, so I
changed my lifestyle totally.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.450 align:middle line:90%
I went to India.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.690 align:middle line:84%
I did a meditation
retreat for 10 days

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.250 align:middle line:90%
after 10 days of being there.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.050 align:middle line:84%
20 days later, I did my
second meditation retreat.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.850 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.290 align:middle line:84%
Because I was hungry to develop
myself to be more fulfilled,

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.560 align:middle line:84%
peaceful, centered,
and purpose-driven.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And 23 years later, I'm so
grateful that along the way,

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.960 align:middle line:84%
I've picked up more meditative
and mindfulness techniques

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.190 align:middle line:84%
to bring into a
centerfold of breathwork.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Conscious breathing is the
direct awareness of breath.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Our breathing is controlled
consciously or unconsciously.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.080 align:middle line:84%

a breath session with Gigh

He's been a client of mine.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.210 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing transformational
coaching with him,

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.340 align:middle line:84%
and I've been doing
breath classes with him.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.440 align:middle line:84%
So the session is going to be
at an incredible setting that's

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.240 align:middle line:90%
world class.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.340 align:middle line:84%
So we're in Plettenberg
Bay, South Africa.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And the studio is called
The Space Between,

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.230 align:middle line:90%
and it's between land and ocean.

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.320 align:middle line:84%
It's on the cliff
and it's got fynbos--

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.730 align:middle line:90%
our local vegetation.

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.690 align:middle line:84%
So this also enhances the
energy we have from the air

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:05.590 align:middle line:90%
that we breathe.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And we're doing it at sunrise,
which is a most optimal time.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Traffic and human
activity is down to almost

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.020 align:middle line:84%
none when we're doing it at
sunrise, and that's around 5:15

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.820 align:middle line:90%
in the morning.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And we live in an area
where there's pretty much

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.780 align:middle line:84%
no pollution because we
live with nature, surrounded

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:23.580 align:middle line:90%
by nature.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And typically, if one's
practicing between 4 and 6

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.470 align:middle line:84%
in the morning, it's that window
that many spiritual practices,

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.570 align:middle line:84%
including yoga, says that
it's a gateway for just a very

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.010 align:middle line:84%
high resonance of connecting
very deeply with a most

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.300 align:middle line:90%
powerful energy--

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.290 align:middle line:90%
4 to 6 in the morning.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.350 align:middle line:84%
So I'm glad we're catching our
session at sunrise tomorrow.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.320 align:middle line:90%

I did a course
called Art of Living

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.850 align:middle line:84%
that my mom sent me to on
my birthday a few years ago.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And I found the routine
that they were doing,

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.290 align:middle line:84%
it was really awesome
and energizing,

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.530 align:middle line:90%
and I kept doing that.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.685 align:middle line:84%
It makes the mind so awake
and the body so relaxed

00:05:06.685 --> 00:05:11.550 align:middle line:84%
that you enter the states,
similar to psychedelic state,

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.810 align:middle line:84%
where your mind is
creating things that--

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.930 align:middle line:84%
I had this six-month
period once where

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.310 align:middle line:84%
like after my
breathing sessions,

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.630 align:middle line:84%
I would lie down and start
visualizing people that I know

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.780 align:middle line:84%
and connecting this
white line to them.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.943 align:middle line:84%
And it had like the
most profound effects.

00:05:27.943 --> 00:05:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Like just people would
call me out of the blue

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.693 align:middle line:84%
and tell me what a great
day they're having.

00:05:31.693 --> 00:05:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like that if the real
connection sort of disappeared

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.930 align:middle line:84%
and came back and I guess it
kind of goes in waves in life.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.370 align:middle line:90%
Then I came here to Pletts.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.150 align:middle line:84%
I met some lady on the beach
because my dog knew her dog.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And she connected
me to these groups

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.080 align:middle line:84%
with all these healers on
them, and somebody sent me

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.420 align:middle line:84%
images of Pletts, and I was
like, yeah, that's what I need.

Been out of my
breathwork for a while

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.370 align:middle line:90%

just shake it off.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And I feel when
we do more release

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.950 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning of
the session, then

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:43.440 align:middle line:84%

a deeper breath in, and feel

That's it.

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:44.610 align:middle line:84%
So a key significant
reason why this works

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:48.990 align:middle line:84%
is that the nervous system, our
emotions, and breath are all

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:51.940 align:middle line:90%
interdependent, interrelated.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.420 align:middle line:84%
So when we do breathwork and
we bring mindfulness into it,

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.740 align:middle line:84%
we bring emotion into it, and
we bring some body action,

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.520 align:middle line:84%
then we come with so
many domains of how

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.410 align:middle line:84%
we can shift, how
we can transform,

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:07.560 align:middle line:84%
how we can transmute
energy, and be more settled

irritation, doubt, unsettled
about some situation,

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:40.090 align:middle line:84%
the first part of it is,
after awareness, we release

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:41.650 align:middle line:90%
that which does not serve us.

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:44.560 align:middle line:84%
So we lighten up,
we are more primed

so that we can use energy and
build more on that energy.

body movement and breathing.

Then keeping the chin
more parallel, which

is more challenging, but

up through the spine.

about breathwork is that it

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:41.600 align:middle line:84%

And then breathing
in, we're going

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:21.560 align:middle line:84%
to go through the nostrils,

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.405 align:middle line:84%
