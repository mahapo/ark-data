00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.180 align:middle line:84%
>> The holistic world of healing
includes plants and herbs

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.200 align:middle line:84%
channeling energy as well as
both spiritual and physical

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.910 align:middle line:90%
modalities.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Healers are
multi-dimensional beings

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.490 align:middle line:84%
who dance between the realms
of the seen and unseen.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.590 align:middle line:84%
These individuals
have the ability

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.670 align:middle line:84%
to facilitate a shift in
people, offering them insight

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.250 align:middle line:84%
and support, reconnecting people
with themselves and the greater

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.680 align:middle line:84%
collective, healing the
world one person at a time--

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.825 align:middle line:90%
healing from the other side.

00:01:19.825 --> 00:01:32.900 align:middle line:90%


00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.590 align:middle line:84%
>> The planets are like
lenses which focus the light

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.960 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness as it descends
into the earthly realm.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And so at any given
moment, those lenses

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.970 align:middle line:90%
are in a unique configuration.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And if you catch that moment
and draw a chart for it,

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.970 align:middle line:84%
you've got a map
of consciousness.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.470 align:middle line:90%


00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm Rod Suskin.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:58.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm an astrologer.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And I have been an astrologer
for about 30 years.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.139 align:middle line:10%
An astrologer these days is
someone who basically consults

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:10.630 align:middle line:10%
with people on a
one-to-one basis,

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.850 align:middle line:10%
a little bit like a
psychologist or a lawyer

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.770 align:middle line:10%
might do in a private interview.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.010 align:middle line:10%
And we use that space to
give people understanding

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.000 align:middle line:10%
of themselves, guidance about
what's going on in their lives,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.190 align:middle line:10%
and a little bit about
the future as well.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm also an African
diviner and healer,

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.550 align:middle line:84%
which we call a
"sangoma" over here,

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.620 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes use my
astrological skills as a form

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.315 align:middle line:90%
of divination for that as well.

00:02:37.315 --> 00:02:43.160 align:middle line:90%


00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.420 align:middle line:84%
I was actually drawn to
astrology at a very young age,

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.790 align:middle line:90%
when I was 10 or 11 years old.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember
why, but I definitely

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.680 align:middle line:90%
knew about my own star sign.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And I went on a little trip
with my uncle and aunt,

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.250 align:middle line:84%
and they bumped into
a friend of theirs who

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.250 align:middle line:84%
was drawing astrological
charts, these wheels,

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.790 align:middle line:84%
and I started asking a million
questions about what that is.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And he told me what
book to buy, and I did.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And from 11 years old, I
started drawing charts,

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.960 align:middle line:84%
and it just seemed to me the
most logical, obvious thing

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.120 align:middle line:84%
to eventually just do
with the rest of my life.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.880 align:middle line:90%


00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.590 align:middle line:84%
If you understand the
regularity and repeatability

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.130 align:middle line:84%
of how nature works, and if
you understand that we are part

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.000 align:middle line:84%
of that nature, then you gain
the power of predictability,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.040 align:middle line:84%
then you can predict
the outcomes.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.200 align:middle line:84%
It's really what we do
with all our sciences.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.250 align:middle line:84%
We use past knowledge to
predict the future outcome.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And astrology is an early model
of the human experience linking

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.870 align:middle line:84%
us to the bigger cosmos,
which does exactly that.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.410 align:middle line:90%


00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Astrology is an ancient
practice that claims to discern

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.600 align:middle line:84%
information about human
affairs and terrestrial events

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.200 align:middle line:84%
by studying the movement and
relative position of stars

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.370 align:middle line:90%
and planets.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Many cultures have
attached great importance

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.660 align:middle line:84%
to astrological events and have
spent centuries studying them.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.550 align:middle line:84%
For many people
around the world,

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.860 align:middle line:84%
there is comfort
and encouragement

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.680 align:middle line:84%
in uncovering the
mysteries of the universe

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.340 align:middle line:84%
and the cosmic guidance it
provides, offering people

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.770 align:middle line:84%
insights and tools
that can assist

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.920 align:middle line:84%
them to achieve their dreams and
reach their highest potential.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.470 align:middle line:90%


00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm going to be reading
the charts for Marina.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And reading a chart really means
looking at that map of the sky

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.070 align:middle line:84%
and understanding the
positions of all the planets

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.990 align:middle line:84%
and the relationships
between them.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And the knowledge of
astrology shows us exactly

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.390 align:middle line:84%
then where in their
various cycles

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.790 align:middle line:84%
they are, how are they
relating to each other,

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.700 align:middle line:84%
and that describes what
we could conveniently call

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.440 align:middle line:90%
the karma of the individual.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.180 align:middle line:84%
In the same way that if someone
drew a map of your human genome

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.540 align:middle line:84%
at the moment of your birth,
it contains the information

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.327 align:middle line:84%
about your entire
life and the future.

00:05:12.327 --> 00:05:13.660 align:middle line:90%
It's all there at the beginning.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And the geneticist could
perhaps come along and say

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.190 align:middle line:90%
you definitely have blue eyes.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.530 align:middle line:84%
You're likely to
have that illness--

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.930 align:middle line:84%
greater likelihood,
lesser likelihood.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And with that knowledge, you
understand your parameters,

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.390 align:middle line:84%
and you can even make some
lifestyle changes that perhaps

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:29.545 align:middle line:90%
might avoid that illness.

00:05:29.545 --> 00:05:31.640 align:middle line:90%
Astrology works the same way.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a model that
says, from this map,

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.350 align:middle line:84%
we all-- everything is
there at the beginning,

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.780 align:middle line:84%
and you can describe the
unfolding of the life.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.440 align:middle line:84%
So I will do that
with Marina's chart

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.170 align:middle line:84%
and be able to give
her-- it's like a mirror

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.550 align:middle line:90%
to reflect herself.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.740 align:middle line:84%
A lot of it is, of course,
familiar for adults.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And by gaining that objectivity,
just like in a regular mirror,

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.200 align:middle line:90%
we can take control.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And so a chart
works the same way.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.620 align:middle line:90%
It works like a mirror--

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.320 align:middle line:84%
lets her see herself
more objectively

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.070 align:middle line:84%
and then, in times of choice
and decision or what's going on,

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.455 align:middle line:84%
can usually make a better
decision or choice.

00:06:05.455 --> 00:06:12.300 align:middle line:90%


00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.880 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Marina Rossa.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm from Italy, and I've arrived
in Cape Town eight years ago.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.920 align:middle line:84%
So I am a video game
translator from Italy.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.720 align:middle line:84%
I translate video
games from English

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.060 align:middle line:84%
into Italian, which
is a lot of fun.

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And I grew up in
the north of Italy.

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:30.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm the only child--

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.180 align:middle line:84%
loving parents, very
different from each other.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:40.110 align:middle line:84%
My dad is very hardworking,
super ethical, pragmatic man

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.050 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't believe
in anything spiritual.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.615 align:middle line:90%
He's very grounded.

00:06:44.615 --> 00:06:46.470 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't speak much.

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.710 align:middle line:10%
My mom, she's a totally
hippie-- musician,

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.630 align:middle line:10%
believes in pretty
much everything.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:55.170 align:middle line:84%
She will be the one to sew a
little medallions of saints

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:58.570 align:middle line:84%
into my clothing before I go
on a journey to keep me safe.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:01.140 align:middle line:84%
So growing up with
these two differences

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.440 align:middle line:84%
made me quite confused
but at the same time quite

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.020 align:middle line:90%
open-minded.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.880 align:middle line:84%
In Italy, astrology
is really popular.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.780 align:middle line:84%
So, actually, we'll have
the news during lunchtime,

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.420 align:middle line:84%
and there is always the
nationally appointed

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.980 align:middle line:90%
astrologer.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, I remember
growing up looking

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.390 align:middle line:84%
at this astrologer on
national television,

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.520 align:middle line:84%
and he just never
seemed to get it right.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.980 align:middle line:90%
He seemed like a bit of a fraud.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And, yes, I never
quite believed him.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.860 align:middle line:84%
Nothing ever happened
that he said will happen.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.892 align:middle line:84%
And everything he
said was very generic.

00:07:33.892 --> 00:07:35.350 align:middle line:84%
It could have
applied to everybody,

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:37.230 align:middle line:90%
so I never quite believed.

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And when I left Italy
for my traveling,

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.930 align:middle line:84%
I went traveling
for seven years.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't quite
know where I fit.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.010 align:middle line:90%
I was quite cynical.

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:48.600 align:middle line:90%
I didn't believe in nothing.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.270 align:middle line:84%
But during my travels,
I've seen some things,

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:55.300 align:middle line:84%
and I felt some things that
made me doubt everything.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:08:00.180 align:middle line:84%
So now I am more open-minded
about everything.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.960 align:middle line:84%
So pretty much my current
view is I don't deny anything

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.670 align:middle line:90%
and I don't believe in anything.

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:08.100 align:middle line:84%
You'd say maybe I'm
agnostic, even when

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.990 align:middle line:90%
it comes to astrology.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:11.470 align:middle line:90%
But I'm very curious about it.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:12.670 align:middle line:90%
I know it's a science.

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:15.450 align:middle line:84%
It's a proper art with a
lot of knowledge involved.

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:19.140 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to
check it out and see

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:22.800 align:middle line:84%
how it goes in this session
with this very famous astrologer

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.020 align:middle line:90%
that everybody is talking about.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:28.650 align:middle line:84%
I just want to see what he
gets right with me giving out

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.540 align:middle line:90%
as little as possible.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.549 align:middle line:90%
Because I'm willing to believe.

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:33.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm open.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.385 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to see
how good is this guy.

00:08:35.385 --> 00:08:39.380 align:middle line:90%


00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.230 align:middle line:84%
So I do believe that
we are connected,

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.240 align:middle line:90%
and we all come from energy.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.530 align:middle line:90%
We're made of energy.

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:47.320 align:middle line:84%
So why shouldn't
the planet alignment

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.650 align:middle line:84%
and the date of our birth
not influence our lives?

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:51.850 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it does.

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:53.420 align:middle line:84%
So I'm curious to
see how it goes.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:54.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Marina.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:54.565 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:08:54.565 --> 00:08:55.090 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Rod.

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:55.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:56.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Please come inside.

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:57.681 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Throughout most
of its history,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.570 align:middle line:84%
astrology was considered a
scholarly tradition and was

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:18.210 align:middle line:84%
common in academic circles,
often in close relation with

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:22.020 align:middle line:84%
astronomy, alchemy,
meteorology, and medicine.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:26.250 align:middle line:90%


00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:30.720 align:middle line:84%
Advocates have defined astrology
as a symbolic language, an art

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.880 align:middle line:84%
form, a science, and a
method of divination.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.810 align:middle line:90%


00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:41.560 align:middle line:84%
With the information given,
you can test your compatibility

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.780 align:middle line:84%
and find out how
your love and work

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:48.170 align:middle line:84%
relationships rank with your
partner, colleagues, friends,

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:49.270 align:middle line:90%
and family.

With this information,

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.220 align:middle line:84%
can unveil the meaning
behind their past, present,

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.020 align:middle line:90%
and future.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:59.240 align:middle line:90%


00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.950 align:middle line:84%
It is astrologers that make this
information available to us.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:06.775 align:middle line:84%
They are the stewards and
conduits of the stars.

00:10:06.775 --> 00:10:10.120 align:middle line:90%


00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.780 align:middle line:84%
>> So, Marina, what we
have here is what we call

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.160 align:middle line:90%
your astrological chart.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.340 align:middle line:84%
It's literally a map of the sky
at the time that you were born.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:22.735 align:middle line:84%
And from that, I can tell you
various potentials and so on.

00:10:22.735 --> 00:10:24.110 align:middle line:84%
The interesting
thing, of course,

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:26.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have
to reveal your age.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:29.030 align:middle line:84%
Because to me it's
interesting, of course,

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:33.670 align:middle line:84%
that you're 41 because 41 is
the time that people generally

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:36.280 align:middle line:84%
come to see astrologers
because there

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:40.040 align:middle line:84%
are many changes beginning to
happen in life at that time.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.310 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things we
astrologers are looking at

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.270 align:middle line:90%
is cycles of life.

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most important
periods of change in our cycles

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:52.720 align:middle line:84%
is the period from
about 41 to 44,

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.690 align:middle line:84%
which the previous generation
called the mid-life crisis,

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:58.480 align:middle line:84%
because perhaps in
those days you couldn't

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.890 align:middle line:90%
change your life at that age.

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:01.810 align:middle line:90%
It was much more fixed.

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose of the chart is
to give you a bit of a mirror

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:07.400 align:middle line:84%
as to some of that
identity as well.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.880 align:middle line:90%
So it just helps you see--

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.360 align:middle line:84%
remember who I am,
what I love, what is

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.160 align:middle line:90%
the important stuff about me.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:21.080 align:middle line:90%


00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.960 align:middle line:84%
So your rising sign
is the sign Capricorn.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.300 align:middle line:84%
People who first
meet you will see

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.700 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the qualities
that come with Capricorn.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And so Capricorn is a person who
is very together in themselves.

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:36.380 align:middle line:84%
They're usually
quite independent.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.480 align:middle line:84%
They're very much in
charge of their own lives.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And usually, since
they are small,

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.530 align:middle line:90%
they're a lot like an adult.

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:44.120 align:middle line:84%
They seem to know
what they want--

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.460 align:middle line:84%
adults call them
precocious because they're

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.320 align:middle line:90%
talk and behave like adults--

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.290 align:middle line:84%
and are kind of
self-contained to the point

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:54.500 align:middle line:84%
that it could be
even a disadvantage.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:58.670 align:middle line:84%
Because people will always
assume Marina's fine.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:59.840 align:middle line:90%
She's in control.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.190 align:middle line:90%
She's got it under control.

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:02.360 align:middle line:90%
She's fine.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And Scorpion mixed
with Capricorn

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:08.210 align:middle line:84%
won't easily show when
there's a problem.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:10.070 align:middle line:84%
She will act like
everything's fine,

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:11.780 align:middle line:84%
so no one ever
offers you any help.

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.280 align:middle line:84%
They're like, no,
no, she's fine.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.500 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it has its advantages.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:19.220 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you went
to work in my shop,

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:21.770 align:middle line:84%
by the end of the first day,
I will leave you with the keys

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:22.700 align:middle line:90%
because I know I can trust you.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:23.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, depend a lot.

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.080 align:middle line:84%
>> You will get done
what you need to be done.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:25.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it's fine.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:26.760 align:middle line:90%
We can trust you.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.810 align:middle line:84%
So letting go is
the Scorpio lesson

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:32.840 align:middle line:84%
that works a little bit
with that Capricorn thing.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.750 align:middle line:84%
But there is something that's
misunderstood about Scorpio

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:38.090 align:middle line:84%
that I'd like to
clear up for you.

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:42.530 align:middle line:84%
People always describe
Scorpio as the scorpion--

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:45.200 align:middle line:84%
that dangerous, little insect
that everyone's afraid of.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say, Scorpio is
going to sting in the tail.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.760 align:middle line:84%
You know, that
isn't what Scorpio.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.760 align:middle line:84%
The constellation of stars
looks like a scorpion.

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:56.570 align:middle line:84%
But in astrology, Scorpio
has always been an eagle.

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And an Eagle is this
animal that flies

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:02.900 align:middle line:84%
above the rest of the world
in order to see its prey.

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.570 align:middle line:84%
It can see a little mouse
from a great distance because

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:07.100 align:middle line:84%
of the special
eyes that it's got.

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.270 align:middle line:84%
That means it
needs to be higher.

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:11.600 align:middle line:84%
So Scorpio will often
feel a little bit

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.410 align:middle line:90%
separated from everything else.

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:15.920 align:middle line:84%
So even when you're
taking part, even when

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.870 align:middle line:84%
these are people that
you know, there's

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:19.870 align:middle line:84%
a part of you that will
always feel as if you're

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:21.290 align:middle line:90%
slightly outside watching this.

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:23.060 align:middle line:84%
What does allow
us in your chart--

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.890 align:middle line:84%
and I do know this
about you anyway,

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:26.630 align:middle line:84%
but it's very much
in your chart--

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:30.260 align:middle line:84%
is traveling to the point
that, with your chart,

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.140 align:middle line:84%
I would worry that
you might never stop.

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.480 align:middle line:84%
You might never actually
settle somewhere.

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.495 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a little
bit of a discomfort in you

00:13:38.495 --> 00:13:40.370 align:middle line:84%
that says-- it's like
a restlessness-- that's

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:41.900 align:middle line:84%
the discomfort I
mean-- that needs

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.340 align:middle line:90%
you to see the next place.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.710 align:middle line:90%
Your moon sign is Gemini.

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:47.330 align:middle line:90%
So Gemini is a moon sign.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:50.360 align:middle line:84%
First, it gives you a
great deal of adaptability,

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:54.680 align:middle line:84%
especially to different
places because the moon

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.210 align:middle line:90%
loves new spaces.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And with the moon in
Gemini, any new place

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.980 align:middle line:84%
is interesting and
exciting to you.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:02.480 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
what it is or what

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.647 align:middle line:90%
it looks like, you're there.

00:14:03.647 --> 00:14:08.150 align:middle line:90%


00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:10.340 align:middle line:84%
In terms of your profession,
the other problem

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:13.040 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to
have is that there

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:19.670 align:middle line:84%
isn't an ideal university or
institution that can train you.

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:21.860 align:middle line:84%
There isn't a right
degree for you even.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.260 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you wanted to
go and study at a university,

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.120 align:middle line:90%
they don't have that yet.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:29.840 align:middle line:84%
So it's that you were
going to-- in the end,

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.340 align:middle line:84%
it's going to have
to come from you.

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:32.570 align:middle line:90%
You're the innovator.

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:35.090 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have to be
the teacher or something.

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:35.960 align:middle line:90%
>> No, that is true.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.580 align:middle line:84%
I've been self-trained
all my life.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.845 align:middle line:84%
I tried university,
failed spectacularly.

00:14:39.845 --> 00:14:41.360 align:middle line:90%
It didn't work for me.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm just looking at
how much money are you

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:45.680 align:middle line:90%
going to make out of that.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.230 align:middle line:84%
You have got the ability to
make money as long as you're

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:49.670 align:middle line:90%
generating it yourself.

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:53.120 align:middle line:84%
Salaries won't get you many,
other people's promises.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Even if you gave your money
to someone else to invest,

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:58.040 align:middle line:90%
I would say do not go there.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.150 align:middle line:90%
>> No, 100% true.

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:02.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Any resources in other
people's hands will not work

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:02.810 align:middle line:90%
for you.

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:04.010 align:middle line:90%
>> It's true.

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:07.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Same also goes for
marrying a rich man.

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:08.990 align:middle line:90%
You're the rich person.

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:10.940 align:middle line:84%
You know it's going
to come from you,

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.370 align:middle line:84%
not going to come from
them in any kind of way.

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.500 align:middle line:90%
>> I want me a househusband.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, that's a very good--

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.260 align:middle line:90%
you can be a power.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.927 align:middle line:84%
You can tell him
what's going to happen.

00:15:19.927 --> 00:15:22.640 align:middle line:84%
You can be in charge
of financial resources.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:27.480 align:middle line:90%


00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.200 align:middle line:84%
It's important then to find
the right kind of people

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.400 align:middle line:90%
to support you.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.740 align:middle line:84%
In terms of friends
and social group,

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:37.400 align:middle line:84%
that kind of social group, other
group, it's very easy for you

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.300 align:middle line:90%
to achieve your goals.

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.750 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we ain't
seen nothing yet.

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And since you're
only 41, big time,

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.960 align:middle line:84%
because in the next two or three
years, a lot of changes happen.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:53.115 align:middle line:90%


00:15:53.115 --> 00:15:54.740 align:middle line:84%
In your case, just
by the way, the moon

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:58.440 align:middle line:84%
is also connected to health
and says don't smoke.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.240 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>> So the health area of
your chart is the lungs.

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:06.770 align:middle line:84%
So for you, smoking would
be especially dangerous,

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:09.890 align:middle line:84%
and pranayama or any
breathing exercises

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:11.690 align:middle line:90%
would be especially healthy.

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:15.320 align:middle line:84%
You can control your health
from breathing, from--

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.780 align:middle line:84%
that's quite a clear
area of your chart,

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:20.450 align:middle line:84%
but it's got that
sensitivity of the moon,

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:22.140 align:middle line:84%
picking up on other
people's stuff.

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And as I say, if you were
to damage your lungs,

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:26.202 align:middle line:84%
then you're asking
for your own trouble.

00:16:26.202 --> 00:16:27.410 align:middle line:90%
>> It does run in the family.

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:29.670 align:middle line:84%
My grandpa, my
father, drugs problem.

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:30.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes, so no smoking.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.655 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
that you say

00:16:32.655 --> 00:16:35.510 align:middle line:84%
that because the moon
is also one of the two

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:38.060 align:middle line:90%
genetic planets in astrology.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:39.890 align:middle line:84%
The moon and Saturn
are the two planets

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:41.635 align:middle line:90%
of childhood, and so our genes.

00:16:41.635 --> 00:16:43.010 align:middle line:10%
So that's why it's
not surprising

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:45.260 align:middle line:10%
that you have that
in your family.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:46.400 align:middle line:90%
So so far, so good.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.840 align:middle line:90%
You're on the track to there.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.640 align:middle line:84%
You're going in the
right direction.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:53.090 align:middle line:84%
But as it becomes necessary
for you to do something more,

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:56.090 align:middle line:84%
you'll remember, my thing
is to fulfill the promise--

00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:59.540 align:middle line:84%
the way I honor my ancestors
for what it's worth because we

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:01.370 align:middle line:84%
don't really know
what they were up to--

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:05.310 align:middle line:84%
is I do what I say and I
fulfill what I put my mind to.

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And in the end,
you're the good proof

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.890 align:middle line:84%
of why it's so good to
have a chart at birth.

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:11.630 align:middle line:90%
Your nature is to succeed.

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:12.819 align:middle line:90%
The rest is up to you.

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:18.970 align:middle line:90%


00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:20.760 align:middle line:84%
It was really great
seeing Marina's chart.

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:24.690 align:middle line:84%
In many ways, she's the
ideal astrologist's client.

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:26.880 align:middle line:84%
Firstly, she was
exactly the right age

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.410 align:middle line:90%
to be seeing an astrologer.

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And what's important about
that and I think why astrology

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.950 align:middle line:84%
is important,
astrology shows people

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:38.940 align:middle line:84%
when things are appropriate--
our life cycles,

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:40.500 align:middle line:90%
when things are changing.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And in astrology, we
recognize that a lot

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:45.600 align:middle line:90%
is changing at around 41 to 43.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:51.120 align:middle line:84%
So Marina is the perfect
age to need those changes,

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.030 align:middle line:84%
to recognize them
coming, and so to relate

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:55.800 align:middle line:84%
at that level to what
I was talking about,

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.450 align:middle line:84%
to recognize what I
was talking about.

00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:03.860 align:middle line:90%


00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:05.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Rod really put me at ease.

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:07.940 align:middle line:90%
He was very warm, very prepared.

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.820 align:middle line:10%
And, yes, definitely, he was
spot-on on most of the things

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:14.930 align:middle line:10%
he told me about my personality,
about the way I achieve things

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:18.140 align:middle line:10%
in life, what works
for me, what doesn't.

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And mostly, I'm very excited
about the few coming years

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.790 align:middle line:84%
because everything he told me
sounds really, really good.

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:31.310 align:middle line:84%
So it's mostly good news and
just pretty much he reinforced.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:33.330 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes you have
doubts about who you are,

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:35.030 align:middle line:10%
if you're doing things right.

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:38.240 align:middle line:10%
But he actually talked
to me about my flaws

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:41.090 align:middle line:10%
like they were strengths,
and I really loved that.

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:44.260 align:middle line:90%


00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:47.770 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have any
expectation at all.

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:51.310 align:middle line:84%
I just decided to do it
because it's a new experience.

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:55.330 align:middle line:10%
And I'm walking away
with a newfound respect,

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:58.790 align:middle line:10%
I think, for this, and
I've learned a lot.

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:00.980 align:middle line:90%
So, yes, I was really positive.

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.770 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sure it will help.

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:05.390 align:middle line:84%
It's always great
to see yourself

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:07.370 align:middle line:90%
through somebody else's eyes.

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:10.250 align:middle line:84%
I will definitely recommend
a session with Rod.

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:12.770 align:middle line:84%
So anybody that is a little
bit in doubt or maybe

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:15.350 align:middle line:84%
in a transition time,
sometimes you just

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:17.270 align:middle line:84%
need to hear
something to reinforce

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:19.730 align:middle line:90%
or resolve to go for it.

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:22.290 align:middle line:90%
And he's very diplomatic.

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:25.130 align:middle line:84%
He's got a very nice way
to give you all the info.

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:27.470 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, I will
definitely recommend.

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:30.950 align:middle line:84%
My stance is I
still wouldn't say

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:34.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm a firm believer, just
because I don't know enough

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:35.430 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:36.890 align:middle line:90%
But I'm definitely curious.

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:39.290 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm going to do
some research on my own

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:43.040 align:middle line:84%
and look into this because
it is really fascinating.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:49.740 align:middle line:90%


00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:54.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Given its antiquity
of over 2,000 years old,

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:58.290 align:middle line:84%
astrology comes from a time
where they had a much richer

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:01.500 align:middle line:84%
definition of fate-- or
what we also call karma,

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:02.830 align:middle line:90%
and they probably did too--

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:07.260 align:middle line:84%
and that is that to simplify
it, one third of things

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:11.100 align:middle line:84%
are fated and unchangeable,
one third of things

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:14.220 align:middle line:84%
are changeable with difficulty,
and one third of things

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:15.720 align:middle line:90%
are changeable with ease.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:19.170 align:middle line:84%
So the astrologer's
job is to direct people

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:21.420 align:middle line:84%
towards those things
which are changeable

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:24.030 align:middle line:84%
and encourage them as to
how they can be changed

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:26.730 align:middle line:84%
and, with the things
that are unchangeable,

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:29.820 align:middle line:84%
to encourage them to accept
this is how it is, so

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:31.590 align:middle line:90%
work within those parameters.

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:35.320 align:middle line:90%


00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:38.080 align:middle line:84%
So as much as
astrologers are trying

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.985 align:middle line:90%
to help people make choices--

00:20:40.985 --> 00:20:42.610 align:middle line:84%
because the idea of
astrology is if you

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:44.590 align:middle line:84%
understand where
this is heading,

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:46.600 align:middle line:90%
you can make better choices--

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.000 align:middle line:84%
despite that, people
will ask the flat-out,

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.050 align:middle line:90%
predictive questions.

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:51.610 align:middle line:90%
When am I getting married?

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:55.060 align:middle line:84%
The most common question
often asked by females.

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:58.240 align:middle line:90%
And what is my purpose in life?

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.400 align:middle line:90%
Everyone asks that question.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And I find myself having to
explain that purpose itself

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.130 align:middle line:84%
is a little fake, the
idea that everyone's

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:07.630 align:middle line:90%
got a special purpose.

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:11.740 align:middle line:84%
Our purpose is to be who we
are as best as we possibly can,

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:14.230 align:middle line:84%
and astrology can help
you see who that is.
