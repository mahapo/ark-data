>> The holistic world of healing
includes plants and herbs,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.890 align:middle line:84%
channeling energy as well as
both spiritual and physical

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.610 align:middle line:90%
modalities.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Healers are
multi-dimensional beings

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:59.100 align:middle line:84%
who dance between the realms
of the seen and unseen.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.280 align:middle line:84%
These individuals
have the ability

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.340 align:middle line:84%
to facilitate a shift
in people, offering

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.200 align:middle line:90%
them insight and support.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.940 align:middle line:84%
Reconnecting people with
themselves and the greater

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.750 align:middle line:90%
collective.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.190 align:middle line:84%
Healing the world
one person at a time.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.470 align:middle line:90%
Healing from the other side.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:38.400 align:middle line:90%


00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.120 align:middle line:84%
>> I had a prophetic dream where
all four of my grandparents

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.140 align:middle line:90%
came to me.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And my grandmother, who I was
closest to, stepped forward.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And she was just
this being of light.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And she said to me, if
you start meditating,

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.770 align:middle line:90%
you will see the angels.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.420 align:middle line:84%
At that point, I was a very
strong agnostic atheist.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.270 align:middle line:84%
But I knew the power
of dreams and the power

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.650 align:middle line:90%
of subconscious messages.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.350 align:middle line:84%
I had studied psychology
when I was much younger.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.865 align:middle line:90%
And I followed the message.

00:02:05.865 --> 00:02:15.670 align:middle line:90%


00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.040 align:middle line:90%
I sought out Reiki for myself.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.530 align:middle line:10%
And during a three-month
period called

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.720 align:middle line:10%
Anattā it was like a
spiritual death and rebirth,

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.170 align:middle line:10%
the vision came to
me to take on Reiki

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.790 align:middle line:10%
and the healing
modalities myself.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And it progressed to the
point of life coaching

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.550 align:middle line:84%
and hypnotherapy, where I
could bring all my modalities

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.230 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Evolution coach is a
broad term for someone

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.200 align:middle line:84%
who helps people move through
their different phases of life,

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.170 align:middle line:90%
different traumas or issues.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Even the opportunity
to evolve themselves,

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.210 align:middle line:84%
to develop themselves
spiritually.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.390 align:middle line:84%
So the modalities that
I use, primarily it's

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.190 align:middle line:84%
life coaching,
which pulls together

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.880 align:middle line:84%
all the other modalities as
it creates a structure for you

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.750 align:middle line:84%
to diagnose and identify
where the person needs help.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And from there, I
choose from the range

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.190 align:middle line:84%
of modalities for them to use
for their particular session.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.960 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to today
probably be using Reiki

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.010 align:middle line:90%
and hypnotherapy.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.200 align:middle line:90%
I do them in combination.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.690 align:middle line:84%
The Reiki is the channeling
of life force or life

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.350 align:middle line:84%
energy into a person who
needs healing or just

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.310 align:middle line:90%
development in a certain area.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And the hypnotherapy is very
similar to a guided meditation

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.230 align:middle line:84%
where the person is taken
into a trance state.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And from there, I pass
on certain messages,

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.080 align:middle line:84%
deliver certain messages
into the subconscious.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And it is messages
that they have chosen.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Hypnotherapy and Reiki are
healing techniques that have

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.940 align:middle line:90%
been around for decades.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.270 align:middle line:84%
Reiki was developed
in the 1920s in Japan

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.100 align:middle line:90%
as a spiritual practice.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And there are many references
to trance and hypnosis

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.320 align:middle line:90%
in early writings.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Around the world,
more and more people

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.680 align:middle line:84%
are opening up to alternative
healing methods and modalities,

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.100 align:middle line:84%
looking for holistic ways
to approach their issues.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.130 align:middle line:84%
Turning to coaches
like Natalie to enhance

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.990 align:middle line:84%
various areas of their lives and
start the process of healing.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.052 align:middle line:84%
>> For the evolution coaching,
the beginning of the session is

00:04:15.052 --> 00:04:16.260 align:middle line:90%
always talking to the client.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.050 align:middle line:84%
So that could take anything
from 30 minutes to an hour,

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:23.150 align:middle line:84%
depending on how deep the
issue is residing within them.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.300 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes clients need a
little bit longer to open up.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And there's a number of
questions and techniques

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.810 align:middle line:84%
that I can use to get to what
the core of the issue is.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.240 align:middle line:84%
We always want to be going
to what the cause is,

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.202 align:middle line:90%
not to treat the symptoms.

00:04:37.202 --> 00:04:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
difference, I feel,

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.400 align:middle line:84%
with the traditional modern
medicine and these more

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.110 align:middle line:84%
holistic healing
modalities, is that we

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.140 align:middle line:84%
go to what the core of the
issue is and start unraveling it

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.960 align:middle line:90%
from there.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.260 align:middle line:84%
So once we've unraveled
that, then it's

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.310 align:middle line:84%
a matter of choosing
which modality works.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.820 align:middle line:84%
So if there's a limiting
belief pattern going on,

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.610 align:middle line:84%
then I will tend more towards
neurolinguistic programming,

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.260 align:middle line:90%
where we will pick that apart.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.840 align:middle line:84%
If the person is struggling with
the decision making process,

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.190 align:middle line:84%
for example, we'll do a
dissociative little process

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.250 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.800 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, if they
just need healing,

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.380 align:middle line:84%
if there's difficulty or
pain, then definitely Reiki

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.040 align:middle line:84%
hypnotherapy is where
I would move it.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.540 align:middle line:84%
So depending on the person,
each person has their own issues

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.330 align:middle line:84%
and has their own unraveling
to do and healing to do.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And once I've got a better idea
of what's actually going on

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.210 align:middle line:84%
for them, then it's easier to
choose a modality to go into.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.360 align:middle line:84%
Today, I'm going to be working
with a lady named Roulla.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.870 align:middle line:90%
I have not met her yet.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk to
her for a little while,

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.990 align:middle line:84%
get an understanding of
actually what's going on.

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully dig a
little deeper, see

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.250 align:middle line:84%
if we can get to the
underlying issue there.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.220 align:middle line:84%
I feel that Reiki and
hypnotherapy will be the best

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.580 align:middle line:84%
modality for today,
because it's really precise

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.260 align:middle line:84%
and it's quite easy to focus
in on a particular issue.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And the results are
usually quite rapid.

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's sort of
easy to actually see

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.450 align:middle line:84%
a difference between the
before and the after.

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.290 align:middle line:84%
So it's quite a powerful
modality to use.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Coming up on The Other
Side, we meet Roulla,

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.080 align:middle line:84%
a woman struggling to
find energy, drive,

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.830 align:middle line:84%
and purpose after two
years of being unemployed.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.715 align:middle line:84%
Join us as we follow her on
her journey to the other side.

00:06:19.715 --> 00:06:28.080 align:middle line:90%


00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>> There are things
I want to do.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.630 align:middle line:84%
Just not the drive to
get them done anymore.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.510 align:middle line:84%
I think maybe it's
energy that's gone.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:41.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Some people see spirituality
as a way to communicate with

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.810 align:middle line:90%
lost loved ones or ancestors.

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Others like Roulla see
it as an opportunity

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.510 align:middle line:84%
to delve inwards and
reconnect with themselves.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.510 align:middle line:84%
To guide those open to
it back onto their path

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.550 align:middle line:90%
and into the light.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.693 align:middle line:84%
>> Bit of an exciting day
for me today, actually.

00:06:56.693 --> 00:06:58.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be meeting
up with Natalie.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.010 align:middle line:84%
She's got quite a range of
skills that are really, really

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:04.240 align:middle line:90%
intriguing, to be honest.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm not good at
looking after myself.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.462 align:middle line:90%
I'm a bit of an ostrich.

00:07:08.462 --> 00:07:10.420 align:middle line:84%
I stick my head in the
sand and hope everything

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.500 align:middle line:90%
goes away and sorts itself out.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.580 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to be, I think,
quite a good experience to see

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.670 align:middle line:90%
what she thinks will help me.

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:24.550 align:middle line:84%
It's been a tough
couple of years.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.370 align:middle line:84%
I haven't worked
since February 2020.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And of course, with
COVID kicking in,

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:31.760 align:middle line:90%
I haven't been able to work.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm a travel agent.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm very pressure driven.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.960 align:middle line:84%
So the last two years have been
really strange in that there's

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.700 align:middle line:90%
been no pressure at all.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.150 align:middle line:90%
I can't read anymore.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.810 align:middle line:84%
I used to be a
really big reader.

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:46.460 align:middle line:90%
Six, seven books a week.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And I can't pick up a
book anymore, which is--

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.200 align:middle line:90%
it's a frightening thing for me.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.470 align:middle line:90%
And honestly, motivation's gone.

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:56.300 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot
of new interests.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, not new
interests, but things

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.560 align:middle line:84%
that I've been delving
into in the last two years

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.120 align:middle line:90%
that I haven't been able to.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:07.850 align:middle line:84%
I've worked pretty much
since I was 17 all the time.

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:10.340 align:middle line:84%
Things have been tough
this year, so that would

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.460 align:middle line:84%
be something that would be
amazing to walk away with,

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:18.740 align:middle line:84%
is to rediscover my focus
and my energy, to be honest.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:30.866 align:middle line:90%


00:08:30.866 --> 00:08:31.854 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, darling.

00:08:31.854 --> 00:08:33.336 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, hi.

00:08:33.336 --> 00:08:34.818 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice to meet you.

00:08:34.818 --> 00:08:37.360 align:middle line:90%


00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.299 align:middle line:84%
So you've come here today
for a healing session.

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:42.890 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, just what is going on?

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:46.160 align:middle line:84%
>> I was saying earlier that
I don't really focus on me.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's not as though I
have a specific something

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:50.883 align:middle line:90%
that I want to work on.

00:08:50.883 --> 00:08:53.050 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot that's happened
in the last two years,

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:54.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure, for everyone.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.040 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, I haven't
worked in nearly two years.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was saying I'm
really struggling.

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:01.150 align:middle line:90%
I've had two years at home.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:03.220 align:middle line:90%
I haven't cleared a single room.

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.540 align:middle line:90%
I know it needs to be done.

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.790 align:middle line:90%
I have no, no inspiration.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:09.380 align:middle line:90%
No inkling to do it.

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:12.227 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you say you
don't think about yourself,

00:09:12.227 --> 00:09:13.810 align:middle line:84%
you don't spend much
time on yourself,

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:15.893 align:middle line:84%
what and who are you
spending your time on?

00:09:15.893 --> 00:09:18.310 align:middle line:84%
>> It used to be work, work,
work, work, work, work, work,

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:19.450 align:middle line:90%
work, work, work, work.

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:21.070 align:middle line:90%
A complete workaholic.

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:23.680 align:middle line:84%
It's actually interesting
maybe that I'm not a workaholic

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.230 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.600 align:middle line:84%
I actually don't know
what to do with myself.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.870 align:middle line:90%
But yes, I've got kids.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.100 align:middle line:84%
I've got a 12-year-old and
a 7-year-old and hubby.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:34.270 align:middle line:10%
>> In terms of the home
dynamic, is it a typical

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:38.100 align:middle line:10%
breadwinner/householder kind
of dynamic that you have

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:38.900 align:middle line:10%
at the moment?

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.160 align:middle line:90%
>> At the moment, yes.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.220 align:middle line:84%
It's actually
completely flipped over.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:46.920 align:middle line:84%
I did the stable job and he did
bits and pieces here and there.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.460 align:middle line:84%
So it's flipped on
its head with COVID.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:52.370 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's been space that
you've been given now to do

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:53.780 align:middle line:90%
some exploration.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And you've gotten stuck in the
householding and the parenting

00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:59.670 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:00.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:04.580 align:middle line:84%
>> What's your feeling
about being like the typical

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.170 align:middle line:90%
housewife mom at the moment?

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:09.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah I'm not
a house-y person.

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:10.940 align:middle line:90%
No, not really.

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.230 align:middle line:90%
I'll be honest.

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:14.630 align:middle line:84%
I've never done the
housewife-y thing.

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:15.505 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a girly girl.

00:10:15.505 --> 00:10:17.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So the last two years,
what have you been doing?

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:19.970 align:middle line:84%
Because you've been at home,
you haven't been working.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:24.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been learning about
spiders and snakes and insects

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.980 align:middle line:84%
and things I haven't
been able to do before.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And are you enjoying the
time that you're having now?

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:32.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I am.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>> You've been gifted.

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:35.420 align:middle line:90%
It's not so much an issue.

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:36.990 align:middle line:90%
It's like a gift of grace.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>> I feel guilty.

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:39.680 align:middle line:90%
>> --time to be yourself.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel like I should
be doing other things.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.870 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, it sounds like
you've been given a window.

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Like that space that
you've been given now,

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:50.990 align:middle line:84%
you've not had that space
before to peek in and go, oh,

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:52.677 align:middle line:90%
what do I actually like doing?

00:10:52.677 --> 00:10:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm sure
when you left school,

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:55.820 align:middle line:84%
it was probably just like,
what am I going to study?

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:56.737 align:middle line:90%
What am I going to do?

00:10:56.737 --> 00:11:00.260 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever had a time
of travel, of being alone,

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.870 align:middle line:84%
of actually what
you've had now where

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:05.170 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing to do except
for do what you feel like?

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:05.970 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:07.040 align:middle line:90%
I really haven't.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.280 align:middle line:84%
>> It's actually a magical
point where you get to go,

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.740 align:middle line:84%
what do I actually want
to spend my days doing?

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:15.380 align:middle line:90%
>> A little bit terrifying, too.

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.240 align:middle line:90%
>> It can be terrifying.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.540 align:middle line:84%
You're in what we
would call a soup.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:21.453 align:middle line:90%
It's like it--

00:11:21.453 --> 00:11:22.370 align:middle line:90%
>> It feels like soup.

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:23.170 align:middle line:90%
>> It's soup, yeah.

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:25.190 align:middle line:84%
So it's like everything
mushed together.

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:28.400 align:middle line:84%
You can't tell one
thing from the other.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.985 align:middle line:90%
It's like a developmental soup.

00:11:30.985 --> 00:11:33.110 align:middle line:84%
There's an easy route and
there's a difficult route

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:34.760 align:middle line:90%
when you're in this state.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.920 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the difficulty is
like, I don't know what to do,

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:38.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm so stressed.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.150 align:middle line:84%
I should be doing this,
I should be doing that.

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:42.950 align:middle line:90%
Blah, blah, blah.

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:44.720 align:middle line:84%
But let's say you come up with
an idea of what you would do.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.880 align:middle line:84%
But someone else has been doing
this 20 years more than me,

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:47.780 align:middle line:90%
and I don't know.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's facing the space
with a sense of fear and anxiety

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:55.530 align:middle line:84%
that you're not doing what
you're supposed to be doing.

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:58.148 align:middle line:84%

route is to go--

I've got all this time.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.550 align:middle line:90%
What am I going to do?

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:05.540 align:middle line:90%
What am I going to do?

it's like starting again.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.220 align:middle line:84%
It's like starting
again, but with all the

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:17.140 align:middle line:84%
wisdom that you've
gained through your life.

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And because we are very
instant gratification,

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:23.878 align:middle line:84%
we want that sense of,
what am I doing now?

00:12:23.878 --> 00:12:25.420 align:middle line:84%
Ooh, I got to be
doing a purpose now.

someone to go on a holiday?

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.390 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for this.

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:50.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Pleasure.

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:54.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Coming up on The Other Side,
Natalie takes Roulla through

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:57.280 align:middle line:84%
a guided meditation
and Reiki session,

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:01.450 align:middle line:84%
enabling her to let go and
allow things on this new path

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:03.640 align:middle line:90%
to unfold more organically.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.923 align:middle line:90%
[CHANTING]

00:15:06.923 --> 00:15:10.680 align:middle line:90%


00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>> You're going to begin by
just bringing your awareness

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:21.140 align:middle line:84%
to your feet and just
feeling how relaxed they are.

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:26.420 align:middle line:84%
Up through your belly,
relaxing everything.

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:30.245 align:middle line:90%
A deep sleep of dreams.

00:15:30.245 --> 00:15:31.480 align:middle line:90%
A deep rest.

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:34.560 align:middle line:90%


00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:39.420 align:middle line:84%
A deep adventure into
your imagination.

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And begin this beautiful
journey inwards

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:47.300 align:middle line:90%
by walking down some steps.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:52.280 align:middle line:84%
These steps are natural
steps, just made by the rocks.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.590 align:middle line:84%
Relax as you deep,
as you realize

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:57.650 align:middle line:84%
that you are coming into
nature, your space of rest

00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:59.150 align:middle line:90%
and relaxation.

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:00.080 align:middle line:90%
You are there.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.280 align:middle line:90%


00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:07.530 align:middle line:84%
You look around at
this mountain valley.

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:12.410 align:middle line:84%
There is a familiar path that
you have traveled before.

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:15.350 align:middle line:90%
And you begin on that path.

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:17.220 align:middle line:84%
You look at the ground
as you're walking,

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:21.020 align:middle line:84%
and the ground is so soft
that you can walk barefoot.

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And you can feel the
earth and the stones

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:29.010 align:middle line:84%
below you, and the
leaves, soft and cool.

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And just allow yourself
to absorb the beauty.

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:35.820 align:middle line:10%
Walking along the path,
you notice a familiar tree

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.140 align:middle line:10%
that you've passed before.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And you look at its beauty
and you notice how it's grown.

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:44.640 align:middle line:90%
How it's changed over time.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:52.070 align:middle line:84%
You continue along the path,
seeing more familiar scenes.

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:54.650 align:middle line:84%
You continue up
the path, and it's

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:58.700 align:middle line:90%
becoming steeper and steeper.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And you notice that it's
not as familiar as before.

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:05.540 align:middle line:90%
But you're exhilarated.

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.640 align:middle line:84%
Completely exhilarated,
because you

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.450 align:middle line:90%
haven't seen this spot before.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:14.800 align:middle line:84%
You're now excited to see
how far this new path goes.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And there's some
new little creatures

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:22.609 align:middle line:84%
you haven't seen before, some
beautiful, colorful insects

00:17:22.609 --> 00:17:25.890 align:middle line:90%
going along their business.

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Each of them contributing to
the ecosystem in so many ways.

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Some simple, simple tasks
they may be doing that

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:41.200 align:middle line:90%
is affecting the whole forest.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And you take your final
step in the shade.

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And you turn around and you
look over this beautiful forest

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:49.850 align:middle line:90%
that you've just walked through.

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:52.060 align:middle line:84%
You're looking at it
from above, feeling

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:54.400 align:middle line:84%
grateful for that
journey that you've taken

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:58.190 align:middle line:90%
on that path that's familiar.

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And you realize you
merely need to be.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:08.220 align:middle line:90%
You are an extension of earth.

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:11.670 align:middle line:90%
And now comes the exciting part.

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:16.530 align:middle line:84%
You get to choose your
path down the mountain.

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:19.320 align:middle line:90%
You've got a new path to follow.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And each time you step
into a little clearing,

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.770 align:middle line:90%
you look around in awe.

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:29.970 align:middle line:84%
Lush, flourishing,
thriving potential.

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:32.970 align:middle line:84%
You merely need to give
yourself time to look at it,

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:37.080 align:middle line:84%
to notice it, to absorb
it, and to realize

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.130 align:middle line:90%
that you are part of it.

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:44.350 align:middle line:84%
You've always been part of
life where you are alive.

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:49.800 align:middle line:84%
You're going to leave the forest
now, making our way back home,

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.790 align:middle line:84%
knowing that you can
return there at any point.

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And knowing more
importantly that you

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:59.205 align:middle line:84%
can follow any new path
and you will be gifted.

00:18:59.205 --> 00:19:02.070 align:middle line:90%


00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:03.970 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:06.790 align:middle line:84%
So the session
with Roulla, I was

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:11.410 align:middle line:84%
trying to identify what was
going on in her past, what's

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:13.930 align:middle line:84%
going on in her
present, and where she

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:15.640 align:middle line:90%
wants to get to in the future.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.160 align:middle line:84%
She is in a phase
that a lot of us

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.460 align:middle line:84%
have been in where we've
been given a bit more time

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:22.760 align:middle line:90%
than we're used to having.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And so in that lack
of busyness, we're

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:29.350 align:middle line:84%
now able to see certain things
that we don't resonate with

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:31.550 align:middle line:84%
and certain things that
we are interested in.

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:34.235 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot of people
where they know now what

00:19:34.235 --> 00:19:36.610 align:middle line:84%
they don't want to do anymore,
but they're not quite sure

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:40.325 align:middle line:84%
where to go to or what
to do next in their path,

00:19:40.325 --> 00:19:41.450 align:middle line:90%
in their career, and so on.

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:43.660 align:middle line:84%
So she's definitely
one of those people

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:45.260 align:middle line:90%
that's experiencing that.

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:48.190 align:middle line:84%
So after that assessment,
I saw that she definitely

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:52.360 align:middle line:84%
just needed some energy to
revitalize and rejuvenate her.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And then also the meandering
path hypnosis that I use,

00:19:56.870 --> 00:20:01.240 align:middle line:84%
which is to get someone feeling
comfortable through familiarity

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:04.810 align:middle line:84%
and then move into the
excitement and the exhilaration

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:07.660 align:middle line:84%
of taking on something new,
something unpredictable,

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:08.770 align:middle line:90%
unexpected.

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>> She really has a knack of
pulling up information that you

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.540 align:middle line:84%
didn't really know
was lying in there.

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:19.600 align:middle line:84%
I think I ended up in
tears at one point.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.640 align:middle line:84%
I do normally stick
my head in the sand

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.960 align:middle line:84%
and hope things go
away on their own.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.300 align:middle line:90%
So this was quite a big step.

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:29.050 align:middle line:10%
Putting myself out there
and letting people in.

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:30.790 align:middle line:90%
And it does, it feels good.

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And it does feel like I've
made a bit of progress.

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:40.300 align:middle line:10%
The session itself was really
relaxing and reassuring.

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:45.340 align:middle line:84%
Going forward, I
think she's helped

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:47.560 align:middle line:84%
me to trust myself
a little bit more

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.710 align:middle line:84%
and be less anxious about
what I think I should be doing

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:54.460 align:middle line:84%
and more relaxed
with what I am doing.

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:59.560 align:middle line:10%
Allowing that process to follow
through and organically evolve.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:06.520 align:middle line:84%
It really has not a hard
impact, a really gentle easing

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.200 align:middle line:90%
into change.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:13.480 align:middle line:84%
I think the benefit of that is
so much more than everything

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.960 align:middle line:84%
always having to be a
hard "I'm doing this now."

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:20.470 align:middle line:84%
Giving myself the time
to do this session today,

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:25.390 align:middle line:84%
it just opens up doors in the
mind to move things along.

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:30.340 align:middle line:84%
So all in all, I think really
quite a wonderful experience,

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.650 align:middle line:90%
really.

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:37.150 align:middle line:84%
>> At the moment it's really
exciting being in the healing

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:38.020 align:middle line:90%
arts.

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:42.040 align:middle line:84%
Because there is definitely
an awakening in humanity

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.710 align:middle line:84%
as a whole, where
we are allowing

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:49.280 align:middle line:84%
ourselves to see the elements
that are no longer serving us.

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And so there's now an
openness to healing.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:56.200 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, it's really just
a ritual of recognizing,

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.550 align:middle line:84%
these are the issues
that I need to deal with,

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:00.820 align:middle line:84%
and then taking
responsibility for it.

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:03.620 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't matter who caused
it, what the issue was,

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:04.760 align:middle line:90%
or where it stems from.

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.940 align:middle line:84%
But it's about me, and
it's about healing myself.

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And if each one of
us heals ourself,

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.370 align:middle line:84%
we then change the world,
because we're all part of it.

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:17.180 align:middle line:84%
So if you are in
a place where you

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:20.570 align:middle line:84%
would like to explore
more about yourself

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:24.260 align:middle line:84%
and more about your healing,
more about what you can expand,

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.090 align:middle line:84%
what you can become,
then I would highly

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:29.360 align:middle line:84%
recommend going for any
healing modality that

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.240 align:middle line:90%
resonates with you.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Every one of us has
our own path to take.

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:37.220 align:middle line:84%
How we choose to see
it, engage with it

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:39.890 align:middle line:84%
and shape it along
the way, is up to us.

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:42.780 align:middle line:90%
But remember, you are not alone.

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.990 align:middle line:90%
There are people all around us.

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:47.840 align:middle line:84%
Healers in every
corner of the Earth.

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:51.640 align:middle line:90%
Arms open, ready to guide you.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:23:57.000 align:middle line:90%
