When one hears the term Medium, our brains automatically go to Ouija boards, tarot cards and crystal balls. However, there is more to psychics than Hollywood has lead us to believe. Mediums believe that there is no such thing as death, only a transition from the physical being to the spiritual being. Mediums facilitate connections between us and the unseen past, present and future. \n\nWe meet Sam, who is connected to the other side. After having what is described as an awakening, Sam continued to suppress her psychic gifts. In 2005, Sam fell extremely ill and after many surgeries and not receiving any healing, she knew that there was more to what was physically wrong with her. Sam needed to embrace all her pain and trauma for her to truly connect to the other side, and she needed to accept who she was to receive the healing she needed. Sam has always known she has been able to connect to the other side from being told stories by her mother about when she was younger and how she would talk to ghosts. Being a psychic medium is the only tool that Sam uses to connect to the other side. \nHoping to connect with her father who passed away in 2013, Ingrid, has come to see Sam. Ingrid is a Reiki master herself, helping others who have reached out to her for help, for all sorts of reasons. Ingrid believes that everything in life always connects for the greater good. \n\nShe is embarking on a personal journey with Sam, to connect with her inner self, to find the healing and closure that she needs. Sam will work through Ingrid by connecting to Ingrid’s energy and spirit. This will help Sam to see who Ingrid really is and what kind of life she has, past, present and future. \nBut will Ingrid’s father come through as she hopes? Will she find the healing and closure she needs to go forward on her journey? \nWe may ask questions and hold intentions, but what we need to be reminded of is that we are not in control of the information and messages that have chosen to come through for us during these sessions.

Practitioners share how therapy can help to conquer fears and negative emotions, reaching a deeper connection to the inner self.\n\nIboga is a plant used for ritual and ceremonial purposes in some African cultures. In todays day and age, it can be used as a treatment for opiate addiction. The experience of Ibogaine occurs in two phases: the visionary phase, and the introspective phase. This helps enable people to conquer their fears and negative emotions. Ibogaine catalyzes an alternate state of consciousness and reminiscent dreaming, while fully conscious and aware. This enables us to process our memories, life experiences and issues of trauma. The journey can last 4-6 hours.\n\nMarouf and Anita, both practitioners of the Iboga therapy journey, met in 2017 at a Buddhist retreat. Working together at other retreats, the two decided to break away because they wanted to have a more holistic approach after the Ibogaine medicine. Wanting to help more people and give them more healing and attention, in 2018, they opened The Exclusive Ibogaine Retreat to give people the best support they can have. \nMarouf and Anita, having gone through their own iboga journeys and finding so much healing along the way, take us through the process of what all an Iboga journey involves. We go through a journey with one of their patients from the darkness of his life through to his authentic other side. \n\nWe discover if Iboga medicine really does help one to open up and connect with your deep subconscious mind. Can it assist with stripping a person from all cultural conditioning, trauma, violence, anxiety, depression, and abuse, to really connect with the true self? Can it help to reset the mind, body and spirit?","teaser":"Breaking chains from your past and present problems is no easy task.
