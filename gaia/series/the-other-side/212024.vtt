from past life regression,

what their pre-existing

It's very intuitive how I
decide how to treat people

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.710 align:middle line:84%
depending on what's
happening in their lives

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.790 align:middle line:84%

>> The HiddenMind is a healing
system and protocol founded

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.070 align:middle line:84%
by Tom Griffin, which uses the

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.300 align:middle line:84%
to look deeper into the cause
of diseases and ailments.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.250 align:middle line:84%
It utilizes what is called the
bioenergy protocol, a series

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.530 align:middle line:84%
of energy-balancing
techniques that

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.220 align:middle line:84%
use hand movements to
restore and regenerate

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:21.920 align:middle line:84%
embraces the hidden
potential of the human mind.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.570 align:middle line:84%
>> It's hard to say when my
personal journey with healing

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.840 align:middle line:84%
began, because I think it began
from early, early childhood.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.130 align:middle line:84%
My parents were Irish,
both born in Dublin.

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And I was born and raised
in the then-Rhodesia.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.240 align:middle line:90%
My mother was very psychic.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.410 align:middle line:84%
So it was very common for her
to speak about the spirits that

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.100 align:middle line:84%
were surrounding us, visitors
that popped in and out

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.840 align:middle line:90%
that others could not see.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.790 align:middle line:84%
So I grew up with
that being normal.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:59.100 align:middle line:84%
When we emigrated back to
Europe in the late '70s,

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.740 align:middle line:84%
I landed up in
England on my own.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And it was then that I realized
that these things were not

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.190 align:middle line:84%
quite mainstream, they
were rather frowned upon.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.560 align:middle line:84%
But I started soon after in
London studying meditation.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And it was through
meditation that I

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.590 align:middle line:84%
developed my own
innate psychic ability

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.210 align:middle line:90%
because we are all psychic.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And my third eye opened,
and I was able to understand

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.130 align:middle line:84%
see, hear, feel,
intuit much deeper

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.350 align:middle line:84%
things that were
happening in the ethos.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.780 align:middle line:84%
Then it was a long journey of
doing different modalities.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.510 align:middle line:84%
But the biggest catalyst was
when my eldest son was born.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.860 align:middle line:84%
He was born with what we
would call today ADHD.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And I got no joy from the
medical fraternity at all.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.200 align:middle line:84%
Then I went on a long
journey of investigation

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.410 align:middle line:84%
to help Sean with energy
healing modalities

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.380 align:middle line:90%
and shifted that completely.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.580 align:middle line:84%
It's just developed one
thing after another.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.870 align:middle line:84%
So that's a journey of 35 years
learning different healing

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:04.960 align:middle line:90%
modalities.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Healers like Diana use a wide
variety of modalities to heal.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Through various questions with
a candidate prior to a session

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.150 align:middle line:84%
and by listening
to her intuition,

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.900 align:middle line:84%
she can get an indication of
which modalities to call on.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.500 align:middle line:84%
During a session, she works
on the meridians, chakras,

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.890 align:middle line:84%
and auric fields, leading to
improved physical, mental,

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:30.150 align:middle line:84%
emotional, and
spiritual well-being.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.750 align:middle line:84%
Coming up next, we learn about
the types of negative energies

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.930 align:middle line:84%
that can hold us back
or create ailments.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.420 align:middle line:10%
And we meet Michelle,
a Reiki master

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.220 align:middle line:10%
in desperate need of help.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.430 align:middle line:84%
Join us as we journey with
them to the other side.

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.150 align:middle line:90%


00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Shortly, I'm going
to be seeing Michelle.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And I know nothing
about her background.

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.710 align:middle line:10%
I'll question her
as to why she feels

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.660 align:middle line:10%
that she needs to
come for treatment,

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.500 align:middle line:10%
what has brought her here.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And depending on
her answers, then, I

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.820 align:middle line:84%
will tailor a treatment
protocol specifically

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.840 align:middle line:84%
for her to address
her specific problems.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.560 align:middle line:84%
It's possible that she may
have past life things or entity

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.910 align:middle line:90%
attachment.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.500 align:middle line:84%
Muti might have
been sent to her,

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.300 align:middle line:90%
which is very common in Africa.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And those things can be easily
released and removed once I

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:23.330 align:middle line:90%
know what we're dealing with.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Past life problems are
resolved through ancestral

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.140 align:middle line:84%
healing, which focuses on
meridian gene folds that come

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.920 align:middle line:90%
through our DNA.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.340 align:middle line:84%
It is the process of
revealing and releasing

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.230 align:middle line:84%
traumas that have
been passed down

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.170 align:middle line:90%
by our ancestors and past lives.

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:41.270 align:middle line:84%
Entity attachments
are when a person

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:45.840 align:middle line:84%
has undesirable energy or a
spiritual attachment residing

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.830 align:middle line:90%
within or around them.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.860 align:middle line:84%
These attachments
are generally formed

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:54.510 align:middle line:84%
through trauma, when our energy
field is most vulnerable.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:57.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Often, we will start
with a channeled reading

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.460 align:middle line:84%
because spirit comes through
me to give them guidance

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.490 align:middle line:84%
to highlight areas in their
lives that need to be looked

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:07.500 align:middle line:90%
into to be released.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And often, those
channel readings

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:12.000 align:middle line:84%
can turn into healings as
well because we are visited

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.090 align:middle line:90%
by very amazing beings--

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:19.830 align:middle line:84%
Beloved Jesus, Mother Mary,
Saint Germain, Mary Magdalene.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:23.040 align:middle line:84%
There are so many beloveds
that arrive at those readings,

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.890 align:middle line:90%
it's quite profound these days.

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:29.475 align:middle line:84%
And it's ramping up as
the veil is thinning.

>> I am a Reiki master,
and I'm a psychic.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:57.330 align:middle line:10%
But on today's
episode, I actually

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.168 align:middle line:10%
need help, believe it or not.

00:08:59.168 --> 00:09:00.210 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what I need.

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:01.350 align:middle line:90%
I just know I need help.

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:05.500 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going to be
spiritually, emotionally,

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.780 align:middle line:90%
physically.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:10.080 align:middle line:84%
My opening up to
the spiritual stuff

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.120 align:middle line:84%
only really happened
in my late 40s.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.170 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't born with it.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:17.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's been actually a
very interesting journey.

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:21.150 align:middle line:84%
When the bad stuff happens,
yeah, in my human life,

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm experiencing real life.

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:26.730 align:middle line:84%
But if I sit back
and I look at my--

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:31.260 align:middle line:84%
from the spiritual side of
things, it all makes sense.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:35.350 align:middle line:84%
Afterwards, I find there
was actually a lesson in it.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And with that experience, I
find that I've helped people

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:43.210 align:middle line:90%
that have been in a situation.

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:45.657 align:middle line:84%
So what I find is that
people can understand

00:09:45.657 --> 00:09:47.490 align:middle line:84%
where I'm coming from
when I'm giving advice

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:51.050 align:middle line:84%
because I'm speaking
from personal experience.

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:53.230 align:middle line:84%
So I would tell them,
for example, this

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:56.050 align:middle line:84%
is what I did in this
situation, it worked.

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:59.000 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to do
exactly what I did,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.220 align:middle line:84%
but even if they did get a
thought and say, oh, OK, yeah,

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:07.580 align:middle line:84%
I'll do that, then
my job is done.

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:10.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm so excited
about my appointment

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:11.620 align:middle line:90%
later on with Diana.

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.170 align:middle line:84%
People would say,
you are a psychic,

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:16.750 align:middle line:84%
you've got all
these abilities, how

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.340 align:middle line:84%
come you don't know
what's going on?

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:21.460 align:middle line:84%
What you misunderstand is I'm
still a human being living

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.050 align:middle line:90%
a human life.

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And I go through all the trials
and tribulations and I have,

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:29.140 align:middle line:84%
my daily stresses and
stuff, like everybody else.

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:31.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm very excited
about seeing Diana.

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:33.950 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, she's got
various abilities.

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think I'm going to be
her perfect candidate because I

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.950 align:middle line:84%
need so much, and I
don't know what I need.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And she's going to, obviously,
use her intuition and work

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:46.270 align:middle line:90%
out what I need.

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:48.040 align:middle line:90%
So I'm very interested.

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And maybe this could be a
life-changing experience for me

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.390 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:54.910 align:middle line:84%
It'll be interesting
experiencing it myself

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.178 align:middle line:90%
and see if I'm drawn to it.

00:10:57.178 --> 00:11:00.664 align:middle line:90%
[SERENE MUSIC]

00:11:00.664 --> 00:11:15.640 align:middle line:90%


00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:16.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome.

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:18.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much.

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:18.937 align:middle line:90%
>> Lovely to meet you.

00:11:18.937 --> 00:11:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm so excited, and this has
just come at the right time.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:22.960 align:middle line:90%
I come totally open.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.720 align:middle line:84%
I've heard you do so many
therapies, which I'm actually

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.150 align:middle line:84%
grateful for because I don't
know where I need help.

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:29.320 align:middle line:90%
I just know I need help.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:29.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:31.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm going to
ask you some questions

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.050 align:middle line:84%
because I'm wanting to
have that information.

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:36.160 align:middle line:84%
But if I could ask you to
fill in my paperwork, just

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.370 align:middle line:90%
that section at the top.

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:38.170 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, sure.

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:40.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And then I'm going to
ask you some questions

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:44.870 align:middle line:84%
as to your present
medical condition.

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:45.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:46.470 align:middle line:90%
>> That's perfect.

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:47.780 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:48.580 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.650 align:middle line:84%
So why are you
brought here today?

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel that you need
a bit of an overhaul?

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:56.200 align:middle line:90%
Are your energy levels low?

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>> To be honest, I
just know I need help.

00:11:58.730 --> 00:11:59.620 align:middle line:90%
That's all I can say.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:02.620 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't answer your
question, but I just

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:08.120 align:middle line:84%
know I need spiritual
help from above.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:08.920 align:middle line:90%
I can't define it.

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:09.970 align:middle line:90%
I just know I need help.

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:10.960 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:14.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to ask you
some 3D questions because I

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:18.010 align:middle line:84%
need to know what's happening
in your life and in your body.

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:20.540 align:middle line:84%
Headaches, migraines,
tension, stress, anxiety?

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, with the encephalitis,
obviously there's severe

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:24.998 align:middle line:90%
headaches.

00:12:24.998 --> 00:12:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>> How old were you when
you had an encephalitis?

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>> In my 30s, I was in
hospital for four months.

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:34.480 align:middle line:90%
And, yeah, headaches were long.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.020 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, stress-- I've always
had careers with severe stress.

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.255 align:middle line:84%
So I got addicted to
grabbing my headache powders.

00:12:40.255 --> 00:12:48.910 align:middle line:90%


00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:50.570 align:middle line:90%
>> And your skeletal system.

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:51.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Pardon?

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:52.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Skeletal system.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.820 align:middle line:90%
Any fractures of your bones?

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.235 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I broke my arm when
I was younger, horse riding.

00:12:57.235 --> 00:13:00.650 align:middle line:90%


00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:02.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Would you mind signing there?

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.090 align:middle line:90%
>> And just ticking those boxes.

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:07.770 align:middle line:84%
Then that's just-- we
can go ahead with your--

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:08.570 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:10.080 align:middle line:90%
>> --your therapy.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:10.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.540 align:middle line:84%
So we can just step
into the clinic.

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:20.210 align:middle line:84%
If you would like to come with
me, we'll get you on the bed.

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:24.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Coming up next, Diana takes
Michelle through an hour long

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:29.870 align:middle line:84%
session, cleansing her aura,
chakras, and meridians,

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:34.520 align:middle line:84%
and increasing her
energetic frequency.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm just going
to scan your body.

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take a
remote view of what's

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.550 align:middle line:84%
happening in your
body and get direction

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:46.790 align:middle line:84%
as to what we need to
do, how we need to do it,

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:49.250 align:middle line:90%
and what needs to be healed.

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:51.930 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to take a
quick scan with the dowsing

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:52.730 align:middle line:90%
rods.

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:56.360 align:middle line:90%


00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.250 align:middle line:90%
Picking up an energy field here.

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:01.300 align:middle line:90%


00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And then in your
Earth star chakra.

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:07.610 align:middle line:90%


00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:10.040 align:middle line:84%
There's a bit of a
tremor happening here.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.450 align:middle line:84%
Gives us some indication
of what we're looking for.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:14.960 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to be
silent for a little while

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.180 align:middle line:90%
as I connect your energy fields.

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going
to have a look

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:21.380 align:middle line:84%
and see what spirit
wants me to see.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:25.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking for any
attachments and anything

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:28.580 align:middle line:84%
of a lower vibration
that needs to be removed.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:33.060 align:middle line:84%
Your sphere, your whole
sphere, is very dark.

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.510 align:middle line:84%
So here, my angel,
I'm seeing like-- what

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:37.380 align:middle line:84%
looks to be like a
whole lot of arrows.

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:39.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes, there are arrows.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.540 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
take those off.

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And this was a
lifetime that you had.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And I see you riding a horse, so
it looks like a North American

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:48.920 align:middle line:90%
Indian.

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And you were killed
in that lifetime

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:52.610 align:middle line:90%
and shot with all these arrows.

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>> It makes sense why I'm
so drawn to the Red Indians.

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:03.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Tension in our faces because
we're all wearing masks.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.400 align:middle line:84%
The happy smile,
and I'm just fine,

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:09.165 align:middle line:84%
and everything's wonderful,
and often, that's not the case.

00:15:09.165 --> 00:15:11.880 align:middle line:90%


00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:15.690 align:middle line:84%
Clearing off all that old
energy, all that stress

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:17.090 align:middle line:90%
and tension.

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:18.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Isn't-- the drilling here.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm?

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I'll just
give you feedback.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:26.340 align:middle line:84%
It's like the--
it's this type of--

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:27.900 align:middle line:90%
>> And is that common?

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.405 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I only felt it now.

00:15:29.405 --> 00:15:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And now it's like
this, but now I

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:32.635 align:middle line:84%
think what you said
about the entities.

00:15:32.635 --> 00:15:33.760 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not making this up.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.643 align:middle line:90%
I think maybe I do have--

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:36.810 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm working something up.

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:38.820 align:middle line:90%
Let's just take a look.

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Please have a look.

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:44.670 align:middle line:84%
>> So these entities are what
we call in energy medicine

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:47.640 align:middle line:84%
parasites of the
human energy field.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Basically, they attach to us,
and then they will live off

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:52.830 align:middle line:90%
our life force energy.

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And they get bigger
and bigger and bigger,

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:57.390 align:middle line:84%
and they get quite
comfortable and set in,

00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:59.340 align:middle line:84%
and they're quite happy
with their new home.

00:15:59.340 --> 00:15:59.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, let it go.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:00.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Going anywhere.

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:01.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:02.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Don't move.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>> So my angel, the next
thing I'd like to do,

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:10.470 align:middle line:84%
with your permission, is take
you to the 25th dimension,

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:16.540 align:middle line:84%
where we're going to look at any
attachments, cords, agreements,

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:20.800 align:middle line:84%
contracts that you might have
made in this lifetime or any

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.180 align:middle line:90%
other.

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:23.530 align:middle line:90%
We're going to cut all of those.

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:28.790 align:middle line:90%


00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:33.950 align:middle line:84%
So arriving now at
the 25th dimension--

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:36.950 align:middle line:84%
so understanding that
we live in the third,

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:40.820 align:middle line:84%
some of us in the fourth,
some of us in the fifth, 25th

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:41.900 align:middle line:90%
is very high.

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:45.080 align:middle line:84%
It's a safe place
where we can do

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:49.835 align:middle line:84%
this work without any worries
of any nefarious interference.

00:16:49.835 --> 00:16:51.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's fantastic.

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.910 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:16:51.910 --> 00:17:00.690 align:middle line:90%


00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:06.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Archangel Michael, show
us any cords, threads,

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:12.190 align:middle line:84%
vines that Michelle has with
others from this lifetime

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:13.680 align:middle line:90%
or any other.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:14.650 align:middle line:90%
Oh, there's lots.

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:17.000 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:17.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my god.

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:18.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:18.810 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:21.730 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so we attach
cords into others.

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:23.119 align:middle line:90%
We do this ourselves.

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And we have this agreement that
we exchange energies with them.

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:31.270 align:middle line:84%
All right, so it's never good
because it's never allowing

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:34.300 align:middle line:90%
us to be our authentic selves.

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm seeing lots of
cords to do with contracts.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:41.210 align:middle line:84%
OK, so birth certificates,
marriage certificates.

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:48.900 align:middle line:90%


00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.120 align:middle line:84%
So this is not just from
this lifetime, though.

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:55.890 align:middle line:84%
It's going back into hundreds,
if not thousands, of lifetimes.

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:57.225 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:57.225 --> 00:18:00.630 align:middle line:84%
>> I must say, my body's feeling
different, in a good way.

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:04.590 align:middle line:90%


00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're lit up
like a Christmas tree.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.140 align:middle line:90%
You're a bit early, but you're--

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:11.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And we just finish off
with the infinity to seal you.

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.260 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if you
can hear your frequency,

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:21.820 align:middle line:90%
but it's very, very high now.

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:22.870 align:middle line:90%
>> I feel lighter.

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:23.710 align:middle line:90%
And thank you.

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:27.170 align:middle line:90%
And the headaches are gone.

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:27.970 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:30.510 align:middle line:90%


00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:32.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Session with
Michelle went very well.

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:34.380 align:middle line:84%
It was an interesting
session in that

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:38.200 align:middle line:84%
she didn't have any pre-existing
conditions to be treated.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:42.510 align:middle line:84%
So I was working quite
blindly and decided that,

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:45.720 align:middle line:84%
or was prompted that, I needed
to check into her energy fields

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.880 align:middle line:84%
to see if there were
any attachments that

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.260 align:middle line:90%
needed to be removed.

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.560 align:middle line:90%
That went exceptionally well.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:54.510 align:middle line:84%
I was guided very well
by my team of healers

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:55.770 align:middle line:90%
that I work with.

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And when I connected
to her energy field,

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.410 align:middle line:84%
I could feel that her
energy was very low,

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:04.200 align:middle line:90%
very, very suppressed.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And I dowsed to
find what that was.

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:09.420 align:middle line:90%
And it was at 65.

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:12.880 align:middle line:84%
When I looked into her energy
field, it was very dark.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.330 align:middle line:84%
So she had a lot
of astral debris,

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:17.340 align:middle line:84%
we call it, in
her energy fields.

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And it did take quite
a while to clear that

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:22.890 align:middle line:84%
and to clear off any
entities that she had.

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:26.790 align:middle line:90%


00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:29.160 align:middle line:84%
She had remarked that
she was feeling lighter

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.080 align:middle line:90%
as we went through the session.

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.730 align:middle line:84%
But she remarked that
she had a headache.

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:38.070 align:middle line:84%
So I worked on her cranial
bones and her facial bones

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:40.440 align:middle line:84%
to readjust there,
and it came up

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.650 align:middle line:84%
that the left temporal bone,
there was an attachment there.

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:45.180 align:middle line:90%
So we removed that.

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.490 align:middle line:84%
I cleared off, I balanced
her auric fields,

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:49.650 align:middle line:84%
and then allowed
her to come back

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:53.400 align:middle line:84%
into her body to integrate all
the changes that had been made.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.040 align:middle line:84%
There was quite a
lot of work that was

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.080 align:middle line:90%
done to her in this session.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And I would recommend
that she has

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.300 align:middle line:84%
further sessions,
at least two more,

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.930 align:middle line:90%
to see what comes up next.

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:09.030 align:middle line:84%
So with energy work, it's
very much in priority

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:11.550 align:middle line:84%
that things come up
that need to be removed.

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And then we leave it
for a week or two,

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:15.840 align:middle line:84%
and then the next
priorities will come up.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's layers and layers
and layers and layers

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:22.830 align:middle line:84%
of things that need to be
removed in a specific order.

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:24.510 align:middle line:90%
Things are shifting now.

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:27.910 align:middle line:84%
We've initiated a
process within her body,

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:31.350 align:middle line:84%
within her energy fields,
that they are moving.

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:33.970 align:middle line:90%
And that, we call integration.

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:40.600 align:middle line:84%
We're clearing off ancestral
debris, trauma from past lives.

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.790 align:middle line:84%
We've lived hundreds of
thousands of lives, most of us.

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:47.770 align:middle line:84%
So there is eons of
time to be cleared.

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:51.490 align:middle line:84%
Spirit has told us that we need
to remove all of this past life

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:54.700 align:middle line:84%
karma, because it's
what it is, in order

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.340 align:middle line:84%
to be able to move forward
into the new golden age,

00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:00.534 align:middle line:84%
into the fifth dimension
and beyond, unimpeded.

00:21:00.534 --> 00:21:11.400 align:middle line:90%


00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Words actually
can't describe it.

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:14.710 align:middle line:90%
She did so much.

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And I actually was
right, I needed it.

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:19.080 align:middle line:90%
I feel much lighter.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And it feels like
I'm walking on air.

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:26.550 align:middle line:84%
Part of my headaches
that I had was an entity.

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:29.040 align:middle line:84%
So she cleared that
all away from me.

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:32.130 align:middle line:84%
It just shows what a dark
place I was and how I felt.

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:33.480 align:middle line:90%
It actually makes sense.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.150 align:middle line:84%
When she first started,
all my chakras, the chakras

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:37.590 align:middle line:90%
have got different colors.

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:41.010 align:middle line:84%
She says, I was told,
everything was black.

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:43.770 align:middle line:84%
There was actually
so much to take in.

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And I've actually
learned from it.

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.360 align:middle line:84%
But it actually
makes sense why I

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:52.050 align:middle line:84%
said I felt I was,
like, in a black box.

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:54.750 align:middle line:90%
And things from my past came up.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:57.450 align:middle line:90%
One was I was a Red Indian.

00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:59.985 align:middle line:84%
And I've always wondered why
I was drawn to Red Indians.

00:21:59.985 --> 00:22:03.200 align:middle line:90%


00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.600 align:middle line:84%
So basically, you
can say I'm like--

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:10.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm a new person ready for
the next higher dimensions.

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.530 align:middle line:90%
So I'm very, very grateful.

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And she was-- I
feel so much better.

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:21.950 align:middle line:84%
>> The subconscious mind is a
remarkable and complex place,

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:26.900 align:middle line:84%
a place where we store
trauma but also find healing.

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:31.370 align:middle line:84%
Healers like Diana are in tune
with the energies of the Earth.

And through various
techniques, she

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:36.770 align:middle line:84%

the subconscious mind

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:38.810 align:middle line:90%
