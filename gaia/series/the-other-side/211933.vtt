00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.070 align:middle line:84%
>> When most of us
hear the term, medium,

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.220 align:middle line:84%
we think of Ouija boards,
tarot cards, and crystal balls.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.650 align:middle line:84%
But there is more to
mediums than Hollywood

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.450 align:middle line:90%
has led us to believe.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.390 align:middle line:84%
Mediums believe, do
not speak with the dead

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.209 align:middle line:84%
as there is no such
thing as death.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:07.150 align:middle line:84%
There is only a transition
from the physical being

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.830 align:middle line:90%
to the spiritual being.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And mediums are sensitive
and intuitive enough

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.420 align:middle line:84%
to hear, feel, and
see information

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.890 align:middle line:90%
coming from the other side.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:38.650 align:middle line:90%


00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So it started when
I was three years old.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:50.870 align:middle line:84%
I was lying in my crib and I saw
all these things hanging over

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:51.670 align:middle line:90%
me.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't understand
what it was, obviously,

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.610 align:middle line:90%
because I'm three years old.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.830 align:middle line:90%
And my mom said good night.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And she put the light
off, closed the door,

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.300 align:middle line:90%
and then everyone was around me.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And since then, I've
been scared of it.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.980 align:middle line:90%
I was so scared.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.990 align:middle line:84%
My whole life, I could see them
but I couldn't communicate.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.275 align:middle line:90%
And that was the scary part.

00:02:16.275 --> 00:02:20.880 align:middle line:90%


00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.690 align:middle line:84%
About two years ago my
brother got a heart attack.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.250 align:middle line:90%
And he was in a coma.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And my nagging sister came
around again and she said,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.250 align:middle line:90%
San, San, you must do something.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.840 align:middle line:90%
You can do something.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And I said, but
what, what can I do?

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.300 align:middle line:84%
She said, can't you
go to him in a way?

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.970 align:middle line:90%
So I say, OK, I'll try that.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And just like that, I got
quiet and I went to him.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.720 align:middle line:90%
And I said to him--

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.090 align:middle line:84%
I talked to his spirit
and I said to him, listen,

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.230 align:middle line:90%
what's wrong?

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.680 align:middle line:90%
How can I help you?

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they
call astral travel.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.930 align:middle line:84%
So I said to him,
listen, there is a light.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Because I saw the light, I said
to him, do you see the gates?

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.430 align:middle line:90%
There's a light.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.740 align:middle line:90%
Go towards the light.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.120 align:middle line:84%
And he just went like this,
no, I'm not ready yet.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.900 align:middle line:84%
So I went to my brother
and I healed him.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.050 align:middle line:84%
I encouraged him,
his soul, his spirit.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.885 align:middle line:90%
And he got out of the coma.

00:03:27.885 --> 00:03:34.680 align:middle line:90%


00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.110 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so that's where
my journey started.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And everything just came to
me, everything-- downloads,

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.100 align:middle line:84%
I got visions, I got dreams,
and I connect with everything

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.900 align:middle line:90%
around me.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.280 align:middle line:84%
My sister, I thank her because
she nagged me all the time.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.900 align:middle line:10%
She said, San,
you've got a gift.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.150 align:middle line:90%
And then I got so cross.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.305 align:middle line:90%
But now, I just want to help.

00:04:01.305 --> 00:04:04.500 align:middle line:90%


00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.240 align:middle line:84%
So my sister says,
OK, San, there's

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.960 align:middle line:84%
a lady that died in the
house next door to us.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.880 align:middle line:90%
And that house is haunted.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.710 align:middle line:90%
So what can we do?

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:16.740 align:middle line:90%
Can we help them?

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.110 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK, let's go.

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.380 align:middle line:90%
And I went up the stairs.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.950 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at the house.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And I saw the woman sitting
there in a sitting room.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.110 align:middle line:90%
And she was so lonely.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.480 align:middle line:90%
She drank every night.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.290 align:middle line:84%
She used alcohol
as a way to escape.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And what happened to
her, she passed out

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.030 align:middle line:84%
and she hit her
head on the couch.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.810 align:middle line:90%
And she died there.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.690 align:middle line:90%
So she was stuck there.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:45.950 align:middle line:90%
And what happened?

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.690 align:middle line:84%
People come and they
move into the house.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.350 align:middle line:90%
And they stay in there.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And at night-time when she
starts drinking, in her mind,

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.890 align:middle line:90%
she thinks, what's this?

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.390 align:middle line:90%
There's people in my house.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.770 align:middle line:90%
And that's why, they hurt her.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.870 align:middle line:90%
And they thought it was haunted.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.590 align:middle line:84%
So all I did, I just
said to her, listen,

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.390 align:middle line:90%
you can't stay here anymore.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.370 align:middle line:84%
You've got to go
to a better place.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And you see there,
there's a light.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.400 align:middle line:84%
Go towards the light,
there's the light.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.100 align:middle line:90%
And I did a prayer for her.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.120 align:middle line:90%
And she went.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.850 align:middle line:90%
And since then, that house was--

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.680 align:middle line:84%
there's new owner
staying in the house

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.070 align:middle line:90%
and very happy about that.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.390 align:middle line:84%
So that was one of
the things I could do.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Mediums can connect with all
types of energy with those that

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:43.260 align:middle line:84%
are in need of healing, souls
who are trapped between worlds.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.910 align:middle line:84%
But probably, most famously,
for connecting millions

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.730 align:middle line:84%
of individuals with
loved ones that

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.610 align:middle line:90%
have passed to the other side.

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.090 align:middle line:84%
Belief in an afterlife
comes much easier

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.580 align:middle line:90%
to some people than others.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.670 align:middle line:84%
A reading with a
truly gifted medium

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.510 align:middle line:84%
is reported to be life
changing and specifically,

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.690 align:middle line:84%
the trajectory of grief
you may be going through

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.150 align:middle line:90%
from losing a loved one.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:17.520 align:middle line:10%
>> I just want to share
this side of my story,

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.650 align:middle line:10%
because I've been missing
my mom for a long,

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.520 align:middle line:10%
long time now from 2017.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And there is
something that I want

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:30.510 align:middle line:90%
to communicate with her about.

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:37.950 align:middle line:84%
I just want to clear some
things with her, because I don't

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:41.340 align:middle line:90%
understand how she passed away.

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:46.170 align:middle line:84%
If ever she's happy where she
is because most of the time,

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:52.590 align:middle line:84%
she's always coming to me with
dreams, asking me some things.

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:57.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Many mediums and spiritual
leaders believe that dreams

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.700 align:middle line:84%
connect you to a
spiritual realm,

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:04.410 align:middle line:84%
where steps to resolving your
trauma and self-development are

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:06.020 align:middle line:90%
laid before you.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.750 align:middle line:90%
A world that has no time.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.940 align:middle line:90%
A world with no rules.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.740 align:middle line:84%
A world designed to
recalibrate your consciousness.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.880 align:middle line:90%
>> She came to my dream.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.535 align:middle line:90%
We were like in a forest.

00:07:19.535 --> 00:07:22.770 align:middle line:90%


00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.870 align:middle line:90%
My mom was cross with me.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:26.910 align:middle line:84%
Then she just left
me in the dark.

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And I was like
trembling with fear.

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And I was running
away, hopeless.

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:38.470 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to clear on that
part to chat to her, if ever,

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.700 align:middle line:84%
is there anything that
I have to do for her?

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:46.810 align:middle line:84%
Or is there anything that
she's not happy about?

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>> A medium by bringing
through specific information,

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:53.950 align:middle line:84%
that nobody else
could possibly know,

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:56.840 align:middle line:90%
can reestablish a connection.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.370 align:middle line:90%


00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:05.190 align:middle line:84%
>> So I've got one rule
in my house, one rule.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:08.670 align:middle line:84%
If they come to me,
I've got a waiting room.

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And otherwise, I will
never have a life.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.070 align:middle line:84%
They will bother
me the whole time.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:16.610 align:middle line:90%
They will talk together.

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:18.180 align:middle line:90%
And that won't work.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:20.550 align:middle line:90%
I've still got to do life.

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.300 align:middle line:90%
I've got to have boundaries.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.950 align:middle line:84%
So they know the rule--
go to the waiting room,

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:27.405 align:middle line:90%
take a number, and wait.

00:08:27.405 --> 00:08:31.250 align:middle line:90%


00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.500 align:middle line:90%
Where they are, there's no time.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:34.490 align:middle line:90%
They've got no time.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:35.450 align:middle line:90%
So they can wait.

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:39.679 align:middle line:84%
And they respect my
boundaries and I respect them.

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Full of love, full of
compassion, full of--

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:46.820 align:middle line:90%
it's all about love.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:50.870 align:middle line:84%
They've got no pain in
that side, no sorrows.

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:52.640 align:middle line:90%
It's all about love.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.200 align:middle line:84%
They come through to
bring some healing.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.570 align:middle line:90%
And that's where I come in.

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:57.680 align:middle line:90%
That bridge?

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.655 align:middle line:90%
I'm that bridge.

00:08:58.655 --> 00:09:07.450 align:middle line:90%


00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>> There is currently
more scientific evidence

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:15.280 align:middle line:84%
to the reality of
near-death experience, NDE,

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.430 align:middle line:84%
than there is for how to
effectively treat certain forms

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:20.230 align:middle line:90%
of cancer.

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:28.430 align:middle line:90%


00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:31.930 align:middle line:84%
The idea of astral
travel is ancient

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:36.390 align:middle line:90%
and occurs in multiple cultures.

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:39.720 align:middle line:84%
The modern terminology
of astral projection

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.860 align:middle line:84%
was coined and promoted
by 19th century theorists.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.860 align:middle line:90%


00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:49.770 align:middle line:84%
It is sometimes
reported in association

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:52.770 align:middle line:84%
with dreams and
forms of meditation.

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:55.430 align:middle line:90%


00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:59.030 align:middle line:84%
According to the classical,
medieval, renaissance theories,

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:02.390 align:middle line:84%
the astral body is
an intermediate body

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:08.940 align:middle line:84%
of light linking the rational
soul to the physical body.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:14.070 align:middle line:84%
While the astral plane is an
intermediate world of light

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.095 align:middle line:90%
between heaven and Earth.

00:10:16.095 --> 00:10:24.910 align:middle line:90%


00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:28.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So my sister says, OK,
San, a friend of hers,

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:31.100 align:middle line:90%
her son is 17 years old.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:34.610 align:middle line:84%
He never spoke a
word in his life.

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:38.260 align:middle line:84%
So I started working
with the angels.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.750 align:middle line:84%
I'll use Raphael, that's
the angel of healing.

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
did on my brother.

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:46.460 align:middle line:90%


00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.320 align:middle line:90%
I go into meditation.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And I ask Raphael,
Raphael, come with me.

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:53.090 align:middle line:84%
I want to go and
heal my brother.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And then Raphael is
always there by my side.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.710 align:middle line:84%
What I did, the next
night, I thought, OK,

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:00.500 align:middle line:84%
if I can do this
with my brother,

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.710 align:middle line:90%
I can do with this boy.

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:04.760 align:middle line:90%
I went there.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:09.470 align:middle line:84%
In my mind, I said to him,
listen, my name is San.

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:11.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm here to guide you.

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:13.220 align:middle line:84%
What do you want
to say to your mom?

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:14.480 align:middle line:90%
Or is there something wrong?

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.850 align:middle line:90%
Can I help you?

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.630 align:middle line:84%
So he gave me a
whole list of stuff

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:21.850 align:middle line:90%
that he wasn't happy about--

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:25.120 align:middle line:84%
like, the bathwater
is too hot, or I

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.090 align:middle line:84%
don't like that food you
make, I love this song

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:31.280 align:middle line:90%
you sing to me every day.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.080 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And I thank you for what you,
my mother, is doing to me.

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:38.140 align:middle line:90%
I said to him, OK, goodbye.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.580 align:middle line:90%
And I went on my way.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And the next day I
went to his house.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw him, I
said, hello, I'm here.

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.670 align:middle line:90%
And he started rambling like,

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.170 align:middle line:90%
[RAMBLES]

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And his mother said he'd
never done that before.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.950 align:middle line:90%
He was trying to communicate.

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:56.080 align:middle line:90%
He heard my voice.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:56.930 align:middle line:90%
He heard me.

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:58.390 align:middle line:90%
He felt my energy.

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:01.855 align:middle line:84%
That was an amazing
experience as well.

00:12:01.855 --> 00:12:18.840 align:middle line:90%


00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:23.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I would be so happy about
the fact that I am going to meet

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:29.630 align:middle line:84%
Suzanne, today, because
it's been a dream come true

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:35.870 align:middle line:84%
for someone to come and help
me to clear all things that are

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:37.650 align:middle line:90%
going through my mind.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:42.165 align:middle line:84%
I would like Suzanne to help me
to get all the answers that I

00:12:42.165 --> 00:12:42.965 align:middle line:90%
have.

00:12:42.965 --> 00:12:46.180 align:middle line:90%


00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:49.510 align:middle line:84%
I've been missing my mom
for a long, long time now.

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:55.370 align:middle line:90%


00:12:55.370 --> 00:13:00.910 align:middle line:84%
She's always coming to me with
dreams, asking me some things.

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:04.450 align:middle line:90%


00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:09.070 align:middle line:84%
I just want to clear
some things with her.

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:22.530 align:middle line:90%


00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:23.970 align:middle line:90%
>> At long last we meet.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:35.510 align:middle line:90%


00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:38.750 align:middle line:84%
OK, so she's saying,
why do I have

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:43.070 align:middle line:84%
to wait so long
before you come here?

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:44.310 align:middle line:90%
I want to talk to you.

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:46.770 align:middle line:90%
She says, I want to talk to you.

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And these people take so
long for me to talk to you.

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:53.540 align:middle line:84%
She says, she's
very proud of you.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:56.120 align:middle line:90%
She's so proud of you.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:14:00.020 align:middle line:84%
So she says, A, why
do you fight so much--

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:03.270 align:middle line:84%
your children, your
siblings, others?

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:04.850 align:middle line:90%
Why do you fight so much?

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:07.550 align:middle line:90%
It must be peace and love there.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:11.900 align:middle line:84%
>> We are fighting with
her sister, our aunt.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:16.580 align:middle line:84%
There were this money
issue that our aunt

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:18.630 align:middle line:90%
was supposed to give it to us.

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:23.100 align:middle line:84%
But now, it takes a long time
for her to give it to us.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:27.510 align:middle line:84%
So we don't know what
really happened there.

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:30.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so she says, why
do you fight about money?

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:31.880 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:32.680 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.010 align:middle line:90%
Why do you fight about that?

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:36.180 align:middle line:90%
Make peace with it.

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.210 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:40.690 align:middle line:90%
I get these words, let it go.

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:43.290 align:middle line:90%
Let it go, she says.

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:47.400 align:middle line:84%
Because she sees no
other way for this.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:51.430 align:middle line:84%
She's saying, I'm just hearing
these words, let it go.

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:52.230 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:53.740 align:middle line:90%
>> We can't do it, because we--

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:54.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Let it go.

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:58.620 align:middle line:90%
It's no use hanging on to this.

00:14:58.620 --> 00:14:59.560 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:00.960 align:middle line:90%
Make peace.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.820 align:middle line:90%
Life is too short.

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:04.636 align:middle line:90%
Would she say that?

00:15:04.636 --> 00:15:08.070 align:middle line:90%
You know, would she say that?

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:12.270 align:middle line:84%
>> We have to always push in
life, because life is short.

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:13.800 align:middle line:90%
>> And she says, she's sorry.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.730 align:middle line:90%
She had to go.

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:17.250 align:middle line:90%
It was her time.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.980 align:middle line:90%
Her circle is complete.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:21.180 align:middle line:90%
Her circle is complete.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:23.740 align:middle line:90%
She had to leave.

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:26.310 align:middle line:90%
It was her time.

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:30.850 align:middle line:84%
It's not always a
great time for us,

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:33.190 align:middle line:90%
but for them, it's their time.

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:34.860 align:middle line:90%
And don't worry about her.

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:37.020 align:middle line:90%
She's happy where she is.

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:39.150 align:middle line:90%
She's in her heaven.

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:40.900 align:middle line:90%
She loves you very much.

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have
to worry one day.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And she wants to thank you,
thank you for everything

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:48.750 align:middle line:90%
you've done for her.

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:52.760 align:middle line:90%


00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And she says she
don't want to say it,

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:59.270 align:middle line:90%
but you're her favorite.

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:01.200 align:middle line:90%
She's not allowed to say that.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.960 align:middle line:90%
But she's going to say it now.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.980 align:middle line:90%
You're her favorite.

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:10.650 align:middle line:84%
Did you do something special
for her when she crossed over?

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:13.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I was doing
a ceremony after.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:16.420 align:middle line:90%
>> She said thank you for that.

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:18.150 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:20.070 align:middle line:90%
It touches my heart

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:20.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, no.

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:22.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you for that.

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:26.580 align:middle line:84%
She acknowledges you did
something for her in her honor,

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.910 align:middle line:90%
not like a funeral of sorts.

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:30.870 align:middle line:90%
She's not talking about--

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:33.790 align:middle line:84%
she's talking about something
special you did for her.

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:34.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:37.430 align:middle line:90%
>> She's thanking you for that.

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And did you change something
in your house where you stay?

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:45.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Nooo.

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:48.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Some color, she's
showing me a color.

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I painted a
new color in my house.

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:53.340 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't like that color.

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:55.900 align:middle line:90%
>> She doesn't like--

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>> She doesn't like that
color you paint in your house.

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't like that
color but it's, OK.

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:03.720 align:middle line:90%
I'll work with it.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.000 align:middle line:84%
She shows me your
daughter singing to her.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, they've got their song.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it?

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:12.079 align:middle line:84%
>> My mom, then no one
have to sing that song.

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, so she's
showing me the song.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.842 align:middle line:84%
She shows me your
daughter singing to her.

00:17:16.842 --> 00:17:17.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Singing to her, yes.

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.319 align:middle line:84%
>> So she sang a lot to
her when she was ill?

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:21.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, a lot.

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:25.790 align:middle line:84%
They've got this
song of both of them.

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:28.720 align:middle line:84%
So by the time we were
doing that ceremony,

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.660 align:middle line:90%
my sister knows this song.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.790 align:middle line:84%
So my sister was
singing this song.

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And my daughter
said, no, that is

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:41.050 align:middle line:84%
my song-- that is the song
of me and my grandmother.

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:42.230 align:middle line:90%
So stop it.

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:43.030 align:middle line:90%
Keep quiet.

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:43.510 align:middle line:90%
Leave it.

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:44.310 align:middle line:90%
It's our song.

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:45.520 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, so she's showing me.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.110 align:middle line:90%
She appreciates that song.

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:50.650 align:middle line:84%
And she still sings it
to her as if she's there.

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:52.630 align:middle line:84%
But tell your
daughter she's there.

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:54.250 align:middle line:90%
She's hearing that song.

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:55.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.415 align:middle line:90%
She will be happy to hear that.

00:17:57.415 --> 00:18:00.190 align:middle line:84%
>> She's really not here
for you only, you know that?

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:01.570 align:middle line:90%
She's here for your daughter.

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:05.710 align:middle line:84%
>> For my daughter, that's
what I also realize.

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:06.920 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not about you.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.800 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not, it's always
about my daughter.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:12.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, she's coming
through for her.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:18.300 align:middle line:84%
She'll be with her always,
as long as, she needs her.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:21.240 align:middle line:90%
She's showing me butterflies.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:24.480 align:middle line:84%
She's showing me
butterflies flying around--

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.086 align:middle line:90%
not one, a few.

00:18:26.086 --> 00:18:27.120 align:middle line:90%
>> A few of them.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.920 align:middle line:90%
>> A few of them, yeah.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.800 align:middle line:84%
She's showing me
these butterflies.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.590 align:middle line:90%
So ask your daughter.

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:34.740 align:middle line:90%
>> I'll ask her.

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:37.540 align:middle line:84%
I'll ask if she can
see the butterflies.

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:38.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Ask her.

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:40.860 align:middle line:84%
If you see the butterflies,
remember that's--

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:42.420 align:middle line:90%
>> That's her grandmother.

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, your grandmother
coming through.

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:52.080 align:middle line:84%
It's awesome, the signs they
send through for us to see.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:56.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And some of them, we just
ignore not knowing that--

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>> You're not looking.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:01.110 align:middle line:90%
You're so busy with life.

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:04.260 align:middle line:84%
Is there something you want
to say to her, a last word?

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:11.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I dream about
her, left me in a forest.

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>> This is how you feel
when she crossed over.

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.600 align:middle line:90%
There's that feeling.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:22.540 align:middle line:84%
This is relating to
that, when she died.

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:25.660 align:middle line:84%
When she died, this is
that-- this feeling you get.

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.220 align:middle line:84%
>> That feeling I
get in that forest.

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:28.300 align:middle line:90%
>> You left me.

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to work with
that for you to work that out,

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:39.520 align:middle line:84%
to go through that
process, to heal--

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.260 align:middle line:90%
>> To heal and to accept it.

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.642 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, because
you dream this--

00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:45.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Because it was terrifying.

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>> --it's the same.

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:47.980 align:middle line:90%
It's the same.

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:50.770 align:middle line:84%
So all she's saying
is, I'm here.

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:53.050 align:middle line:90%
That's all about healing.

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:58.540 align:middle line:84%
So she says, heal yourself
and be there for your kids.

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:03.170 align:middle line:84%
Be there for your loved
ones and heal yourself.

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:05.090 align:middle line:90%
This is the feeling.

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:06.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:07.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:08.070 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, mama.

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:16.720 align:middle line:90%


00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:19.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Suzanne helped
me a lot today.

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And it makes me very, very
happy that my mom is happy

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:26.140 align:middle line:90%
where she is.

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:30.115 align:middle line:84%
And with that dream,
she's always with me.

00:20:30.115 --> 00:20:37.460 align:middle line:90%


00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And I gained a lot from
her that, she told me

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:46.280 align:middle line:84%
the other things that I
was also asking myself--

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.650 align:middle line:84%
like, what is
happening to my life

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:52.730 align:middle line:84%
because I was having
an issue of a money.

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:56.030 align:middle line:90%
But she said, I must let it go.

00:20:56.030 --> 00:21:01.640 align:middle line:84%
I must take one thing at a time
as my mom used to say to me.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:14.060 align:middle line:90%


00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:17.230 align:middle line:84%
So it was a nice
session to meet her.

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And it makes me feel very, very
happy to get all the answers

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:23.620 align:middle line:90%
I was looking for.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:26.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm feeling so much light.

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:32.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling that all the burden
I was having it just get off

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:33.310 align:middle line:90%
my body.

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:35.420 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'm free.

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:40.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking forward to
whatever that life brings me.

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking forward
to being myself again.

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Many questions still
remain around mediums

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:52.150 align:middle line:84%
and their ability to talk to the
intermediate world or predict

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:52.950 align:middle line:90%
future outcomes.

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:56.410 align:middle line:90%


00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:59.280 align:middle line:84%
Questions that can only
be answered if you,

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.980 align:middle line:84%
yourself, are willing
to take the first step

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:04.160 align:middle line:90%
to the other side.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:23:04.000 align:middle line:90%
