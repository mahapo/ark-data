00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Healers are
multidimensional beings,

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.340 align:middle line:84%
who dance between the realms
of the seen and unseen.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.470 align:middle line:84%
These individuals
have the ability

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.580 align:middle line:84%
to facilitate a shift in
people, offering them insight

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:09.130 align:middle line:84%

with themselves and the greater

>> Where do I even begin?

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.975 align:middle line:84%
It's, kind of, like watching
someone stand there and take

00:01:20.975 --> 00:01:23.075 align:middle line:84%
a leap of faith,
watching them fly,

00:01:23.075 --> 00:01:24.450 align:middle line:84%
and then meeting
them in the sky.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.660 align:middle line:84%
It's the weirdest, weirdest
sensation because I start off,

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.120 align:middle line:84%
kind of, feeling, you know,
kind of, average, kind of, OK.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.250 align:middle line:84%
But then I bowed in front
of the fire just before,

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.125 align:middle line:84%
just to, like, put myself
in the right state,

00:01:34.125 --> 00:01:38.580 align:middle line:84%
and then screaming, ice cold,
ice cold, ice cold, ice cold,

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.455 align:middle line:84%
and feeling that
energy and feeling

00:01:40.455 --> 00:01:41.580 align:middle line:90%
the people walk towards me.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And their eyes light up as
they don't feel the fire

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.000 align:middle line:90%
beneath their feet.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.583 align:middle line:84%
And they're starting to get more
confident and more confident,

00:01:47.583 --> 00:01:50.760 align:middle line:84%
this beautiful, beautiful
moments of just feeling

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.180 align:middle line:84%

It's a metaphor for
conquering self.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.065 align:middle line:84%
It's a metaphor for
breaking through.

00:02:21.065 --> 00:02:22.690 align:middle line:84%
By breaking through,
we say, OK, if I'm

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.580 align:middle line:90%
able to walk across fire.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.635 align:middle line:84%
What else can I
possibly do in my life?

00:02:26.635 --> 00:02:31.310 align:middle line:90%


00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.950 align:middle line:10%
A firewalk is
essentially a practice

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.790 align:middle line:10%
that's been done for many, many
years by many, many cultures,

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.260 align:middle line:10%
and essentially, in its simplest
form, is walking across fire.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.750 align:middle line:84%
It's a concept where we want
to break through any fears

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.120 align:middle line:84%
that we have, any
unsupportive beliefs

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.490 align:middle line:84%
around our lives and
things that we want

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.790 align:middle line:90%
to achieve within our life.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.290 align:middle line:84%
>> For someone
that's never done it,

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.830 align:middle line:84%
the closest thing I can kind of
relate to that many people have

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.570 align:middle line:90%
done is running a marathon.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.940 align:middle line:84%
Like, I ran a marathon
once in my life.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And since that day, whenever I
meet a challenging situation,

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.550 align:middle line:90%
I know that I have done that.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.680 align:middle line:84%
So like, I can
handle most things.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.020 align:middle line:90%
And the fire is similar to that.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.990 align:middle line:84%
Once you've walked across
fire with bare feet,

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.710 align:middle line:84%
then when challenges arise or
you battle with your thoughts

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.790 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is,
that's always something

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.040 align:middle line:90%
you can take yourself back to.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.450 align:middle line:90%
And you know you can--

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.291 align:middle line:90%
that you can conquer that.

00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:28.280 align:middle line:84%
>> There'd be people
walking tonight.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.260 align:middle line:84%
What's quite a beautiful
process is at the start of this,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.150 align:middle line:84%
we may be sitting
down, we'll say,

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.402 align:middle line:84%
OK, so show of hands,
who's walked on fire?

00:03:35.402 --> 00:03:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And generally, you
find that people

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.930 align:middle line:84%
in a room, generally,
95% are what

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.670 align:middle line:90%
we love to call fire virgins.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.175 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll say, OK, so
who has an intention or plan

00:03:43.175 --> 00:03:45.050 align:middle line:84%
to actually walk this
evening, or say give us

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.090 align:middle line:84%
a show of hands, and
generally, another 10%

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.650 align:middle line:84%
of the people in the room
will put their hands up

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:49.733 align:middle line:90%
and say, yes, we're ready.

00:03:49.733 --> 00:03:50.900 align:middle line:90%
We're going to be walking.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.810 align:middle line:84%
But generally, let's call it
85% of the people in the room

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.550 align:middle line:90%
are not planning to walk.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we like
to see because we actually

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.942 align:middle line:84%
say to people that
when you're thinking

00:03:59.942 --> 00:04:02.150 align:middle line:84%
of going through the process,
don't make the decision

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.060 align:middle line:84%
to walk until you finally
step up to the fire

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.340 align:middle line:84%
because we have all
these preconceived ideas,

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.560 align:middle line:84%
maybe have had
incidents with fire,

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.240 align:middle line:90%
negative memories of fire.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.445 align:middle line:84%
So we, kind of, think
that it's a bit mental.

00:04:13.445 --> 00:04:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Like, why would
anybody want to walk

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.329 align:middle line:90%
across a beautifully hot fire?

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.670 align:middle line:84%
So we say, rather,
let's run the process.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.360 align:middle line:84%
We get people thinking about
the physiology and the science

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.460 align:middle line:90%
of fire and the human body.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.665 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the human body
is 70% to 75% water.

00:04:28.665 --> 00:04:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And in the same way, if you
had to take a plastic bottle,

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.180 align:middle line:84%
fill it with water, put
it over an open flame,

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.180 align:middle line:84%
that bottle is not going
to burn, not initially.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.410 align:middle line:90%
That water has to heat up.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And in the same way,
your body, if you

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.100 align:middle line:84%
were going to stand on
fire long enough, then

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.260 align:middle line:84%
maybe you would get-- you
would injure yourself.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.360 align:middle line:84%
But as a walk,
when you've raised

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.970 align:middle line:84%
your vibrational frequency
and the energy's being raised,

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.520 align:middle line:84%
then you're going to be
perfectly fine to walk.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.150 align:middle line:84%
It's important if
you're somebody

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.150 align:middle line:84%
who's considering doing
a firewalk that you make

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.872 align:middle line:84%
sure that you're working with
a correctly trained facilitator

00:04:55.872 --> 00:04:57.080 align:middle line:90%
who knows what they're doing.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.820 align:middle line:84%
Both Beatrix and
myself are trained

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.050 align:middle line:90%
firewalking instructors.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.190 align:middle line:84%
We've been through
a process where

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.830 align:middle line:84%
we understand how to prepare the
fire, how to prepare the wood,

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.420 align:middle line:84%
how to select the
wood correctly,

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.310 align:middle line:84%
and also how to take
people through a process

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.770 align:middle line:84%
and put them into a
state where they are then

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.500 align:middle line:84%
able and capable of
walking uninjured.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.975 align:middle line:84%
>> When people find out that
we are firewalking instructor

00:05:14.975 --> 00:05:18.410 align:middle line:84%
and we're having a brah, maybe,
then people will ask us, OK,

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.510 align:middle line:84%
so can we take some
calls and we go brah.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:21.942 align:middle line:90%
So no, we cannot.

00:05:21.942 --> 00:05:23.900 align:middle line:84%
From the moment we start
working with the fire,

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:29.540 align:middle line:84%
we set the intention for this
to be a cold, healing fire.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And while we're
building, while we're

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.935 align:middle line:84%
working, while we're
talking to people,

00:05:32.935 --> 00:05:34.250 align:middle line:90%
this is the intention we set.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Then we add to
that that tonight,

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.980 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be asking for
clear skies and gentle breezes.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And I can promise you, I've
seen this happen myself.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.743 align:middle line:84%
It can look like
it's going to rain.

00:05:44.743 --> 00:05:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And we start setting
the intention

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.860 align:middle line:84%
for the clear skies, gentle
breezes, and things clear up.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.010 align:middle line:84%
So this is part of
the intention setting.

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And when you do a firewalk
on a property like this

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.970 align:middle line:84%
at Shambhala, you will find
that nature and everything in it

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.060 align:middle line:84%
conspires to just
make it super special.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.225 align:middle line:84%
So we are really excited
about the walk tonight.

00:06:05.225 --> 00:06:10.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Elemental, ancient,
transformational,

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:15.230 align:middle line:84%
fire is primal, one of
the powers of nature,

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:19.700 align:middle line:84%
weaved into the shared
ancestry of humankind.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Across cultures, fire has
always carried significance.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.690 align:middle line:84%
And firewalking
has been practiced

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.980 align:middle line:84%
for thousands of years as
a form of introspection

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.100 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual release.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.510 align:middle line:84%
Today, firewalking instructors,
like Ceri and Beatrix,

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:43.760 align:middle line:84%
use very specific techniques
to build the ideal fire

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.620 align:middle line:84%
and to get you into a strong
physical and mental state

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.020 align:middle line:90%
for the journey ahead.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.090 align:middle line:84%
>> The moment you start
working with the fire,

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.840 align:middle line:84%
you have to put your best
intentions into the whole

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.390 align:middle line:84%
process and into the wood
because this is a fire that

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.700 align:middle line:84%
people are physically
literally going to walk on.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.420 align:middle line:84%
There are very specific types
of words that you can and cannot

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:06.220 align:middle line:90%
use.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.870 align:middle line:84%
You cannot, for example,
use a wood with a lot of sap

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.080 align:middle line:84%
because then, that wouldn't
be very good for walking on.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.020 align:middle line:84%
Over here at Shambhala,
we use protea wood,

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:19.290 align:middle line:84%
which grows natively, burns
for about two to three hours.

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:22.700 align:middle line:84%
So we have the wood
collected beforehand.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.200 align:middle line:90%
We start taking the wood.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.682 align:middle line:90%
And we start packing a fire.

00:07:25.682 --> 00:07:27.890 align:middle line:84%
They are different ways in
which you can pack a fire.

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Tonight, we will
make a center fire.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.480 align:middle line:90%
We will create the coals.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And then when we are ready,
we start the fire lighting

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.100 align:middle line:90%
ceremony.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So one of the things that
we do is we're not really a fan

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.710 align:middle line:84%
of using gasoline or petrol
or anything like that

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:44.000 align:middle line:90%
because it's rather dangerous.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.610 align:middle line:84%
If it's not used correctly,
you can injure yourself

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:47.690 align:middle line:90%
as a facilitator.

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:50.900 align:middle line:84%
So we prefer to use
sunflower cooking oil.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.750 align:middle line:90%
It's very light.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.620 align:middle line:84%
It takes a while to actually
get the wood to ignite.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And what it actually does
is it soaks into the wood.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:59.250 align:middle line:84%
So you have to work
a little bit harder

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:00.700 align:middle line:84%
to actually get the
wood to take it.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.492 align:middle line:84%
But when it takes it,
it takes beautifully.

00:08:02.492 --> 00:08:05.430 align:middle line:84%
The workers are really taken
aback because it just gives us

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.020 align:middle line:90%
this beautiful aroma and smell.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>> So my role is
the fire keeper.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.540 align:middle line:84%
So for me, that is a really nice
role because I love the fire.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm really connected
with the fire.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:18.570 align:middle line:84%
I will stand beside the
fire, come rain or storm,

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:19.980 align:middle line:90%
which we said will not come.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And whatever
distractions there are,

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.560 align:middle line:84%
my job is to have-- always
have my eyes on the fire.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.930 align:middle line:84%
We will make a really
big fire tonight.

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And so what will happen
eventually, some of the wood

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.580 align:middle line:90%
will start breaking as it burns.

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.309 align:middle line:84%
And I will have to use
the different tools

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:38.220 align:middle line:84%
that we have just to keep the
fire nice and tight together

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:41.740 align:middle line:84%
to generate that
really lots of heat.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.670 align:middle line:84%
>> So we'd initiate both the
fire and then set it alight.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:48.090 align:middle line:84%
We also ask people to set an
intention as to why they're

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:50.100 align:middle line:84%
going to walk, such as
like, we set an intention

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.017 align:middle line:90%
why they want to walk.

00:08:51.017 --> 00:08:52.450 align:middle line:90%
So is it conquering fear?

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:54.700 align:middle line:84%
Is it maybe something that
they want to break through?

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And then we get them to write
it down on a piece of paper,

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.000 align:middle line:84%
which they then wrap up
and then put into the wood.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.920 align:middle line:84%
Everybody just
connects with the fire

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.800 align:middle line:84%
and connects and
watches their intention

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.450 align:middle line:90%
be released and be burnt.

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.387 align:middle line:84%
And then we go and take
them into the beginning

00:09:09.387 --> 00:09:10.720 align:middle line:90%
of the next part of the process.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.095 align:middle line:84%
And this is really
where we start

00:09:12.095 --> 00:09:14.940 align:middle line:84%
to share stories, both personal
stories, stories in terms

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.390 align:middle line:84%
of-- so, for example, why I walk
on fire and my first connection

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.640 align:middle line:84%
with the fire and what
it's done in my life,

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.200 align:middle line:84%
and then, kind of,
sharing other stories.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.990 align:middle line:84%
So we'll start to
go into concepts.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.040 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about
what fear is and why

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.290 align:middle line:90%
we would want to walk on fire.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.570 align:middle line:84%
So we're really giving people
something to think about.

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:35.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And as we we're talking about
the state that you're in when

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:36.150 align:middle line:90%
you walk on the fire.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.090 align:middle line:84%
So this is something very
important to know is that you

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:41.110 align:middle line:84%
cannot be intoxicated
in any way.

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:43.038 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be of a
completely sober mind

00:09:43.038 --> 00:09:44.580 align:middle line:84%
because what you're
going to be doing

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.420 align:middle line:84%
is you're going to go
deep within yourself,

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.410 align:middle line:84%
within your own mind, and
go and search for that power

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:52.110 align:middle line:90%
to overcome what is almost--

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:53.640 align:middle line:90%
what we assume to be natural.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.745 align:middle line:84%
And for that, we need our
full faculties present.

00:09:56.745 --> 00:10:00.870 align:middle line:90%


00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:03.120 align:middle line:84%
Towards the end when
the coals are ready,

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.190 align:middle line:84%
we will go back to
the runway, and we'll

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:09.240 align:middle line:84%
start laying the ice or
the popcorn on the runway.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.890 align:middle line:90%
Ceri will pack the runway.

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:14.430 align:middle line:84%
So we have bought
grass We bought

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:16.390 align:middle line:84%
eight square meters,
which is a little bit more

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:17.190 align:middle line:90%
than what we need.

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:18.730 align:middle line:90%
But we'd like to be safe.

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:21.750 align:middle line:84%
So we will lay the runway
straight or slightly curved

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:24.730 align:middle line:84%
depending on the area
where we're going to walk.

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:28.530 align:middle line:84%
Once he's laid the runway,
I will go and make sure

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:31.840 align:middle line:84%
that it's even, that there are
no gaps or holes or anything

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:32.640 align:middle line:90%
sticking out.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is all to
keep the walkers safe

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.430 align:middle line:84%
and just to make
sure that everyone

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:41.110 align:middle line:84%
is going to have a very
good experience with this.

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:44.010 align:middle line:84%
>> So the process will take
people through beyond that is

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:45.580 align:middle line:84%
we would get
everybody to stand up.

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:47.538 align:middle line:84%
We would get everybody
to take their shoes off.

00:10:47.538 --> 00:10:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And then we will get
them to visualize

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:50.520 align:middle line:90%
walking across the fire.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.290 align:middle line:84%
So we'll get everybody
to close their eyes

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:55.560 align:middle line:84%
and imagine standing at
the front of the fire

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.200 align:middle line:84%
and comfortably, not
running, not at a fast pace,

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.320 align:middle line:84%
but just gently and slowly
just taking one step off

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.150 align:middle line:84%
to the next, walking
across the fire,

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:05.820 align:middle line:84%
and then getting to the other
end and actually celebrating.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.280 align:middle line:84%
Now why is celebration such
an important component?

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, because firstly, you've
just walked across fire.

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:11.730 align:middle line:90%
So you should celebrate.

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:14.700 align:middle line:84%
In addition to that, any
time we've achieved something

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.070 align:middle line:84%
momentous in our lives,
it's important to celebrate

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:18.520 align:middle line:90%
because that's how we anchor it.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And once we've
anchored it, that's

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.272 align:middle line:90%
something that you can draw on.

00:11:21.272 --> 00:11:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Every time you look back
on that momentous occasion,

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.160 align:middle line:84%
you're going, OK, well,
that's how I actually

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.060 align:middle line:84%
can move through this or conquer
this situation in my life.

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:32.310 align:middle line:84%
So we will practice
that in the mind.

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:34.802 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll physically
walk in the room.

00:11:34.802 --> 00:11:36.510 align:middle line:84%
There are obviously
some important things

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:39.300 align:middle line:84%
to consider as well when
we walk across the fire.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.670 align:middle line:84%
We don't look down because
the moment we look down,

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:43.950 align:middle line:84%
the mind is going to say,
oh, I'm walking on fire.

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, I'm
supposed to get burnt

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:47.260 align:middle line:84%
or I'm supposed
to get a blister.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:48.927 align:middle line:84%
So it's very important,
in the same way,

00:11:48.927 --> 00:11:51.090 align:middle line:84%
when you set a goal
and an intention,

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:52.025 align:middle line:90%
you look at your goal.

00:11:52.025 --> 00:11:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
you walk towards.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And in the same way,
when we walk on fire,

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:55.980 align:middle line:90%
we don't look down.

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:58.740 align:middle line:84%
But we rather look up to where
we are-- where we are headed.

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.210 align:middle line:90%
So we practice that.

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
thing we'll do is

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:03.480 align:middle line:84%
we'll go into a state
of actually raising

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.600 align:middle line:84%
the vibrational frequency
because fire has

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.110 align:middle line:90%
its own vibrational frequency.

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And if your
vibrational frequency

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:12.292 align:middle line:84%
is lower than that of the
fire, there is a chance

00:12:12.292 --> 00:12:13.500 align:middle line:90%
that you can injure yourself.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.810 align:middle line:84%
So by raising the
vibrational frequency,

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:17.880 align:middle line:84%
then you can comfortably
walk across the fire.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.680 align:middle line:90%
We then have a beautiful chant.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And we progressively
will repeat the chant

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.020 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over.

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And as we do this, it gets
louder and more exciting

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:27.180 align:middle line:90%
and more energetic.

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And we end off with
a yes, yes, yes.

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:32.640 align:middle line:90%
>> How we open the fire is--

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.920 align:middle line:84%
actually the runway,
to start walking,

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:39.840 align:middle line:84%
is that one of the facilitators
will usually walk first.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And this just gives the people
that are going to walk with us

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:45.480 align:middle line:84%
the confidence that
yes, this is doable.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, nothing's
going to happen with me.

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to have that
same amazing feeling that I've

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.600 align:middle line:90%
seen in the facilitator.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.833 align:middle line:84%
>> We'll then stop the first
person, get them into state.

00:12:54.833 --> 00:12:56.500 align:middle line:84%
So we'll say, OK, now
when you're ready,

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.960 align:middle line:90%
I want you to go, yes, yes, yes.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And at the point that they
start walking, we are then

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:03.300 align:middle line:84%
going to collectively,
as a community, we're

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:06.900 align:middle line:84%
going to chant, ice cold, ice
cold, ice cold, because again,

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.090 align:middle line:84%
we're sending messages to
the mind to say, listen,

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:10.110 align:middle line:90%
this is not fire.

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:10.950 align:middle line:90%
This is ice cold.

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:13.450 align:middle line:84%
It's popcorn, or it's blocks
of ice that I'm walking across.

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:16.590 align:middle line:84%
So everybody would be chanting,
ice cold, ice cold, ice cold.

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:17.605 align:middle line:90%
They get to the end.

00:13:17.605 --> 00:13:19.980 align:middle line:84%
There is somebody always
waiting at the end of the runway

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:21.000 align:middle line:90%
to receive them.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And when they receive them,
they give them a nice big hug.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:25.870 align:middle line:90%
They scream like mad.

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:26.910 align:middle line:90%
They jump up and down.

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And they really,
really do celebrate.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
most amazing things

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.580 align:middle line:84%
as well is that by the end
of the night, invariably

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.402 align:middle line:90%
95% to 100% of the people walk.

00:13:35.402 --> 00:13:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And they can't even believe
themselves that they've walked.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And once they've
walked the first time.

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:41.620 align:middle line:84%
I always love to ask,
OK, who's walked?

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:42.870 align:middle line:90%
Everybody puts their hands up.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:44.662 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, who would
like to walk again?

00:13:44.662 --> 00:13:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And everybody puts
their hands up.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.740 align:middle line:90%


00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.815 align:middle line:84%

We have just completed one
of the most amazing firewalks

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.040 align:middle line:90%
here at Shambhala.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.720 align:middle line:84%
There was so many
things going on.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.280 align:middle line:84%
I've been at a
number of firewalks,

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:35.090 align:middle line:84%
where the elements have,
kind of, played havoc.

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:38.140 align:middle line:84%
And tonight was probably one
of the most intense moments

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:38.940 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:43.000 align:middle line:84%
So we had, as we started
the fire, beautiful flames.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing,
the heavens opened up.

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:46.070 align:middle line:90%
And the rain came down.

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And I found myself in a moment,
almost a moment of a wavering

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:53.210 align:middle line:84%
faith because I was like,
here I am standing alone,

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:54.500 align:middle line:90%
tendering this fire.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And the rain is pouring
down, the wind's blowing,

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.660 align:middle line:84%
and I'm like, is this
firewalk going to happen?

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And in true character and
nature of believing and trusting

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:08.130 align:middle line:84%
in the firewalk, in the process,
we asked for clear skies.

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:09.380 align:middle line:90%
We asked for gentle breezes.

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And we asked for an
ice cold healing fire.

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:13.520 align:middle line:90%
And that's exactly what we got.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.770 align:middle line:84%
When went in to
facilitate and raise

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:18.619 align:middle line:84%
the energy with everybody, the
heavens opened up even more.

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:19.700 align:middle line:90%
And it poured down.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.829 align:middle line:84%
And literally, as
we finished up,

00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:25.490 align:middle line:84%
and we started to walk out to
the fire, the heavens closed.

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:26.900 align:middle line:90%
And the rain stopped.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And we poured the
coals onto the runway.

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:32.630 align:middle line:90%
And we got everybody into state.

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:33.590 align:middle line:90%
And we walked.

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And the most amazing thing was
everybody walked three times

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:39.750 align:middle line:84%
and had the most
amazing experience.

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it's
just such a gift

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:45.110 align:middle line:84%
to be able to facilitate growth
and healing-- spiritual growth

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:47.450 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual healing
in other people

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:50.420 align:middle line:90%
through this process of fire.

But I'm also known as Mr.

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:55.490 align:middle line:90%
Owl or Owlbino.

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:56.598 align:middle line:90%
I didn't firewalk myself.

00:17:56.598 --> 00:17:58.640 align:middle line:84%
But what I did do was
receive every single person

00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:59.440 align:middle line:90%
that did firewalk.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.730 align:middle line:84%
So earlier, while we
were preparing the space,

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:04.040 align:middle line:84%
Ceri was very clearly
telling us about incidents

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.560 align:middle line:84%
where he was able
to open up the fire

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:08.960 align:middle line:84%
and the fire would actually
cause the rain to stop.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And then as soon as they
would close the fire,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.410 align:middle line:90%
the rain would come back.

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:14.510 align:middle line:84%
Now as far fetched as
this felt, the storm

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:15.830 align:middle line:90%
has been coming in for hours.

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:17.847 align:middle line:84%
We've been feeling the
rain pouring down on us.

00:18:17.847 --> 00:18:18.680 align:middle line:90%
Everything is muddy.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:19.790 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's cold.

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:23.300 align:middle line:84%
But yet, the second we
decided to step outside,

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.447 align:middle line:90%
the rain stopped, generous.

00:18:26.447 --> 00:18:27.530 align:middle line:90%
I wish I was making it up.

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:30.530 align:middle line:84%
But it's a good thing we got it
on camera because it stopped.

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:32.912 align:middle line:84%
And then after we were
done, it came back.

00:18:32.912 --> 00:18:34.370 align:middle line:84%
So what's phenomenal
about the walk

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:36.710 align:middle line:84%
itself is that the
serendipity of how it happened

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:38.330 align:middle line:84%
is a very deep and
intricate story.

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:40.970 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, the people
that facilitated it and I,

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:42.678 align:middle line:84%
we we're meant to be
in Egypt last week.

00:18:42.678 --> 00:18:43.970 align:middle line:90%
And we're meant to go together.

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And the flight got postponed
two different times

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:47.900 align:middle line:90%
so that we could do work here.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's super important
and super incredible

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:52.337 align:middle line:84%
to know that spirit is
moving with us right now.

00:18:52.337 --> 00:18:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And every single moment
we're spending here,

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:55.378 align:middle line:90%
we're learning something new.

00:18:55.378 --> 00:18:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And people's eyes
are being opened.

00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And love is chasing
away, chasing away

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.270 align:middle line:90%
the very concept of impossible.

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:03.070 align:middle line:90%

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:10.618 align:middle line:90%
He didn't really mind.

00:19:10.618 --> 00:19:12.410 align:middle line:84%

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:59.840 align:middle line:90%
And it felt amazing.

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:05.540 align:middle line:10%
My intention was that I'm
releasing all fear and anxiety

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:08.210 align:middle line:10%
I have surrounding
the birth of my baby

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:09.770 align:middle line:10%
that I'm going to
have in six weeks.

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:11.090 align:middle line:90%
It's a free birth.

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:14.240 align:middle line:90%
So it's really been a lot on me.

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.200 align:middle line:90%
And I feel fantastic now.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.000 align:middle line:90%
I feel fearless.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.910 align:middle line:90%
I feel free and so positive.

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:22.265 align:middle line:84%
It was a great, great,
great experience.

00:20:22.265 --> 00:20:23.645 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:20:23.645 --> 00:20:27.560 align:middle line:84%
>> I started by walking just
about two years ago when I

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.800 align:middle line:84%
learned to become a
firewalking instructor.

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Tonight, we hosted a
firewalk here at Shambhala.

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:37.190 align:middle line:10%
And I walked two or
three times myself.

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:39.230 align:middle line:84%
For me, tonight was
a very special walk

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:41.780 align:middle line:84%
as I tended the fire
throughout the rain.

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And he was so resilient
and so strong.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.670 align:middle line:84%
We ended up having
a beautiful walk.

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And for me, personally,
today, the walk

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:54.560 align:middle line:84%
was very, very special as my
intention tonight with the walk

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:59.720 align:middle line:84%
was to take back my power and
step into a life of sobriety.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.140 align:middle line:90%
>> I've never firewalked before.

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:02.380 align:middle line:90%
This was my first time.

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:04.120 align:middle line:90%
It was oddly calming.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.410 align:middle line:84%
Hey, I'm going to
step onto the coals.

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:08.810 align:middle line:10%
Just this complete sense
of calm came toward me.

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:10.190 align:middle line:90%
And I walked slowly as I could.

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:11.210 align:middle line:90%
I didn't feel a thing.

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:14.363 align:middle line:84%
I think his name is Mr. Owl was
saying how serendipitous it is.

00:21:14.363 --> 00:21:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And for me, as well, I,
kind of, just wandered

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.530 align:middle line:84%
through the fire earlier
because I like fires.

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:21.064 align:middle line:84%
And then I found out we're
going to be firewalking.

00:21:21.064 --> 00:21:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And well, fate has
brought me here.

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:23.840 align:middle line:90%
I've got to do this now.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:25.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm happy that I did
it and took the plunge

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:27.860 align:middle line:84%
and didn't give into
fear, like someone else,

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:29.420 align:middle line:90%
because I was afraid.

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>> me, that's one of the most
amazing things is to watch

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:35.900 align:middle line:84%
people go through this
process, to see the anxiety

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:39.442 align:middle line:84%
in their being slowly dissipate
because as you're talking

00:21:39.442 --> 00:21:41.150 align:middle line:84%
to them as you're
sharing these concepts.

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And these ideas with them, so
their-- you can see it's, kind

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.770 align:middle line:84%
of, like the light bulbs going
on, and they're kind of going,

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:46.930 align:middle line:90%
oh, well, maybe--

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:47.833 align:middle line:90%
maybe I'll walk.

00:21:47.833 --> 00:21:50.000 align:middle line:84%
You see when they reach out
for the indemnity forms.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.828 align:middle line:84%
I go, OK, well, let me fill
in a form just in case.

00:21:52.828 --> 00:21:54.120 align:middle line:90%
And that's quite nice, you see.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.967 align:middle line:84%
And then when they're all
fully charged and excited,

00:21:56.967 --> 00:21:59.300 align:middle line:84%
and they walk out to the fire,
and you can, kind of, see

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:01.400 align:middle line:90%
there's the sense of purpose.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And then when
people finally start

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:05.940 align:middle line:84%
walking and everybody's
chanting, ice cold, ice cold,

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:06.740 align:middle line:90%
ice cold.

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
unity and this unison.

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's
working together.

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:12.110 align:middle line:84%
And they're all
supporting each other.

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:13.700 align:middle line:90%
And then that person walks.

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:14.880 align:middle line:90%
They get to the end.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:15.770 align:middle line:90%
They celebrate.

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And they go a second
time and a third time.

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:20.107 align:middle line:84%
And then everybody just
wants to hug everybody

00:22:20.107 --> 00:22:22.190 align:middle line:84%
because they've just gone
through the most amazing

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:23.960 align:middle line:84%
transformational
process that they can't

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.490 align:middle line:90%
believe that they've just done.

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:29.540 align:middle line:84%
It's just such a gift to be able
to facilitate that development

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:30.450 align:middle line:90%
in people's lives.

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And I just really feel
blessed and honored

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:32.975 align:middle line:90%
to be able to do that.

00:22:32.975 --> 00:22:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and even afterwards
when you meet some

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:38.297 align:middle line:84%
of the people, again, and you
see the real changes they made

00:22:38.297 --> 00:22:40.880 align:middle line:84%
in their lives just because they
went through that experience,

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.297 align:middle line:84%
where they did something that
they never thought they'd be

00:22:43.297 --> 00:22:45.530 align:middle line:84%
able to do, and just
witnessing that is, like,

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:46.970 align:middle line:90%
that's the biggest gift of all.

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:50.320 align:middle line:10%
