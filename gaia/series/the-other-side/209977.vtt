>> When most of us
hear the term medium,

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:54.460 align:middle line:84%
we think of Ouija boards,
tarot cards, and crystal balls.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.800 align:middle line:84%
But there is more to
mediums than Hollywood

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.690 align:middle line:90%
has led us to believe.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.600 align:middle line:84%
Mediums believe do not
speak with the dead,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.450 align:middle line:84%
as there is no such
thing as death.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.330 align:middle line:84%
There is only a transition
from the physical being

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.910 align:middle line:84%
to the spiritual
being, and mediums

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.790 align:middle line:84%
are sensitive and
intuitive enough

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.540 align:middle line:84%
to hear, feel, and
see information

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.995 align:middle line:90%
coming from the other side.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.710 align:middle line:84%
>> As I went through life
and made more mistakes,

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.760 align:middle line:84%
I started getting the calling
where I started having

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.170 align:middle line:84%
nightmares and experiences
with something pushing me down

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.625 align:middle line:90%
and having sleep paralysis.

00:01:52.625 --> 00:01:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
realized I was having

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.020 align:middle line:84%
an awakening, which means to
awaken to who you really are.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And that was really
hard because I'd

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:09.430 align:middle line:84%
become a horrible mess
due to my upbringing.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And so that awakening was
pretty harsh and severe,

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.450 align:middle line:90%
but I didn't take it seriously.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.320 align:middle line:90%
So in 2005, I got ill.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.470 align:middle line:84%
I had trapped nerves,
and I just was

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.120 align:middle line:90%
in a lot of pain for six months.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And they operated, and it
still didn't do anything.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.750 align:middle line:84%
So I started realizing
that there was

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.430 align:middle line:90%
more to what was wrong with me.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And part of what was
wrong was that I was not

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.880 align:middle line:90%
accessing my intuition.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.400 align:middle line:84%
I was not working on my gift,
which was to be a messenger

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.590 align:middle line:84%
and to heal and to download
information and then

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.640 align:middle line:90%
pass that on.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.840 align:middle line:84%
So I know that I can
connect to the other side

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.540 align:middle line:84%
because my mom used to tell
stories about me speaking

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.790 align:middle line:90%
to ghosts when I was young.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.640 align:middle line:84%
But very, very strong
empath is what's

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.850 align:middle line:84%
more important, because
strong empaths are usually

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.250 align:middle line:90%
psychics and mediums.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And it ended up where
I needed to embrace

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.480 align:middle line:84%
all my myths and my
disasters for that intuition

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.420 align:middle line:84%
to really start
kicking in so that I

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.730 align:middle line:84%
could see everybody and
everything from the other side.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.270 align:middle line:84%
So I am known as
a psychic medium,

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.750 align:middle line:84%
but those are the
tools that I use

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.550 align:middle line:84%
to bring you closer to what's
really important in life.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.350 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness, your inner
self, being connected

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.655 align:middle line:90%
to something more profound.

00:03:44.655 --> 00:03:47.880 align:middle line:90%


00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.320 align:middle line:84%
If I look back on my family
to see who has the gifts,

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.100 align:middle line:84%
I've got a grandmother that
I kind of grew up with,

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.780 align:middle line:90%
a Portuguese lady.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.450 align:middle line:90%
And she's my spiritual guide.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.120 align:middle line:84%
She came to me
about 12 years ago,

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.660 align:middle line:84%
and she helped me with healing
and anything to do with health.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.050 align:middle line:84%
So I think she must have
had the gift, because she's

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.460 align:middle line:84%
the one that guides
me in that area.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.840 align:middle line:84%
Other than that, I do
not know of anybody

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.180 align:middle line:90%
that has these abilities.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.410 align:middle line:84%
But having said that, I
also believe that we all

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.000 align:middle line:90%
have these abilities.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.760 align:middle line:90%
We all have these gifts.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.310 align:middle line:84%
This is not something special
for me that I can act special.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.830 align:middle line:84%
The only difference is that
my trauma kept me connected,

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.305 align:middle line:84%
but we can all connect
in the same way.

00:04:40.305 --> 00:04:43.540 align:middle line:90%


00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.470 align:middle line:84%
>> So I come from a very
big family of five siblings,

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.640 align:middle line:84%
and my parents have been
privileged to have 16

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.370 align:middle line:84%
grandchildren and 12
great-grandchildren of which

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.930 align:middle line:84%
my mother has the privilege
of seeing growing up.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Poor dad passed away in 2013
after quite a long illness.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.660 align:middle line:90%
We miss you, Dad.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.280 align:middle line:90%
We miss you terribly.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.260 align:middle line:90%
And I hope you'll come through.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.400 align:middle line:84%
You're a fantastic
man, a loyal father,

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:18.120 align:middle line:84%
an absolute rock of a man whose
only privilege in his life

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.250 align:middle line:84%
was that he raised
six beautiful children

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.630 align:middle line:90%
and all his grandchildren.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And he always used
to say to us, if you

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.690 align:middle line:84%
want to know what
success means in life,

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.020 align:middle line:84%
it means having your
children grow up healthy,

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.510 align:middle line:84%
watching them grow
old, and making sure

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.450 align:middle line:90%
that everybody is happy.

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.540 align:middle line:84%
Through my journey in life,
I became a Reiki master,

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.970 align:middle line:84%
and I've had the
absolute privilege

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.520 align:middle line:84%
of treating and dealing
with so many people

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.400 align:middle line:84%
who have reached
out to me for help

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.770 align:middle line:84%
for all sorts of
different reasons.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Of course, what
we do when we work

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.540 align:middle line:84%
with electromagnetic
fields and energy, chakras,

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.670 align:middle line:84%
and when we work
with affirmations,

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.880 align:middle line:84%
and when we do a lot of
different types of therapies

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.350 align:middle line:90%
with people, so much comes out.

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.020 align:middle line:84%
And the most
amazing thing is how

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.670 align:middle line:90%
everything connects together.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:06.690 align:middle line:90%
And why?

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.000 align:middle line:84%
Because right this
weekend I decided

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.490 align:middle line:84%
to block my cottage and
suites so that I wouldn't

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.740 align:middle line:84%
have any guests so
that I could help

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.570 align:middle line:90%
some elderly people on Sunday.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:16.830 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.130 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm meant to be here
because I have the whole day

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:24.420 align:middle line:84%
today to be able to experience
what I'm going to experience.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>> What I can really pick up is
that there's two major losses

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.910 align:middle line:90%
that you've had.

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like you're
buzzing with people around.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.140 align:middle line:90%
So let's get started.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.940 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:39.740 align:middle line:90%
So it's Ingrid.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.370 align:middle line:84%
What's your first--
your surname?

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Fish.

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.930 align:middle line:90%
>> F-I-S-H. Just like that.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:46.900 align:middle line:90%
>> F-I-S-H.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:47.700 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:48.690 align:middle line:90%
And your birthday?

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:53.460 align:middle line:90%
>> 20th of May, 1960.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.250 align:middle line:90%
So let's have a look here.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Your life path
number is basically,

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.720 align:middle line:90%
what is your soul's mission?

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.310 align:middle line:90%
Who are you as a person?

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.530 align:middle line:90%
What's your soul's character?

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And what are you
supposed to be doing?

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.600 align:middle line:84%
So that will then
tie in with, why

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.540 align:middle line:90%
have you had such ups and downs?

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:13.542 align:middle line:90%
Why has that happened?

00:07:13.542 --> 00:07:15.750 align:middle line:84%
Because it'll lead you to
what you're supposed to do,

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:16.900 align:middle line:90%
so this is very important.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:17.700 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.210 align:middle line:84%
So this vibration,
the five, tells me

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:24.450 align:middle line:84%
that this here, there's
been a lot of things

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:26.100 align:middle line:90%
that have shifted for you.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:30.210 align:middle line:84%
A lot of things that have
changed, lots of ups and downs.

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm feeling your energy,
it feels like enough energy,

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:39.930 align:middle line:84%
like I've changed
something and it's enough.

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.190 align:middle line:84%
I feel like there's a
person watching over you.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.280 align:middle line:90%
He's quite a big guy.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:51.820 align:middle line:10%
He's strong and he's from
a long time ago, he says.

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Did you have an uncle or a close
friend of your dad that died

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:56.710 align:middle line:90%
or something?

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:57.610 align:middle line:90%
>> My uncle.

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:57.940 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.230 align:middle line:90%
Because I feel like this--

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:01.960 align:middle line:84%
let me just bring him in
because he's coming through.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.060 align:middle line:84%
He's telling me he's
connected very closely

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.870 align:middle line:84%
to the masculine
that brought you up.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:11.680 align:middle line:90%
[SIGH] Men in your life--

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.610 align:middle line:84%
you struggle with boundaries,
so the men in your life

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:19.360 align:middle line:90%
have harmed you.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like he's been
the one that's been trying

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.820 align:middle line:90%
to protect you during these--

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:27.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's three
different situations.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.000 align:middle line:84%
>> These three
different situations,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.730 align:middle line:84%
I feel like he's been the one
that's been there to protect

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:35.650 align:middle line:90%
you and to guide you.

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:39.340 align:middle line:84%
Next to him but not with
him is a feminine energy.

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm picking up a
very lady vibration.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.410 align:middle line:90%
Was this your mom or something?

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:45.970 align:middle line:90%
Because that-- or an auntie?

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:47.530 align:middle line:84%
Because I feel like
you guys are very

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:49.960 align:middle line:90%
similar in your vibrations.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, not my
mother or an aunt.

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Was it a friend
of yours, or--

00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:00.550 align:middle line:90%
she says you talk to her a lot.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:02.020 align:middle line:84%
There's some shift
that you needed

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:05.230 align:middle line:84%
to take this year,
a different turn,

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:08.080 align:middle line:84%
and I feel like she's been
guiding you with that turn that

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.355 align:middle line:90%
had to be now or never.

00:09:09.355 --> 00:09:11.980 align:middle line:90%


00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:16.840 align:middle line:84%
I feel a disconnect with a
parent when you were younger.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:21.700 align:middle line:84%
That was more-- it affected you
more than what you've made out.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.550 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] Because
you're very good.

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:26.410 align:middle line:84%
You've got survivor
energy, you know?

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:30.020 align:middle line:90%
That one that, I can handle.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:34.300 align:middle line:84%
But I feel like
you actually don't.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:35.470 align:middle line:90%
You're sensitive.

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:36.830 align:middle line:90%
You're very soft.

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:38.750 align:middle line:90%
You're very vulnerable.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:42.760 align:middle line:84%
So there's this part
of you that's strong.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying
you're not strong.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.870 align:middle line:90%
It's not real.

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:48.370 align:middle line:90%
Actually, very soft inside.

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:50.720 align:middle line:90%
You break easily.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.865 align:middle line:84%
You just wouldn't
tell from the outside.

00:09:53.865 --> 00:09:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And you'd be saying this
would only be in the last two

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.040 align:middle line:90%
years?

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:01.880 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I'm saying that in
the last two years she's been

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.140 align:middle line:90%
helping you with a major shift.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:08.120 align:middle line:84%
Like in the last two years,
you've changed dramatically.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:13.525 align:middle line:84%
>> And she's saying it's got a
lot to do with some disconnect

00:10:13.525 --> 00:10:17.840 align:middle line:84%
with a parent and some inner
workings that have gone

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.640 align:middle line:90%
in in you.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:19.540 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:20.830 align:middle line:90%
>> That makes sense, yeah.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I also feel like you've
got talents that you are only

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:27.250 align:middle line:84%
really starting
to understand now.

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:31.300 align:middle line:90%
Healing abilities, intuition.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.890 align:middle line:90%
You're also a messenger, hey?

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:36.430 align:middle line:84%
You've got, like--
only way to describe

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:39.700 align:middle line:84%
it is when it comes out,
it sounds almost musical.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.935 align:middle line:84%
It just works and snaps things
into place energetically.

00:10:42.935 --> 00:10:43.810 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean.

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:44.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:44.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:45.910 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] I'm with you.

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:46.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:47.860 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.650 align:middle line:84%
>> This year, you are
supposed to be expanding,

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:53.450 align:middle line:84%
so people are supposed to
be knowing who you are,

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:57.550 align:middle line:84%
what you do, what you
expect expertise of.

00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:01.190 align:middle line:90%
But not what you're doing.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:02.650 align:middle line:90%
It's you.

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:04.360 align:middle line:90%
You are the thing.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.910 align:middle line:84%
You are the one that
brings everything together.

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:08.710 align:middle line:84%
You've got quite
an incredible mind

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:14.058 align:middle line:84%
in terms of seeing things and
then just making it happen.

00:11:14.058 --> 00:11:15.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why, but
I'm getting a message

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:19.870 align:middle line:84%
from that protector
to tell you to be

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:23.230 align:middle line:84%
very picky about what
you do, because there's

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:25.960 align:middle line:90%
a little bit of--

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.880 align:middle line:84%
insecurity's not the
right word for you

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.320 align:middle line:84%
because you have
a warrior energy.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.690 align:middle line:90%
It's like uncertainty.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:31.490 align:middle line:90%
Can I?

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:33.040 align:middle line:90%
Can I?

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.670 align:middle line:84%
You must get rid of that
because you must go, go, go,

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:39.405 align:middle line:84%
but you also have
to be very picky.

00:11:39.405 --> 00:11:44.140 align:middle line:84%
Don't settle for low
vibrational work.

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:45.550 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:48.880 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm seeing this as the
start of something totally,

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.958 align:middle line:90%
totally new for you.

00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.500 align:middle line:84%
I feel like the last
two years you've

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.660 align:middle line:90%
had one issue after another.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.660 align:middle line:84%
Like, little things
happening within your life

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.150 align:middle line:84%
and in your friends' lives
and your family's lives.

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:03.160 align:middle line:84%
Like, stuff has been
happening around you.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:03.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:04.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.630 align:middle line:84%
>> That has triggered
internal thinking,

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:13.330 align:middle line:84%
internal work that has
changed you as a person.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Now I feel like whatever
you've been doing--

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:18.140 align:middle line:90%
not your decision.

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:19.210 align:middle line:90%
It's a calling.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:22.460 align:middle line:84%
There is more that
you need to be doing.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And that has now come up
now, now that there's more.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>> But I'm wanting
to slow down now.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.780 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.100 align:middle line:90%
>> That's not possible.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.198 align:middle line:84%
What you can maybe
do is pull back.

00:12:36.198 --> 00:12:37.240 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what I'm doing.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.670 align:middle line:90%
But you're too important.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:43.600 align:middle line:84%
I feel like all these things
that you've been going through

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.080 align:middle line:84%
are leading you to
this new decision

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.150 align:middle line:90%
that you can't close the door.

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:50.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Look, I mean, it's
entirely your decision,

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:55.320 align:middle line:84%
but I just feel like
you'll be blocked

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.320 align:middle line:84%
and you might even get
more ill because it's

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.370 align:middle line:90%
going against who you are.

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:03.060 align:middle line:84%
You're a sharer, a
traveler, an adventurer.

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:04.380 align:middle line:90%
You're very sensual.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:07.290 align:middle line:84%
You connect very,
very deeply to people.

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:09.960 align:middle line:90%
Highly, highly sensitive.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:10.830 align:middle line:90%
Gypsy energy.

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:13.320 align:middle line:84%
You can detach very
easily and you can just

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.330 align:middle line:90%
move to the next place.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.940 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:20.600 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm being
told to tell you,

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.867 align:middle line:90%
I know you're exhausted.

00:13:22.867 --> 00:13:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:25.590 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what the guides say.

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:26.590 align:middle line:90%
I know you're exhausted.

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:27.390 align:middle line:90%
You're finished.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:28.710 align:middle line:90%
Don't want to do this anymore.

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm being told to tell
you to remember who you are.

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:37.000 align:middle line:84%
>> It doesn't surprise me that
you are saying this to me.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.490 align:middle line:84%
>> It's almost like you
know that image where

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:41.140 align:middle line:84%
somebody's feet
are being dragged,

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:44.530 align:middle line:84%
and you're locked like this and
for some reason it's that way.

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:45.530 align:middle line:90%
That's what's happening.

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:50.620 align:middle line:84%
But I just feel like you're
hitting your peak now.

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:53.230 align:middle line:90%


00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Everything that's happened
to you, if you really look,

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:57.570 align:middle line:90%
this is now your friend.

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:00.060 align:middle line:84%
If you really look
carefully, every single thing

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.830 align:middle line:84%
that's happened in
the last two years

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:04.260 align:middle line:90%
has brought you to this place.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.350 align:middle line:84%
But you see now, you said
you were going to do this.

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:10.260 align:middle line:84%
When you came in, you said
you were going to do this.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.182 align:middle line:90%
You can't stop halfway.

00:14:12.182 --> 00:14:13.140 align:middle line:90%
That's the one message.

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:13.940 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And then the other one
is in terms of your health,

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.280 align:middle line:90%
you can fix it.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:23.340 align:middle line:84%
The mind work-- you've done a
lot of mind-heart integration.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:26.880 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm saying,
trying to integrate you

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.560 align:middle line:90%
as a person with higher self.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:32.490 align:middle line:84%
You're trying to live
the two together.

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:33.840 align:middle line:90%
Just feel like you also--

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:37.470 align:middle line:84%
you're a teacher, so you have
to pass on your knowledge

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:39.360 align:middle line:90%
and your information.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.370 align:middle line:84%
OK, you've got to
tell me what you do.

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:42.660 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm a Reiki master.

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:43.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow!

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:44.580 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing!

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:47.580 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS] I mean, you go.

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:49.140 align:middle line:90%
>> So powerful.

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:51.270 align:middle line:84%
>> You were fiddling
around all the time,

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:52.455 align:middle line:90%
but I'm a Reiki master.

00:14:52.455 --> 00:14:53.650 align:middle line:90%
I have been for many years.

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:54.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:57.210 align:middle line:90%
>> That is amazing.

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:59.820 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm looking
at your energy.

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Then I'm seeing geometry
and shine and all this stuff

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:09.740 align:middle line:84%
going on, but I'm seeing
it getting bigger.

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:10.790 align:middle line:90%
And it's beautiful.

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:12.680 align:middle line:90%
I would not stop that.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:13.490 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I shouldn't.

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.740 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I've worked
with terminally ill patients

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:17.630 align:middle line:84%
for many, many years,
so I think I've just

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:20.840 align:middle line:84%
come to a point where I just
needed to sometimes just--

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:21.860 align:middle line:90%
it's not finished.

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:22.740 align:middle line:90%
It's not over.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And I certainly-- we
stand as a beacon.

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And when people search me
out, they search me out,

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:30.590 align:middle line:90%
I promise you.

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:33.050 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] They know
exactly where to find me.

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:34.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.950 align:middle line:84%
No, Reiki, you go
for the Reiki classes

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:38.520 align:middle line:90%
and then you learn how it is.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:42.095 align:middle line:84%
But there's the
intuition that drives--

00:15:42.095 --> 00:15:43.370 align:middle line:90%
>> It's very strong in me.

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:43.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:44.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Now that intuition
there, that's teachable.

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:53.570 align:middle line:84%
>> I certainly--
I certainly could.

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:55.370 align:middle line:84%
I've sort of coming
to a point that I

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:57.080 align:middle line:90%
have done huge amounts of work.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.380 align:middle line:90%
And you know, I'm not so sure--

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:05.075 align:middle line:84%
but that's maybe
me talking to me--

00:16:05.075 --> 00:16:08.790 align:middle line:84%
whether this is really
what I want to keep doing.

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I honestly think you should
just leave here and go with

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.300 align:middle line:90%
a different perspective.

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:17.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well, it's given
me something to think about.

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's strange because in the
last two years, it's exactly--

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:23.420 align:middle line:84%
the last two years that I've
totally toned it all down.

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:24.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.580 align:middle line:84%
Yet in the background, you've
actually been preparing.

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that bigger is
actually a bigger within you.

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:33.920 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.440 align:middle line:84%
When you are-- remember
I said to you just now

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.790 align:middle line:84%
you're the integration
of the higher self--

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:39.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:40.390 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:43.280 align:middle line:84%
I might have a bit to support
between the higher self

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:46.597 align:middle line:84%
and what's going on with me
physically at the moment.

00:16:46.597 --> 00:16:48.180 align:middle line:84%
There might be a bit
of discord there,

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:51.800 align:middle line:84%
and that's certainly something
I've got to work on quickly.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.450 align:middle line:90%
>> And maybe that's what it is.

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Maybe once that's-- maybe
that's what you're going to.

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And once that hits,
it'll come to you,

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:01.422 align:middle line:90%
whatever this expansion is.

00:17:01.422 --> 00:17:03.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, because you're
talking about expansion,

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:04.925 align:middle line:84%
and all I'm talking
about is going smaller.

00:17:04.925 --> 00:17:05.450 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.339 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:10.349 align:middle line:84%
And physically if you want
to do that, that makes sense.

00:17:10.349 --> 00:17:13.250 align:middle line:84%
But maybe this is an
internal expansion then.

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:16.490 align:middle line:84%
When you started pulling
away from the sessions,

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:20.119 align:middle line:84%
did you find that you were
connecting more with you?

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:21.095 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:21.095 --> 00:17:22.970 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've gone
through cycles in my life

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:25.609 align:middle line:84%
where I've pulled away
purposely because you

00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:27.410 align:middle line:84%
can get very drained
from-- we get very

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:28.730 align:middle line:90%
drained from the work we do.

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And I've always
acknowledged that you first

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:35.690 align:middle line:84%
work with yourself and you
work with the key aspects

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:38.840 align:middle line:84%
of yourself, and then it--
but it's always worked

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.130 align:middle line:90%
very naturally in my case.

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:43.580 align:middle line:84%
It's never been a forced
situation or a planned

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:46.010 align:middle line:90%
situation.

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:49.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Do any of you
know an Ed or a Fred?

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.800 align:middle line:84%
There's a very
strong energy here.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.630 align:middle line:90%
Does-- Ed?

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Edward or Ed or Eddie
or Fred or Freddy?

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:00.800 align:middle line:90%
>> My brother-in-law is Edward.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:01.610 align:middle line:90%
>> He's Edward?

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:01.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:02.710 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:04.340 align:middle line:90%
>> And he's still here, hey?

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:06.320 align:middle line:10%
>> He's still in
this world, yes.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.370 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm getting a warning.

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:07.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.320 align:middle line:90%
There's something building up.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.760 align:middle line:90%
This man's very, very stressed.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.320 align:middle line:84%
It feels like it's
from here to here.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:18.950 align:middle line:84%
I would recommend a checkup
or something because I just

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:21.500 align:middle line:90%
feel like he can't see it.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:26.010 align:middle line:84%
I feel like high-end
job or very responsible.

00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:28.175 align:middle line:90%
Very masculine, strong energy.

00:18:28.175 --> 00:18:29.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's passed.

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:31.400 align:middle line:90%
He's retired now.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:32.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, have a look.

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:36.048 align:middle line:84%
Maybe even the retirement
is what's affecting him.

00:18:36.048 --> 00:18:37.340 align:middle line:90%
But there's something going on.

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:38.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:39.755 align:middle line:84%
And it's from here
to here, so it

00:18:39.755 --> 00:18:43.920 align:middle line:84%
might be heart or ulcers
or something like that.

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm scared it will rupture
because these things don't

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:47.750 align:middle line:90%
come up for nothing.

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:50.795 align:middle line:84%
>> I'll certainly
message him and just--

00:18:50.795 --> 00:18:51.920 align:middle line:90%
>> That doesn't feel light.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.300 align:middle line:90%
It was a heavy energy.

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:56.920 align:middle line:90%
Just bear with me for a moment.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.840 align:middle line:84%
Does he struggle
with his emotions

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:02.880 align:middle line:84%
or was he emotionally
disconnected from people?

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:07.150 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm finding a
struggle with intimacy.

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:09.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>> [GROAN] Two sides
to this person.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm a bit confused about
it, so bear with me again.

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:18.970 align:middle line:90%
Two sides.

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:24.160 align:middle line:84%
Like, nice guy, approachable,
you can talk to him.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:29.210 align:middle line:84%
He seems like just the nice
guy in the room, you know?

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.610 align:middle line:84%
I've got another side
which was quite moody

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:34.520 align:middle line:90%
and aloof sometimes.

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:37.010 align:middle line:90%
Disconnected.

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:40.310 align:middle line:90%
But highly intelligent person.

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:41.570 align:middle line:90%
Fabulous mind.

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Not much information
about himself.

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:48.470 align:middle line:84%
Like, he doesn't really know
his own stuff, or not deep,

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:50.900 align:middle line:90%
but very knowledgeable.

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:53.930 align:middle line:90%
>> I was a mess.

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:54.920 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.305 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what he's saying.

00:19:56.305 --> 00:19:57.105 align:middle line:90%
Always a mess.

00:19:57.105 --> 00:19:59.200 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, man.

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:03.290 align:middle line:84%
I just feel like
a part of him was

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:11.490 align:middle line:84%
broken from a young age, which
stopped that intimacy thing.

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:13.110 align:middle line:90%
A lot of regret about that.

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:15.990 align:middle line:84%
It's not just you
he harmed, he says.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:18.050 align:middle line:84%
But I just feel
like he's saying you

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:19.750 align:middle line:90%
two have already fixed that.

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:27.660 align:middle line:84%
So he doesn't have the anguish
he had before and the regret he

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:33.700 align:middle line:84%
had before, but he needs
you to hear that he just

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:36.057 align:middle line:90%
didn't know any better.

00:20:36.057 --> 00:20:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Take your hand,
because he's doing it.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:42.110 align:middle line:84%
He's asking me to tell
you, I can't change it.

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:44.340 align:middle line:90%
I can't take it back.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:48.330 align:middle line:90%
You're not broken over it.

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:51.690 align:middle line:84%
He's proud of you,
of what you've done.

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
best thing that he

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.270 align:middle line:84%
can say to you because the
sorry's passed already.

00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:00.150 align:middle line:90%
This is now, look at you.

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:01.860 align:middle line:90%
Look at what you can do.

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:04.550 align:middle line:90%
It's lovely.

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:05.490 align:middle line:90%
It's dad.

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:07.090 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:08.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:14.520 align:middle line:84%
>> We often sit and we're hoping
to get the messages that we

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:15.810 align:middle line:90%
think we should get.

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:18.960 align:middle line:84%
But again, we cannot--
we are not in any control

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.260 align:middle line:90%
of the situation.

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:23.130 align:middle line:84%
So it was lovely just to
hear a few people coming

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:24.930 align:middle line:90%
through to me.

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:27.480 align:middle line:84%
I would have liked a bit
more in-depth information,

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:31.260 align:middle line:84%
but of course I've picked up
and I've gotten the information

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:32.940 align:middle line:90%
that I needed to know.

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:36.810 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, it was really great.

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:39.180 align:middle line:84%
Everybody needs to spend
more time on themselves

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:41.940 align:middle line:84%
and look into themselves and
get the healing for themselves

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:43.050 align:middle line:90%
that they need.

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And people like us, we are far
too busy with other people.

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:50.190 align:middle line:84%
So it was good just to
have space for myself

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:52.860 align:middle line:84%
and my loved ones
around me, and it

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:56.980 align:middle line:84%
was really delightful to
hear from a few of them.

00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:02.200 align:middle line:84%
What I did was I connected with
her energy, with her spirit

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:05.410 align:middle line:84%
so that I could tell
what kind of energy

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:07.380 align:middle line:84%
she was, what type
of vibration she was.

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:12.510 align:middle line:84%
So then when I do that, I can
connect and see who she really

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:16.930 align:middle line:84%
is, what kind of life she has,
past, present, and future.

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:20.340 align:middle line:84%
So I felt today
I did that really

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:27.630 align:middle line:84%
nicely in terms of feeling how
amazing she is with her work.

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:31.440 align:middle line:84%
If you're coming to see
me, you need to surrender.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.270 align:middle line:84%
You can't be a person
that's coming here

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:35.700 align:middle line:84%
expecting to hear
a specific message,

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:40.920 align:middle line:84%
because intuition is a
flowing process where

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:43.260 align:middle line:84%
you get the
information as you need

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:46.990 align:middle line:84%
it to connect the dots
for your specific healing.

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:50.100 align:middle line:84%
So you need to surrender
