>> Welcome.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.230 align:middle line:90%
My name is Gary.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.140 align:middle line:10%
And I've been on this
journey for the last 22

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.430 align:middle line:10%
years of my life.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.490 align:middle line:90%
I've been searching.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.760 align:middle line:84%
I have gone to every
nook and cranny I

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.770 align:middle line:84%
could find to find
answers to deal

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.440 align:middle line:90%
with my pain and my trauma.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.540 align:middle line:90%
I've done scary things.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.060 align:middle line:90%
I've done beautiful things.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.900 align:middle line:84%
I have done things that has
made me feel unbelievably

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.850 align:middle line:90%
uncomfortable.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.200 align:middle line:84%
But I kept on going because
I knew that even if I just

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.710 align:middle line:84%
get one answer in everything I
do, eventually, the puzzle will

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.150 align:middle line:90%
be completed.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.320 align:middle line:84%
That happened for me
just over two years ago

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.680 align:middle line:84%
when I did my first
psilocybin journey.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.950 align:middle line:84%
Going into the journey, the
person holding the space

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.400 align:middle line:84%
for me was very clear on what it
is I came to do in my journey.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.100 align:middle line:90%


00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.660 align:middle line:10%
And it was the integration of
the masculine and feminine,

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.780 align:middle line:10%
which I've been struggling
with all my life.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.250 align:middle line:84%
I walked around with a
hole in my solar plexus

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.490 align:middle line:90%
up to that journey.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And when I came out of
that psilocybin journey,

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.440 align:middle line:84%
I felt whole for the
first time in my life.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.180 align:middle line:84%
In that journey, I was also
very clearly told that this is

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:05.980 align:middle line:84%
my work, that I cannot be scared
anymore of holding the line

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.210 align:middle line:90%
and shining my light.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:15.410 align:middle line:84%
I have a deep innate
sense that this

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.550 align:middle line:90%
has been the work I have to do.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.090 align:middle line:84%
This is the work I've
been called to do.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.110 align:middle line:90%
This is my life.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.620 align:middle line:90%


00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Psilocybin mushrooms,
commonly known as magic

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.260 align:middle line:84%
mushrooms, mushrooms,
or shrooms,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.530 align:middle line:84%
are a group of fungi
that contains psilocybin,

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.920 align:middle line:84%
which turns into
psilocin upon ingestion.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.620 align:middle line:84%
Mushrooms have been
used by many cultures

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.170 align:middle line:84%
as what is called
a plant teacher.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.110 align:middle line:84%
People report that after
ingesting these mushrooms,

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.690 align:middle line:84%
they are taken on a
journey of connection

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.940 align:middle line:90%
to themselves and to nature.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.700 align:middle line:84%
The dosage dictates
how deep the journeyer

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.920 align:middle line:90%
goes on their inward journey.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.980 align:middle line:84%
Some experience a connection
to something much greater

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.070 align:middle line:84%
than themselves and
find powerful shift

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.900 align:middle line:84%
and transformation
in their process.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>> My name is Reinhart,
otherwise lovingly known

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.860 align:middle line:90%
as Ray.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.840 align:middle line:90%
I am a creative.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.459 align:middle line:90%
I'm a Reiki master.

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:17.870 align:middle line:90%
I am psychic.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And I am super,
super, super excited

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.035 align:middle line:90%
for my guided journey with Gary.

00:04:24.035 --> 00:04:24.920 align:middle line:90%
And I won't lie.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.430 align:middle line:84%
It's been a bit of a rough
road for me this week.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm having to go
through the cleanse that

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.040 align:middle line:90%
was my homework from Gary.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.510 align:middle line:84%
I basically needed to
sacrifice in order to cleanse,

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.160 align:middle line:84%
and that entailed needing
to give up meat, caffeine,

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.960 align:middle line:90%
and a few other things.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.470 align:middle line:84%
>> How am I normally connect
with the person journeying?

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.780 align:middle line:90%
The person will contact me.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.240 align:middle line:84%
In the first call,
like, in this instance,

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.450 align:middle line:84%
when I spoke to
Reinhart, we make

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.160 align:middle line:90%
a connection, the two of us.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.760 align:middle line:84%
In that first interaction
is where we already

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.680 align:middle line:90%
start feeling each other out.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.480 align:middle line:84%
Am I the right person
to hold this person?

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And am I the right
person for this person

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.430 align:middle line:90%
to come journey with?

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a contract that
our souls go into.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.580 align:middle line:84%
I'll then set up
a few days later.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.390 align:middle line:90%
I call.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.660 align:middle line:84%
It's normally one week
before the journey.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And I will go through
a very extensive

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.010 align:middle line:90%
medical questionnaire.

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.760 align:middle line:84%
I need to know all the
mind-altering substances

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.810 align:middle line:84%
they've taken, why they've
taken it because there are very

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.770 align:middle line:84%
concrete things that the
psilocybin cannot work with,

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.000 align:middle line:84%
psychiatric medication being
at the top of that list.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.060 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the medical
and the questionnaire,

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.480 align:middle line:84%
I will give the
person the guidelines.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Not the rules, just
the guidelines.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Through this process
of working with Gary,

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:06.390 align:middle line:84%
he had to ask the plant teacher
to approve of whether I was

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.460 align:middle line:84%
worthy of going
through this process.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And the beauty of it was
obviously that I am worthy.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.410 align:middle line:84%
So one of the messages that Gary
gave to me through the plant

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.610 align:middle line:84%
teacher is that I am
a natural light worker

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.740 align:middle line:84%
and that I have
very high energies

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.290 align:middle line:84%
and that it is something
that he is looking forward

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.270 align:middle line:90%
to working through with me.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Every little bit of
information I can get sets up

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.340 align:middle line:90%
the journey already.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.450 align:middle line:84%
So, for me, the
psilocybin starts

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:39.630 align:middle line:84%
working the minute
that person phones me.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.120 align:middle line:84%
I will request
that the person not

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.840 align:middle line:84%
have meat for the week
leading up to the journey,

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:51.600 align:middle line:84%
not have caffeine, or anything
that overstimulates the body.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And then three days
before the journey starts,

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:59.310 align:middle line:84%
I will ask them to not have any
sexual release because we carry

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.390 align:middle line:84%
so much energy in our
root sexual chakra

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:08.820 align:middle line:84%
that whenever we hit a wall
or something uncomfortable,

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.535 align:middle line:84%
that's normally the easiest
way to get rid of the tension.

00:07:11.535 --> 00:07:14.220 align:middle line:90%


00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Two months ago,
my doggy passed.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:21.240 align:middle line:90%
He was my child, my everything.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.100 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the one thing
that I do hope

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.840 align:middle line:84%
that I experience
in this journey

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.480 align:middle line:90%
is actually connecting with him.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.890 align:middle line:84%
This last year has been rather
rough for me personally.

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:35.130 align:middle line:84%
Due to the coronavirus
pandemic, I

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:37.770 align:middle line:90%
was unemployed for eight months.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:41.130 align:middle line:90%
I basically lost everything.

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:43.410 align:middle line:90%
I needed to start over.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:47.130 align:middle line:84%
But I am fortunately
back on my feet.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And that, I think, is
everything at this stage.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:55.860 align:middle line:84%
This eight-month process of
unemployment, six-month process

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.930 align:middle line:84%
of admitting that
I really would like

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:02.213 align:middle line:84%
to go on a guided psilocybin
journey, and the fact

00:08:02.213 --> 00:08:03.630 align:middle line:84%
that I was then
approached and had

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:08.910 align:middle line:84%
to go through this beautiful
process of cleansing,

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:12.330 align:middle line:84%
acceptance, self-acceptance,
and then being

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.870 align:middle line:84%
accepted as one of the
participants in the psilocybin

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:19.950 align:middle line:90%
journey is an absolute honor.

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so looking
forward to it.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.760 align:middle line:90%


00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I will request that on
the day of their journey,

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:35.870 align:middle line:84%
they have a very light
breakfast because the more empty

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:40.160 align:middle line:84%
the tummy is, the deeper and the
faster the medicine will work.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:46.020 align:middle line:90%


00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:49.080 align:middle line:90%
The person arrives.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.450 align:middle line:90%
We will do a smudging.

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:57.295 align:middle line:84%
I will smudge the person just
to clear the energy fields.

00:08:57.295 --> 00:09:08.870 align:middle line:90%


00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:12.065 align:middle line:84%
I will calibrate the
chakras with Tibetan bells.

00:09:12.065 --> 00:09:15.920 align:middle line:90%


00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:20.580 align:middle line:84%
I will ask the
journeyer to draw a card

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:24.180 align:middle line:84%
just so that we can see
what spirit and the medicine

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.140 align:middle line:90%
wants to work with.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:31.080 align:middle line:90%


00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.350 align:middle line:84%
I will then ask the
journeyer, have they

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:35.330 align:middle line:84%
got an intention
for their journey?

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And we'll just see how
it all fits in together.

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:41.440 align:middle line:90%


00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:45.580 align:middle line:84%
When that's done, we go into
the birth-to-seven process.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And I ask the journeyer
to tell me everything

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:52.000 align:middle line:84%
that they remember
from birth to seven.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.590 align:middle line:90%
That's rattling the cage.

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:55.870 align:middle line:84%
It's just getting
all the sediment

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:59.380 align:middle line:84%
that's been stuck at the
bottom of the dam for so long.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:02.740 align:middle line:84%
All I'm doing is, I'm
just stirring the water

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:06.320 align:middle line:84%
so that that sediment can
start rising to the top,

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.880 align:middle line:84%
so that when the medicine
works, the medicine doesn't have

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.805 align:middle line:90%
to unblock all of that first.

00:10:12.805 --> 00:10:16.700 align:middle line:90%


00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.380 align:middle line:84%
Then we're going
to the forgiveness

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.900 align:middle line:90%
part of the process.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.270 align:middle line:84%
I will ask them to write
a letter of forgiveness

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:24.380 align:middle line:90%
to their mother.

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.990 align:middle line:84%
The same will go for the
letter to the father.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And when that is
done, I say to them,

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.030 align:middle line:84%
you have one more
letter to write.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:34.055 align:middle line:84%
It's the letter of
forgiveness to the self.

00:10:34.055 --> 00:10:36.910 align:middle line:90%


00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:40.180 align:middle line:84%
Once that is done, we
burn all the letters.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:41.860 align:middle line:90%
Nobody reads the letter.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And in the process of
burning the letter,

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:48.220 align:middle line:84%
it transmutes all that
energy, and the smoke

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:51.170 align:middle line:90%
takes it up into the light.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:54.280 align:middle line:84%
We then will move into
the ceremony space.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And before we do that, I
smudge the journeyer again

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:00.430 align:middle line:84%
because I don't want
the energy with which we

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:04.990 align:middle line:84%
work downstairs to be taken
into my journey space.

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:14.270 align:middle line:90%


00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:17.120 align:middle line:84%
I ask the journeyer to
light the ceremony candles.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.940 align:middle line:90%


00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And then I will open the space
with an American-Indian prayer

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:25.820 align:middle line:90%
in all the directions.

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And we call the energy and
spirits in every direction.

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:33.200 align:middle line:90%
The direction of the lover.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Welcome the energy
of new beginnings,

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:39.905 align:middle line:84%
of connection with beauty,
and the richness of the world.

00:11:39.905 --> 00:11:42.700 align:middle line:90%


00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:46.810 align:middle line:84%
While we're doing that, I call
my spirit guides and the people

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:49.210 align:middle line:90%
who hold me in this work.

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:52.070 align:middle line:90%
We sit down opposite each other.

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And I ask the
journeyer if they're

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:59.410 align:middle line:84%
ready for the actual
journey to start.

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:03.160 align:middle line:84%
I will get my
container of water,

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:08.420 align:middle line:84%
and I wash the journeyer's
feet to prepare

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:11.640 align:middle line:84%
them to walk on holy
ground because that's

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:16.080 align:middle line:84%
what they do when they're
in the psilocybin journey.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:21.040 align:middle line:84%
Once I've washed the
feet, I do the bowing.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:26.220 align:middle line:84%
I sit on the ground in front
of the person journeying,

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.560 align:middle line:84%
and I bow to the
person journeying.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.260 align:middle line:90%
I bow to their mother.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.090 align:middle line:90%
I bow to their father.

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And I bow to all
their ancestors.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And I call all their
ancestors who're

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:42.420 align:middle line:84%
willing to work with the
light to come into the room

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:46.515 align:middle line:84%
and hold the person journeying
while they're on their journey.

00:12:46.515 --> 00:12:49.450 align:middle line:90%


00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:52.120 align:middle line:84%
When that is complete,
I ask the journeyer

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.440 align:middle line:84%
to lie on the bed
with an eye mask.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And I play a guided
meditation on forgiveness.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:09.140 align:middle line:84%
When the meditation is complete,
I play very deep cello music.

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And I run an Epsom salt
bath for the journeyer.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:18.700 align:middle line:84%
I will slowly help them to the
bath, give them their privacy,

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.530 align:middle line:84%
and they will
submerge themselves

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:23.480 align:middle line:90%
in the bath for 20 minutes.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:27.310 align:middle line:84%
This is to open the
arteries with the heat.

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And the Epsom salt and the
heat takes the lactic acid out

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.800 align:middle line:90%
of the muscles.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And it also just
puts the journeyer

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:39.160 align:middle line:84%
in a total relaxed
state so that when

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.460 align:middle line:84%
they take the sacrament and
the medicine starts working,

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:48.300 align:middle line:84%
the resistance and the
fight against it is less.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.700 align:middle line:90%
They will come out of the bath.

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And I will have set
up the sacrament.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:58.620 align:middle line:84%
I normally give
between 2 and 5 grams.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:02.130 align:middle line:84%
Once we have both
drunk the sacrament,

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:04.740 align:middle line:84%
again ask the journeyer
to go lie down on the bed

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.180 align:middle line:90%
and put the eye mask on.

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:08.610 align:middle line:84%
The journey is for
four hours, and they'll

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:11.400 align:middle line:84%
know that the journey is
over when the music stops.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.730 align:middle line:90%


00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And the person journeying
starts the process

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:22.740 align:middle line:84%
between them, their
creator, and the medicine.

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
the four hours,

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:28.670 align:middle line:84%
I normally have the person
who's coming to collect

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:31.340 align:middle line:90%
them waiting downstairs for me.

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.160 align:middle line:84%
I will ask the journeyer
just to be in that space

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.120 align:middle line:90%
and in silence for a bit.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And then I take the
loved one up to them

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:44.060 align:middle line:84%
just to be held in love
in that space they're in.

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.760 align:middle line:90%
And that is my process.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:52.430 align:middle line:84%
Not every person who does this
work journeys the same way.

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:54.960 align:middle line:90%
That's their process.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And I honor everyone
doing this work.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.500 align:middle line:84%
Processing work in
the start, I felt

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:04.460 align:middle line:84%
he was very open and
very willing to go

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.700 align:middle line:84%
to places that maybe was not
that comfortable for him.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:13.160 align:middle line:84%
In the birth-to-seven process,
a lot of childhood memories

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.950 align:middle line:84%
came back, most of them
beautiful, some of them

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:17.010 align:middle line:90%
uncomfortable.

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:18.600 align:middle line:90%
And it was really interesting.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:23.120 align:middle line:84%
It really felt that yesterday
with myself and Reinhart,

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.960 align:middle line:84%
our two eight-year-old
boys were in communication

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:27.770 align:middle line:90%
with each other.

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And it was a meeting
of the two boys.

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And something very
playful came out of that.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>> My psilocybin journey
with Gary was intense to say

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:44.380 align:middle line:90%
the very least.

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:49.420 align:middle line:84%
And this entire process, I
completely underestimated.

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I was
ready from the get-go.

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:57.480 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't realize just
how intense, just how

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:03.780 align:middle line:84%
emotionally gripping or
releasing this entire journey

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:05.160 align:middle line:90%
would be.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>> When we went into
the actual journey,

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:14.100 align:middle line:84%
there was an unbelievable
release of energy to the point

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:18.540 align:middle line:84%
that I kept on finding ways
just to cool Reinhart down

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:23.340 align:middle line:84%
because his body temperature
shot up tremendously.

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.430 align:middle line:84%
>> While I was under with
Gary in the very beginning,

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:32.110 align:middle line:84%
I experienced somewhat of an
awakening, one would call it.

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:35.700 align:middle line:90%
I had a sort of eye mask on.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And I could see clear white
lights radiating from obviously

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.360 align:middle line:90%
my internal being.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And that, for me, gave
me the realization

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:48.570 align:middle line:84%
that I had just been
taken back to birth.

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:53.820 align:middle line:84%
To try and put into words what
I saw, what I experienced,

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:59.830 align:middle line:84%
exactly how I felt is
very, very, very difficult.

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:03.850 align:middle line:84%
If I had to try and articulate
and put it into a few words,

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:12.630 align:middle line:84%
I would try to describe it
as releasing, forgiving,

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:19.760 align:middle line:84%
awe-inspiring, awakening, and
just absolutely beautiful.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>> There were challenging
parts throughout the journey

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:27.349 align:middle line:84%
throughout the day
for me personally.

00:17:27.349 --> 00:17:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And the challenge
was my relationship

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:35.420 align:middle line:84%
of having to always
prove my worth

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:42.830 align:middle line:84%
in the past and my relationship
with how do I stand in my truth

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:47.240 align:middle line:84%
but also be in a place of
needing external validation all

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.470 align:middle line:90%
the time.

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And I had to come face to face
with that at numerous spots

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:54.200 align:middle line:90%
throughout the day yesterday.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Gary is absolutely amazing.

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:58.970 align:middle line:84%
I understand that
he as well as myself

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:03.950 align:middle line:84%
are purely channels that
experienced this body

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.650 align:middle line:84%
journey because we're
all souls and we're

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:09.350 align:middle line:84%
all interconnected
and interlinked.

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:12.260 align:middle line:84%
So through this process,
I have obviously

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:17.540 align:middle line:84%
connected with Gary through
Gary and whoever he uses

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:19.710 align:middle line:90%
within the spiritual realm.

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And I rediscovered that
my great grandfather

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:27.140 align:middle line:84%
on my dad's side,
Theodore Rozenkranz,

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.450 align:middle line:90%
is actually my guide.

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And he's that little
inner voice that I hear.

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:37.590 align:middle line:84%
He's my gut feeling, which
is actually quite special.

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:38.730 align:middle line:90%
I have never met him.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:41.453 align:middle line:90%
I had never met him.

00:18:41.453 --> 00:18:42.870 align:middle line:84%
But it was actually
quite special.

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:44.610 align:middle line:90%
He came to me.

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:48.210 align:middle line:84%
We had a whole deep,
intense conversation.

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:51.280 align:middle line:84%
My dog that passed
two months ago,

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.300 align:middle line:84%
he was 17 and 1/2,
a Cocker Spaniel.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And he came to me
in the journey.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:02.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to get
emotional, but it

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.890 align:middle line:84%
is quite an emotional thing
that I have been through.

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And it has been
absolutely enlightening.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:13.590 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a dance between me and
the person journeying and even

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:15.340 align:middle line:90%
down to the dosage.

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:17.760 align:middle line:84%
So yesterday with
Reinhart's journey,

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:22.590 align:middle line:84%
he very gracefully accepted
that he trusts the medicine.

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And for his journey, the
medicine said 3 grams.

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:31.140 align:middle line:84%
That's the sacrament
he accepted and took.

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And in my being, I
know that he got more

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:41.550 align:middle line:84%
than he thought he
was going to get.

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:44.670 align:middle line:90%


00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:48.210 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I find this
dance very interesting

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:52.110 align:middle line:84%
because I want to honor
Reinhart's journey as much as I

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:57.060 align:middle line:84%
can, but I'm also very aware
that the agreement I had

00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:59.280 align:middle line:90%
was to share that journey.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that keeps
on coming up as I'm talking

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:06.740 align:middle line:84%
is, you made him a promise,
you made him a promise.

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.700 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just putting
that to one side

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.610 align:middle line:84%
and just clearing
the space that I'm

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:14.640 align:middle line:84%
aware that I have his
permission to share what

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.730 align:middle line:90%
I need to share of the journey.

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:22.470 align:middle line:84%
The energy in the room
was palpable for me.

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And the way the medicine
worked with Reinhart yesterday

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:31.290 align:middle line:84%
because he is so
open energetically

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:35.640 align:middle line:90%
was, it really worked with heat.

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And the heat that was coming
out of Reinhart yesterday was--

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:48.780 align:middle line:84%
awe-inspiring is the
word that comes to mind.

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And I was in awe of the medicine
and the power of the medicine

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:57.390 align:middle line:84%
and my blind faith
in the medicine.

00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:59.970 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what's going
to happen in the journey.

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:03.930 align:middle line:10%
When we walk into that room,
we walk in it together,

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:05.920 align:middle line:10%
and we walk next to each other.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm not leading him.

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:08.670 align:middle line:90%
He's not leading me.

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:10.485 align:middle line:84%
But we walk that
journey together.

00:21:10.485 --> 00:21:15.730 align:middle line:90%


00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:19.020 align:middle line:90%
>> So my doggy, my child.

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:21.570 align:middle line:84%
Part of the
forgiveness process was

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:25.530 align:middle line:84%
needing to forgive myself
for the necessity of needing

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:27.570 align:middle line:90%
to work to generate an income.

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, through that, I
couldn't spend the quality time

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:33.570 align:middle line:90%
that I wanted to with him.

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:37.530 align:middle line:84%
But due to the
pandemic, I got to spend

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:40.420 align:middle line:84%
eight months of absolute
quality time with him.

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And he came to me, and he
said that I forgive you.

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:49.390 align:middle line:84%
So in turn, that allowed
me to forgive myself.

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:59.740 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a very deep dance
within Reinhart of expressing

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:08.620 align:middle line:84%
deep-felt emotions and
expressing deep-held trauma.

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And the medicine
working as the medicine

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:16.570 align:middle line:84%
does, at the end of the
journey, the breakthrough came.

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:17.590 align:middle line:90%
>> I won't lie.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:19.960 align:middle line:84%
When my friend came and
fetched me from the journey,

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:25.480 align:middle line:84%
I felt and presumably
looked like a newborn baby.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:27.590 align:middle line:90%
I had to learn to speak.

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:31.600 align:middle line:84%
I had to learn to walk and
stand and talk and move.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:36.700 align:middle line:84%
I had to virtually, in a couple
of seconds less than a minute,

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:41.140 align:middle line:84%
rediscover myself because
that is how fresh and how

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:46.180 align:middle line:84%
invigorating and how beautiful
this entire process was

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:48.520 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of needing
to release the past,

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.490 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of needing
to forgive myself,

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:56.590 align:middle line:84%
and in the sense of accepting
what is and what will be.

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:59.940 align:middle line:90%
