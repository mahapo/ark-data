>> When most of us
hear the term medium,

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.660 align:middle line:84%
we think of Ouija boards,
tarot cards, and crystal balls,

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.540 align:middle line:84%
but there is more to mediums
than Hollywood has led us

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.890 align:middle line:90%
to believe.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.800 align:middle line:84%
Mediums believe do not
speak with the dead

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.680 align:middle line:84%
as there is no such
thing as death.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.530 align:middle line:84%
There is only a transition
from the physical being

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.110 align:middle line:84%
to the spiritual
being, and mediums

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.990 align:middle line:84%
are sensitive and
intuitive enough

can also be a curse when you

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.720 align:middle line:84%
don't know how to work with it
because once you open yourself

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.750 align:middle line:84%
to your power, it just works
and works and works constantly.

My name is Angelique,
and I'm a psychic medium.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.540 align:middle line:84%
I was born with this gift,
and it was very difficult

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.300 align:middle line:84%
when I was a small
child knowing things

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.920 align:middle line:84%
from the age of two or three and
telling people things that they

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.389 align:middle line:90%
didn't quite understand.

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:11.220 align:middle line:90%


00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.630 align:middle line:84%
I was very obsessed with
fortune tellers and people that

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.540 align:middle line:84%
could read tea leaves
and crystal balls

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.320 align:middle line:90%
and all those kind of things.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.910 align:middle line:90%
And I used to go to all of them.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.330 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in Johannesburg,
and I knew where all the best

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.340 align:middle line:90%
ones were and how to find them.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And some of them were really
accurate, and some of them

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.500 align:middle line:90%
were real charlatans.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.860 align:middle line:10%
And then one day my mother
got a little magazine

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.120 align:middle line:10%
in an "Australian Home
Journal" or something,

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.360 align:middle line:10%
and it was all about fortune
telling-- crystal ball, tea

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.270 align:middle line:10%
leaves, cards, and all that.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And she said maybe
you can use this.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.700 align:middle line:84%
So I took it and I looked
at it, and the only thing

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.300 align:middle line:84%
I had at hand was a set
of playing cards, which

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.280 align:middle line:90%
they showed how to use it.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And I was about 16, and I
said to all my friends come.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.250 align:middle line:90%
I can tell you your future.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And I used to put a
little book on my lap,

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.130 align:middle line:84%
and I'd go, oh, this
and this and this

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.070 align:middle line:84%
and they'd say to me
how do all this stuff.

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And I started first
with the playing cards.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.460 align:middle line:84%
Some people like tarot cards,
but I've used angel cards.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.670 align:middle line:84%
I learned from time
and experience.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.290 align:middle line:84%
I never saw myself as doing
this as a professional thing,

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.500 align:middle line:84%
and that is why only 30
years later after doing

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.660 align:middle line:84%
every other modality of job that
you can imagine on the planet,

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.570 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I
do have a calling.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And my calling is to
help advise people

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.260 align:middle line:84%
because I've worked out and
figured out many years back

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.450 align:middle line:84%
that I actually channel and
I channel from the Akashic

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.020 align:middle line:90%
Records of my own and of others.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.260 align:middle line:84%
The Akashic Records is
basically the Book of Life

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.360 align:middle line:84%
that all religions
tell you about,

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.020 align:middle line:84%
and everything you've ever been
or ever will be or ever will

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.580 align:middle line:84%
become is written in
that book of life,

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.110 align:middle line:90%
which you write yourself.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore you are the
creator of your own reality,

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.390 align:middle line:84%
you're the creator
of your own problems,

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.210 align:middle line:84%
you're the creator
of your own dilemmas,

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.270 align:middle line:84%
and you here to have
a human experience

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.090 align:middle line:90%
and to learn from being human.

but they were healers.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.240 align:middle line:84%
My father's sister
was a healer, and I've

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.860 align:middle line:84%
got a daughter that is very
much now coming into her right

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.060 align:middle line:84%
and a granddaughter
who is exactly like me.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.550 align:middle line:84%
But she hasn't got there
yet because she's only

And what I do is I also
do mediumship for people

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.990 align:middle line:84%
and talk to the relatives
on the other side.

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And I can also do
regression hypnosis, which

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.700 align:middle line:84%

forward in this lifetime.

best thing that I do

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.670 align:middle line:84%
is when I help other

when various big windows
of opportunities arise,

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.140 align:middle line:84%

>> Well, I didn't.

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:07.700 align:middle line:84%
I was questioned because they

own books because they

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:36.640 align:middle line:84%
choose who they are, each body
incarnation that they take.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, if
you've written the script,

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.340 align:middle line:90%
you've got to live the script.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.220 align:middle line:84%
It's your movie, and
you have to make sure

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.413 align:middle line:90%
that you go through it.

00:09:45.413 --> 00:09:47.580 align:middle line:84%
If you don't like the script,
you change the script,

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:51.870 align:middle line:84%
and then obviously your mind
changes and your body changes

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:53.925 align:middle line:90%
and your circumstances change.

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Right, so the way it
works is that I channel

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:17.090 align:middle line:90%
from your Akashic Records.

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:21.770 align:middle line:84%
So none of my energy gets used,
and none of it is my opinion.

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And what I do is I give
you information that is

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.420 align:middle line:90%
helpful to you for your future.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.960 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like
you to do is choose

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.900 align:middle line:90%
one of these packs, these.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:37.700 align:middle line:90%
That one.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:41.200 align:middle line:90%
OK, thank you.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.690 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Have you just recently
changed your job?

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:50.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, there has been a
shift in the work, yeah.

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:51.860 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the best thing
that ever happened.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.070 align:middle line:84%
I know it doesn't feel
like it at the moment,

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:57.130 align:middle line:84%
but it will be for
you because you're

00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:03.880 align:middle line:84%
moving into a much better place,
a much healthier environment

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.060 align:middle line:84%
mentally and just
hanging in there

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:11.480 align:middle line:84%
with a commitment of knowing
that you're on the right track.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:16.450 align:middle line:84%
So don't feel a bit wobbly
because of the change.

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:19.330 align:middle line:84%
Because there's
somebody that gave you

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:22.450 align:middle line:90%
difficulty as a person.

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:27.880 align:middle line:84%
I can see a female energy that
used to be difficult for you

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:32.440 align:middle line:84%
in your-- not in your life
but in your work space.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:36.841 align:middle line:84%
Is there someone that you
didn't get on with too well?

00:11:36.841 --> 00:11:37.960 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm not sure.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.010 align:middle line:90%
More recent or--

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:41.484 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, recently.

00:11:41.484 --> 00:11:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Was someone-- it was jealous
of you or maybe envious of you.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:45.760 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm not sure.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.550 align:middle line:84%
It's just been a different
journey, very strong--

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:49.570 align:middle line:90%
too strong.

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Well then, perhaps
if it's that or--

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:52.030 align:middle line:90%
>> That's it.

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:56.440 align:middle line:84%
>> There's been a lot of
different work I've done to be

00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:01.322 align:middle line:84%
honest because it could be my
previous work that was very--

00:12:01.322 --> 00:12:02.155 align:middle line:90%
you know they were--

00:12:02.155 --> 00:12:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Because what I'm seeing is
that it's each time you've made

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:09.130 align:middle line:90%
a change, you've improved.

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:14.470 align:middle line:84%
You're improving as a person,
you're improving as a worker,

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:16.720 align:middle line:84%
and you're improving
with your knowledge.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:20.350 align:middle line:84%
So give yourself credit
now for everything

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:22.510 align:middle line:90%
that's happening in your life.

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:25.630 align:middle line:84%
Now when it comes to
relationships and love and all

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:30.500 align:middle line:84%
those kind of things, you've got
to start being more assertive

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.580 align:middle line:84%
not because you got to be
bossy or that kind of thing.

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:36.590 align:middle line:90%
But just state your case.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:41.980 align:middle line:84%
Make sure that the other
person knows what's right

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:42.880 align:middle line:90%
and what's wrong.

You going to be moving
out soon I'm seeing.

>> Not particularly it was
meant to be on the cards but we

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:57.450 align:middle line:90%

00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:59.130 align:middle line:90%

>> Oh, really?

00:13:00.135 --> 00:13:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:06.133 align:middle line:84%
I think it might have been
put on hold but not over yet

00:13:06.133 --> 00:13:08.550 align:middle line:84%
because I'm definitely seeing
a house move, which is going

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:11.190 align:middle line:90%
to be much better for you.

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Do you live near water
because I see that water

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:15.480 align:middle line:90%
is very important near you?

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well, we close
to the beach back in--

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:20.880 align:middle line:90%
>> And you always need that.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.580 align:middle line:84%

it's very important.

it's there or the mountains

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:25.980 align:middle line:90%
for me.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:27.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm always between the two.

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:27.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Very much so.

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:31.380 align:middle line:90%


00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And I see that it's time for you
over the next couple of months

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:41.070 align:middle line:84%
to go through a major
rebirthing in your life.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:45.900 align:middle line:84%
If it's a relationship change,
it could be in the relationship

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:50.400 align:middle line:84%
that there will be a change and
a much improved relationship

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.830 align:middle line:90%
so don't panic.

do more with that because what

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:28.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing is I see money coming
to you to help you enlarge it.

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:29.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, the other.

sponsoring you or someone

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:32.750 align:middle line:90%
that's good--

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:35.333 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's the other business
that I run that would sponsor

00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:37.160 align:middle line:90%
it because it's my--

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you don't have to
give up anything at this stage.

You keep both because
one can feed that--

and then once you've got
that one fully established,

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.280 align:middle line:84%
then you can let
the other one go.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.800 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to let one--
anything go right now.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:56.060 align:middle line:84%
I'd say more towards next
year, the first three,

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:58.760 align:middle line:84%
four months maybe
by April next year.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:02.345 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing a lot of changes
happen for you always in April.

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:10.450 align:middle line:84%
The next three months are going
to be very interesting for you.

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:11.750 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be very busy.

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:13.292 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be
very tired, so you

00:15:13.292 --> 00:15:16.930 align:middle line:84%
need to build up your strength
and your energy for everything

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:20.370 align:middle line:84%
because it's going to feel even
more chaotic than it is right

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:21.170 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.200 align:middle line:84%

you're going to be taxed.

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.870 align:middle line:84%
But then you're going to
get the benefits of that,

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:31.250 align:middle line:84%
and the new year
will come much--

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:34.930 align:middle line:84%
but if you do the breathing
and you calm yourself then

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:37.640 align:middle line:84%
you don't panic
before you get there.

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:42.940 align:middle line:84%
So you as the key person in
your home, you bring the peace.

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:44.590 align:middle line:90%

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:24.280 align:middle line:84%
How can you support this person
because that's all they need.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:28.300 align:middle line:90%
Not money, support.

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.300 align:middle line:90%
Acceptance.

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.480 align:middle line:90%
He's feeling very scared.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:35.950 align:middle line:90%
He's scared.

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Your anxiety and this
is a fearful person--

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:42.310 align:middle line:84%
fear of the future, fear
of not having enough money,

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:46.450 align:middle line:84%
fear of losing everything,
unsure what's going to happen,

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:48.340 align:middle line:84%
unsure of what
you're going to do.

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:52.810 align:middle line:90%
So put the fears to rest .

nothing to be afraid of him.

in your neighbor's life,

you don't have to
buy into the rubbish,

And so are your children
and your family.

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:01.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:18.710 align:middle line:90%


00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:22.130 align:middle line:84%
We just finished the reading,
and I must be honest.

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:24.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm feeling quite elevated.

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:29.330 align:middle line:84%
It was very helpful,
and at the same time,

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:33.080 align:middle line:90%
it's really brought about peace.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:37.010 align:middle line:84%
So interesting to
hear that when you

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:41.240 align:middle line:84%
coming to the end of a
cycle within your life

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.800 align:middle line:84%
that there is a
bit of turbulence

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.990 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of shifts and changes.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:47.720 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like I've
been going through that

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:51.230 align:middle line:84%
and building
towards a bit of a--

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:54.740 align:middle line:84%
a bit of a hopefully
breakthrough, and this

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.470 align:middle line:90%
is what the reading has said.

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:00.440 align:middle line:84%
She did mention that it's going
to be a very exhausting time

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:04.430 align:middle line:84%
moving forward, which I'm scared
for because I can't possibly

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:08.570 align:middle line:84%
get more exhausted, but I think
that's generally something

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:10.580 align:middle line:84%
that we've all
been experiencing.

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:14.330 align:middle line:84%
Just with regards to my
various relationships and peace

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:18.500 align:middle line:84%
of mind about the businesses and
the direction they're going in,

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:24.650 align:middle line:84%
I just think that she really
spoke spot on to what I needed.

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:29.450 align:middle line:84%
No, I'd like to thank Angelique
for this amazing reading

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:33.005 align:middle line:84%
and thank everyone involved
for making this possible.

>> It was very pleasant to meet
a lovely young lady, Monique.

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:48.050 align:middle line:84%
Most of the people
that I meet I only

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:52.140 align:middle line:84%
see once maybe or
sometimes more.

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.770 align:middle line:84%
But the fortunate
thing for me is

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:58.610 align:middle line:84%
that I never remember
anything that I told them.

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:01.440 align:middle line:90%


00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And I always tell them at
the end if you're happy, then

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:07.490 align:middle line:90%
please tell others.

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:10.290 align:middle line:84%
If you're not happy,
please tell me now

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:14.510 align:middle line:84%
because I don't remember
anything that I say.

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And she seemed pleased, and
I'm sure she's satisfied.

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And if she ever needs advice,
again maybe she'll come again.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't do predictions.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- because people
create their own reality.

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:35.730 align:middle line:84%
I only guide them to the journey
that is of the highest good.

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:39.170 align:middle line:84%
However, the advice that
I give to each person

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:41.630 align:middle line:84%
is that just always
remember there

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:45.680 align:middle line:84%
is no such thing as a
crossroad because you can never

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:50.930 align:middle line:84%
go back and redo anything
ever, ever again.

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:55.820 align:middle line:84%
The last minute, the last hour,
the lost lifetime is done.

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:58.760 align:middle line:90%
But you reach a T junction.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And when you make the choice
and you take a left turn,

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:05.990 align:middle line:84%
you're going to end up
in a left direction.

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And the end of that
direction is already

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.270 align:middle line:90%
foretold by your action.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:17.962 align:middle line:84%

look at life from a different

realms where time is not linear

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:29.110 align:middle line:84%
and knowledge goes
beyond reason.

In times of uncertainty,
this type of guidance

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.500 align:middle line:84%
may be the turning
