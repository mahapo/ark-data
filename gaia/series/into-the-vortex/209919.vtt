fascinated and I'm

excited to go deeper on it.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.120 align:middle line:84%
>>JIMMY: One of the most
important things, Josh,

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.950 align:middle line:84%
that we're going
to get into today

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.940 align:middle line:84%
is the community
always wants supporting

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.890 align:middle line:90%
evidence and witnesses.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.040 align:middle line:84%
And we've always been
one step short of that.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.850 align:middle line:84%
The Wilson Davis document has
given us supporting evidence.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:08.650 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Yeah.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.690 align:middle line:84%
>>JIMMY: Witnesses
have now come forward

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.110 align:middle line:84%
and on the record,
which now suggests

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.820 align:middle line:84%
that the document is exactly
what it suggests that it is.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.802 align:middle line:84%

very, very important.

>>JIMMY: Melinda.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LESLIE: Yes.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.130 align:middle line:84%
>>JIMMY: The Wilson Davis
document, let's start there.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.945 align:middle line:84%
For those that may not
be familiar with what

00:02:32.945 --> 00:02:33.820 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about--

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:34.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LESLIE: Sure.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>>JIMMY: --what is the
Wilson Davis document?

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.680 align:middle line:10%
>>LESLIE: Well,
it's meeting notes

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.775 align:middle line:10%
from a meeting between Admiral
Thomas Wilson and scientist Dr.

00:02:43.775 --> 00:02:44.575 align:middle line:90%
Eric Davis.

00:02:44.575 --> 00:02:47.450 align:middle line:90%


00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.620 align:middle line:10%
So Dr. Davis apparently
was taking notes

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.122 align:middle line:10%
during the meeting and/or--

00:02:52.122 --> 00:02:53.830 align:middle line:10%
we're not sure-- he
may have recorded it,

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.280 align:middle line:10%
and then this is the
transcript of his.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.370 align:middle line:10%
But the discussion
was specifically

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.080 align:middle line:10%
about Admiral Wilson
had had a briefing

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.470 align:middle line:10%
by the hands of
veteran researcher

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.120 align:middle line:10%
in the field, Steven Greer.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And Steven Greer went with
Shari Adamiak, his assistant

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.750 align:middle line:84%
at the time, Will Miller,
another gentleman,

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.460 align:middle line:84%
and the late Dr. Edgar Mitchell,
the astronaut Edgar Mitchell.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And they had said
something to Wilson

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.940 align:middle line:84%
and given him a briefing
on Greer's understanding

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.370 align:middle line:84%
that there were
reverse engineering

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.000 align:middle line:84%
programs and technology being
developed-- meaning UFO reverse

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.260 align:middle line:84%
engineering-- and technology
being developed from materials

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.830 align:middle line:84%
and possible craft retrieved
in crash retrievals

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.540 align:middle line:90%
by the US government.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.250 align:middle line:84%
Whenever they got
this meeting and they

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.390 align:middle line:84%
shared this information with
the admiral, and he said,

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:51.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't know
anything about this,

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:52.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to look into it.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.820 align:middle line:84%
What he did is being
in his position,

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.120 align:middle line:84%
he went to the guys that
managed the SAP program--

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.700 align:middle line:84%
special access and
unacknowledged special access

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.790 align:middle line:84%
programs-- which allocate
money and give money

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.510 align:middle line:84%
to black projects and
military development projects.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.120 align:middle line:84%
And he went to them and
he said, is this true?

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.670 align:middle line:84%
Is money going to
these organizations

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.820 align:middle line:84%
and to the development by any
aerospace companies to do this?

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.599 align:middle line:84%
And they basically said,
yes, but we can't really

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:21.399 align:middle line:90%
talk about it.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:22.660 align:middle line:90%
Ask these guys.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.630 align:middle line:84%
Put him in touch with folks
at one of the major aerospace

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:27.430 align:middle line:90%
companies.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.650 align:middle line:84%
We don't know for sure--
it doesn't mention

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.710 align:middle line:84%
in the notes from the meeting
the name of the aerospace

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.600 align:middle line:84%
company, but we
have every reason

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.610 align:middle line:84%
to believe it's
probably Lockheed,

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.370 align:middle line:84%
just from-- it makes sense
that that's probably the case.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.870 align:middle line:90%
But regardless, he goes there.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.110 align:middle line:84%
He meets with the people running
the reverse engineering program

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.670 align:middle line:90%
at this aerospace company.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And he basically says, I want
to know what you're working on.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.292 align:middle line:84%
They tell them what they
can, but then they said,

00:04:50.292 --> 00:04:51.578 align:middle line:90%
you're not read in on this.

00:04:51.578 --> 00:04:53.120 align:middle line:84%
You don't have the
clearance to know.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
wait a second,

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm the head of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:57.550 align:middle line:90%
>>JIMMY: I'm J2.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:58.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LESLIE: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And whether you get the funding
or not depends on me and people

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.790 align:middle line:90%
under me.

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.790 align:middle line:84%
So whether you guys get any of
your military project funding

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.160 align:middle line:84%
from the government,
it's up to me.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And they basically said, nope,
you're not in need to know.

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.720 align:middle line:84%
This is-- and here's the rub--
this is a corporate secret.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.670 align:middle line:84%
In the UFO research
community, we always

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.940 align:middle line:84%
knew that probably the cover up
had become a corporate secret.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.440 align:middle line:90%
Well, this document helps--

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.260 align:middle line:84%
it's evidence in
support of that.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.690 align:middle line:84%
That yes, that
these notes say this

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.770 align:middle line:90%
became a corporate secret that.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was even out
of his hands to be

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.000 align:middle line:90%
able to find out about it.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.580 align:middle line:84%
But I want to say,
for your viewers,

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.860 align:middle line:84%
the significance of the
Wilson Davis document--

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.080 align:middle line:84%
the bottom line
significance-- is

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.000 align:middle line:84%
it's very much about the fact
that there is crash retrievals,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.040 align:middle line:84%
that they're being
reverse engineered,

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.620 align:middle line:84%
that that technology is
being worked on by aerospace

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.200 align:middle line:84%
companies, that the
approval process is

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.750 align:middle line:84%
through the SAP,
Special Access Programs,

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and the unacknowledged
special access programs.

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And that they're
getting for development

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.160 align:middle line:90%
of military technology, funding.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And so the UFO subject has
become a corporate secret.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.270 align:middle line:84%
The government let it
out of their hands.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And the importance
of this document

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:16.990 align:middle line:84%
is it's meeting notes that
suggests that whole thing.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.390 align:middle line:84%
That it's a reverse
engineering program,

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.570 align:middle line:84%
crash retrievals,
that it's in the hands

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.300 align:middle line:84%
of corporate entities,
and that someone

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.410 align:middle line:84%
as high up as Admiral Wilson
couldn't have access to it.

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>>JIMMY: There's no oversight.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LESLIE: Yeah, exactly.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.080 align:middle line:84%
>>JIMMY: And they
felt that they didn't

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.560 align:middle line:84%
have to answer to anybody,
including Admiral Wilson.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And so to back up
and to summarize

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.600 align:middle line:84%
what we're talking
about here, is

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:49.980 align:middle line:84%
you have the Former Rear Admiral
J2 in the back of a car having

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:55.450 align:middle line:84%
a conversation with Eric Davis
behind the EG&G Building in Las

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:56.250 align:middle line:90%
Vegas.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:57.700 align:middle line:90%
EG&G, Josh--

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:58.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LESLIE: Yes.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.820 align:middle line:84%
>>JIMMY: --is the company that
runs Janet Airlines that flies

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.480 align:middle line:90%
in the employees at Area 51.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.940 align:middle line:84%
So here we are at the center
of the UFO alien universe, Las

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Vegas, Area 51, and this
conversation happens.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:15.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LESLIE: Yes.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>>JIMMY: Eric Davis
wrote everything down

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.580 align:middle line:90%
and summarized in the notes.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LESLIE: And/or recorded it.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:23.970 align:middle line:90%
>>JIMMY: And here's the thing.

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
notes themselves-- this

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.970 align:middle line:84%
is not an official
government document.

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:33.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a FOIA thing and
there's not a document number

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.980 align:middle line:90%
assigned to it.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a direct recollection
of this conversation.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.650 align:middle line:90%
But there are names in this.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And when you read
the document itself--

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:46.170 align:middle line:84%
and there's a letter
in there from Will

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.540 align:middle line:90%
Miller and some other things--

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:52.200 align:middle line:84%
that would strongly
suggest a huge cover up.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And that the public
does not have a need

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:56.790 align:middle line:90%
to know about what's going on.

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And you can complain
all you want,

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:01.880 align:middle line:84%
but we're in control of
this and you are not.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.980 align:middle line:84%
So that's where we are
with this document.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, Melinda, you
mentioned Oke Shannon.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:14.940 align:middle line:84%
Now if we go to page one, this
is the first page of the notes.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:20.460 align:middle line:10%
And the reason why Oke
Shannon's name is so important

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:23.220 align:middle line:10%
here is it's mentioned at
the front of this document.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:24.240 align:middle line:10%
>>LESLIE: Yes.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.820 align:middle line:10%
>>JIMMY: Eric Davis was
friends with Oke Shannon.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:28.620 align:middle line:10%
>>LESLIE: Yes.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:33.299 align:middle line:10%
>>JIMMY: Eric Davis was
vetted by Oke Shannon

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:34.890 align:middle line:10%
to Admiral Wilson.

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.559 align:middle line:10%
And all of this was
just brought forward

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:41.490 align:middle line:10%
when Oke Shannon, whose name is
right here on the front page,

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:45.120 align:middle line:10%
decided to come forward and
speak publicly about this.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:49.260 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly we can put a
face behind the name on--

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.890 align:middle line:84%
and he is supporting some of
this evidence that is there.

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:55.920 align:middle line:10%
Now, we have two sets of notes.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.500 align:middle line:10%
And one set of notes
was from Oke Shannon.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.810 align:middle line:10%
We now have this, and we'll
get to that in just a second.

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:04.590 align:middle line:10%
Another set of notes
came from Jack Houck.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:08.700 align:middle line:10%
And that came from you, Melinda.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.070 align:middle line:10%
You have been in
possession of these notes

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:12.330 align:middle line:10%
for a very long time.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:17.940 align:middle line:10%
And you mentioned that both
Oke's notes and Jack's notes

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.350 align:middle line:10%
support a bigger story.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:20.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LESLIE: Yes.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>>JIMMY: What are
you referring to?

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LESLIE: The history of
the Working Group, otherwise

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:28.410 align:middle line:84%
the Advanced Theoretical
Physics Working Group.

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:31.800 align:middle line:84%
It evolved over time, and they
took on different projects

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:32.700 align:middle line:90%
and changed names.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:36.240 align:middle line:84%
But just really quick, the
Advanced Theoretical Physics

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.780 align:middle line:84%
Working Group meeting in '85
became known shortly thereafter

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.570 align:middle line:84%
as the Aviary, because
two major researchers

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.600 align:middle line:84%
in the field dealing with
the various guys involved

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.550 align:middle line:84%
in this group said, we
got to have a code name

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.095 align:middle line:84%
so we can email and
talk to each other

00:09:49.095 --> 00:09:50.550 align:middle line:84%
and no one will know
what we're talking about.

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.383 align:middle line:84%
And that was Bill Murray
and Jamie Chandray.

00:09:52.383 --> 00:09:54.210 align:middle line:84%
So they called them
these bird names,

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:55.740 align:middle line:90%
and collectively, the Aviary.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's the history
of the Aviary.

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes into
what was loosely called

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:01.200 align:middle line:90%
for a while the Bigelow Group.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.810 align:middle line:84%
They started to get
funding by Robert Bigelow.

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:06.030 align:middle line:84%
That then morphed,
if you will, morphed

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:10.110 align:middle line:84%
into NIDS, National Institute
of Discovery Science, which

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.840 align:middle line:84%
morphed into BAASS, Bigelow
Aerospace Advanced Space

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:14.640 align:middle line:90%
Studies--

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.680 align:middle line:84%
Advanced Science
Studies, excuse me.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.820 align:middle line:90%
Became BAASS.

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:22.470 align:middle line:84%
BAASS then and Bigelow and
all the people involved then

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:24.880 align:middle line:90%
were going after Pentagon money.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And once they got
Pentagon money,

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.950 align:middle line:84%
the Pentagon said,
OK, we're giving this

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:30.750 align:middle line:90%
a name for our project now.

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.700 align:middle line:90%
That became AWSAP--

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.420 align:middle line:84%
Advanced Weapons Space
Application Program.

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:37.562 align:middle line:90%
I forget.

00:10:37.562 --> 00:10:38.520 align:middle line:90%
AWSAP, if you remember.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.330 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: A lot of acronyms.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:40.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LESLIE: Yeah, but
that became AWSAP.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.680 align:middle line:90%
And then under AWSAP was AATIP.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the Lue
Elizondo story coming forward

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.440 align:middle line:84%
and his position with AATIP,
which was under AWSAP,

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.300 align:middle line:90%
we know that now.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.610 align:middle line:90%
And then To The Stars Academy.

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:56.400 align:middle line:84%
So this keeps
morphing over time.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.595 align:middle line:84%
This group of people, it's not
always been the same people.

00:10:59.595 --> 00:11:00.720 align:middle line:90%
People have come and gone--

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.190 align:middle line:84%
>>JIMMY: Oh, there's
been a lot of overlap.

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:03.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LESLIE: Yeah, there's
been a lot of overlap.

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:04.480 align:middle line:90%
>>JIMMY: There's a lot.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.147 align:middle line:90%
You see the same characters.

00:11:06.147 --> 00:11:07.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LESLIE: Is the history
of the whole thing.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:08.780 align:middle line:90%
>>JIMMY: Right.

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:11.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LESLIE: To The Stars,
AATIP, AWSAP, BAASS, NIDS--

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:14.520 align:middle line:84%
NIDS period is when Wilson
Davis happened, the meeting--

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.470 align:middle line:84%
and then before that, Bigelow
Group, and then Aviary,

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:18.270 align:middle line:90%
and then--

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:19.910 align:middle line:90%
>>JIMMY: They began.

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:20.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LESLIE: You got it.

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.340 align:middle line:90%
It's all connected.

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:23.960 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge story.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.660 align:middle line:10%
>>JIMMY: What is most
significant about all of this

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:28.222 align:middle line:10%
is that Grant Cameron--

00:11:28.222 --> 00:11:29.180 align:middle line:10%
>>LESLIE: That's right.

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.252 align:middle line:10%
>>JIMMY: --had these
notes for 20 years--

00:11:31.252 --> 00:11:32.210 align:middle line:10%
>>LESLIE: That's right.

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:35.610 align:middle line:10%
>>JIMMY: --that were given
to him by Eric Davis.

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:36.410 align:middle line:10%
>>LESLIE: Exactly.

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:39.050 align:middle line:10%
>>JIMMY: It's such a significant
point that all of this

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:41.640 align:middle line:10%
starts to come together and
support the Wilson Davis

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.440 align:middle line:10%
document.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:42.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LESLIE: That's right.

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:43.730 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And he had promised Eric that at
the time, when Eric Davis gave

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:50.100 align:middle line:90%
these Oke Shannon notes--

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:53.300 align:middle line:84%
so these are Oke Shannon's
notes from the original meeting

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:54.440 align:middle line:90%
at BDM.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:58.040 align:middle line:84%
Eric gave them to him and said,
you can't go forward with these

00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.570 align:middle line:90%
till Oke Shannon passes away.

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:03.890 align:middle line:10%
>>JIMMY: And here we have on
page one of Oke Shannon's notes

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.870 align:middle line:10%
are the clearance--

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:09.140 align:middle line:10%
security clearance
to get into BDM.

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:12.770 align:middle line:10%
But here it is, and all of
this supports the verbiage

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.242 align:middle line:10%
that is in Eric Davis's notes--

00:12:14.242 --> 00:12:15.200 align:middle line:10%
>>LESLIE: That's right.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.300 align:middle line:10%
>>JIMMY: --from the meeting
with Admiral Wilson.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:17.930 align:middle line:90%
It's tremendous.

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:18.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LESLIE: Yes.

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:20.540 align:middle line:84%
>>JIMMY: So how did
you get in possession

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:21.890 align:middle line:90%
of Jack Houck's notes?

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:24.830 align:middle line:10%
>>LESLIE: So the reason I
came forward with Jack's notes

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:28.400 align:middle line:10%
was Jack's notes are more notes
from that original meeting

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:32.570 align:middle line:10%
supporting Oke Shannon and
the significance of him being

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:35.300 align:middle line:10%
in this document and
the working group

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:38.600 align:middle line:10%
and why Eric was sent
by the working group

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.830 align:middle line:10%
to meet with the Admiral.

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:43.010 align:middle line:10%
So this is backup
documentation, if you will,

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:44.460 align:middle line:10%
in support of all that.

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:48.590 align:middle line:10%
And so, I knew Jack
Houck for years.

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:52.010 align:middle line:10%
A long story there, but
he was a personal friend.

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:54.980 align:middle line:10%
He was known for
teaching psychokinesis,

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.710 align:middle line:10%
manipulating matter
with your mind classes.

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.030 align:middle line:90%
And also remote viewing.

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:01.370 align:middle line:90%
I had taken those from him.

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And he was at that
original meeting.

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:05.960 align:middle line:84%
Someone else involved,
long story short,

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.910 align:middle line:84%
had told me about
the original meeting.

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And I eventually asked Jack
about it, and he confirmed it.

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:14.510 align:middle line:84%
He never gave me any
documentation or anything

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:15.710 align:middle line:90%
while he was alive.

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:19.580 align:middle line:84%
But after he passed, his
wife, who I got to know,

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:22.770 align:middle line:84%
and another friend of mine
gave this other friend of mine,

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:25.500 align:middle line:84%
another research in the
field, and gave us and said,

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:29.390 align:middle line:84%
would you guys like
these files that Jack

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:32.480 align:middle line:90%
had in his office at home?

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.040 align:middle line:90%
And so we said, yes.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And then so my friend went and
picked up from Jack's house

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.830 align:middle line:90%
from his wife two file boxes.

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:43.430 align:middle line:84%
And in these file boxes were a
couple of interesting things.

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:47.690 align:middle line:10%
But most notably were
the original agenda

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:51.350 align:middle line:10%
and notes, handwritten
notes by Jack Houck.

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:53.840 align:middle line:10%
Does it help prove Wilson Davis?

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:54.860 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:57.980 align:middle line:10%
Except for in there is
mentioned Oke Shannon.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:02.810 align:middle line:10%
And the documents talk about the
Advanced Physics group, the AP

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:06.500 align:middle line:10%
group, and the meeting
at BDM corporation.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.640 align:middle line:10%
And what they were all about.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.630 align:middle line:10%
So it's the complete
outline of what was going

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:12.800 align:middle line:10%
to happen in that meeting.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.520 align:middle line:10%
And when you take Oke's notes,
they dovetail perfectly.

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.462 align:middle line:10%
So when you have Jack's
notes, Oke's notes follow it

00:14:19.462 --> 00:14:21.170 align:middle line:10%
and you can tell
exactly what's going on.

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:21.830 align:middle line:10%
>>JIMMY: And they're all dated.

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:22.640 align:middle line:10%
>>LESLIE: In the meeting.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:23.480 align:middle line:10%
And they're all dated.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.090 align:middle line:84%
>>JIMMY: They're all dated and
they match the clearance form.

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:26.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LESLIE: Yeah.

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:29.240 align:middle line:84%
So I came forward with
Jack's, which I had gotten

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.610 align:middle line:84%
and I'd had it, like you
said, in my possession

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:32.570 align:middle line:90%
for many years.

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:36.350 align:middle line:84%
But when Oke went
public and mentioned

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:39.530 align:middle line:84%
that everything Admiral
was quoting him saying

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:43.950 align:middle line:84%
was accurate, at that
point, Grant Cameron says,

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:46.650 align:middle line:84%
well, I don't need to sit on
my set of Oke Shannon notes

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:47.450 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:49.110 align:middle line:90%
Oke's gone public about it.

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:50.780 align:middle line:84%
So if he's gone
public, I don't have

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:54.170 align:middle line:84%
to wait till they passes like he
had promised Eric Davis, right?

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:55.410 align:middle line:90%
So he goes public.

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:56.660 align:middle line:90%
So he puts the notes.

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And then I said,
Grant, why don't I

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:01.280 align:middle line:84%
back up-- you're putting
Oke's notes out--

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.320 align:middle line:84%
by putting Jack's
with them because they

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.340 align:middle line:90%
tell a bigger story together.

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:07.400 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I came
forward with Jack's notes.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>>JIMMY: Is this
the first time where

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:14.630 align:middle line:84%
we have a document-- the
UFO community is used

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:17.420 align:middle line:84%
to getting excited,
getting built up,

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:20.030 align:middle line:84%
and then the balloon pops
and something happens

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:21.710 align:middle line:90%
and the story falls apart.

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:23.340 align:middle line:90%
And we're used to this.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:24.460 align:middle line:90%
We're acclimated to it.

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:25.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LESLIE: Sure.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>>JIMMY: But this time, it
seems completely different.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.990 align:middle line:10%
We have the Wilson
Davis document,

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:32.790 align:middle line:10%
which in and of itself
is pretty significant.

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:36.140 align:middle line:10%
But now we have two sets
of supporting documents

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:40.340 align:middle line:10%
that indirectly absolutely
support Wilson Davis.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:42.560 align:middle line:10%
But we have a
witness that is named

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.810 align:middle line:10%
in these documents
that has come forward

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:46.710 align:middle line:10%
and confirmed the entire story.

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:48.830 align:middle line:10%
Is this the first time
where this has all

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:50.250 align:middle line:10%
come together for us?

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:53.540 align:middle line:10%
>>LESLIE: I think it's just
unfolded so beautifully.

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:55.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
it's the first time,

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:58.070 align:middle line:84%
but I know it's so
significant because, again,

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:00.470 align:middle line:84%
what is in the
Wilson Davis notes

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:02.420 align:middle line:84%
about there being
crash retrievals,

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.730 align:middle line:84%
a reverse engineering
program, existing

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:06.980 align:middle line:84%
craft in our possession,
the government

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:09.320 align:middle line:84%
had these game two
aerospace communities--

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:13.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is absolutely
explosive if all true.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:16.280 align:middle line:10%
Now, Admiral Wilson, as
we're saying, has denied.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:20.370 align:middle line:10%
But it says in the document--
it says, if this ever comes out,

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:21.290 align:middle line:10%
I will deny it.

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:23.180 align:middle line:84%
But we're hearing
through the grapevine,

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:26.660 align:middle line:84%
because we have congressional
hearings coming up again

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:30.020 align:middle line:84%
and because the NDAA, National
Defense Authorization Act,

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:33.920 align:middle line:84%
has in it now what we
call amnesty legislation,

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:38.780 align:middle line:84%
to go give amnesty to people
involved in these programs.

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:41.540 align:middle line:84%
Because the Senate and
Congress said, we want to know.

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:44.090 align:middle line:84%
We want to know, is there
these crash retrievals?

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:46.010 align:middle line:84%
Is there this
reverse engineering?

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:47.030 align:middle line:90%
Is it being developed?

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:48.650 align:middle line:90%
Where's the money going?

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:49.830 align:middle line:90%
And they want to know that.

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>>JIMMY: And there should
be a certain amount

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:53.900 align:middle line:84%
of protection for any witnesses
that would come aboard.

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:55.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LESLIE: And so
what we're hearing

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:57.800 align:middle line:84%
through the grapevine
is both Eric Davis

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.390 align:middle line:84%
and Admiral Wilson have
already been asked to testify.

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:01.190 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Oh.

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:02.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LESLIE: And yeah.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.240 align:middle line:84%
So Eric apparently
told Garry Nolan--

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.319 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Garry Nolan.

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:09.410 align:middle line:10%
They were both in this
group together going back.

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:12.560 align:middle line:10%
And Garry has said in
multiple interviews now,

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.390 align:middle line:10%
I briefed Congressman Gallagher.

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:18.800 align:middle line:10%
Well, Congressman Gallagher
read the Wilson Davis notes

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.950 align:middle line:10%
into the public record, into
the congressional record,

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:24.650 align:middle line:10%
last May when Congress
had public hearings on--

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:26.549 align:middle line:10%
>>JIMMY: A huge
significant moment.

00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:27.349 align:middle line:90%
>>LESLIE: Yeah.

00:17:27.349 --> 00:17:30.230 align:middle line:90%
>>JIMMY: And now if we have--

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:33.530 align:middle line:84%
staying on this-- if we
have another hearing,

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:38.240 align:middle line:84%
and I understand that this
is imminent and possible,

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.750 align:middle line:84%
would we expect
both sets of notes

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:45.015 align:middle line:84%
to be brought into the
public record, too, as well?

00:17:45.015 --> 00:17:47.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LESLIE: I don't think Congress
and Senate know anything

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:49.400 align:middle line:84%
about the Shannon
and Houck notes

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.140 align:middle line:84%
on the original
working group meeting.

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:55.200 align:middle line:84%
That would be very interesting
if that was to happen.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.260 align:middle line:84%
But the Wilson Davis
notes have already

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:58.700 align:middle line:90%
been read into the record.

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And the congressman
had said to the guys

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:07.340 align:middle line:84%
heading up the UAP Task
Force for the Pentagon.

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And when they did
this hearing, it

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:10.457 align:middle line:84%
was to ask them
for their findings.

00:18:10.457 --> 00:18:11.540 align:middle line:90%
What have you come across?

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:13.970 align:middle line:90%
And to speed up the process.

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:16.442 align:middle line:84%
Well, these guys denied
knowing anything about this.

00:18:16.442 --> 00:18:17.400 align:middle line:90%
Which is probably true.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.275 align:middle line:90%
They probably didn't.

00:18:18.275 --> 00:18:22.700 align:middle line:84%
But the congressman said,
next time we meet, I

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:24.823 align:middle line:84%
want you guys to
know all about this.

00:18:24.823 --> 00:18:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And then he had it
read into the record.

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:28.250 align:middle line:84%
So we know it's going
to come up again.

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:30.722 align:middle line:84%
And I think it stands
to reason-- like I said,

00:18:30.722 --> 00:18:32.180 align:middle line:84%
we're hearing
through the grapevine

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:36.440 align:middle line:84%
that both Eric Davis
and Admiral Wilson

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.670 align:middle line:90%
have been asked to testify.

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure if Admiral
Wilson is put before Congress

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:45.050 align:middle line:84%
to testify, particularly if
it follows up Eric Davis,

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:47.805 align:middle line:84%
I doubt he'll say, there was
no meeting, it didn't happen.

00:18:47.805 --> 00:18:48.930 align:middle line:90%
I think he'll back them up.

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:53.450 align:middle line:84%
But the one who gave them to
the congressman, Garry Nolan,

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:55.340 align:middle line:84%
has said in multiple
interviews now--

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:58.790 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Garry Nolan has said,
my friend Eric Davis

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:02.360 align:middle line:84%
says the meeting happened,
says it happened,

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:05.570 align:middle line:84%
and says that that's
a true account of it.

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>>JIMMY: There was a very
significant comment from what

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:16.430 align:middle line:84%
we can assume as Lockheed
Skunkworks, where

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:19.160 align:middle line:84%
you had an engineer
and you had a lawyer

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.490 align:middle line:84%
and you had the head of
security with Admiral Wilson.

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:30.560 align:middle line:84%
And the conversation started
to get elevated, colorful.

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to use
the word negative,

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:34.310 align:middle line:90%
but it was very standoffish.

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And the three
gentlemen from Lockheed

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:45.020 align:middle line:84%
then said to Admiral Wilson,
well, OK, we might as well tell

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:47.640 align:middle line:90%
you what's going on.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was the head
of security said, well,

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.280 align:middle line:90%
go ahead and say it.

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:53.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm paraphrasing here.

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:54.283 align:middle line:90%
>>LESLIE: Yes, sure.

00:19:54.283 --> 00:19:56.010 align:middle line:84%
>>JIMMY: And Admiral
Wilson says, well,

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:57.135 align:middle line:90%
what are you talking about?

00:19:57.135 --> 00:19:59.330 align:middle line:90%
And they said, it's aliens.

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:00.950 align:middle line:90%
We are back engineering.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:02.190 align:middle line:90%
We have a craft.

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:03.273 align:middle line:90%
>>LESLIE: We have a craft.

00:20:03.273 --> 00:20:05.030 align:middle line:84%
>>JIMMY: And we
think it can fly.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:05.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LESLIE: Yes.

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>>JIMMY: And that's
what we are doing here.

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.550 align:middle line:84%
Admiral Wilson at that
point, his response

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:11.930 align:middle line:90%
was, now I understand.

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:12.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LESLIE: Yes.

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>>JIMMY: This is elevated in a
level of secrecy above anything

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:19.160 align:middle line:90%
that I can know about.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And here's the
significant point.

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:26.650 align:middle line:84%
They then said, you can
go back to Washington.

00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:28.180 align:middle line:90%
You can cry.

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:29.590 align:middle line:90%
You can scream.

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:30.970 align:middle line:90%
You can yell.

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:33.460 align:middle line:84%
But there's nothing
you can do about it.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:35.050 align:middle line:90%
Have a nice day.

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And he says he jumps on a plane
and flies back to Washington DC

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:40.720 align:middle line:90%
and does just that.

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LESLIE: Yes.

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.600 align:middle line:84%
>>JIMMY: And everybody
told him to behave.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.400 align:middle line:84%
When you read
something like that,

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.970 align:middle line:84%
is that exactly what has been
going on in our community?

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:51.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LESLIE: Well, exactly.

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:54.165 align:middle line:84%
Like I said earlier, I think
the subject has gotten out

00:20:54.165 --> 00:20:55.540 align:middle line:84%
of the control of
government when

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.820 align:middle line:90%
it's gone into corporate hands.

00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And so it's no longer
the government's secret,

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.490 align:middle line:90%
it becomes a corporate secret.

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a
huge, huge problem.

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And it speaks to the nature
of the way the cover up works.

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think Senate and Congress,
if they have the chutzpah,

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:14.410 align:middle line:84%
if they have the
fortitude to push this,

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:18.550 align:middle line:84%
if they have Eric Davis
and Admiral Wilson testify

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:21.790 align:middle line:84%
that that meeting happened
and that that whole experience

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:23.050 align:middle line:90%
that Admiral was sharing.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:24.400 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's a big if.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.620 align:middle line:84%
But we're hoping this
is what will happen.

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:30.400 align:middle line:84%
Because it will take
incredible fortitude,

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.160 align:middle line:84%
like I was saying, by
Congress to both do that

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.810 align:middle line:90%
and then to go the next step.

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:38.590 align:middle line:84%
Because if this is so, a
congressional investigation

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:39.860 align:middle line:90%
has to happen.

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:41.150 align:middle line:90%
>>JIMMY: I agree with you.

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And to support all
of this, you've

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:45.220 align:middle line:84%
been doing this for
a very long time.

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to share
this with you, Josh.

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:50.470 align:middle line:90%
I was with Melinda 10 years ago.

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And we were out with a couple
hundred of our friends.

00:21:55.330 --> 00:22:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And I've had many
sightings, but I

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:03.910 align:middle line:84%
had my first very
significant sighting

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:05.290 align:middle line:90%
on this particular night.

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:07.270 align:middle line:90%
One that brought me to my knees.

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And it was Melinda that
picked me up off the ground.

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out to be a
very, very big deal that night.

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And you've been doing
this for so very long.

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:18.550 align:middle line:10%
And here we--

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:21.265 align:middle line:10%
>>LESLIE: I've been in the UFO
research field for 33 years

00:22:21.265 --> 00:22:21.370 align:middle line:10%
now.

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:22.270 align:middle line:10%
>>JIMMY: 33 years.

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:24.700 align:middle line:10%
And here we are today
talking about something

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.110 align:middle line:10%
this significant.

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:29.710 align:middle line:10%
And you're part of it, and
you deserve the recognition

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:30.940 align:middle line:10%
of what's going on.

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:32.648 align:middle line:10%
>>LESLIE: Now, here's
a little side thing

00:22:32.648 --> 00:22:34.240 align:middle line:10%
we hadn't brought up.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.880 align:middle line:84%
In the Wilson Davis notes,
there's a reference.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.040 align:middle line:84%
When Admiral Wilson
is telling Eric

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.443 align:middle line:84%
about knowing the history of the
group, he says the AP-10 group.

00:22:42.443 --> 00:22:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>>JIMMY: That's right.

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:44.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LESLIE: Yeah.

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And in the original
85 notes that

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:51.100 align:middle line:84%
were written by Oke Shannon,
in his own handwriting,

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:55.480 align:middle line:84%
it says the Advanced Physics
Group, dash T-E-N. And under it

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:58.030 align:middle line:90%
literally in parentheses, AP-10.

00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:00.040 align:middle line:84%
Everyone wondered,
what is that code name?

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.540 align:middle line:84%
What is that code
name referring to?

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, for someone
like me that's been

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.520 align:middle line:84%
researching the history of the
Working Group for 30 years,

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:06.320 align:middle line:90%
I knew.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.278 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, OK, I knew this
is the Working Group.

00:23:08.278 --> 00:23:11.380 align:middle line:84%
But in Oke's handwritten
notes that Grant

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:13.060 align:middle line:84%
had in his possession
all these years,

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:16.170 align:middle line:84%
there it says
right there, AP-10.

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's clearly what Wilson
is specifically referencing

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:22.060 align:middle line:90%
by the exact same code name.

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:23.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the chance of
having that in there

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:26.090 align:middle line:84%
and having that written
there was just phenomenal.

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:29.980 align:middle line:84%
I think where the rubber meets
the road on this whole thing

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:32.560 align:middle line:84%
is, as I said
before, if Congress

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:38.220 align:middle line:84%
is willing to do the work
and dig and pull that string

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:42.240 align:middle line:84%
and start to unravel
that ball of yarn,

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.190 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking
crash retrievals,

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:47.670 align:middle line:84%
reverse engineering,
where the money has gone,

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:49.260 align:middle line:84%
how the cover up
has been managed.

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:50.820 align:middle line:90%
I think it's all in there.

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:53.640 align:middle line:84%
That's the significance
of the Wilson Davis notes.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:58.500 align:middle line:84%
>>JIMMY: Yeah, it said
earlier that it may not prove

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:00.630 align:middle line:90%
that the meeting happened.

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:02.160 align:middle line:90%
Although that's true.

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:05.070 align:middle line:84%
It's harder now
for those that were

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:08.958 align:middle line:84%
participants in this meeting
to deny that it happened.

00:24:08.958 --> 00:24:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
the significance--

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.417 align:middle line:84%
>>LESLIE: Especially
when you get to something

00:24:12.417 --> 00:24:15.180 align:middle line:84%
as absolutely specific as the
reference to the AP-10 group.

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:18.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what is the
chance of that exact code?

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:23.130 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's not proof, but it's
incredible supporting evidence.

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:26.400 align:middle line:84%
>>JIMMY: Now, in
closing, lots of promises

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.100 align:middle line:90%
were made to us for 2022.

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.350 align:middle line:84%
We were supposed to get
a couple of reports.

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:34.510 align:middle line:84%
One that was public and
one at the six-month mark.

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:35.310 align:middle line:90%
We missed that.

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:36.210 align:middle line:90%
That didn't happen.

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:37.010 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Oh, yeah.

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:40.170 align:middle line:84%
>>JIMMY: We were supposed
to get a classified report

00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:42.660 align:middle line:84%
at the end of December
before the close of the year.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:45.330 align:middle line:90%
That's still waiting to be seen.

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And we were supposed to have
another congressional hearing.

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And there are rumors and
chatter going around right now,

00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:57.462 align:middle line:84%
and we will see, that there is
something significant that's

00:24:57.462 --> 00:24:59.420 align:middle line:84%
supposed to happen in
the next couple of weeks.

00:24:59.420 --> 00:24:59.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LESLIE: Yeah.

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:00.600 align:middle line:84%
>>JIMMY: What do you
think we're going

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.078 align:middle line:90%
to see in the last quarter?

00:25:02.078 --> 00:25:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LESLIE: We're supposed to get
the task force-- another task

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:05.670 align:middle line:90%
force report.

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:08.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, the last one, people
said was a nothing burger

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:11.760 align:middle line:84%
because when it came out,
it was just six pages long

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.200 align:middle line:90%
and didn't have that much.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.120 align:middle line:84%
It had some interesting
stuff in it,

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.458 align:middle line:90%
but nothing really revelatory.

00:25:16.458 --> 00:25:18.750 align:middle line:84%
We'll see this time if we
get a little more-- we're all

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:21.930 align:middle line:84%
hoping, of course, in this UFO
field, that we'll get more.

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:24.390 align:middle line:84%
So hopefully that
that'll be on track.

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:27.403 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, wait and see.

00:25:27.403 --> 00:25:28.320 align:middle line:90%
>>JIMMY: Right, right.

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:31.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LESLIE: But meanwhile, because
the House and the Senate has

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:35.640 align:middle line:90%
passed the legislation for the--

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:39.118 align:middle line:84%
I hear it's 31 pages
out of the NDAA.

00:25:39.118 --> 00:25:41.160 align:middle line:84%
I haven't read it word
for word, but I've loosely

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.010 align:middle line:90%
gone through it.

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:44.190 align:middle line:84%
But giving, like we
said, the amnesty.

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:46.470 align:middle line:84%
So obviously there's
the intent there

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:49.650 align:middle line:84%
to have more hearings
and public hearings.

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:51.630 align:middle line:84%
That's why they're
giving these people

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:56.340 align:middle line:84%
three years of permission
without breaking their security

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:57.310 align:middle line:90%
clearances.

00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:58.110 align:middle line:90%
Or their--

00:25:58.110 --> 00:25:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>JIMMY: A threat
to their career.

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:00.180 align:middle line:90%
A threat to their career.

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:01.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LESLIE: Nondisclosure
agreements, yeah.

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:02.910 align:middle line:90%
So that they can come forward.

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:03.710 align:middle line:90%
>>JIMMY: Right.

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:06.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LESLIE: So obviously, I think
the fact that that's in there,

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:08.455 align:middle line:84%
there's every intent for
there to be more hearings.

00:26:08.455 --> 00:26:10.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very exciting
time to be in this field,

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:13.335 align:middle line:90%
because those hearings--

00:26:13.335 --> 00:26:15.730 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to have
multiple military witnesses.

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:18.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not just
about this document.

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:20.882 align:middle line:84%
It's about all the military
witnesses and insiders

00:26:20.882 --> 00:26:22.590 align:middle line:84%
and whistleblower
types that they've been

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:24.582 align:middle line:90%
meeting with in closed doors.

00:26:24.582 --> 00:26:26.040 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully some of
those will now be

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.350 align:middle line:84%
able to testify in
a public hearing.

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And you guys, we're in
the era of disclosure.

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.110 align:middle line:90%
It's happening, it's coming.

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:32.910 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Here, here.

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:33.710 align:middle line:90%
>>JIMMY: Yeah.

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:36.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm happy for you because
you can now march around go,

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.140 align:middle line:90%
I told you so.

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:38.250 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:39.992 align:middle line:84%
Melinda Leslie,
thank you so much.

00:26:39.992 --> 00:26:41.075 align:middle line:90%
What a great conversation.

00:26:41.075 --> 00:26:41.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LESLIE: Thank you.

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:42.400 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>>JIMMY: Thank you
for being here.

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:44.520 align:middle line:90%
Josh, what'd you learn, man?

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:45.320 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready?

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:46.120 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: I am ready.
