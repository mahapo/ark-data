00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.340 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm radio and television
host, Jimmy Church.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And I'm here to uncover
the truth about some

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.170 align:middle line:90%
of life's biggest mysteries.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.830 align:middle line:84%
If this is revealed,
everything has to be rewritten.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.940 align:middle line:84%
My guest today is Avi Loeb,
astrophysicist and professor

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.860 align:middle line:84%
of science at
Harvard University,

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.500 align:middle line:84%
who discovered the
earliest known object

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.930 align:middle line:84%
from another solar
system to hit Earth.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Over the past five years,
we discovered the first three

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.990 align:middle line:10%
interstellar objects.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Technical assistant Josh.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.200 align:middle line:90%
Josh, can you pull up the map?

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Also joins us to
help set the scenes.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Join us as we deep dive to
get to the bottom of some

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.820 align:middle line:84%
of the most intriguing
questions of our time.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.560 align:middle line:84%
>> But the more
evidence you get,

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.820 align:middle line:84%
the more convinced you will
get that it's not natural.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:11.870 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:12.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.050 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to Into the Vortex.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Jimmy Church.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And Josh, today we
have Professor Avi Loeb

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.390 align:middle line:90%
of Harvard University.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.190 align:middle line:90%
Excited.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.170 align:middle line:84%
>> I am a super fan of
the Galileo Project.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.370 align:middle line:90%
Happy to have you here, Avi.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, thanks for
having me, Jimmy and Josh.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.740 align:middle line:84%
You may refer to
me as a farm boy.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.210 align:middle line:90%
>> You don't look farmish.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.350 align:middle line:90%
>> I grew up on a farm.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And it pretty much
shaped the way

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.490 align:middle line:84%
I approach everything
in my life.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>> This is exciting because of
your journey that you've been

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.370 align:middle line:90%
on for a number of years.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.330 align:middle line:84%
This search for ET and
life in the universe

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.720 align:middle line:90%
didn't happen overnight.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.570 align:middle line:84%
But how important
is it for academia

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.690 align:middle line:84%
to actually be involved
in the search for ET?

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, first, let me explain.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.620 align:middle line:84%
I search for
intelligence from space

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.380 align:middle line:84%
because I don't often
find it here on Earth.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And that includes in
the academic world,

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.470 align:middle line:84%
there seemed to be a hesitance
in engaging with the subject.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And I find that
inappropriate given

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.600 align:middle line:84%
that the public is extremely
interested in the question

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.740 align:middle line:84%
of whether there is a smarter
kid on our cosmic block.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.710 align:middle line:10%
And also, we know now that about
a quarter of the sun-like stars

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.230 align:middle line:10%
have a planet the
size of the Earth,

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.550 align:middle line:10%
roughly at the same separation.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.440 align:middle line:10%
So the dice of intelligence
was rolled tens of billions

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.900 align:middle line:10%
of times within the
Milky Way galaxy alone.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.270 align:middle line:84%
It's quite likely that there was
a scientist smarter than Albert

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.500 align:middle line:84%
Einstein who lived on an
exoplanet a billion years ago.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.780 align:middle line:10%
And the civilization that
benefited from the wisdom

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.360 align:middle line:10%
of that scientist sent probes.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.258 align:middle line:10%
Within half a billion
years, these probes

00:02:57.258 --> 00:02:59.050 align:middle line:10%
can make it throughout
the Milky Way galaxy

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.600 align:middle line:10%
even if they use
chemical propulsion.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.670 align:middle line:10%
And then they would settle in
the habitable zones near stars.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.110 align:middle line:90%
They can replicate themselves.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And the only way to find out
if we live in such a reality

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.500 align:middle line:90%
is to look out.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.170 align:middle line:10%
So it sounds straightforward.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.620 align:middle line:10%
Then on top of that,
over the past five years,

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.690 align:middle line:10%
we discovered the first
three interstellar objects.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.260 align:middle line:10%
And that was using
astronomical instrumentation.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.920 align:middle line:10%
And the first two
appear to be weird.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.430 align:middle line:10%
It's a meteor discovered in
2014, tougher than iron, faster

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.740 align:middle line:10%
than 95% of all the stars.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.850 align:middle line:10%
And we would like to collect
its fragments because it

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.650 align:middle line:10%
could be artificial in origin.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.730 align:middle line:10%
And the second was a Oumuamua
more discovered in 2017,

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.010 align:middle line:10%
also didn't look like
a comet or an asteroid,

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.590 align:middle line:10%
was flat, had a weird shape.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And so my point is nature is
trying to tell us something.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.440 align:middle line:84%
What's going outside
of the solar system

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.540 align:middle line:84%
is different than
what we expect.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.760 align:middle line:84%
It's just like going
to your backyard.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.860 align:middle line:90%
You're used to seeing rocks.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.990 align:middle line:84%
But every now and
then, you might

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:19.450 align:middle line:84%
see a tennis ball or a beach
ball that came from a neighbor.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And that will tell you
that you're not alone

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.900 align:middle line:90%
on this street.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.340 align:middle line:90%
So we should be open-minded.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.540 align:middle line:10%
Now you may ask, why is academia
not jumping at the opportunity

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.990 align:middle line:10%
to study these things?

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is experts
want to pretend that they know

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.950 align:middle line:84%
anything that comes along
based on their past knowledge

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.980 align:middle line:84%
because they get their
honors, awards, recognition,

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.440 align:middle line:84%
their self-esteem out
of their past knowledge.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.170 align:middle line:84%
They worked hard for
decades acquiring

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.210 align:middle line:84%
the status in the academic
community that they have.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And so if they're used
to explaining everything

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.310 align:middle line:84%
in the sky, everything in space
as rocks made by nature, then

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.630 align:middle line:84%
when an object comes from
outside the solar system,

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.180 align:middle line:90%
they would say it's a rock.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.800 align:middle line:10%
To me, it's just like a cave
dweller finding a cell phone.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.080 align:middle line:84%
The cave dweller would
say it's a rock of a type

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.570 align:middle line:84%
that I've never seen
before, but it's a rock.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.100 align:middle line:84%
But the more evidence you
get, the more convinced

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.190 align:middle line:84%
you will get that
it's not natural.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.320 align:middle line:10%
>> In your book,
Extraterrestrial,

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.230 align:middle line:10%
which is an incredible read.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:27.280 align:middle line:10%
I have personally, as you know,
read this probably 50 times.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.950 align:middle line:10%
And every time I
finish the book, I just

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.430 align:middle line:10%
flip it over and
start over again.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.380 align:middle line:84%
There must have
been for somebody

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.720 align:middle line:84%
like you a certain amount
of pushback from academia.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.380 align:middle line:90%
How did you deal with that?

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, between 2011
and 2020, for nine years,

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.680 align:middle line:84%
I was the longest serving
chair of the Harvard University

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.270 align:middle line:90%
Astronomy Department.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And I also chaired the Board
of Physics and Astronomy

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.780 align:middle line:90%
of the National Academies.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm still the chair of
the Starshot Initiative

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.050 align:middle line:90%
of the Breakthrough Foundation.

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'm also the director
of the Institute for Theory

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.370 align:middle line:84%
and Computation and the founding
director of the Black Hole

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:13.270 align:middle line:90%
Initiative.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.680 align:middle line:84%
Now all of these
leadership positions

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.850 align:middle line:84%
gave me the confidence
that allows me not

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.460 align:middle line:84%
to pay too much attention
to what other people say,

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.820 align:middle line:84%
but simply do the right
thing based on common sense.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.400 align:middle line:90%
As I said, I grew up on a farm.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.230 align:middle line:90%
I pay less attention to people.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And then in 2017,
Oumuamua came along.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And it was weird,
so I wrote about it.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.140 align:middle line:84%
A scientific paper
saying maybe it's

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.660 align:middle line:84%
artificial in origin because
of all the anomalies.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you pull that up, Josh?

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Do you have an
image of Oumuamua?

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.395 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

00:06:47.395 --> 00:06:49.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm worried it's not what Avi
thinks it should look like,

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:51.500 align:middle line:90%
but here we are.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:57.650 align:middle line:10%
So that's the way it should
look like from the side.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.320 align:middle line:10%
It was at least 10 times
longer than it is wide.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.670 align:middle line:10%
But think about a piece of
paper tumbling in the wind.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.300 align:middle line:84%
It would not line
exactly edge on.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And you might think that
it's actually a cigar, where

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.790 align:middle line:90%
it's in fact a flat object.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And the best fit
to the reflection

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:19.820 align:middle line:84%
of sunlight from this
object was of a flat shape,

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.680 align:middle line:90%
pancake-like shape.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.410 align:middle line:10%
>> Avi, one the things that
confuses me about Oumuamua was

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.110 align:middle line:10%
not just pronouncing it, but
was also how it traveled through

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.910 align:middle line:10%
space.

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.380 align:middle line:84%
I've seen animations where
it spins, or it flips.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason,
that matters to me.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:34.700 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering if you by
clarity on how it exactly

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.260 align:middle line:90%
moved past Earth.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.590 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, it was tumbling
every eight hours.

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:42.770 align:middle line:10%
And the amount of
sunlight reflected from it

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.120 align:middle line:10%
changed by a factor of
10 as it was tumbling.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.630 align:middle line:84%
So that made it quite
unusual because it

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:50.510 align:middle line:84%
meant that it had a very
extreme shape, just like a piece

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.340 align:middle line:90%
of paper tumbling in the wind.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:56.210 align:middle line:84%
But if you think about it
as an artificial object,

00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:00.800 align:middle line:84%
you might think that it's
trying to look in all directions

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.130 align:middle line:84%
in order to gain some
insight on whether there

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:07.400 align:middle line:84%
is life in the habitable
region around the sun.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And it actually passed very
close to the inner planets,

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:12.200 align:middle line:90%
unusually close.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.760 align:middle line:10%
We are actually
looking right now

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.660 align:middle line:10%
into the question of whether
the trajectory was designed

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:19.910 align:middle line:10%
in a very special
way that allowed

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.970 align:middle line:10%
it to pass near all of
the habitable planets

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.850 align:middle line:10%
when they came close to it.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:27.540 align:middle line:10%
>> No gravity assist.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.340 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:32.150 align:middle line:10%
The only thing is that it
exhibited an excess push away

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:35.600 align:middle line:10%
from the sun without
showing a cometary tail.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.390 align:middle line:84%
And the question
was what pushed it?

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And we suggest that maybe it's
the reflection of sunlight.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:46.340 align:middle line:10%
And then in
September, 2020, there

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:50.270 align:middle line:10%
was another object that
exhibited an excess push away

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:52.040 align:middle line:10%
from the sun by
reflecting sunlight.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.020 align:middle line:90%
No cometary tail.

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And after a few
weeks, the astronomers

00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:00.020 align:middle line:84%
who discovered it with the
same telescope in Hawaii

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.630 align:middle line:84%
realized that it's actually
a rocket booster launched

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:05.210 align:middle line:90%
in 1966 by NASA.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And so it had thin
walls, and therefore,

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:12.290 align:middle line:90%
a large area for its mass.

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And we know that we produced
this object artificially.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.320 align:middle line:84%
The question is who
produced Oumuamua?

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.140 align:middle line:90%
>> And here's the thing.

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:25.520 align:middle line:84%
All of the artist's
renderings of Oumuamua

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.370 align:middle line:90%
are just an interpretation.

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:31.910 align:middle line:84%
We never had any clear
images of Oumuamua.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:34.340 align:middle line:10%
So when we look at
an image like this

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.290 align:middle line:10%
or when you see an
image like this,

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:39.230 align:middle line:10%
I'm sure that you're taken
aback a little bit because this

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:42.030 align:middle line:10%
doesn't represent at all
with the data has shown us.

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:42.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:45.080 align:middle line:84%
They say a picture is
worth a thousand words.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.000 align:middle line:10%
In my case, it's
worth 66,000 words,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.910 align:middle line:10%
the number of words in my book.

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:52.520 align:middle line:84%
I just want to have
an image of an object

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.590 align:middle line:84%
like that, so that I can
demonstrate my point,

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:55.700 align:middle line:90%
that it's not a rock.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.310 align:middle line:84%
When suggesting that it may
be artificial in origin,

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:01.970 align:middle line:84%
I got a huge amount of
pushback and ridicule

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:05.390 align:middle line:84%
by some people who
are not necessarily

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:07.160 align:middle line:90%
practicing scientists.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.760 align:middle line:90%
That's the strange thing.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And I was trained up in the
military at a young age.

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:15.530 align:middle line:84%
I served in the
Israeli military.

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And when during the first
few months as a paratrooper,

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:22.040 align:middle line:84%
I remember the saying that
sometimes, a soldier has

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.050 align:middle line:84%
to put his body on
the barbed wire,

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:26.310 align:middle line:84%
so that others
will pass through.

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And so in order to
bring this subject

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.880 align:middle line:84%
to its proper place
in the mainstream,

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:36.260 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I have to go
through this pain of people

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.120 align:middle line:90%
saying things on social media.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.470 align:middle line:90%
But I ignore it.

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:41.510 align:middle line:84%
I have no footprint
on social media.

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And what I pay attention
to is the evidence.

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:48.170 align:middle line:84%
And the evidence about
Oumuamua looked unusual.

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And the same was true
about this meteor

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:54.020 align:middle line:84%
that we discovered with
my student, Amir Siraj.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.990 align:middle line:84%
These were the two
interstellar objects

00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:00.620 align:middle line:84%
that we've discovered
over the past five years.

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And why would the first
two appear so unusual?

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:07.880 align:middle line:84%
To me, it may imply that
something else is going on

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.430 align:middle line:84%
outside the solar system
that we did not think about.

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there
is a huge amount

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:17.100 align:middle line:84%
of pushback against that from
the scientific community.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:20.840 align:middle line:84%
But I think that the
more evidence we get,

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.790 align:middle line:84%
the clearer it would become
that we should consider it,

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:27.830 align:middle line:84%
because this is the
biggest question that

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:30.380 align:middle line:84%
would affect the
future of humanity,

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:32.670 align:middle line:84%
if we find that
we are not alone,

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:36.300 align:middle line:84%
that there is a smarter
intelligence out there.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And it will change our
aspirations in space.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:44.840 align:middle line:84%
A very advanced,
scientific civilization

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.480 align:middle line:84%
is a good approximation
to God if you

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.540 align:middle line:84%
think about it because it could
create life in the laboratory.

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.120 align:middle line:84%
It could even perhaps
create a baby universe

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:53.930 align:middle line:90%
in the laboratory.

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:57.530 align:middle line:84%
All these attributes that
appear in religious texts

00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:59.840 align:middle line:84%
in association with
God could relate

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.380 align:middle line:84%
to a civilization that
is a million years more

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:05.930 align:middle line:84%
advanced than we are in
science and technology.

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And so finding out if such
a thing exists out there,

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:16.220 align:middle line:84%
discovering the unknown is
similar to spirituality.

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:22.780 align:middle line:84%
Trying to explore the
unknown is giving us

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:25.450 align:middle line:90%
a meaning to our lives.

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:32.280 align:middle line:84%
>> With Oumuamua, what I always
found extremely interesting is

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:39.220 align:middle line:84%
that the data said one thing,
but the professionals out there

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:43.080 align:middle line:84%
tried to make that data
fit their opinions.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:48.750 align:middle line:84%
They tried to make it fit
into some natural cosmic event

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:51.610 align:middle line:84%
when the data represented
something completely different.

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:53.850 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
a craft that seemed

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:57.600 align:middle line:84%
to be under intelligent
control, was turning on its own,

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:03.150 align:middle line:84%
was increasing its speed, didn't
have any means of propulsion.

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:04.860 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't gravity-assisted.

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:06.270 align:middle line:90%
All of these things.

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:11.340 align:middle line:84%
But academia tried to
force their belief system

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.750 align:middle line:90%
into data that didn't work.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the book was
about, was this conflict.

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And by you presenting
the conflict,

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:24.490 align:middle line:90%
does that create more problems?

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:25.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:28.170 align:middle line:84%
So at first, the
mainstream astronomer

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:31.230 align:middle line:90%
said it must be natural.

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And then they started to come
up with natural objects that

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:36.870 align:middle line:84%
might explain the
anomalies of Oumuamua.

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:40.430 align:middle line:90%
For example, a dust bunny.

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:44.640 align:middle line:84%
A cloud of dust particles
that is very loosely bound,

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.680 align:middle line:90%
100 times less dense than air.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:52.260 align:middle line:84%
So that by reflecting sunlight,
it gets pushed like a feather.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.950 align:middle line:84%
The problem with that is it
won't maintain its integrity.

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:59.430 align:middle line:84%
It will be heated up
to hundreds of degrees

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:02.580 align:middle line:84%
and will not survive the
journey near the sun.

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And then there was
another suggestion.

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:08.110 align:middle line:84%
OK, so maybe it's a
chunk of frozen hydrogen.

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And when the
hydrogen evaporates,

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:12.420 align:middle line:84%
it behaves just
like a comet, but we

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.580 align:middle line:84%
can't see it because
hydrogen is transparent.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:17.370 align:middle line:84%
The problem with that is it
won't survive the journey

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:18.300 align:middle line:90%
in interstellar space.

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.920 align:middle line:84%
Hydrogen would
evaporate very quickly.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And so when that group of people
who suggested the hydrogen

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:28.710 align:middle line:84%
iceberg realized that after
we wrote a paper about it,

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:31.080 align:middle line:84%
then there was another
team that suggested maybe

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.640 align:middle line:90%
it's a nitrogen iceberg.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.670 align:middle line:84%
A chunk of frozen nitrogen
chipped off the surface

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:37.200 align:middle line:90%
of a planet like Pluto.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And there, the problem is there
is not enough frozen nitrogen

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.690 align:middle line:84%
in the Milky Way
galaxy to produce

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:45.150 align:middle line:90%
a population of such chips.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:49.170 align:middle line:84%
So all of these suggestions
have problems, but all of them

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:52.810 align:middle line:84%
also talk about something
that we've never seen before.

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:55.080 align:middle line:84%
We don't know if
nature makes a dust

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.780 align:middle line:84%
bunny, if nature makes a
hydrogen iceberg or a nitrogen

00:14:58.780 --> 00:14:59.580 align:middle line:90%
iceberg.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Yet these are the possibilities
that the astronomy community

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:09.900 align:middle line:84%
embraced just because they
allowed a natural explanation

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.730 align:middle line:84%
to all the anomalies
of Oumuamua.

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And I say if it's
an object of a type

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:17.970 align:middle line:84%
that we've never seen
before, we should

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:20.400 align:middle line:84%
allow for the possibility
that it's artificial.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, was that
the mistake though?

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:28.440 align:middle line:84%
The mistake of being asleep
when Oumuamua was here,

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:31.050 align:middle line:84%
didn't have the opportunity
to capture the data.

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:32.430 align:middle line:90%
It was here.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:34.740 align:middle line:84%
We only had 11
days to observe it.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:35.830 align:middle line:90%
It's now gone.

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:39.720 align:middle line:84%
We will never collect
more data on Oumuamua.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.520 align:middle line:90%
That's an impossibility.

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And now, we have
the Galileo Project,

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:47.070 align:middle line:84%
which is primed and ready
to go if an event like this

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:47.910 align:middle line:90%
happens again.

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:48.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And we also have
a dating app now,

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:53.370 align:middle line:84%
the Vera Rubin
Observatory in Chile, that

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:56.130 align:middle line:90%
will start operations in 2023.

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And it could
identify more objects

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:00.960 align:middle line:84%
like Oumuamua that
look weird unlike,

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:05.080 align:middle line:84%
a comet or an asteroid that are
familiar from the solar system.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And I call it a dating
app because if we identify

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:13.120 align:middle line:84%
an object that is worth
rendezvousing with,

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:16.270 align:middle line:84%
we could spend $1,000,000,000
on a space mission

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:19.090 align:middle line:84%
that will come close to it and
take a close up photograph.

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of the activity
within the Galileo Project.

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:23.870 align:middle line:90%
Designing such a mission.

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And we also have
the Webb telescope

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:29.110 align:middle line:84%
that can look at such an object
from a different direction

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:31.360 align:middle line:90%
than the observatories on Earth.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And then can, in
principle, figure out

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.280 align:middle line:84%
the motion of this object
in three dimensions

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:40.150 align:middle line:84%
and tell us whether
it has propulsion

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:43.390 align:middle line:84%
that is different
than the rocket effect

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:45.070 align:middle line:90%
from cometary evaporation.

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And it could also tell us the
composition of the object.

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:51.190 align:middle line:84%
So now that we are alert
to this possibility,

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:54.670 align:middle line:84%
we could find much more
about the next Oumuamua.

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:57.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Oumuamua, of course, 2017.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And there was a lot of
extraordinary things in the UAP

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.503 align:middle line:84%
UFO community that
happened over that period

00:17:03.503 --> 00:17:04.420 align:middle line:90%
of a couple of months.

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:05.859 align:middle line:90%
It was a pretty exciting time.

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:09.190 align:middle line:84%
But in 2014, the
Department of Defense

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:12.099 align:middle line:84%
and other agencies here
in the United States

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:17.290 align:middle line:84%
monitored an object apparently
from interstellar space entered

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:20.360 align:middle line:84%
our atmosphere and is somewhere
in the vicinity of Papua New

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:21.160 align:middle line:90%
Guinea.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And this is your next project,
in addition to, of course,

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:26.050 align:middle line:90%
Galileo.

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:26.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:30.460 align:middle line:84%
So aside from objects that
reflect sunlight and pass

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:33.550 align:middle line:84%
near the Earth, we
have an opportunity

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:36.250 align:middle line:84%
of using the Earth
as a fishing net.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:40.840 align:middle line:84%
It could collide with an object
along its path around the sun.

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And the advantage of that is
that when an object burns up

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:49.270 align:middle line:84%
in the atmosphere of the
Earth, it shines very brightly,

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:52.180 align:middle line:84%
so we could, in principle,
see much smaller objects

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:53.110 align:middle line:90%
than Oumuamua.

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:55.750 align:middle line:84%
Oumuamua was the size
of a football field.

00:17:55.750 --> 00:18:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And this meteor from 2014 that
the government missile warning

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:06.790 align:middle line:84%
systems identified was roughly
the size of a watermelon.

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't see it because
of the reflection of sunlight.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:13.450 align:middle line:84%
We saw it because it burned
up in the Earth's atmosphere.

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And it was very different
than Oumuamua in the sense

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:19.360 align:middle line:90%
that it was tougher than iron.

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.540 align:middle line:84%
We know from the light
curve that the government

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:26.780 align:middle line:84%
released that it burned only
in the lower Earth atmosphere.

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, it was
subjected to extreme stress

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.460 align:middle line:90%
from the atmosphere.

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And it must have been
very tough, tougher

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:42.280 align:middle line:84%
than 273 of all other meteors
in the government catalog.

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And so it was an outlier in
terms of its composition.

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:48.520 align:middle line:90%
Tougher than iron.

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And also, it was
moving faster than 95%

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:54.790 align:middle line:84%
of all the stars in
the vicinity of the sun

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:56.110 align:middle line:90%
outside the solar system.

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:59.920 align:middle line:84%
So it could have
been a spacecraft.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:03.640 align:middle line:84%
If you imagine the New
Horizons spacecraft,

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.640 align:middle line:84%
that is making its way
out of the solar system,

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:11.020 align:middle line:84%
a billion years from now
colliding with an exoplanet.

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And the astronomers
there saying, oh,

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:17.050 align:middle line:90%
look at this meteor.

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And some astronomers
say, oh, forget about it.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.990 align:middle line:90%
It's just a rock.

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:27.760 align:middle line:84%
But others are curious enough
to check the ocean floor where

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:31.570 align:middle line:84%
the fragments landed and
realized that it was actually

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:36.040 align:middle line:84%
made of an alloy and not
a rock, rocky material.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:39.500 align:middle line:10%
And moreover, in the case of
the New Horizons spacecraft,

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.940 align:middle line:10%
they would find
perhaps this small box

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.580 align:middle line:10%
that was attached
to it that included

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:51.370 align:middle line:10%
30 grams of the ashes of Clyde
Tombaugh, the scientist who

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:53.480 align:middle line:10%
discovered Pluto.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And they would say, well,
that makes little sense

00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:02.240 align:middle line:84%
because these ashes are just
like the ashes of a cigarette.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.720 align:middle line:90%
They contain no information.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:09.080 align:middle line:84%
So these humans burned up
the genetic information

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.480 align:middle line:84%
about a person that they
wanted to commemorate.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, they
must be very aggressive.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.740 align:middle line:84%
They have these
primitive rituals.

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:17.960 align:middle line:84%
We don't want anything
to do with these humans.

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.360 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, when
they arrive, Avi,

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:23.510 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
ask for you first.

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:28.280 align:middle line:84%
The difference in data
from what a university

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:31.250 align:middle line:84%
or professional organization
would collect it's

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:33.740 align:middle line:84%
obviously different from
eyewitness testimony

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:35.750 align:middle line:90%
that we've had for decades.

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:38.510 align:middle line:84%
But you've just
mentioned evidence

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:40.550 align:middle line:90%
a couple of times and data.

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:42.320 align:middle line:90%
What evidence is there?

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.570 align:middle line:90%
What do you consider evidence?

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And how would that be different
from a cell phone video

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:52.020 align:middle line:84%
from somebody that is just
seeing something in the sky?

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:52.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:56.480 align:middle line:84%
So let me start by saying
that I grew up on a farm.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And I was attached to nature,
much more than to people.

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:03.230 align:middle line:84%
I distinguish between the two
because people can tell you

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:05.160 align:middle line:90%
stories that are not real.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.040 align:middle line:90%
They have some hidden agenda.

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And so I would like to advance
my knowledge based on evidence,

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.950 align:middle line:84%
based on clues that we collect
directly from nature, not

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:18.780 align:middle line:90%
through the filter of people.

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And when people use
their cell phones,

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:25.350 align:middle line:84%
they usually have a camera
that has an aperture

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:26.590 align:middle line:90%
of only a few millimeters.

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:27.510 align:middle line:90%
So it's very small.

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And the images are quite fuzzy
when you look at an object

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:32.580 align:middle line:90%
several miles away.

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's just
the laws of optics.

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:36.520 align:middle line:90%
You can't improve on that.

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.450 align:middle line:84%
The only way to improve is
to get a bigger aperture,

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:42.790 align:middle line:84%
like a telescope, and look
at the object and resolve it.

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And if you see a label made
on exoplanet so-and-so, then

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:49.860 align:middle line:84%
you know that it's
not from this Earth.

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:53.050 align:middle line:84%
Now the government says
they have high quality data,

00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:54.690 align:middle line:90%
but it's classified.

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And people who looked at that
say that is a serious matter.

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.930 align:middle line:84%
However, waiting
for the government

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:04.560 align:middle line:84%
to declassify the data is
just like waiting for Godot

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.420 align:middle line:90%
in Samuel Beckett's play.

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:08.100 align:middle line:90%
You can wait forever.

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:09.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm not patient.

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, since the
sky is not classified,

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.510 align:middle line:84%
I would like to get my
own data as a scientist.

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:17.110 align:middle line:90%
That's the way to make progress.

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And once the data
is good enough,

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:22.000 align:middle line:84%
it will be impossible
to avoid it.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.160 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if you
go back for centuries,

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.590 align:middle line:84%
Galileo Galilei looked
through his telescope

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:31.500 align:middle line:84%
and realized, oh,
maybe the Earth is not

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.000 align:middle line:90%
at the center of the universe.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.550 align:middle line:90%
He was ridiculed.

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:40.050 align:middle line:84%
Philosophers at the time
put him in house arrest.

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:43.050 align:middle line:84%
Today, he would have been
canceled on social media.

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:47.430 align:middle line:84%
That didn't change the fact that
the Earth moves around the sun.

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:50.610 align:middle line:90%
Reality is whatever it is.

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:53.430 align:middle line:84%
If you were to ask these
philosophers to design a space

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:55.680 align:middle line:84%
mission that would
reach Mars, they

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:57.360 align:middle line:84%
would never get
to the destination

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:00.300 align:middle line:84%
because they thought that
Mars moves around the Earth.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And so people can have presence
on social media or on campuses

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.820 align:middle line:84%
and ridicule one
thing or another.

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.490 align:middle line:90%
That's irrelevant.

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:11.850 align:middle line:90%
Nature is whatever it is.

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And the only way
for us to find out

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.350 align:middle line:84%
is to get more
evidence, more data.

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:21.823 align:middle line:84%
But if you keep saying that this
subject is not worth studying,

00:23:21.823 --> 00:23:23.240 align:middle line:84%
then you will never
get that data.

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.070 align:middle line:84%
It's like a
self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:27.740 align:middle line:84%
If you keep saying everything
in the sky must be natural,

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:32.030 align:middle line:84%
cannot be artificial unless we
have extraordinary evidence,

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:33.500 align:middle line:90%
well, guess what?

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:37.940 align:middle line:84%
People often quote Carl Sagan
as saying extraordinary claims

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:39.920 align:middle line:90%
require extraordinary evidence.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:44.310 align:middle line:84%
I say extraordinary evidence
requires extraordinary funding.

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:47.660 align:middle line:84%
You have to look for
the evidence actively.

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:49.520 align:middle line:84%
Just as an example,
we don't know

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:52.250 align:middle line:84%
what most of the matter
in the universe is.

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:56.360 align:middle line:84%
In 1933, Fritz Zwicky,
an astronomer at Caltech,

00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:00.030 align:middle line:84%
argued that it's of
unknown substance.

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:03.340 align:middle line:84%
We don't see that substance
in the solar system.

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.220 align:middle line:90%
And so it's called dark matter.

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And we've invested billions
of dollars, most recently,

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:11.280 align:middle line:84%
in the context of the
Large Hadron Collider,

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:13.410 align:middle line:84%
smashing particles
at high energies,

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:16.990 align:middle line:84%
trying to see if the dark
matter particles are produced.

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:18.940 align:middle line:10%
We didn't find them.

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:23.850 align:middle line:10%
So if we will invest billions
of over the next few decades

00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:27.180 align:middle line:10%
in the search for equipment
from other civilizations,

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:30.750 align:middle line:10%
just because we send
out spacecraft to space

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:32.700 align:middle line:10%
that will go out of
the solar system,

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:36.360 align:middle line:10%
and we know of tens of
billions of other planets

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.850 align:middle line:10%
within the Milky
Way who could have

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:41.828 align:middle line:10%
had intelligent life on them.

00:24:41.828 --> 00:24:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And that could have happened
a billion years ago.

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:48.000 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps, there is
something in our backyard.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.260 align:middle line:90%
That all makes sense.

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:52.050 align:middle line:10%
If we do that search
and not find anything

00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:54.330 align:middle line:10%
despite the billions of
dollars that we invested,

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:56.640 align:middle line:10%
we would be at
exactly the same point

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.640 align:middle line:10%
as dark matter
searches are right now.

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.800 align:middle line:10%
And they are part of the
mainstream of science.

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.500 align:middle line:10%
So that's why we establish the
Galileo Project, where we are

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:06.900 align:middle line:10%
funded by private donations.

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And we will go ahead
and collect the data,

00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:10.680 align:middle line:90%
make it open to the public.

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.290 align:middle line:84%
The analysis will
be transparent.

00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, we'll
know what's out there.

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:19.200 align:middle line:84%
>> The team has
been put together.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And just recently, you've
installed collection equipment

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:27.240 align:middle line:90%
on a rooftop at Harvard.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.490 align:middle line:90%
Josh, can you pull this up?

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And as we take a
look at this, Avi,

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:36.450 align:middle line:84%
what instruments
are you using here,

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:38.520 align:middle line:90%
and what do you expect to find?

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:42.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we're trying to
take a video of the sky

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:48.000 align:middle line:84%
in the infrared, in the
optical band, in the radio,

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.060 align:middle line:84%
and also in audio, so that we
can trace objects in the sky.

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is
to figure out what

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.940 align:middle line:84%
are these mysterious objects
that the government is talking

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:08.910 align:middle line:84%
about as aerospace, transmedium
objects of unidentified nature.

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:14.220 align:middle line:84%
In November, 2021,
I attended the forum

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:15.720 align:middle line:84%
at the Washington
National Cathedral

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:19.230 align:middle line:84%
with the Director of National
Intelligence Avril Haines.

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And I was sitting
next to her and asking

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:27.300 align:middle line:84%
her, what's your gut feeling,
because she delivered a report

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.100 align:middle line:90%
to Congress at the time.

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And what's your
gut feeling about

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:33.000 align:middle line:90%
these unidentified objects?

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.920 align:middle line:90%
And she said, I don't know.

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And she was educated
as a physicist.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:40.417 align:middle line:84%
So I say let's help the
government figuring it out

00:26:40.417 --> 00:26:42.750 align:middle line:84%
because the government is not
a scientific organization.

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:45.990 align:middle line:84%
It's worried mostly
about national security

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:48.870 align:middle line:84%
and about the safety
of military personnel.

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:52.770 align:middle line:84%
But scientists can
address everything else.

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And if these objects are
not human-made or natural,

00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:00.600 align:middle line:84%
we can figure out their nature
by taking high resolution

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:05.400 align:middle line:84%
images or monitoring
their motion in the sky.

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:09.990 align:middle line:84%
To do that, we need to observe
these objects in the infrared,

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:12.780 align:middle line:84%
in the optical band,
radio, and audio,

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:17.490 align:middle line:84%
and then feed the data to
artificial intelligence

00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:21.150 align:middle line:84%
algorithms that will
identify objects,

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:23.400 align:middle line:84%
and we will use
machine learning,

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.170 align:middle line:90%
learn from experience.

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And basically, there
will be two baskets

00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:30.840 align:middle line:84%
that will include most of
the objects that we see.

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:36.300 align:middle line:84%
One of them is natural objects,
like birds, bugs, lightnings,

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:37.530 align:middle line:90%
meteors.

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:40.740 align:middle line:84%
The second would be
human-made objects,

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:42.660 align:middle line:90%
like drones, airplanes.

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And the question is is
there something else,

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:47.970 align:middle line:90%
and is it out of this Earth?

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:51.038 align:middle line:84%
So the government
says we see things

00:27:51.038 --> 00:27:52.080 align:middle line:90%
that we don't understand.

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And they would never come
out if they had the suspicion

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:59.400 align:middle line:84%
that it's an adversary because
that's part of their day job,

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.590 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what the
adversaries are doing.

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:04.440 align:middle line:84%
But they go to
Congress and say, there

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:08.340 align:middle line:84%
is something else that doesn't
belong to those nations.

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:10.090 align:middle line:84%
And so the question
is what is it?

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And if it's out
of this Earth, it

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:15.970 align:middle line:84%
doesn't adhere to
national borders,

00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:19.120 align:middle line:84%
it should be the
subject of science

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.680 align:middle line:84%
because science
is international.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:24.130 align:middle line:84%
Science is all about sharing
our knowledge in open fashion.

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:28.630 align:middle line:84%
Government is about protecting
the nation against threats.

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:31.570 align:middle line:84%
It's about classifying
information such

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:33.470 align:middle line:84%
that adversaries will
not be aware of it.

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:35.440 align:middle line:84%
So there is a
difference in the way

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:40.450 align:middle line:84%
that the scientific approach
is applied to such questions.

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you prepared for a
discovery, the high res image,

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:48.220 align:middle line:84%
something absolutely
extraordinary,

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:53.350 align:middle line:84%
and then the government coming
in, running a block on this

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:57.250 align:middle line:84%
and saying this is in the
interests of national security.

00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:59.620 align:middle line:84%
We're taking control
of this data.

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Are you prepared for that, and
what have you thought about it?

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.190 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm not worried
about it at all

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:07.270 align:middle line:10%
because if it's of
extraterrestrial origin,

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:12.190 align:middle line:10%
it's not a threat to the
United States in particular.

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:15.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a subject that
should be dealt

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:19.010 align:middle line:90%
with by humanity as a whole.

00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And my hope is that by
recognizing a smarter kid

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:27.040 align:middle line:84%
on our block, we will treat
each other as equal members

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:30.760 align:middle line:84%
of the human species because
the differences among us

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:34.750 align:middle line:84%
will be meaningless relative
to the technological gap

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:37.270 align:middle line:90%
between us and them.

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is also an opportunity
to learn something new

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:43.480 align:middle line:84%
because it might appear
as if we are looking

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:47.410 align:middle line:84%
over the shoulder of
a smarter classmate

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:50.710 align:middle line:84%
to find answers to
fundamental questions,

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:53.260 align:middle line:84%
like discovering
new technologies,

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:55.990 align:middle line:84%
discovering new
science, new physics.

00:29:55.990 --> 00:30:00.580 align:middle line:84%
But if it saves us millions
of years, it's worth it.

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And I would rather learn from
a smarter kid on our block

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:10.280 align:middle line:84%
than try to invent
the will in a way.

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:13.970 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's an opportunity
more than a risk for us.

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So what's the most amazing or
the most exciting evidence that

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.150 align:middle line:90%
you've collected so far?

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:22.030 align:middle line:84%
>> That the first interstellar
meteor, for example,

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:27.850 align:middle line:84%
discovered in 2014 was tougher
than all the other meteors

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:29.860 align:middle line:84%
in the catalog that the
government compiled,

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:32.320 align:middle line:90%
273 of them.

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:37.425 align:middle line:84%
It was twice as tough as iron
because it disintegrated only

00:30:37.425 --> 00:30:38.800 align:middle line:84%
in the lower
atmosphere of Earth.

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.090 align:middle line:84%
It was moving at 45
kilometers per second.

00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:42.190 align:middle line:90%
Very fast.

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And that implied that it
had a very strong material

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:46.330 align:middle line:84%
strength because
otherwise, it would

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:48.500 align:middle line:90%
have disintegrated far above.

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And the government
released the light curve

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:53.380 align:middle line:84%
of the explosion
that took place.

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And we analyzed it and realized
that it was tougher than iron.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And moreover, it
was moving faster

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:03.880 align:middle line:84%
than 95% of all the stars
in the vicinity of the sun

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.750 align:middle line:90%
outside the solar system.

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And so maybe it
was a spacecraft.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.860 align:middle line:84%
The only way to find out
is to collect the fragments

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:16.960 align:middle line:84%
from this explosion, which are
at the bottom of the Pacific

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Ocean, about 100 miles off
the coast of Papua New Guinea.

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:23.080 align:middle line:84%
>> So Avi, what evidence have
you captured with the Galileo

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:24.040 align:middle line:90%
Project so far?

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.207 align:middle line:84%
What's the most compelling
evidence you've captured?

00:31:26.207 --> 00:31:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, so far, we haven't
captured new data because we

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:32.380 align:middle line:84%
just established the suite of
instruments that we are using.

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And in coming months, we'll
test those instruments,

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:39.950 align:middle line:84%
collect data, and analyze it
with artificial intelligence

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:40.750 align:middle line:90%
algorithms.

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll deploy those
instruments at a location

00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:48.760 align:middle line:84%
where unidentified
objects were reported.

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And once we start collecting
data, we will analyze the data.

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, hopefully,
within the coming year,

00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:57.790 align:middle line:90%
release it to the public.

00:31:57.790 --> 00:31:59.170 align:middle line:90%
>> What's the plan, Avi?

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:03.010 align:middle line:84%
You have to have a plan in place
to present this to the media.

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And what is that
Rubicon that you

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:12.100 align:middle line:84%
have to cross of what is
presentable and exciting?

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:13.670 align:middle line:90%
What's the plan?

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:16.060 align:middle line:84%
>> First, we will make
sure that we understand how

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:19.900 align:middle line:84%
the instruments work because
government data is collected

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:23.290 align:middle line:84%
by instruments that they
have no full control over,

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:26.570 align:middle line:84%
like if it's a camera in a
jittery cockpit of a fighter

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:27.370 align:middle line:90%
jet.

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:29.950 align:middle line:84%
You don't know exactly what
the fighter jet was doing.

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:32.440 align:middle line:84%
We would have full control
over the instruments.

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:35.950 align:middle line:84%
We will try to understand all
the systematic effects that

00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:37.310 align:middle line:90%
may come into play.

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:40.960 align:middle line:90%
And then analyze the data.

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.480 align:middle line:84%
Write a scientific
paper about it.

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:45.520 align:middle line:84%
Submit it to a peer
reviewed journal.

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And once it's accepted
for publication,

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:52.330 align:middle line:84%
we'll release the data, make it
open, so anyone can analyze it.

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:57.250 align:middle line:84%
So that's the scientific process
of getting peer reviewed data

00:32:57.250 --> 00:33:00.170 align:middle line:84%
to be open to the
scientific community.

00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And if we do find a
visitor in our backyard,

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:08.680 align:middle line:84%
the implications
will be dramatic.

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:11.590 align:middle line:84%
The search for extraterrestrial
intelligence in the past

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:14.800 align:middle line:84%
was looking for radio
signals from stars that are

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.690 align:middle line:90%
thousands of light years away.

00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And if we were to detect such
a signal, which by the way,

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:23.710 align:middle line:84%
is a very naive
proposition because we

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:26.860 align:middle line:84%
developed radio communication
only over the past century.

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And we are backing
off from it right now

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:33.010 align:middle line:84%
because we have fiber optic
for transferring data,

00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:34.960 align:middle line:90%
rather than radio.

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:37.060 align:middle line:84%
We are also using
lasers for radio

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:39.980 align:middle line:90%
for communication in space.

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And so another civilization
using this primitive mode

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:47.170 align:middle line:84%
of communication for
a long period of time

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:50.410 align:middle line:90%
is not necessarily out there.

00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And moreover, civilizations
may have a lifetime

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:56.170 align:middle line:84%
that could be quite
short once they

00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:57.610 align:middle line:84%
develop their
technologies because

00:33:57.610 --> 00:33:58.870 align:middle line:90%
of self-inflicted wounds.

00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:02.140 align:middle line:84%
So searching for those
signals make little sense

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:03.760 align:middle line:84%
because those
signals may have been

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:05.480 align:middle line:90%
generated a billion years ago.

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And by now, they're a
billion light years away.

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:14.590 align:middle line:84%
However, if those civilizations
sent anything to space, probes,

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:18.070 align:middle line:84%
those probes are still
confined by gravity

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:19.310 align:middle line:90%
to the Milky Way galaxy.

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:23.080 align:middle line:84%
So they collect in this basket
called the Milky Way galaxy,

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:25.550 align:middle line:90%
and we can find them around us.

00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And now the question
is what to do if we

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:30.808 align:middle line:90%
find a visitor in our backyard?

00:34:30.808 --> 00:34:32.350 align:middle line:84%
It's a completely
different situation

00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:36.130 align:middle line:84%
because you don't have
the luxury of saying, OK,

00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:39.219 align:middle line:84%
the signal came from
1,000 light years away.

00:34:39.219 --> 00:34:40.810 align:middle line:90%
Therefore, it took 2,000 years.

00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:42.730 align:middle line:90%
We have 1,000 years to respond.

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:44.020 align:middle line:90%
There's plenty of time.

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:45.130 align:middle line:90%
No rush.

00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:49.770 align:middle line:84%
Here, it's like having a
person in your backyard,

00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:51.370 align:middle line:84%
you have to do
something about it.

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:52.770 align:middle line:90%
We don't have a protocol.

00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:55.120 align:middle line:90%
And who represents humanity?

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:57.810 align:middle line:84%
We don't have an
organization that does it.

00:34:57.810 --> 00:34:59.640 align:middle line:84%
What to do about the
technological gap?

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:02.040 align:middle line:84%
Suppose this device
is very advanced

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:06.810 align:middle line:84%
relative to what we possess,
how do we interpret its intent?

00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:11.220 align:middle line:84%
Imagine ants on a
sidewalk witnessing

00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:13.660 align:middle line:84%
a biker that stopped
just next to them

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:16.530 align:middle line:84%
and starting to discuss what
protocol should we follow

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:18.390 align:middle line:90%
in engaging with this biker?

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:19.920 align:middle line:90%
That's completely irrelevant.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:22.620 align:middle line:84%
The biker wouldn't care
less about these ants.

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.670 align:middle line:90%
The biker may step on them.

00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And so whatever we do might
not be really relevant.

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:31.170 align:middle line:84%
What we should do at
first is figure out

00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:34.440 align:middle line:84%
what the intent of
any device we find is

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:37.230 align:middle line:84%
and what the property,
the physical properties

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:38.430 align:middle line:90%
of this device is.

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:40.380 align:middle line:84%
Does it represent
technologies that

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:43.200 align:middle line:84%
are way beyond what
we can imagine,

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:46.920 align:middle line:84%
just like a cell phone
represents technologies

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:49.140 align:middle line:84%
that a cave dweller
would never imagine?

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Imagine a cave dweller
going to New York City,

00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:54.600 align:middle line:84%
seeing all the
gadgets out there.

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.252 align:middle line:90%
That would look like magic.

00:35:56.252 --> 00:35:57.210 align:middle line:90%
>> I want to thank you.

00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:59.190 align:middle line:90%
What a great conversation today.

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And the Galileo
Project, of course,

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:07.020 align:middle line:84%
and what is going on
in Papua New Guinea,

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:08.790 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
discover something.

00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be an amazing
moment for humanity, you,

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:18.840 align:middle line:84%
to touch the first
interstellar object ever.

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that you come back
and make the announcement here.

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.340 align:middle line:90%
>> I'd be delighted.

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:27.840 align:middle line:84%
My wife says that if they
ever come to pick me up,

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:29.770 align:middle line:90%
she wants me to do two things.

00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:32.460 align:middle line:84%
One, to leave the
car keys with her.

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And the second is
to ask them not

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:39.690 align:middle line:84%
to ruin the lawn in our
backyard when they take off.

00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:41.460 align:middle line:90%
>> You can't have that.

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:42.330 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Avi.

00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:43.590 align:middle line:90%
Great conversation.

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:44.865 align:middle line:90%
This has been Into the Vortex.

00:36:44.865 --> 00:36:47.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Jimmy Church.

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:51.000 align:middle line:90%
