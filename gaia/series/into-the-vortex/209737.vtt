00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.290 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm radio and television
host, Jimmy Church,

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.079 align:middle line:84%
and I'm here to uncover
the truth about some

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.120 align:middle line:90%
of life's biggest mysteries.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.630 align:middle line:84%
If this is revealed,
everything has to be rewritten.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.620 align:middle line:10%
My guest today is Scott Wolter,
a forensic geologist, author,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.050 align:middle line:10%
and television
host, whose research

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.840 align:middle line:10%
suggests that there are
alternative narratives

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.430 align:middle line:10%
to mainstream history.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And I said it was authentic,
and that's when the trouble

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.020 align:middle line:90%
started.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Technical Assistant, Josh.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.200 align:middle line:90%
Josh, can you pull up the map?

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Also joins us to
help set the scenes.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.490 align:middle line:84%
Join us as we deep-dive to
get to the bottom of some

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.400 align:middle line:84%
of the most intriguing
questions of our time.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.460 align:middle line:84%
Frankly, we have been
fed a boatload of lies

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.270 align:middle line:84%
about the history
of our country.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.735 align:middle line:84%
Everybody was here
before Columbus.

00:00:57.735 --> 00:01:11.100 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome to Into the vortex.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Jimmy Church.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And today, we're going
to talk about one

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.510 align:middle line:84%
of the most controversial
subjects there is,

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.340 align:middle line:84%
which is who discovered America
before Columbus, with geologist

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.150 align:middle line:90%
Scott Wolter.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.660 align:middle line:90%
Josh, are you ready for this?

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.460 align:middle line:90%
>> I am ready.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.140 align:middle line:84%
I always love going
into old stuff

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.557 align:middle line:84%
and finding out
everything we know

00:01:29.557 --> 00:01:30.810 align:middle line:90%
is older than we think it is.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott, this is--

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.290 align:middle line:84%
it's controversial, but
what are the implications

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.280 align:middle line:84%
of somebody discovering
America before Columbus?

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Jim, that's
a huge topic, really,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.570 align:middle line:84%
but to distill it down,
there's a couple of things.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.610 align:middle line:84%
First of all, as a scientist,
I just want it to be right.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.340 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the answer
is, is the answer.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.430 align:middle line:90%
And I want it to be the truth.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And frankly, we have been
fed a boatload of lies

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.960 align:middle line:84%
about the history
of our country.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.280 align:middle line:84%
Everybody was here
before Columbus.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And what's at stake
here really is not just

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:12.420 align:middle line:84%
getting the past right, but
getting the present right.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And the way we get it
right is by understanding

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.090 align:middle line:84%
what happened in the past
that leads to the future

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.470 align:middle line:84%
so that we can go
forward the right way.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And I will say this without
getting into the politics

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.060 align:middle line:90%
or into the details.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.200 align:middle line:84%
I think we can all agree that
what's happening in the world

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.700 align:middle line:90%
today is messed up.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And part of the problem
is there's disinformation,

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.000 align:middle line:90%
there's misinformation.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And the only way we can
go forward intelligently

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.170 align:middle line:84%
successfully is to get
the information right.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And that means
understanding what happened.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's so important
because it's about the future.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, if different
explorers, for whatever reason,

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.850 align:middle line:84%
were arriving here in what
is now labeled North America,

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.720 align:middle line:84%
100s if not maybe 1,000
years before Columbus,

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.760 align:middle line:90%
does that mean a land grab?

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And if you've left something
behind to mark that territory,

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.800 align:middle line:84%
is it possible that another
country, maybe from Europe,

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.910 align:middle line:84%
could lay claim to
the United States?

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.140 align:middle line:90%
>> That is a great question.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of the problem
because if there were people

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.170 align:middle line:90%
that came here before Chris--

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.800 align:middle line:84%
I call him Chris, the guy that
didn't set foot on what we now

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.500 align:middle line:84%
call the United States of
America, that already had

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.940 align:middle line:90%
millions of people living here.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.030 align:middle line:84%
The whole notion of talking
about discovering America

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.620 align:middle line:90%
is frankly ridiculous.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.560 align:middle line:84%
But getting back to your
question about a land grab,

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.390 align:middle line:84%
the Kensington Runestone,
which, in my opinion,

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.510 align:middle line:84%
is the most important
historical artifact

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.170 align:middle line:84%
in the history of this
nation and of this continent,

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.530 align:middle line:90%
is exactly that.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.320 align:middle line:90%
It's a land claim.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.932 align:middle line:84%
And I've actually had attorneys
call me, representing people

00:03:57.932 --> 00:03:59.640 align:middle line:84%
that they wouldn't
tell me who they were.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.820 align:middle line:84%
They were interested in
exploring that question.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:08.490 align:middle line:84%
Could the runestone actually
usurp any colonial claim

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.430 align:middle line:84%
to what we now call the
United States of America?

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know the legal
implications of that,

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.840 align:middle line:84%
but there's no question the
Kensington Runestone is a land

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.640 align:middle line:90%
claim.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And there may be
others out there,

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.280 align:middle line:84%
but there's a lot of
artifacts that really change

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.700 align:middle line:84%
the current narrative, that
there are certain powers that

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.590 align:middle line:90%
be do not want out there.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.260 align:middle line:84%
One of those being the
Roman Catholic Church.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.230 align:middle line:84%
They are exerting themselves
in a huge way right now.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And frankly, they are not doing
humanity any good right now.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sorry to have to say
that, but it's the hard truth.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to get into
it, I will get into it.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.630 align:middle line:84%
But the people that carved
the Kensington Runestone,

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.050 align:middle line:84%
part of the reason they did it
is because, what was happening

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.480 align:middle line:84%
in Europe at the
time, with a group

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.500 align:middle line:84%
called the Knights Templar,
who were persecuted by who?

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.820 align:middle line:84%
A monarchy-- the King of France,
Philip the Fair, and the Roman

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.200 align:middle line:90%
Catholic Church.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And what they did
was they put together

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.640 align:middle line:84%
a stockpile of
artifacts, of money,

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:18.040 align:middle line:84%
of technology, of
documents, and remains,

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.430 align:middle line:84%
and they brought them over here,
starting in the-- actually,

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.000 align:middle line:84%
starting in the 12th century,
and they buried them here

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.650 align:middle line:90%
for someday.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:33.010 align:middle line:84%
Someday came in 1776 when
we defeated the British

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:38.050 align:middle line:84%
in the Revolutionary War, which
is a Monarchy back then, right?

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the story
that has not been told.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And that runestone was
the stake in the ground

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.340 align:middle line:84%
if they needed it, but
they didn't need it

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.550 align:middle line:84%
because the founding fathers,
who were all Freemasons,

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.580 align:middle line:84%
I might mention,
founded this country,

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.590 align:middle line:90%
and the rest is really history.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.210 align:middle line:84%
But at this particular point in
time, this Republic that they

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.270 align:middle line:84%
founded, that we
all are living in

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:10.470 align:middle line:84%
and love and pledge allegiance
to every day, is in trouble.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.740 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it's really
important that we have

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.800 align:middle line:84%
this conversation, we talk
about these artifacts,

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.790 align:middle line:90%
we talk about the implications.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.210 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for giving
me this opportunity.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's start--

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.420 align:middle line:84%
Josh, if you could, let's look
at the Kensington Runestone.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And your books about
this and your research

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.040 align:middle line:90%
are comprehensive.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.200 align:middle line:84%
You have traveled
internationally

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.960 align:middle line:84%
and have done work with
different universities

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.100 align:middle line:84%
and researchers, not only
to decipher the stone

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.030 align:middle line:84%
but to figure out who was here
first and what the dating of it

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:45.830 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.050 align:middle line:90%
So here's the stone.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.190 align:middle line:90%
Where was it found?

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the Kensington
Runestone is about 31 inches

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.110 align:middle line:84%
long, 15 and 1/2 inches wide,
and about 5 and 1/2 inches

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.910 align:middle line:90%
thick.

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.830 align:middle line:90%
It weighs 202 pounds.

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And it was found
in the fall of 1898

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.200 align:middle line:84%
by a Swedish
immigrant farmer who

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.070 align:middle line:90%
was homesteading this property.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And he was clearing trees
in preparation for farming,

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:12.630 align:middle line:84%
and he cut off the roots
around this roughly 25

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.070 align:middle line:90%
to 30-year-old Aspen tree.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And when he took a winch
and pulled the tree down,

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.580 align:middle line:84%
which pulled the stump
out at the same time,

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.340 align:middle line:84%
tightly wrapped in
the roots of the tree,

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.760 align:middle line:84%
almost directly underneath
it, was this stone.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was actually his young
son, who was nine years old,

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.230 align:middle line:90%
Edward Ohman.

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:33.630 align:middle line:84%
The farmer, his
name was Olaf Ohman.

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And it was his
younger son, Edward,

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.910 align:middle line:84%
who first noticed that there was
something carved on the stone.

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:42.120 align:middle line:84%
At first, they said they thought
it was an Indian Almanac,

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.000 align:middle line:84%
but it was quickly realized,
when scholars looked at it,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.570 align:middle line:84%
that it was a long
12-line inscription carved

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:50.880 align:middle line:90%
in Scandinavian runes.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And 124 years ago, this thing
was pulled out of the ground,

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:59.070 align:middle line:84%
and its authenticity has
been debated ever since.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:02.520 align:middle line:84%
I got involved in 2000 when
it came into my laboratory,

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.680 align:middle line:84%
and I did a forensic
study on it.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.120 align:middle line:90%
And they asked me--

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.600 align:middle line:84%
the museum where the
artifact is currently housed,

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.120 align:middle line:90%
in Kensington, Minnesota--

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.060 align:middle line:84%
if I could try to
age-date the inscription.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.970 align:middle line:84%
So I did a study where I
compared the weathering

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:23.280 align:middle line:84%
of the ruins with Revolutionary
War-era tombstones that

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.660 align:middle line:90%
have the dates right there.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to conclude
that the weathering was older

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:32.250 align:middle line:84%
than 200 years, and that was
from the day it was pulled out

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:33.960 align:middle line:84%
of the ground because
it hasn't been

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.820 align:middle line:84%
in a weathering
environment since.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:40.110 align:middle line:84%
So you push it back
200 years from 1898,

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:41.909 align:middle line:90%
Olof Ohman couldn't have done.

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:44.790 align:middle line:84%
He's the guy that
to this day, people

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.110 align:middle line:90%
have accused of carving it.

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:47.460 align:middle line:90%
That's impossible.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And I said it was
authentic, and that's

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.940 align:middle line:84%
when the trouble
started for me, anyway.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:59.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Now what were the dates that
were implied on the runestone

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:02.990 align:middle line:84%
and a conversation
about a land-grab,

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:04.670 align:middle line:84%
and that was the
purpose of the stone?

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:05.720 align:middle line:90%
What did it say?

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>> It starts with a
number, the number 8,

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.960 align:middle line:84%
which is very important, very
sacred to the group that carved

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.710 align:middle line:84%
this, but it says eight
Gotlanders and 22 Northmen,

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:21.950 align:middle line:84%
Norwegians, on this acquisition
business or taking up land from

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.690 align:middle line:90%
Vinland far to the West.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.690 align:middle line:84%
We had a camp near two
shelters, one day's journey

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:28.670 align:middle line:90%
North from the stone.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.230 align:middle line:90%
We were fishing one day.

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:35.150 align:middle line:84%
After we came home, found 10
men red from blood and death,

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:39.260 align:middle line:84%
and then three Latin letters A,
V, M. And then the last line,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.060 align:middle line:90%
it says save from evils.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:42.710 align:middle line:90%
There's nine lines on the front.

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:45.240 align:middle line:84%
The last three lines
on the split side,

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.900 align:middle line:84%
which is intentionally
split by the carver

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:51.560 align:middle line:84%
to create that
final shape, it says

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:55.240 align:middle line:84%
"There are 10 men by the inland
sea to look after our ships.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.890 align:middle line:84%
14 days journey
from this Island.

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:04.190 align:middle line:84%
Year 1362" Now, that's
130 years before Chris.

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And this was found in
the geographic center,

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.720 align:middle line:90%
approximately, of North America.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And of course, how
could anybody get

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.750 align:middle line:84%
to the center of the
continent before Chris even

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:16.520 align:middle line:90%
came here 130 years?

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:17.660 align:middle line:90%
Impossible.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.040 align:middle line:90%
It must be a fake.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.060 align:middle line:90%
>> It must be a fake.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And there's a very standout
symbol there, the Hooked X,

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:32.660 align:middle line:84%
which you have been chasing
all over the continent.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:34.980 align:middle line:90%
It has surfaced in Egypt.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.690 align:middle line:90%
It's surfaced in Jerusalem.

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:38.600 align:middle line:90%
It's surfaced in Portugal.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.420 align:middle line:84%
It surfaced, of course,
in Northern Europe.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And then we find
the Hooked X dated

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:48.390 align:middle line:84%
to the 12th, 13th century,
in the center of the United

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:49.280 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.870 align:middle line:90%
What does that imply?

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:54.860 align:middle line:84%
>> The Hooked X is being used
for the letter A or the A sound

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:56.210 align:middle line:90%
in this inscription.

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
about it, it

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:03.200 align:middle line:84%
looks a lot like a straight-line
stonemason's version

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.330 align:middle line:84%
of the Hebrew aleph,
which again is

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.470 align:middle line:84%
the first letter in
the Hebrew alphabet,

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:09.650 align:middle line:90%
and that's not a coincidence.

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:13.250 align:middle line:84%
But, in any case, it
is the sacred symbol

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:16.670 align:middle line:84%
that represents the ideology
of the people that carved this.

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:19.580 align:middle line:84%
The people I'm talking
about is the medieval order

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.440 align:middle line:90%
of the Knights Templar.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And as we all
know, in 1307, they

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:28.550 align:middle line:84%
were put down by the church
and the King of France,

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:31.340 align:middle line:90%
and supposedly disappeared.

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, they didn't
disappear, and we

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:35.520 align:middle line:90%
can get into that if you want.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.940 align:middle line:84%
But getting back to
the Hooked X symbol,

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:41.510 align:middle line:84%
it's very important because it
represents the true ideology

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:42.380 align:middle line:90%
of the Templars.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, most people
are probably going

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.730 align:middle line:84%
to be watching this and
saying, wait a minute, Scott,

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:49.188 align:middle line:84%
the Templars were the fighting
force for the Roman Catholic

00:11:49.188 --> 00:11:49.988 align:middle line:90%
Church.

00:11:49.988 --> 00:11:50.870 align:middle line:90%
They were Catholic.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:53.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what the
Templar leadership

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:55.130 align:middle line:90%
wanted them to believe.

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, they duped
the Catholic Church

00:11:57.770 --> 00:11:59.210 align:middle line:90%
for about 200 years.

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:02.690 align:middle line:84%
They pretended to be Catholic
because the symbols that

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:05.660 align:middle line:84%
were taken by the Roman
Catholic Church, actually

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:09.930 align:middle line:84%
predate them by hundreds
and thousands of years.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And the Templar ideology
represented by the Hooked X

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.010 align:middle line:90%
goes back to Egypt and beyond.

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And that ideology is something
called monotheistic dualism--

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:25.190 align:middle line:84%
belief in a single deity that
has dualistic aspects, that

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:29.120 align:middle line:84%
keep things in balance, like
male, female, heaven and Earth,

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.940 align:middle line:84%
good, bad, light,
dark, yin, yang.

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's the ideology
that they embraced.

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:39.200 align:middle line:84%
It certainly wasn't Catholicism,
but they did it secretly.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
ways they conveyed

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.460 align:middle line:84%
it was with this
Hooked X symbol.

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And if you understand
the symbolism

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:49.280 align:middle line:84%
and you look at some
of the Templar symbols,

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.560 align:middle line:84%
things really start to
make a lot more sense.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.860 align:middle line:84%
>> When everybody else was
fighting the treacherous seas

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:59.900 align:middle line:84%
to go and explore, the Knights
Templar were coming to North

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:05.360 align:middle line:84%
America because it was important
and certainly easy for them

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.530 align:middle line:90%
to do, right?

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I wouldn't
say that it was easy.

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have documentation
about several of those trips,

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.010 align:middle line:90%
and they had some troubles.

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:16.070 align:middle line:84%
They lost ships, they
lost a lot of their men.

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:18.063 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't say
that it was easy,

00:13:18.063 --> 00:13:19.730 align:middle line:84%
but they certainly
knew how to get here,

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:21.960 align:middle line:90%
and they would go back.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.920 align:middle line:84%
The other thing I think is
really important to understand

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:28.200 align:middle line:84%
too as we get into
more of the artifacts

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.500 align:middle line:84%
we're going to talk about,
and certainly, the Templars,

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:34.230 align:middle line:90%
is once they got over here.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.260 align:middle line:84%
People say to me,
how could they get

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.060 align:middle line:90%
to the center of the continent?

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:39.427 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what about the natives?

00:13:39.427 --> 00:13:40.760 align:middle line:90%
Wouldn't they have stopped them?

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course,
they would have,

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:45.620 align:middle line:84%
but what people don't understand
is this ideology that's

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:47.840 align:middle line:90%
represented by the Hooked X.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.150 align:middle line:84%
This Reverend sent
a single deity

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:52.820 align:middle line:84%
that respected the
feminine aspect

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:55.850 align:middle line:90%
of the Godhead, the goddess.

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:59.270 align:middle line:84%
The natives are matriarchal,
so when the Templars came over

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:01.520 align:middle line:84%
here, they bonded
with the natives.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.630 align:middle line:84%
They formed a brotherhood,
a deep spiritual bond

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:09.500 align:middle line:84%
through ritual and through
a common appreciation

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.990 align:middle line:84%
and reverence of
the sacred feminine,

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:16.310 align:middle line:84%
as well as the Holy Father, if
you will, or the great spirit.

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
allowed them to operate

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:21.140 align:middle line:84%
on this continent
for hundreds of years

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:23.970 align:middle line:84%
without anybody knowing
what was going on.

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a really
important thing.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:29.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, getting back to
the treasures that

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:33.060 align:middle line:84%
were brought over here, they
were put in multiple places,

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.280 align:middle line:90%
including Oak Island.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And the natives said,
look, you are our brothers.

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:42.690 align:middle line:84%
You want us to guard these
treasures for you, we'll do it.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:44.490 align:middle line:84%
You got to understand,
they didn't

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:47.880 align:middle line:84%
care about gold and silver
and relics and artifacts.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.320 align:middle line:90%
They didn't care.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.880 align:middle line:90%
But you are our brothers.

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:55.260 align:middle line:84%
We bonded in ritual, and
we will guard them for you.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And they did that
for over 400 years

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:01.470 align:middle line:84%
until the time of
the revolution.

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And that obligation that
the Templars passed on

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:07.770 align:middle line:90%
to our founding fathers.

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:09.540 align:middle line:90%
And the mission was this--

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:14.280 align:middle line:84%
they wanted to establish
a sanctuary, what they

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.040 align:middle line:90%
called a free Templar state.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.340 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they called
it the new Jerusalem.

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:23.130 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they called
it the third temple.

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:25.980 align:middle line:84%
A place where they
could live free

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:30.880 align:middle line:84%
to practice whatever religion
they wanted or no religion.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.330 align:middle line:84%
They also wanted to
escape the tyranny

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.440 align:middle line:90%
of the monarchs of Europe.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And I would remind people
that we fought a revolution

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:42.660 align:middle line:84%
against a monarchy, and
now we have a large faction

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:45.330 align:middle line:84%
of people in this country
that want to go back to that.

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:46.540 align:middle line:90%
Are you kidding me?

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there must have
been mutual respect--

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:49.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:52.470 align:middle line:84%
>> --between the cultures
that were already here

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:56.130 align:middle line:84%
and the Knights Templar
because you don't just make it

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:57.660 align:middle line:84%
to the center of
the United States.

00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:01.260 align:middle line:84%
You're allowed to travel to the
center of the United States.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>> They are going
to bring you there.

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.810 align:middle line:84%
They are going to
guide you there.

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And I can't stress
how important this is.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And Jim, I'll give you an
example of the research

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.360 align:middle line:84%
that I've done that helped me
to understand that premise.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:19.860 align:middle line:84%
Because as a scientist, once I
understood that the Kensington

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.350 align:middle line:84%
Runestone was
authentic, and realized

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:25.080 align:middle line:84%
that it was a land claim,
the next questions you have

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.960 align:middle line:90%
to ask that are automatically--

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.520 align:middle line:90%
have an answer.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.900 align:middle line:90%
Somebody carved it.

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:33.960 align:middle line:84%
They came from someplace
for some reason.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.240 align:middle line:84%
We've touched on a
couple of those things.

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.680 align:middle line:84%
To get across the
continent is no easy thing.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And if you had people like
the natives to guide you,

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:44.320 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get there,
and that's what happened.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.860 align:middle line:90%
So this was important to them.

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:51.720 align:middle line:84%
But after I asked those initial
questions about who from where,

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:55.650 align:middle line:84%
and why, I thought to myself,
if these guys came over here

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:57.630 align:middle line:84%
and they got to
Kensington, they had

00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:59.730 align:middle line:90%
to interact with the natives.

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:03.780 align:middle line:84%
So I reached out to the
natives and I found out

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:06.810 align:middle line:84%
that they have their
own secret society.

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:11.430 align:middle line:84%
It's the exact same thing
as modern Freemasonry.

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:14.640 align:middle line:84%
They have rituals that
are resurrection rituals

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.750 align:middle line:90%
just like we do.

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:18.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm a Freemason.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And I actually reached out
to some natives, some friends

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:24.280 align:middle line:90%
that I know in Canada--

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.920 align:middle line:90%
specific tribe was the Ojibwe--

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:32.260 align:middle line:84%
and I was allowed to
participate in a [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.530 align:middle line:90%
and that was amazing.

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:34.900 align:middle line:90%
It was life-changing.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And when I finally
earned the right

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:40.390 align:middle line:84%
to ask my questions of the
medicine man, I said to him,

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:43.330 align:middle line:84%
I would like to ask you some
questions about the Knights

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:44.530 align:middle line:90%
Templar.

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me
and he said, oh, you

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:50.280 align:middle line:90%
mean our blood brothers?

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, needless to say, it
went pretty good after that.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>> You have presented and
collected a number of artifacts

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:57.910 align:middle line:90%
over the years.

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:01.710 align:middle line:84%
I want to bring up the story
behind the Bat Creek stone

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:03.000 align:middle line:90%
and where it was found.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.020 align:middle line:84%
What did you find with not
only the age of the stone,

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:09.960 align:middle line:84%
but certainly, we've got to
talk about its authenticity

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.220 align:middle line:90%
and what it represents.

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:14.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's go back to 1889
when this artifact was found

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:16.470 align:middle line:90%
by the Smithsonian Institution.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.410 align:middle line:84%
A field agent working for them,
by the name of John Emmert,

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:22.860 align:middle line:84%
found this stone in
a sacred bundle that

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:26.520 align:middle line:84%
was underneath the skull
of one of nine bodies that

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.720 align:middle line:84%
was found inside the Bat Creek
complex mound number three.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:35.260 align:middle line:84%
He collected the stone, he
documented everything really,

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.350 align:middle line:84%
really well, especially
for that time period.

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And the initial interpretation
of this inscription

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.830 align:middle line:84%
on the stone that was
found inside of this bundle

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:46.800 align:middle line:90%
was that it was Paleo Cherokee.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.780 align:middle line:90%
In other words, Native American.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:50.400 align:middle line:84%
It's not a threat
to the narrative,

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.970 align:middle line:90%
so it wasn't a problem.

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:54.750 align:middle line:90%
And they published it in 1894.

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And then it was
put in the archives

00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:00.440 align:middle line:84%
and forgotten until 1964
when a Chicago patent

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.760 align:middle line:84%
attorney by the name
of Henrietta Mertz,

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.520 align:middle line:84%
in the Smithsonian, she
found the Bat Creek box,

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.850 align:middle line:84%
she looked at the stone,
she flipped it over,

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:11.400 align:middle line:84%
and she thought she
recognized what she thought

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.190 align:middle line:90%
were Phoenician characters.

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:17.040 align:middle line:84%
It was then looked at by one
of the top Semitic scholars

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:19.410 align:middle line:84%
in the world at that time--
a guy by the name of Cyrus

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:23.010 align:middle line:84%
Gordon, who, in 1971, published
a paper-- and he said,

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:26.190 align:middle line:84%
this inscription is
not Paleo Cherokee.

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:28.830 align:middle line:90%
It's Paleo Hebrew.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:30.720 align:middle line:90%
First century.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.190 align:middle line:90%
Paleo Hebrew.

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, the
Smithsonian Institution,

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:36.360 align:middle line:90%
they lost their mind.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And immediately, set out and
had a couple of archeologists

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:43.800 align:middle line:84%
go on a campaign to
dismiss it and attack

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.020 align:middle line:90%
the evidence of Cyrus Gordon.

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.900 align:middle line:90%
And of course, it's a fake.

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:51.690 align:middle line:84%
Can't have it be real
because that's a problem.

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:55.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, then a good friend of
ours, professor of actually,

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:59.280 align:middle line:84%
economics, Hugh McCulloch,
took it upon himself

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.230 align:middle line:90%
to look into this artifact.

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And he had some of the
other artifacts tested.

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:12.390 align:middle line:84%
There was a bone awl,
there was some red paint--

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:19.530 align:middle line:84%
red ocher stone for face paint,
and two copper bracelets.

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:23.760 align:middle line:84%
The C-14 date on the
bone awl came back

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:27.840 align:middle line:90%
between 70 and 700 AD.

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is back
in the early 80s,

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:32.730 align:middle line:84%
the C-14 technology has
improved dramatically.

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Be nice to retest the
rest of that artifact.

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:37.110 align:middle line:84%
But the other
interesting thing is

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.780 align:middle line:84%
that those two copper
bracelets were tested,

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.430 align:middle line:90%
and they weren't copper.

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:45.150 align:middle line:84%
They were brass that
actually tested out

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:49.690 align:middle line:84%
to have the same
composition of copper, zinc,

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:54.030 align:middle line:84%
and lead as first-century Jewish
bronze work in the Middle East

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:55.590 align:middle line:84%
or brass work in
the Middle East.

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:59.730 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, you've got
this additional data that calls

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:02.880 align:middle line:90%
the whole dig into question.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.110 align:middle line:84%
And they're still
trying to fight this.

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:08.190 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we did a couple of
episodes on this artifact,

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:11.110 align:middle line:84%
and I was the first one to
actually test the stone.

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:13.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you look at
on the upper left,

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:15.210 align:middle line:90%
you see those two scratches?

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:18.510 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the very first
pictures taken of the stone,

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:20.160 align:middle line:90%
those scratches aren't there.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:24.090 align:middle line:84%
Sometime in the 1960s,
somebody took a probe

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:26.790 align:middle line:84%
and made those
scratches, probably

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:29.430 align:middle line:84%
to test it and compare
it with the inscription.

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:32.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible that somebody
collected these artifacts

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:36.450 align:middle line:84%
in Jerusalem or somewhere
around the Mediterranean--

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:39.840 align:middle line:84%
that they are ancient and they
were from the first century--

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:43.980 align:middle line:84%
and brought them over here
and buried them in the dirt?

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:44.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that possible?

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:45.660 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:47.170 align:middle line:90%
Is it likely?

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:48.490 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:51.000 align:middle line:84%
I think the most plausible
scenario is clearly,

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.140 align:middle line:84%
somebody came over here and
maybe they brought the artifact

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:57.840 align:middle line:84%
or they had the knowledge,
and they carved the artifact,

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.540 align:middle line:84%
and it was buried with
them in this sacred bundle.

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:04.870 align:middle line:10%
Because it was found inside of
a sacred bundle, this person,

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:05.880 align:middle line:10%
whoever it was--

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.140 align:middle line:10%
And it may have been a gift.

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:08.970 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that was an
Indigenous person.

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And this Hebrew person who
carved this or gave them

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:15.000 align:middle line:84%
the knowledge, is buried
somewhere else, or maybe

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.290 align:middle line:90%
this is that person.

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:18.720 align:middle line:84%
But the point is this
is sacred because it's

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.610 align:middle line:90%
inside the sacred bundle.

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And all we know is
somebody came over here,

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:26.670 align:middle line:84%
and they either carved
it when they got here

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:29.160 align:middle line:84%
or they brought it with
them, but it was clearly

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.920 align:middle line:84%
somebody who understood
first-century Hebrew.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:35.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, maybe the knowledge was
passed on through the centuries

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:37.630 align:middle line:84%
and it was carved later,
that's not likely.

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:40.320 align:middle line:90%
But what it tells me is--

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.690 align:middle line:84%
the most parsimonious
explanation

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:44.320 align:middle line:84%
or the most reasonable
explanation--

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Which is?

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that somebody was here
sometime almost 2000 years ago,

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:52.570 align:middle line:84%
who understood the
Hebrew language.

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:54.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you know the meaning
of the Hebrew written

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:55.110 align:middle line:90%
on the stone?

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:56.140 align:middle line:90%
>> What does it say?

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:56.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.470 align:middle line:84%
>> The interpretation that
has been put out there--

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:02.032 align:middle line:84%
and I say this with a
little bit of an asterisk,

00:23:02.032 --> 00:23:03.490 align:middle line:84%
and I'll explain
that in a second--

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:07.530 align:middle line:84%
but basically, they say it says,
for the Judeans, for the Jews.

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:08.890 align:middle line:90%
But here's the issue--

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:11.310 align:middle line:84%
if you look on the
far left, you can

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:14.280 align:middle line:84%
see that there's some scratches
that are going off the edge.

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And I've looked at that
edge very carefully.

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.380 align:middle line:84%
It looks like that stone
was probably larger.

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And we may have only part
of the inscription there.

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:24.180 align:middle line:90%
There may be more to it.

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, going back to the
Knights Templar and the reason

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:32.850 align:middle line:84%
why they were here, what
would they bring here that was

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:36.120 align:middle line:84%
so special from the
religious side of things?

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.610 align:middle line:90%
And why North America?

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:42.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let's start
with the Bat Creek stone.

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:45.900 align:middle line:84%
How did the Templars find
out about North America?

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.990 align:middle line:84%
Because the Templar
leadership are

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:51.630 align:middle line:84%
ideological and
bloodline descendants

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:54.990 align:middle line:84%
of some of these early
Hebrews, specifically

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:56.910 align:middle line:90%
the Essenes, Jesus' sect.

00:23:56.910 --> 00:24:00.670 align:middle line:84%
Jesus, Mary Magdalene, John the
Baptist, all the rest of them.

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:02.792 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
that's the story.

00:24:02.792 --> 00:24:05.250 align:middle line:84%
So they knew about it because
they've been coming over here

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:06.730 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:08.100 align:middle line:90%
This wasn't a secret.

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:10.980 align:middle line:84%
This was-- well, it was secret,
but they knew all about it.

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:13.750 align:middle line:90%
And again, this was a sanctuary.

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:15.900 align:middle line:84%
This is where cultures
could come over here.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:17.110 align:middle line:90%
>> A safe place?

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:19.890 align:middle line:84%
>> A safe place
where they could--

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:22.308 align:middle line:84%
if they treated the
natives with respect--

00:24:22.308 --> 00:24:24.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's amazing what
happens when you treat people

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:25.470 align:middle line:90%
with respect.

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:27.300 align:middle line:90%
They give it back to you.

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And so they knew about
this place, this sanctuary.

00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:33.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's continue with-- let's
go to the Spirit Pond stone.

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:35.880 align:middle line:90%
And this is incredible.

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.710 align:middle line:90%
There's two sides to the stone.

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:39.730 align:middle line:84%
What side are we
looking at here?

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:42.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this is
where the inscription,

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:46.710 align:middle line:84%
which we believe is a
map or a report, starts,

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:49.740 align:middle line:84%
and then it finishes on the back
side with I think five or six

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:50.770 align:middle line:90%
more lines.

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:52.440 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting
here is they

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.660 align:middle line:90%
are using Scandinavian runes.

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:58.417 align:middle line:84%
There are, I think, a couple
dozen Hooked X's here.

00:24:58.417 --> 00:24:59.250 align:middle line:90%
>> You can see them.

00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:01.320 align:middle line:84%
They're all over--
where was this found?

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:03.540 align:middle line:84%
>> This was found at
Spirit Pond Maine,

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:10.290 align:middle line:84%
which is at the mouth of the
Kennebec River in Northeastern

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:15.060 align:middle line:84%
Maine, in 1971, by a guy who was
actually looking for artifacts

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:17.130 align:middle line:90%
around Spirit Pond.

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And he sat down on a rock
to smoke a cigarette,

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:21.480 align:middle line:84%
and he looked down
on the ground and he

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.970 align:middle line:84%
saw the corner of this
stone actually sticking out.

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And he saw what he thought
were characters written on it,

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:31.930 align:middle line:84%
and he pulled it out, and he
found the three Spirit Pond

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:32.730 align:middle line:90%
stones.

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:36.540 align:middle line:84%
What the inscription actually
says is not agreed upon.

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And part of the
problem is there's

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.280 align:middle line:90%
a lot of things going on here.

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:45.180 align:middle line:84%
There's Pentateuch numbers just
like the Kensington Runestone,

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:48.720 align:middle line:84%
there's double vowels, there's
all kinds of modifications

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:52.050 align:middle line:84%
of runes that we see that are
a little bit differently done

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:53.520 align:middle line:90%
on the Kensington stone.

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.800 align:middle line:84%
We have some ideas
of what this says,

00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:00.090 align:middle line:84%
but basically, we
think it's a report.

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And when we get into
some of the other stones,

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:07.080 align:middle line:84%
you'll kind of see that
there's a different context.

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.910 align:middle line:90%
>> A report of what?

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:12.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Operations that were going
on over here by the Templars.

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.220 align:middle line:90%
This stone is dated twice--

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:17.070 align:middle line:90%
1401 and 1402.

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And remember, the Kensington
Runestone is dated 1362,

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:25.360 align:middle line:84%
so this is less than 40
years apart from that.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And as you said
yourself, they were

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:28.800 align:middle line:90%
coming over here all the time.

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.060 align:middle line:90%
This was just another time.

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's see the back
side of it real quick.

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:35.010 align:middle line:90%
And here it is here.

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:42.030 align:middle line:84%
How easy is it to understand
Scandinavian ruins enough

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:44.370 align:middle line:90%
to hoax something or fake it?

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:46.390 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty difficult
back then, I would think.

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:48.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Jim you asked that--
that is a really good question.

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
the bottom line,

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:53.310 align:middle line:84%
you see that Hooked X
in that dark area there,

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:55.800 align:middle line:84%
kind of about a third of
the way from the left?

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.860 align:middle line:84%
If you look above it, you
see a little line above it.

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:00.360 align:middle line:90%
That's a modification.

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:03.690 align:middle line:84%
That is actually
analogous to umlauts,

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:05.850 align:middle line:84%
which on the runestone,
are double dots.

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And basically, it's a different
way of saying the A sound

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:11.880 align:middle line:90%
and it's a modification.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.500 align:middle line:90%
And there's other modifications.

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.510 align:middle line:84%
If you look very carefully
at this inscription,

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:18.690 align:middle line:84%
you'll see there's a number of
other runes, different runes,

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:22.020 align:middle line:84%
that have bars over them,
and they are modifications.

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:25.950 align:middle line:84%
The point of this is that this
is a very complex inscription.

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:30.690 align:middle line:84%
People are saying that the guy
that found this carved this,

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:34.440 align:middle line:84%
and he's using
very sophisticated

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:35.725 align:middle line:90%
late medieval runes.

00:27:35.725 --> 00:27:36.525 align:middle line:90%
Are you kidding me?

00:27:36.525 --> 00:27:36.690 align:middle line:90%
Where did he learn that?

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:37.121 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:37.121 --> 00:27:39.070 align:middle line:84%
Dialects that you
wouldn't have any idea.

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:39.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Forget about it.

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:40.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:42.270 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's go to the map.

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:46.140 align:middle line:84%
This is also found
in the Spirit Pond.

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:49.320 align:middle line:84%
This is about as
intriguing as it gets,

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:53.190 align:middle line:84%
and it wouldn't be complete
without a Hooked X.

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:54.610 align:middle line:90%
>> There's a number of them.

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:56.400 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a number
of them there.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.540 align:middle line:90%
What are we looking at?

00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.580 align:middle line:90%
Now, is this a map to treasure?

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:00.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:01.973 align:middle line:84%
I mean you got to
remember something--

00:28:01.973 --> 00:28:07.040 align:middle line:84%
to the Templars, North America,
the sanctuary was the treasure.

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:09.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when we think of
treasure, what is treasure?

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:11.420 align:middle line:84%
It's different things
to different people.

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:13.610 align:middle line:84%
Most people think of
gold and silver coins,

00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:16.490 align:middle line:84%
but when you're persecuted
and you're looking for a place

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:19.910 align:middle line:84%
where you can live free
to be who you want,

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:21.910 align:middle line:90%
that's the real treasure.

00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:24.590 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, so what is this a map of?

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, this is a map
of the mouth of the Kennebec

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:28.070 align:middle line:90%
River.

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:29.870 align:middle line:84%
On the upper left,
you see the island.

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:32.090 align:middle line:84%
If you looked on a
map, that's the mouth

00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:34.250 align:middle line:84%
of it emptying into
the Atlantic Ocean.

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:38.510 align:middle line:84%
Below that little knob there,
that little Bay going in

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:39.950 align:middle line:90%
is actually Spirit Pond.

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
about that is that today,

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:46.310 align:middle line:84%
Spirit Pond and the stream
that flows out of it

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:47.360 align:middle line:90%
is just a trickle.

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:51.800 align:middle line:84%
But if you go back
600 years to 1,400,

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:54.350 align:middle line:84%
isotatic rebound,
which is-- remember

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:56.810 align:middle line:84%
that whole area was
covered by a heavy glacier

00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:58.100 align:middle line:90%
over a mile thick.

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:01.640 align:middle line:84%
That ice has melted
away, and now the Earth

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.200 align:middle line:90%
is rebounding back.

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And so that actually
matches what

00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:09.020 align:middle line:84%
Spirit Pond would have
looked like back then when

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:10.113 align:middle line:90%
the ground was lower.

00:29:10.113 --> 00:29:11.780 align:middle line:84%
But let me just tell
you one other thing

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:13.280 align:middle line:84%
that's very important
about this map

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:17.780 align:middle line:84%
that nobody talks about,
is that this map actually

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:21.440 align:middle line:84%
has north to the left,
east is at the top,

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.480 align:middle line:84%
south is to the
right, and that's

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:26.060 align:middle line:84%
consistent with
many medieval maps.

00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:28.100 align:middle line:90%
So actually, what it says--

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:30.450 align:middle line:84%
in the middle there to
the left of that arrow,

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:33.830 align:middle line:90%
it says takes two days.

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:37.010 align:middle line:84%
On the lower-left
there, it says Vinland.

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And then that 10 and
the two lines says 1402.

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And if you go to the
right, that arrow

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:47.660 align:middle line:84%
to the right, that word on
the lower right below it

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:49.700 align:middle line:90%
essentially says map.

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And if you rotate it 90 degrees
and put North at the top,

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:54.590 align:middle line:90%
it's pointing South.

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:57.140 align:middle line:84%
If you go two days
sail, guess where

00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:01.220 align:middle line:84%
you end up-- in Narragansett
Bay and the Newport Tower.

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:02.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:05.270 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's look at the back
side of this really quick.

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:09.630 align:middle line:84%
This is the reverse
of the Map Stone.

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:12.340 align:middle line:84%
Scott, there's a lot of
things going on here.

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:13.980 align:middle line:90%
And I'm just going to say this--

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:17.190 align:middle line:90%
I see a brontosaurus.

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:18.480 align:middle line:90%
Is that a dinosaur?

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:21.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm sure you do, Jim, but
that's not a brontosaurus.

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:22.380 align:middle line:90%
>> What is that?

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Actually, it's an eel.

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:24.690 align:middle line:90%
The one on the far right?

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:25.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:27.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's an eel.

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:30.930 align:middle line:84%
At the top, we have ruins,
and it says middle taki, which

00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:33.930 align:middle line:90%
is the writ word for Milwaukee.

00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And if you look on either side--
where you see the hooked X,

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:41.010 align:middle line:84%
you look on either side of
that word, you see plants,

00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:43.950 align:middle line:84%
you got a fish, a duck,
a deer, an eel, remember,

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:44.920 align:middle line:90%
we're on the ocean.

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:48.700 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's a saltwater
eel, but I'm not sure.

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.940 align:middle line:84%
You see a native
face, you see a canoe

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:55.410 align:middle line:84%
with presumably a native inside
of it, a bow, an arrow, a skin.

00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And then you see
directly below that

00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:01.020 align:middle line:84%
on the left, what
we call an arched X.

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And without going too
far down a rabbit hole,

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:07.380 align:middle line:84%
I found that same symbol
only one place in the world.

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:13.080 align:middle line:84%
It was on a medieval astrolabe
that dates back to about 1350,

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:17.280 align:middle line:84%
which would be approximately 50
years before this was carved.

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And then that ladder-looking
thing is actually a numbering

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:26.880 align:middle line:84%
system, and it says 44, which
is the latitude that goes right

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.410 align:middle line:90%
to-- guess where--

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:29.520 align:middle line:90%
Spirit Pond.

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:30.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:33.610 align:middle line:90%
Let's shift gears a little bit.

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:36.600 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about the Vatican.

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And they have vaults,
they have a collection

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:46.050 align:middle line:84%
of secrets and documents that
may potentially never be read.

00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:48.600 align:middle line:84%
There were too much
material there.

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.100 align:middle line:90%
What is it that they know?

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:54.840 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that the Vatican
was fully aware of the Knights

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:59.460 align:middle line:84%
Templar bringing artifacts
and things of import

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:00.990 align:middle line:90%
to North America?

00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:04.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one of the things that
I was told during that sweat

00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:08.850 align:middle line:84%
was the Templars were coming
over here, starting around--

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:10.890 align:middle line:84%
well, they started in
the late 12th century,

00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:12.690 align:middle line:84%
but they started
bringing things over

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:16.350 align:middle line:84%
in earnest in the
late 14th century.

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:18.540 align:middle line:84%
The church was
coming over here too,

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:22.450 align:middle line:84%
and they were hunting them
down on this continent.

00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:24.030 align:middle line:84%
This is what the
natives told us.

00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:27.150 align:middle line:90%
And they dealt with them.

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:29.500 align:middle line:84%
So did the church know
what was going on?

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:30.300 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.980 align:middle line:84%
Were they trying to track
these guys down and recover

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:33.780 align:middle line:90%
this stuff?

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:34.980 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:38.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, one thing that
a lot of people

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:41.250 align:middle line:84%
are not aware of, that
a good friend of mine

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:44.580 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Tim
Hogan, enlightened me of,

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:49.410 align:middle line:84%
is that Napoleon, during his
reign, raided the Vatican

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:53.520 align:middle line:84%
and took out all the
documents and copied them,

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:55.290 align:middle line:90%
and then gave them back.

00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:59.850 align:middle line:84%
So the narrative that
they're hiding things

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:05.510 align:middle line:84%
that we don't know
about, it's not true.

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:12.460 align:middle line:84%
>> The Knights Templar, again,
one would think and assume that

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:15.430 align:middle line:84%
they are also a
keeper of the secrets.

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:17.260 align:middle line:90%
How do we get to those secrets?

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:20.920 align:middle line:84%
The Knights Templar are still
here with us, so is the Vatican

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.600 align:middle line:90%
and so are Freemasons.

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:25.960 align:middle line:84%
Are they sitting on
information that would

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.000 align:middle line:90%
help clear all of this up?

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And if they are, why aren't
they talking about it?

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, the answer is yes.

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And we are talking
about it right now.

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:40.600 align:middle line:84%
What I just told you is
something you've never heard.

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:45.740 align:middle line:84%
The world is going through
a huge change right now.

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And without going into
a big long dissertation,

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:51.850 align:middle line:84%
there's something called
procession of the equinoxes.

00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And we are now at the
end of a very long cycle,

00:33:55.870 --> 00:34:00.590 align:middle line:84%
a 26,000-year-long cycle,
and entering a new age,

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:02.050 align:middle line:90%
a new cycle.

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's a time, according
to certain prophecies,

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:10.900 align:middle line:84%
of great troubles, great
upheaval, difficult times,

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:15.770 align:middle line:84%
difficult to the point that if
humanity doesn't figure it out,

00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:18.179 align:middle line:84%
we're probably not
going to make it.

00:34:18.179 --> 00:34:20.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's a tough message
for people to hear,

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:21.880 align:middle line:90%
but it's the truth.

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think if we all just take
a step back and think about it,

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:29.830 align:middle line:84%
we all know that things
are tough right now.

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:32.820 align:middle line:84%
So it's time for these
truths to come out.

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:36.690 align:middle line:84%
It's time for us to identify
where the issues are,

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:41.250 align:middle line:84%
who it is that's getting in
the way, and who we need to--

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:44.429 align:middle line:84%
if they won't work with us,
then they have to be defeated.

00:34:44.429 --> 00:34:48.730 align:middle line:84%
Because if we want to go
forward into the future--

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:50.730 align:middle line:84%
and I think there
is a bright future.

00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:52.679 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
more going on here,

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:56.340 align:middle line:84%
and it involves things
like other races,

00:34:56.340 --> 00:35:00.450 align:middle line:84%
not just on this planet,
but on other planets,

00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:06.160 align:middle line:84%
that care deeply for this
planet as most of us do.

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And if we want to make
it, we got to be real.

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:13.110 align:middle line:84%
We got to start talking
about this stuff,

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:15.540 align:middle line:90%
and you're doing that.

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And I appreciate that and
giving us an opportunity

00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:19.680 align:middle line:90%
to talk about this stuff.

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's not easy and
it's not always good news,

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:27.000 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes you got to
fight through the tough times

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.340 align:middle line:90%
to get to the goal line, right?

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:36.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I feel that the change
that is in front of us has gone

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:42.540 align:middle line:84%
from something invisible
or maybe even imaginary,

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:46.110 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of us, to something
that is very tangible,

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:47.190 align:middle line:90%
we can feel it.

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And whether it is a contact with
ET, or knowledge of our past

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:57.270 align:middle line:84%
that has been seriously held
back from us and repressed,

00:35:57.270 --> 00:36:02.040 align:middle line:84%
the conversations that Josh
and I and the team here have,

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:04.050 align:middle line:84%
we are all wondering
the same things.

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:08.400 align:middle line:84%
But we are moving
forward into something

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:14.160 align:middle line:84%
that if this knowledge is
exposed, how can we handle it?

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And are we going
to be able to take

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.110 align:middle line:90%
it and move forward and mature?

00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:22.800 align:middle line:84%
I think the change, ultimately,
is going to be a positive one.

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:23.600 align:middle line:90%
Don't you, Josh?

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:24.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely, yes.

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:25.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:25.710 align:middle line:90%
I feel it.

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:26.877 align:middle line:90%
What have you learned today?

00:36:26.877 --> 00:36:30.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, the idea that the
Native Americans were gentle

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.937 align:middle line:84%
and opening and welcoming to
people coming over as long

00:36:32.937 --> 00:36:35.520 align:middle line:84%
as they engage in those rituals,
just warms my heart and makes

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.812 align:middle line:84%
me realize that our history
is not what we think it as.

00:36:37.812 --> 00:36:38.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, in closing--

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:40.660 align:middle line:84%

you, Scott, for this.
