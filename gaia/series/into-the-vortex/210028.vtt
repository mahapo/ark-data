00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.780 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm radio and television
host, Jimmy Church,

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.540 align:middle line:84%
and I'm here to uncover
the truth about some

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.580 align:middle line:90%
of life's biggest mysteries.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.420 align:middle line:84%
If this is revealed,
everything has to be rewritten.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.020 align:middle line:84%
My guest today is Billy
Carson, CEO, entrepreneur,

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.510 align:middle line:84%
and best selling
author who is an expert

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.260 align:middle line:84%
on ancient civilizations and
the mysteries of Egypt's past.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>> So these structures were
built in a specific way

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.140 align:middle line:84%
to actually harness the
natural Earth energies.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.800 align:middle line:84%
So the architecture is
like living architecture.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.420 align:middle line:90%
>>Technical assistant Josh.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.755 align:middle line:90%
Josh can you pull up the map?

00:00:44.755 --> 00:00:45.555 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:00:45.555 --> 00:00:48.190 align:middle line:10%
>>Also joins us to
help set the scenes.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.300 align:middle line:84%
Join us as we deep dive to
get to the bottom of some

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.090 align:middle line:84%
of the most intriguing
questions of our time.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.030 align:middle line:84%
>>Something energetic
was happening back then.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.110 align:middle line:84%
What exactly it
is, we don't know.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.870 align:middle line:90%
But somebody had technology.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:14.710 align:middle line:90%


00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.230 align:middle line:84%
>>Welcome to Into the Vortex,
I'm your host, Jimmy Church,

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.030 align:middle line:84%
and today our guest
is Billy Carson.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
be discussing, Egypt.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.620 align:middle line:84%
Billy is a best bestselling
author of Compendium

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.880 align:middle line:90%
of the Emerald Tablets.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.540 align:middle line:84%
I wrote the foreword
to that book.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.340 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>>Billy, welcome
to Into the Vortex.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.230 align:middle line:90%
>>Nice to be here.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.540 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>>It's great to have you,
but before we get started,

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.720 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be a great
conversation today.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.640 align:middle line:84%
But I have to ask
you, Josh, what

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.810 align:middle line:90%
has attracted you to Egypt?

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.480 align:middle line:90%
What is appealing?

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.640 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm definitely drawn
to Giza and The Sphinx.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.490 align:middle line:84%
I know it's a little cliche, but
I need to see it in this life,

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.490 align:middle line:90%
it's on my bucket list.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.220 align:middle line:90%
>>What about spirituality?

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.020 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, I hear people have
some interesting experiences,

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.420 align:middle line:84%
especially inside some of
the megalithic structures,

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.550 align:middle line:90%
particularly the Giza.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm interested to know
what that experience is like.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.660 align:middle line:84%
>>This conversation is
exactly what you need.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And for me Billy, the spiritual,
the physical side of visiting

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.400 align:middle line:84%
these sites, and you, of course,
leading me through all of this,

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.340 align:middle line:84%
it was profound, it
was life changing,

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.850 align:middle line:84%
it was certainly
a paradigm shift.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.900 align:middle line:84%
For me, I think, it was one of
the most important experiences

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.800 align:middle line:84%
of my life outside of the
birth of my daughter, Nicole,

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.500 align:middle line:84%
but it was that
extraordinary to me.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.770 align:middle line:84%
What is the appeal to Egypt
over the last 5,000 years?

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.130 align:middle line:90%
Where tourism isn't a new thing.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.690 align:middle line:84%
The Greeks were
tourists at 1,000 BC.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.580 align:middle line:90%
What's the appeal?

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>>Egypt is built over a very
strong energy vortex on Earth.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.160 align:middle line:84%
Here we are in the
Vortex, right, the show.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And so we know this by looking
at Earth's magnetic field map

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.950 align:middle line:84%
from usgs.gov, and
overlaying it over Cairo.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that there's
this huge magnetic field there,

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.130 align:middle line:84%
and coincidentally, a lot
of megalithic structures

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.130 align:middle line:90%
are there as well.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.610 align:middle line:84%
So these structures were
built in a specific way

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.000 align:middle line:84%
to actually harness the
natural Earth energies,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.800 align:middle line:84%
and also ancient
knowledge and wisdom

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.230 align:middle line:84%
was built into the
construction technique.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.110 align:middle line:84%
So the architecture is
like living architecture.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And because of this,
you have all the people

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.130 align:middle line:84%
saying they have
all different types

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.680 align:middle line:84%
of incredible,
spiritual experiences

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.590 align:middle line:84%
and that's why Egypt
draws so many people.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.470 align:middle line:84%
It also, somehow, taps into the
psyche and the consciousness

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.510 align:middle line:84%
of a person, where it's
almost as if they feel

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.043 align:middle line:90%
like they've been there before.

00:03:39.043 --> 00:03:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And they have to go back
and revisit the place

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.460 align:middle line:90%
so it's pretty interesting.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.680 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a tangible experience.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.060 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.670 align:middle line:84%
>>I personally now have
visited these temple sites,

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.540 align:middle line:84%
and these pyramids, and
had one profound experience

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.440 align:middle line:90%
after another.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Most of them caught
me by surprise.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:07.000 align:middle line:84%
Is there one temple complex for
you where these things occur?

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>>For me, it's really, Dendera,
The Dendera Temple complex.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.870 align:middle line:10%
It's an amazing site,
you've got to drive way out

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.730 align:middle line:10%
into the desert, about three
hours out into the desert

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:16.579 align:middle line:10%
to get there.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And when you see this
massive, megalithic structure

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.579 align:middle line:84%
just coming up out of
the middle of nowhere,

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.180 align:middle line:90%
it takes your breath away.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And as you walk about
the quarter of a mile

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.580 align:middle line:84%
to get to the front
door, and go inside,

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.430 align:middle line:84%
and you see these super
megalithic columns.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.043 align:middle line:84%
And then a temple
priest takes you

00:04:32.043 --> 00:04:33.460 align:middle line:84%
into this underground
crypt, where

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.190 align:middle line:84%
you can see evidence of what
looks like to be technology,

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.320 align:middle line:84%
and an ancient
storehouse of wisdom

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.300 align:middle line:84%
in this underground shaft, it
just really blows you away.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that's one of
the places where people seem

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.760 align:middle line:90%
to have a lot of experiences.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.430 align:middle line:84%
Several people had the
most incredible experience

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.830 align:middle line:84%
at Dendera, some
saw lights, some

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.570 align:middle line:84%
had a spiritual experience,
some heard things.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:54.370 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.870 align:middle line:90%
>>I saw a lot of tears.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:56.830 align:middle line:90%
>>A lot of tears there.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:57.890 align:middle line:90%
A lot of emotion.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.610 align:middle line:84%
>>A lot of tears,
including myself.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.170 align:middle line:84%
Dendera was an extreme
emotional experience for me.

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's not only the vibrations
of the divine feminine, which

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.990 align:middle line:84%
is just everywhere,
it's a feminine temple.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.470 align:middle line:84%
But it's the
cinematic experience

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.410 align:middle line:84%
of the artwork and the
carving, and the colors.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.300 align:middle line:90%
There's that part of it too.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And then as you're
walking through,

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:30.250 align:middle line:84%
you can feel these energy
sectors coming in that reach in

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.560 align:middle line:90%
and tap into you.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.530 align:middle line:84%
This is unexpected in that,
if you go in there not knowing

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.780 align:middle line:84%
what's going to happen,
and I didn't have a coach

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.640 align:middle line:84%
with me, you are going to
be affected, aren't you?

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.440 align:middle line:90%
>>You are.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.430 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be affected.

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:46.972 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
realize that it's

00:05:46.972 --> 00:05:48.800 align:middle line:84%
going to happen because
it surprises you.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Then all of a sudden,
emotion grabs you.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think, it has a lot to
do with the divine feminine.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.810 align:middle line:84%
There's such a
feminine energy there

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.090 align:middle line:84%
that really gives you a
certain level of balance.

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.570 align:middle line:84%
So a balance that along of
people have been missing

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.060 align:middle line:84%
didn't even it was
missing because we live

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.838 align:middle line:84%
in a predominantly male
energy type of atmosphere

00:06:08.838 --> 00:06:10.630 align:middle line:84%
right now, in this
current state of affairs

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.150 align:middle line:84%
on Earth as a civilization,
and our balance

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.403 align:middle line:84%
between masculine and feminine
is actually off, even in women.

00:06:16.403 --> 00:06:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way the
programming has been working.

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.755 align:middle line:84%
And so you go there and all of
a sudden, the harmony hits you.

00:06:22.755 --> 00:06:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
the emotions kick.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.882 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm going to stay on Dendera,
and I've got a video clip that

00:06:27.882 --> 00:06:29.590 align:middle line:84%
we're going to run
here in just a second.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.960 align:middle line:84%
But so much talk about the Great
Pyramid, and it's deserved.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.380 align:middle line:84%
How many people it took to
build it, and how many years.

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And we're dealing with the
orthodox dogma of what we've

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.000 align:middle line:84%
been told about the Great
Pyramid over the years,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.630 align:middle line:90%
and we understand that.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:52.380 align:middle line:84%
But when you go to a site like
Dendera, or Abydos, or Karnak,

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:56.970 align:middle line:84%
or these temple sites
have the same amount

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:00.750 align:middle line:84%
of size, the same
amount of engineering,

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.030 align:middle line:84%
and are just as
complex, and probably

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:06.510 align:middle line:84%
took the same amount
of time as it took

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.310 align:middle line:90%
to build the Great Pyramid.

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.180 align:middle line:84%
These sites are
everywhere, all over Egypt.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:10.980 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.030 align:middle line:90%
They're all over Egypt.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:16.230 align:middle line:84%
The architectural floor
plan or the architectural,

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.360 align:middle line:84%
I guess, the master
architect, I should say,

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.348 align:middle line:84%
really did a great
job laying out

00:07:20.348 --> 00:07:22.890 align:middle line:84%
how to build these things, the
technology, and the techniques

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:27.600 align:middle line:84%
to build them, you can see
what looks like, in some cases,

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.950 align:middle line:90%
tool markings.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:31.560 align:middle line:84%
You can see evidence of
advanced tooling and advanced

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.610 align:middle line:90%
technologies.

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:35.220 align:middle line:84%
These were not built with
chicken bones and copper tools.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.630 align:middle line:90%
>>No, they certainly weren't.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:39.330 align:middle line:90%
And you see it everywhere.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:43.830 align:middle line:84%
So we were allowed the
opportunity, it was my,

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.000 align:middle line:90%
birthday by the way, Josh.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.190 align:middle line:84%
Billy, and through his
contacts there in Egypt,

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:53.460 align:middle line:84%
got us some access
to these sites

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:58.500 align:middle line:84%
that at Dendera that hadn't
been opened and accessed

00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.850 align:middle line:90%
for many, many years.

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:03.360 align:middle line:10%
And Billy we go to,
so much has been

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.310 align:middle line:10%
made of the Dendera light bulb.

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:09.030 align:middle line:10%
Under the crypt, in the
main temple of Dendera.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.730 align:middle line:10%
So we go through a
ceremony, and Billy

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:19.247 align:middle line:10%
is given the keys to access
this temple outside of Dendera,

00:08:19.247 --> 00:08:20.047 align:middle line:10%
on the grounds.

00:08:20.047 --> 00:08:21.710 align:middle line:90%
>>I need a vacation with you.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:22.800 align:middle line:90%
>>It was amazing.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And we weren't allowed
to talk, and we

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.240 align:middle line:90%
weren't allowed to photograph.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:32.039 align:middle line:84%
Billy and I enter this
very sacred space,

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:34.380 align:middle line:84%
and Billy and I
are standing there.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:38.669 align:middle line:84%
And we look up, and we saw
another Dendera light bulb

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:39.720 align:middle line:90%
on the wall.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:44.895 align:middle line:84%
And now, we weren't allowed
to react, we couldn't talk,

00:08:44.895 --> 00:08:46.950 align:middle line:90%
we couldn't do anything.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:49.800 align:middle line:84%
So what went through
your mind as we looked up

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.350 align:middle line:84%
and there was another
Dendera light bulb?

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:54.360 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, first I mean,
just to back up,

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.720 align:middle line:84%
the fact that I was given
the key by the temple priest

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.820 align:middle line:84%
to unlock and open
a place that only

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:03.060 align:middle line:84%
literally administration
had access to,

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:04.020 align:middle line:90%
that was mind blowing.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to do
this on our tour

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.790 align:middle line:84%
in front of all of our
group, which was amazing

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:09.900 align:middle line:90%
and a blessing.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And I unlock it, and
we go in, and then

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:14.910 align:middle line:84%
see when you've
been told and we've

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:17.553 align:middle line:84%
been taught that the only
light bulbs that existed

00:09:17.553 --> 00:09:19.470 align:middle line:84%
were the ones in that
underground crypt, which

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:21.720 align:middle line:84%
we had just come out
of not so long ago.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.420 align:middle line:84%
And now here's
more evidence that

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.320 align:middle line:84%
isn't any-- no mainstream
document, number mainstream

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.120 align:middle line:90%
documentaries.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.110 align:middle line:84%
I have never found it
on Google, it's there.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, oh, my God,
this is like backing up.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:38.160 align:middle line:84%
They knew this technology, this
wasn't a fluke, this existed.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:43.980 align:middle line:84%
>>Billy and I, Josh, we were
told by the temple priest,

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:45.330 align:middle line:90%
no talking.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.610 align:middle line:84%
We go in and we see
this light bulb,

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:50.340 align:middle line:84%
and we want to scream
and jump up and down.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And we're pointing at
it, and looking at it,

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:57.000 align:middle line:84%
but to see it in
pristine condition.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And so after this experience,
and it was profound,

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:03.310 align:middle line:90%
we come out of the temple.

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And then, I am told that
we are going to enter

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:12.870 align:middle line:90%
an underground pharaonic lake.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:15.210 align:middle line:84%
Now we're in the
middle of the desert,

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:17.490 align:middle line:84%
why don't you go ahead
and roll this clip,

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:21.600 align:middle line:84%
and we're told that
it's out and it's

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.420 align:middle line:84%
a stairway that's going to go
down about five stories, about

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.580 align:middle line:90%
50 feet underneath the desert.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And I can't see
where this is at.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.430 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead and roll the clip.

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:36.930 align:middle line:84%
As we walk across, Billy, it's
Billy and I and the priesthood,

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:40.530 align:middle line:84%
and then we're told
that, you can see there,

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:44.430 align:middle line:84%
there's the three stones, and
that's the stairway going down.

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm told, I can't
photograph, and I can't speak.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:54.690 align:middle line:84%
So as we-- this is a
stairway going down

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:57.600 align:middle line:84%
into the underneath the
desert, five storeys,

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.350 align:middle line:84%
and there's the temple priest,
and he turns to me and says,

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:02.970 align:middle line:90%
oop, turn off the camera.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:04.170 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:07.020 align:middle line:90%
>>And so here, we enter.

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:11.415 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the most
profound, spiritual experiences

00:11:11.415 --> 00:11:12.760 align:middle line:90%
of my entire life.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
what to expect.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:18.270 align:middle line:84%
This is a sacred site, Billy,
where the pharaohs would

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:23.790 align:middle line:84%
go to cleanse and spiritually,
cleanse themselves

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:30.540 align:middle line:84%
with this crystal,
purified, cool water, deep

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.090 align:middle line:90%
underneath the Sahara desert.

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:34.000 align:middle line:90%
You've done it.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:34.800 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.920 align:middle line:84%
>>Did you have the same
spiritual experience

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:38.950 align:middle line:90%
as I went through?

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>>Absolutely.

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:41.410 align:middle line:84%
When you go down
there, first of all,

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:42.750 align:middle line:90%
you don't know what to expect.

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:43.853 align:middle line:90%
>>You can't see.

00:11:43.853 --> 00:11:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>You can't see,
it's pitch black.

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And then you come to
this ice cold water

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.433 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the desert,
that far underground you're

00:11:49.433 --> 00:11:50.460 align:middle line:90%
like, wow.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.395 align:middle line:84%
And it's crystal clear and
you're dousing it on yourself

00:11:53.395 --> 00:11:55.770 align:middle line:84%
and you're kind of really
giving yourself a self baptism.

00:11:55.770 --> 00:12:00.000 align:middle line:84%
You get really emotional because
it's hard to not get emotional

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.980 align:middle line:90%
when you think about it.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:03.630 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, not--

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:06.540 align:middle line:84%
you think there's 8 billion
people on Earth right now,

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:09.233 align:middle line:84%
and less than 1/10
of 1% of those people

00:12:09.233 --> 00:12:10.650 align:middle line:84%
will even ever get
a chance to go.

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And less than 1% of
those people would ever

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:15.690 align:middle line:84%
get to even see what I just saw,
and touch what I just touched,

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:17.470 align:middle line:84%
and be a part of
what I just did.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.620 align:middle line:84%
So it was really emotional,
really spiritual,

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:21.870 align:middle line:84%
and what a blessing to be
able to give our whole group

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:24.750 align:middle line:84%
the opportunity to go down
there and do that because that

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:25.960 align:middle line:90%
was unexpected.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.300 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know they were
going to give us access

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.180 align:middle line:90%
to that this time.

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:31.650 align:middle line:90%
>>So Josh, I go down.

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.240 align:middle line:90%
And we get to the bottom.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.110 align:middle line:90%
I can't see.

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:38.790 align:middle line:84%
I can hear water, which
was a strange experience,

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:42.420 align:middle line:84%
you can't see in front of
you, your senses are cut off,

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:46.210 align:middle line:84%
you go from the extreme
heat of the desert.

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Now you're down in this
cool, underground lake.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:55.925 align:middle line:84%
And I walked out into the
water, and splash myself.

00:12:55.925 --> 00:12:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>>Was there a
particular ceremony

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:59.510 align:middle line:90%
that you followed, or no?

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:02.500 align:middle line:84%
>>Our tour guide, I
repeated what he did,

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.120 align:middle line:90%
which is what Billy did.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Which was completely
drench yourself.

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.900 align:middle line:84%
So I do this, I
turn around Billy,

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:14.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm walking up the
steps, and it started,

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:19.410 align:middle line:84%
this thing, the changes that
were happening physically

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:23.670 align:middle line:84%
with my mind, my vision,
my senses, everything

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:25.320 align:middle line:90%
was immediately altered.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:29.320 align:middle line:84%
I get up to the top, and I
walk out into the sunlight,

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.170 align:middle line:84%
and this is what
the ancients knew.

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:33.300 align:middle line:90%
This is the amnesia.

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:39.150 align:middle line:84%
They understood the process of
going from the extreme heat,

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:43.140 align:middle line:84%
to the darkness, to the
cool, cooling down your body,

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:46.740 align:middle line:84%
turning around walking
back out into the sunlight.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:51.000 align:middle line:84%
The serotonin, melatonin,
conversion that is happening,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.970 align:middle line:84%
the chemical changes
that are happening

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:55.440 align:middle line:90%
with your brain and your body.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:00.010 align:middle line:84%
So now it's a physical
and spiritual experience.

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:04.043 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the ancients
knew 3, 4, 5,000 years ago.

00:14:04.043 --> 00:14:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And I find it
completely profound.

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.415 align:middle line:90%


00:14:08.415 --> 00:14:13.210 align:middle line:84%
My mind, my frontal
lobes exploded.

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And they were doing
this 5,000 years ago.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.830 align:middle line:90%
>>I know, incredible.

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>>Billy, these
steps, this entrance

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:21.750 align:middle line:90%
is in the middle of the desert.

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:24.360 align:middle line:84%
How did they know that
there was a lake down there?

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.880 align:middle line:90%
Where does this water come from?

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.270 align:middle line:84%
It's purified, it's
crystal clear, it's cool,

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:31.980 align:middle line:90%
it's not warm.

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:33.390 align:middle line:90%
Do we have any idea?

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>>According to the priest,
it was the knowledge

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.430 align:middle line:84%
was given to them
by the material.

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:40.710 align:middle line:84%
From the time Zep Tepi,
those are the gods

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:43.770 align:middle line:84%
that came from heaven to Earth
and turned mud into a kingdom.

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And so they gave them
the location of this

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.470 align:middle line:84%
and taught them how to go down
there and cleanse themselves.

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:52.230 align:middle line:84%
But the exact
location of the source

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:55.020 align:middle line:84%
of how that water, where it
flows from, how it gets there,

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:57.060 align:middle line:84%
is actually a
secret of the temple

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:59.700 align:middle line:84%
priests, and they are forbidden
to release that information.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>>The Great Pyramid, for me,
my expectations were high.

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:10.500 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't spiritual for
me, it was mechanical.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.890 align:middle line:84%
So I enter the Grand Gallery,
and it's magnificent,

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:15.810 align:middle line:84%
there's no question
about it, it's beautiful.

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:19.410 align:middle line:90%
But it felt industrial to me.

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:23.340 align:middle line:84%
Why for me, did I lack
a spiritual component?

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.100 align:middle line:90%
And was it not spiritual at all?

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:27.990 align:middle line:90%
Is it something else?

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:29.730 align:middle line:84%
>>I personally
feel that the Great

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:32.250 align:middle line:84%
Pyramid itself is a
multi-functional stone,

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:34.140 align:middle line:90%
computer, and a machine.

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.600 align:middle line:84%
I think, it has
multiple functions,

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.260 align:middle line:84%
some of it being formerly
power generation.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.800 align:middle line:84%
I think, it was also a
communications device.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.890 align:middle line:84%
I think, it was also a
stabilization device.

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:50.490 align:middle line:84%
But inside the King's
Chamber, that's

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:53.580 align:middle line:84%
where some people have some real
spiritual experiences, simply

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:57.900 align:middle line:84%
because of the ratio of
the chamber and the sound,

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:00.480 align:middle line:84%
the resonance of the sound when
everybody went in the chamber

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:03.420 align:middle line:84%
and started homing and
started doing the meditation,

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:07.290 align:middle line:84%
with the ohm, it resonated
off the crystal granite,

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:09.210 align:middle line:84%
and gave them a
spiritual experience.

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:12.360 align:middle line:84%
Other than that, the majority
of that pyramid structure,

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.030 align:middle line:84%
the Queen's Chamber, the
tunnels underneath, it's all

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:16.290 align:middle line:90%
like you say, industrial.

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:19.110 align:middle line:90%
It really is a gigantic machine.

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>>When I came out of
the Great Pyramid,

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.350 align:middle line:84%
I had the extreme
honor and privilege

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:28.980 align:middle line:84%
to be completely alone
on the Giza Plateau.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:32.550 align:middle line:84%
Everybody else was still
inside of the pyramid.

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:38.430 align:middle line:84%
Josh, roll this piece
of video, please.

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:39.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm alone.

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:43.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm alone on the Giza
Plateau, what should normally

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:46.890 align:middle line:84%
there are tens of thousands
of tourists and camels.

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:51.090 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's gone, and
here I am, I pan around,

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:54.595 align:middle line:90%
I am the only person there.

00:16:54.595 --> 00:16:55.470 align:middle line:90%
>>That's a rear shot.

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:58.200 align:middle line:84%
>>And it was quiet,
it was solemn,

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:03.780 align:middle line:84%
but as I gathered my
thoughts, after coming out

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:08.010 align:middle line:84%
of the pyramid, and
the Grand Gallery,

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:12.390 align:middle line:84%
I was overwhelmed with
the profound feeling of,

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:16.060 align:middle line:84%
this is mechanical,
this is something else.

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:19.800 align:middle line:84%
It is void of hieroglyphics,
it is void of artwork.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.950 align:middle line:84%
You hear this, but when
you see a temple that

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:25.349 align:middle line:84%
is beautiful and
adorned, and then you

00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:27.930 align:middle line:84%
go to the Great
Pyramid, the first thing

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:30.300 align:middle line:84%
that you're impacted
with is there's nothing

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.260 align:middle line:90%
there to make it beautiful.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.650 align:middle line:90%
It feels like a factory.

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And so as you can
see, what I was

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:45.930 align:middle line:84%
trying to capture here was
it's perfection, it's size,

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:47.790 align:middle line:90%
but it's not artistic.

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:49.560 align:middle line:90%
It's very mechanical.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:50.580 align:middle line:90%
>>Absolutely.

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:53.280 align:middle line:84%
144,000 casing stones
have pretty much

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.100 align:middle line:84%
been removed and stripped
away from the exterior

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:59.550 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid, making
it look even more industrial.

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:01.830 align:middle line:84%
It used to have a very
smooth finish to it,

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.260 align:middle line:84%
and that those casing sounds
to me, as far as I can tell,

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:08.070 align:middle line:84%
were more like insulation, just
like you would insulate a wire.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:09.540 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, so you
get that feeling.

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you look
at the dimensions

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:13.760 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid,
and the location of it,

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:17.280 align:middle line:84%
you just discover it has a lot
of industrial applications.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:21.500 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you look at some
of the mathematics incorporated

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.540 align:middle line:84%
into the base of
the structure, you

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:26.120 align:middle line:84%
discover that you can
calculate the speed of Earth

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:29.388 align:middle line:84%
around the sun, the speed
of Earth on its axis,

00:18:29.388 --> 00:18:31.430 align:middle line:84%
the distance to the moon,
the distance to the sun

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:33.270 align:middle line:90%
can all be calculated by that.

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And you can even calculate
the sidereal year,

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:37.370 align:middle line:90%
the tropical year.

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And so it has all these
astronomical functions

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:42.590 align:middle line:84%
built into it, but then
when you look at the way

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:45.480 align:middle line:84%
it's constructed, where it was
on top of an ancient aquifer,

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.740 align:middle line:90%
which is now dried up.

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:48.380 align:middle line:84%
We know this because
the tubules that

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:49.910 align:middle line:84%
are underneath the Great
Pyramid are still there,

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:51.860 align:middle line:84%
where the water used
to flow from the Nile.

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And so that would run
underneath the crystal granite,

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:57.020 align:middle line:84%
creating physical static
electricity, which would then

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.420 align:middle line:84%
run up through the
Grand Gallery, which

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:01.550 align:middle line:84%
used to have these
resonating rods,

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:03.260 align:middle line:90%
according to some engineers.

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And which would have then gone
up into the King's Chamber,

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.160 align:middle line:84%
and would have been
amplified there and shot up

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:08.960 align:middle line:90%
through the apex.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.500 align:middle line:84%
So they're showing
wireless energy, which

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.830 align:middle line:84%
would have been picked up by the
Jed's, which we saw connected

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:18.415 align:middle line:84%
to the light bulb, harnessing,
it looks like a Tesla coil,

00:19:18.415 --> 00:19:20.540 align:middle line:84%
harnessing wireless
electricity and then sending it

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:21.998 align:middle line:84%
to the light bulbs
for electricity.

00:19:21.998 --> 00:19:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And also gold electroplating,
which they had back then.

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:26.270 align:middle line:84%
>>There you bring up
a really good point

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:31.580 align:middle line:84%
where the Egyptologists
over the years

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:34.687 align:middle line:84%
said that there's nothing
underneath the pyramid complex,

00:19:34.687 --> 00:19:36.020 align:middle line:90%
there's nothing underneath Giza.

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Now we know, that there
was complete tunnel

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:45.260 align:middle line:84%
complex that starts at the bird
tombs on the Northwest corner.

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And completely goes
underneath the Great Pyramid.

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And these are very
large caves and tunnels.

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:55.560 align:middle line:84%
They weren't supposed to
exist, and now we know that.

00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And now what is the purpose,
and the weight of these three

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:04.250 align:middle line:84%
pyramids above that the
engineering was put in place

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:07.100 align:middle line:84%
to not only support
that, but to make

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:10.010 align:middle line:84%
sure it had access
to the tunnels that

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:10.940 align:middle line:90%
are going underneath.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And to that point, we had our
own access to the Great Sphinx.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And yes, and so
much has been made

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:29.690 align:middle line:84%
over the years about the
Sphinx just being a statue,

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:32.540 align:middle line:84%
that there's nothing
more to it, it's there

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:35.240 align:middle line:84%
in its own enclosure,
there's nothing to see here.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Of course, Edgar Cayce talked
about a library of documents

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:42.500 align:middle line:84%
underneath one of
the front paws.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:43.880 align:middle line:90%
No there's nothing there.

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:45.590 align:middle line:90%
Well, he brought this up.

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And so Billy got us access,
and I shoot a video.

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And I walk around alone, and I
walk around the Great Sphinx,

00:20:57.170 --> 00:21:04.970 align:middle line:84%
and I get to the back, and there
it is, an entrance to a tunnel,

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:06.530 align:middle line:90%
underneath the Great Sphinx.

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:09.860 align:middle line:90%
I've got the video here.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:14.930 align:middle line:84%
Josh, when you first
saw these tunnels,

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:17.720 align:middle line:84%
underneath the Great Sphinx,
and there it is, it's a video.

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.400 align:middle line:90%
What went through your mind?

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.438 align:middle line:84%
>>That I probably have
a claustrophobia issue

00:21:21.438 --> 00:21:23.480 align:middle line:84%
because I don't know if
I could climb down there.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.820 align:middle line:90%
But also, what is down there?

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:29.195 align:middle line:90%
And what secrets can we glean?

00:21:29.195 --> 00:21:32.960 align:middle line:84%
>>As we watch the video,
there's two things

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.090 align:middle line:84%
that I captured
here, Billy, and I

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:37.220 align:middle line:84%
know that you've seen
this entrance before.

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:39.860 align:middle line:90%
There's two tunnels.

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:44.410 align:middle line:84%
One clearly, this
is the beginning

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:46.400 align:middle line:90%
as I start this walk around.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
that you gather

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:55.190 align:middle line:84%
is the absolute size and
perfection of the Great Sphinx.

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:57.660 align:middle line:90%
It's overwhelming to see this.

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And so I try to
capture in this video,

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:04.520 align:middle line:84%
not knowing that I
was about to walk

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:08.450 align:middle line:84%
upon these tunnels
and this entrance.

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:11.720 align:middle line:90%
And so this is what I saw.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:15.290 align:middle line:84%
One tunnel Billy
goes straight down,

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:17.840 align:middle line:84%
and you can't see
the bottom of it.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:21.950 align:middle line:84%
We're going to see that in a
second, I've got some images.

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:23.960 align:middle line:84%
What's at the bottom
of that first tunnel?

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, underneath
the Great Sphinx,

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:26.750 align:middle line:90%
there's a lot of tunnels.

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:30.350 align:middle line:84%
Some of them lead out for
miles underneath Giza.

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And according to
the Emerald Tablets,

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.860 align:middle line:84%
Thoth claims they
have even hidden

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:37.640 align:middle line:84%
a ship of some type
underneath the Sphinx.

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.860 align:middle line:84%
There have been ground
penetrating radar reports

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:42.170 align:middle line:84%
stating that about
a mile down, there's

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:44.960 align:middle line:84%
a massive cavern or some kind
of opening with something

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.820 align:middle line:84%
underneath the Sphinx,
nobody's been given access

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:48.620 align:middle line:90%
to go that deep.

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>>When you say ship,
ship for the water,

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.120 align:middle line:90%
or a ship as in a craft?

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, he calls it a ship that
has the capability of battling

00:22:56.810 --> 00:23:00.195 align:middle line:84%
an invader from the deep, and
he's talking about deep space.

00:23:00.195 --> 00:23:02.570 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think it's a ship
that sails out on the ocean,

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:05.210 align:middle line:84%
I think, it's a space
ship of some type.

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:07.100 align:middle line:84%
He says the one
that is the wisest

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:11.130 align:middle line:84%
will be able to free the ship
and defeat the enemy with ease.

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:14.240 align:middle line:90%
>>Now, there is another tunnel.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:16.068 align:middle line:84%
So you have one that's
going straight down,

00:23:16.068 --> 00:23:17.360 align:middle line:90%
you can't see the bottom of it.

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.460 align:middle line:90%
I tried to capture it.

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And there's another tunnel, off
of this first tunnel, that goes

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:25.730 align:middle line:90%
to the front of the Sphinx.

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:27.050 align:middle line:90%
And what's that leading to?

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:29.180 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, if there's an
ancient papyrus that exists,

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:30.770 align:middle line:84%
and I have a
replica of it, where

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:33.800 align:middle line:84%
it shows Thoth, the Atlantean,
who ruled over the land of Khem

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.387 align:middle line:84%
for 14,000 years,
landing on the back

00:23:36.387 --> 00:23:37.970 align:middle line:84%
of the Sphinx and
something that looks

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:41.810 align:middle line:84%
like some type of
a star tetrahedron,

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:43.690 align:middle line:90%
some type of a vehicle.

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:45.553 align:middle line:84%
He lands on the
back, and then he

00:23:45.553 --> 00:23:47.220 align:middle line:84%
would walk through
the back of the head.

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:49.512 align:middle line:84%
There's a door in the back
of the head, which is sealed

00:23:49.512 --> 00:23:51.920 align:middle line:84%
but you can still see the
outline of it at the top.

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
a staircase that

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.640 align:middle line:84%
walks-- it winds
down, it comes down,

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.385 align:middle line:84%
and he will come out
in between the paws,

00:23:57.385 --> 00:23:59.635 align:middle line:84%
but also that there's a
storehouse of more information

00:23:59.635 --> 00:24:01.490 align:middle line:90%
underneath that area.

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:04.190 align:middle line:84%
The Dream Stele, which we were
touching when we were there

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:07.490 align:middle line:84%
and taking pictures in front
of, that was added to the Sphinx

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:08.780 align:middle line:90%
much later.

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:11.405 align:middle line:84%
There used to be just a
door behind the Dream Stele

00:24:11.405 --> 00:24:13.280 align:middle line:84%
where they would come
right out of the chest.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.902 align:middle line:84%
And underneath that, are more
tunnels leading to other areas.

00:24:15.902 --> 00:24:17.360 align:middle line:84%
According to Thoth,
they would lead

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.308 align:middle line:84%
to his halls of
Vicente, which was

00:24:19.308 --> 00:24:20.600 align:middle line:90%
connected to the Great Pyramid.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.090 align:middle line:90%
>>Do we have the tunnel video?

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:24.490 align:middle line:90%
>>Bringing it up right now.

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:25.490 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>>So this is a photograph,
that I took and I tried to see

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.690 align:middle line:84%
the bottom of the
tunnel, you can't.

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:35.490 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:38.250 align:middle line:84%
>>I have no idea
how deep that goes.

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:41.610 align:middle line:84%
The other photograph,
that we have here,

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:45.510 align:middle line:84%
this is the second tunnel
leading off of the main tunnel.

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Again, I couldn't
see the end of it.

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:51.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any idea
of the length of this,

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.280 align:middle line:84%
but these tunnels weren't
supposed to exist.

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.415 align:middle line:84%
There was supposed to be
nothing underneath the Sphinx,

00:24:56.415 --> 00:24:58.750 align:middle line:84%
and here it is, I
saw it for myself.

00:24:58.750 --> 00:24:59.550 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:02.910 align:middle line:84%
See the general population
never gets access like we have.

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:05.220 align:middle line:84%
So they're in a
place that's maybe,

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:08.450 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, 50 meters above
and maybe almost 100 yards

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:10.200 align:middle line:84%
or 50 yards away
probably from the Sphinx,

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.790 align:middle line:90%
they can't even see down there.

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:14.970 align:middle line:84%
We were actually right up on
it, inside the Sphinx enclosure,

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:16.960 align:middle line:84%
which hardly anybody
gets a chance to do.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And we were able to
see that they do exist.

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:24.720 align:middle line:84%
>>But here's the thing, why
keep this from the public?

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And why the continue,
the contempt--

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:33.120 align:middle line:84%
why the continuation
of denial of anything

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.280 align:middle line:84%
other than what we've
already been told?

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:38.490 align:middle line:84%
We can see that there are
tunnels underneath the Sphinx.

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:43.320 align:middle line:84%
We know that there are caves
and tunnels, and aquifers

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:45.902 align:middle line:84%
underneath the Great
Pyramid, but nobody

00:25:45.902 --> 00:25:48.360 align:middle line:84%
wants to talk about it, and
nobody wants to investigate it.

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:50.580 align:middle line:90%
Why continue with the secrecy?

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:53.460 align:middle line:84%
>>Because if you look
into it and you find out

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:56.190 align:middle line:84%
that it's real, it
verifies the ancient texts

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:59.400 align:middle line:84%
and the ancient documents,
which means all of a sudden,

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:03.090 align:middle line:84%
a lot of dogma and
ideologies have to fall apart

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:05.160 align:middle line:90%
because these things exist.

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.710 align:middle line:84%
Also the second reason
is, these ancient texts

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:10.845 align:middle line:84%
talk about hidden
technologies and knowledge

00:26:10.845 --> 00:26:14.040 align:middle line:84%
records being stored in
these underground areas.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:17.070 align:middle line:84%
Which as you know,
the powers that be

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:19.710 align:middle line:84%
want to get that first
because if there's any way

00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:22.420 align:middle line:84%
that it gives you instructions
on how to build a weapon,

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:26.070 align:middle line:84%
or something that they can
utilize or they can weaponize,

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:27.648 align:middle line:90%
they want access to that first.

00:26:27.648 --> 00:26:29.940 align:middle line:84%
If there's something they
can monetize and convert that

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.460 align:middle line:84%
into technology that can
be sold to the masses.

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:34.812 align:middle line:84%
If we go down there, me
and you, and we find it,

00:26:34.812 --> 00:26:36.520 align:middle line:84%
we're going to tell
everybody what it is.

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:39.600 align:middle line:84%
But if they get it and
hoard the knowledge,

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.480 align:middle line:90%
that they have the power.

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:45.300 align:middle line:84%
>>I think, here's the
most important point

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:52.320 align:middle line:84%
that needs to be discussed,
which is this, you enter Giza

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:56.365 align:middle line:84%
and you look around, and
it doesn't fit the timeline

00:26:56.365 --> 00:26:57.240 align:middle line:90%
that we've been told.

00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:01.200 align:middle line:84%
You can see with your own
eyes that this is much older

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.880 align:middle line:90%
than we have been told.

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:07.320 align:middle line:84%
But you compound that with
site, after site, after site,

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.030 align:middle line:90%
after site in Egypt.

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:11.880 align:middle line:84%
Pyramid, after
pyramid, after pyramid,

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:15.300 align:middle line:84%
and there is no way that
all of this construction

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:18.040 align:middle line:84%
got built in the timeline
that they're telling us,

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:20.520 align:middle line:84%
which is just barely
under 1,000 years,

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:24.240 align:middle line:84%
that they got all of these
megalithic structures and sites

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.750 align:middle line:84%
and pyramids all built with a
population that didn't exist

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:29.820 align:middle line:90%
to support this construction.

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:33.270 align:middle line:84%
It's obviously much older
than what they're telling us.

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:36.540 align:middle line:84%
If you were going to
start taking guesses

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:39.990 align:middle line:84%
with your information, how
old are we talking about?

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:43.510 align:middle line:84%
Are we going back
10,000 years, further?

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, if you go back
10 or 13,000 years,

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:48.390 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about the
Younger Dryas period, which

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:51.000 align:middle line:84%
was to me a lot of global
catastrophes happening

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:51.960 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:54.870 align:middle line:84%
Not a great time to build
megalithic structures

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:58.950 align:middle line:84%
in that area, especially if the
ice sheet has been decimated,

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:02.530 align:middle line:84%
and as we know, come
as far down as Egypt.

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:03.330 align:middle line:90%
>>That's right.

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>>So no need to
build at that time.

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:07.950 align:middle line:84%
I think, if you look at the
alignment of the Great Sphinx

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:09.780 align:middle line:84%
with the constellation
of Leo, and go back

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:11.310 align:middle line:84%
two processional
periods, you find

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:13.740 align:middle line:84%
a time of tranquil
peace, a golden era,

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.200 align:middle line:84%
and you discover that
in the Emerald tablets

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.830 align:middle line:84%
both talks about the fact that
he built the Great Pyramid,

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:20.670 align:middle line:90%
according to him.

00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And in the Sumerian
tablets, his father

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:25.920 align:middle line:84%
tells him to build the Sphinx
and put his face on it.

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.960 align:middle line:84%
Now the face that's there
now is not his face,

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.780 align:middle line:84%
it's been recarved
into his nephew's face,

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.580 align:middle line:90%
the son of Amun-Ra.

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:35.850 align:middle line:84%
But either way, he
built, I believe,

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:37.920 align:middle line:84%
he was the master
architect of that area.

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:40.050 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking
about 36,000 BC,

00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:42.870 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
38,000 years ago.

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:47.850 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm going to save the best for
last, which is, the Serapeum.

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:52.470 align:middle line:84%
First, it's very close
to the Step Pyramid.

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And as you walk through, you're
walking through sand dunes,

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:58.710 align:middle line:84%
you're walking
through the desert,

00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:02.640 align:middle line:84%
and you round this bend,
and you go down a hill,

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:09.840 align:middle line:84%
and then underneath the sand is
the entrance to the Serapeum.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:13.410 align:middle line:84%
Josh, this is not a
joke, as you're walking,

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:17.610 align:middle line:84%
you don't realize what
you're walking on top of.

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:22.680 align:middle line:84%
This ginormous tunnel
and cave system

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:28.590 align:middle line:84%
that is housing
these 100 ton crypts.

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:31.650 align:middle line:84%
Sarcophagus, boxes, whatever
you want to call them.

00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:34.900 align:middle line:84%
But when you enter, this
isn't a small tunnel, Billy.

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:35.700 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:42.340 align:middle line:84%
>>This is a tunnel complex
that is elegant, it's 10 to 15,

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:44.880 align:middle line:90%
maybe 20 feet wide.

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:48.120 align:middle line:84%
10 to 15 foot tall,
beautiful archways,

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:51.450 align:middle line:84%
and it goes on forever
underneath the sand,

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:52.860 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of nowhere.

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:55.740 align:middle line:90%
>>Wow.

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:57.990 align:middle line:84%
>>It's an accomplishment
of engineering

00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:01.690 align:middle line:84%
that wasn't supposed to
exist thousands of years ago.

00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:04.740 align:middle line:84%
>>If this wouldn't exist
would be hard to do today.

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:07.710 align:middle line:84%
Actually, to get
those gigantic boxes,

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:09.383 align:middle line:84%
those granite boxes
in those alcoves

00:30:09.383 --> 00:30:10.800 align:middle line:84%
would be impossible,
for us to do.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:11.670 align:middle line:90%
>>Impossible.

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>>And so when you
look at this place

00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:14.470 align:middle line:84%
and you go down
under, first of all,

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:16.303 align:middle line:84%
the first thing you
recognize like you said,

00:30:16.303 --> 00:30:17.490 align:middle line:90%
the engineering feat.

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:19.950 align:middle line:84%
There's no collapse there's
no evidence of a collapse

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:21.600 align:middle line:84%
anywhere, they
understood the materials

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.267 align:middle line:84%
they were working
with and how to build.

00:30:23.267 --> 00:30:24.190 align:middle line:90%
>>It looks brand new.

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:24.990 align:middle line:90%
>> It does.

00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>>It looks brand new.

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:25.830 align:middle line:90%
>>Pristine.

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:27.300 align:middle line:84%
>>It looks like it
was built yesterday.

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:28.100 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Also you recognize the way
the rock is hollowed out

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:35.130 align:middle line:84%
and to make these amazing
tunnels and these alcoves,

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:36.540 align:middle line:90%
it's vitrified.

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:39.570 align:middle line:84%
So they must have used some
type of a boring machine,

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:42.150 align:middle line:84%
and would have solidified
the tunnels and the alcoves

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:43.440 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
big question is,

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:47.640 align:middle line:84%
each alcove was in
a 90 degree angle,

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:51.910 align:middle line:84%
so how do you get 100 ton
crystal granite box in there.

00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:52.710 align:middle line:90%
>>You don't.

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:53.510 align:middle line:90%
>>You don't.

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:55.480 align:middle line:84%
You have to materialize
them in there.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>>So as you walk through,
to the left, to the right,

00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:02.130 align:middle line:84%
to the left, to the right are
these 100 ton sarcophagus that

00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:07.410 align:middle line:84%
are 10 feet tall, you can
walk underneath the lids.

00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:11.190 align:middle line:84%
It's the size and the
extreme of everything

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:13.180 align:middle line:90%
doesn't make any sense.

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:19.710 align:middle line:84%
But some of these, most
of them seem to be melted.

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:24.780 align:middle line:84%
I have looked into the
temperature of melting granite,

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:28.770 align:middle line:90%
which is 12, 13, 1,400 degrees.

00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And to melt a 100
ton granite box,

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:34.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any idea
what that technology is.

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:39.570 align:middle line:84%
But Billy, you showed me a
completely melted granite box.

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:42.150 align:middle line:90%


00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:44.700 align:middle line:90%
Was it a photon energy weapon?

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>>It was bizarre
because if you remember,

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:49.050 align:middle line:84%
in the back of that alcove,
that's the only alcove.

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:51.060 align:middle line:84%
Now this one granite
box that I showed you,

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:54.210 align:middle line:84%
was the one with the star
gates on it, etched into it.

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:58.020 align:middle line:84%
In the back of the alcove,
there is this opening,

00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:00.600 align:middle line:84%
this hole that
somehow was blasted

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.100 align:middle line:84%
through that back
of that alcove.

00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And when you turn
around, and look directly

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:05.320 align:middle line:84%
where the direction
of it it's going right

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:08.700 align:middle line:84%
towards the warped, melted
granite on that box.

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Some type of beam of energy
of some type in my hypothesis.

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.920 align:middle line:84%
I don't know this for
a fact, my hypothesis,

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:16.500 align:middle line:84%
something came through
that back of the alcove

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:20.910 align:middle line:84%
and hit that granite and
warped and melted it,

00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:23.790 align:middle line:84%
and made it warped
like hot butter, which

00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:25.920 align:middle line:84%
is almost impossible
to do without cracking.

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.780 align:middle line:84%
There's no evidence
of any cracking,

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:30.900 align:middle line:84%
it somehow altered the atomic
structure of the granite.

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:36.000 align:middle line:84%
>>And the hieroglyphics,
the lines that were carved,

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.250 align:middle line:84%
that adorn this entire
sarcophagus, are still there,

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:44.910 align:middle line:84%
and they're perfect,
it's just melted in,

00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:46.285 align:middle line:84%
but the lines are
still straight.

00:32:46.285 --> 00:32:47.452 align:middle line:90%
>>The lines are still there.

00:32:47.452 --> 00:32:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>>It's crazy, but it's
the most insane thing

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:50.760 align:middle line:90%
that I've ever seen.

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And it just doesn't
make any sense.

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:56.190 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to build
a 100 ton granite box,

00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:58.240 align:middle line:84%
you're not going
to make a mistake,

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:01.410 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to carve
an indentation into it,

00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:02.610 align:middle line:90%
and then carve.

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Maybe nobody's going
to see it if I just

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:06.720 align:middle line:84%
paint these hieroglyphics
over the top,

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:08.610 align:middle line:84%
and they won't notice
that I've messed

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:10.420 align:middle line:90%
this up, that's not the case.

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:16.080 align:middle line:84%
You have a perfect, 100 ton,
divine, sarcophagus built.

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:19.170 align:middle line:84%
You've laid all of this
artwork and information

00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:20.500 align:middle line:90%
over the top of it.

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.350 align:middle line:90%
That's what it was.

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:23.860 align:middle line:84%
You're not going
to make a mistake.

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:24.660 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:27.805 align:middle line:84%
>>The damage, this melting
happened after the fact.

00:33:27.805 --> 00:33:28.605 align:middle line:90%
>>After.

00:33:28.605 --> 00:33:31.470 align:middle line:84%
If you remember, at Dendera
the steps were melted,

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:34.230 align:middle line:84%
the granite steps coming
down, one of the passageways

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:37.860 align:middle line:84%
were also unexplainably
melted, nobody knows how.

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:40.770 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about 2 or
3,000 degrees, whatever

00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:43.960 align:middle line:84%
the temperature is to
create liquefied staircases,

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:44.760 align:middle line:90%
coming down there.

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:48.000 align:middle line:84%
So something energetic
was happening back then,

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.050 align:middle line:84%
what exactly it
is, we don't know.

00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:52.020 align:middle line:90%
But somebody had technology.

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:54.180 align:middle line:84%
Those weren't
torches doing that.

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:57.780 align:middle line:84%
>>All I can say is, I finally
made it, after 59 years,

00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:01.930 align:middle line:84%
I did it on my birthday,
and it was, again,

00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:05.760 align:middle line:84%
one of the most profound,
life-changing experiences I've

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:06.630 align:middle line:90%
ever had.

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:08.760 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you
Billy for being here

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:10.424 align:middle line:84%
with us today on
Into the Vortex.

00:34:10.424 --> 00:34:10.860 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you.

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:11.340 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you Billy.

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:11.639 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you.

00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:12.439 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, man.

00:34:12.439 --> 00:34:13.629 align:middle line:90%
>>Josh, you've got to go.

00:34:13.629 --> 00:34:14.429 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:34:14.429 --> 00:34:15.060 align:middle line:90%
>>You've got to go.

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>>You're coming
with us next time.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.530 align:middle line:84%
>>Next time you guys go
please send out an invite.

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:18.330 align:middle line:90%
>>Absolutely.

00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:19.570 align:middle line:90%
>>I need that experience.

00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:20.850 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you Billy Carson.

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:24.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, Jimmy
Church, along with Josh.

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.790 align:middle line:84%
We'll see you next time
on Into the Vortex.
