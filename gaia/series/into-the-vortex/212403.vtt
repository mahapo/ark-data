00:00:10.353 --> 00:00:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm radio and television
host Jimmy Church.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And I am here to uncover
the truth about some

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.630 align:middle line:90%
of life's biggest mysteries.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.960 align:middle line:84%
If this is revealed,
everything has to be rewritten.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.430 align:middle line:10%
My guest today is Michael
Mazzola, celebrated director

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.860 align:middle line:10%
of influential
UFO documentaries,

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.950 align:middle line:10%
who is now delving into
the mystery of Bigfoot,

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.400 align:middle line:10%
suggesting it may be an
interdimensional phenomenon

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.500 align:middle line:10%
possibly connected
to UFO encounters.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.150 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not a matter
of is it real.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.470 align:middle line:84%
The debate is, is it just
a normal mundane animal

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.825 align:middle line:84%
or is it an
interdimensional being?

00:00:47.825 --> 00:00:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>> As always, MUFON
Field Investigator Josh--

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.195 align:middle line:90%
Josh, can you pull up the map?

00:00:53.195 --> 00:00:53.995 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:00:53.995 --> 00:00:56.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Joins us to
help set the scene.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Join us as we dive deep to
get to the bottom of some

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.515 align:middle line:84%
of the most intriguing
questions of our time.

00:01:03.515 --> 00:01:07.730 align:middle line:84%
>> The camera is mounted on his
shoulder shooting behind him.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And you see this portal,
this sort of sphere

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.870 align:middle line:90%
start to materialize.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.815 align:middle line:84%
And then within it, this
humanoid Bigfoot figure.

00:01:16.815 --> 00:01:28.920 align:middle line:90%


00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome to Into the Vortex.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jimmy Church.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And today, my guest is
director Michael Mazzola.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, he's known for
Unacknowledged, Close

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.470 align:middle line:84%
Encounters of the Fifth Kind,
his most recent, The Lost

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Century, and 411,
the UFO Connection

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.540 align:middle line:90%
and centered around UFOs.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.660 align:middle line:84%
But today, we're going
to talk about Bigfoot.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.210 align:middle line:90%
You come from a UFO world.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're jumping into
the world of Bigfoot.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask you the
direct question first.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.685 align:middle line:90%
Are they connected?

00:02:06.685 --> 00:02:08.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And I think that all of my
research and years in the UFO

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.030 align:middle line:84%
field have helped me be prepared
to tackle Bigfoot properly

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.030 align:middle line:84%
because I have discovered
much to my surprise

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.160 align:middle line:84%
that the Bigfoot field is
a lot like the UFO field.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.110 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of the same kind
of infighting and competing

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.200 align:middle line:90%
narratives and controversies.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And my background
in UFOs is helping

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.735 align:middle line:84%
me spot the same kind
of patterns in Bigfoot.

00:02:39.735 --> 00:02:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so with the ET subject,
which has changed decade

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.390 align:middle line:84%
to decade to decade, we
were learning more and more,

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.450 align:middle line:84%
but the same genres, the
same titles, the same nouns,

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.820 align:middle line:84%
the same adjectives
that we use for ET,

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.830 align:middle line:84%
interdimensional nuts and bolts,
biological interdimensional

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.130 align:middle line:84%
beings, the same things
can be said about Bigfoot.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.940 align:middle line:84%
But yet the two communities
seem to be divided.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And to take it one step
further, the UFO community

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.640 align:middle line:90%
is OK with bringing Bigfoot in.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.210 align:middle line:84%
The Bigfoot community is a
little bit resistant to this

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.900 align:middle line:84%
because they have their own
ideas and theories about what

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.230 align:middle line:84%
Bigfoot may be, but they don't
want to cross-pollinate it

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.670 align:middle line:90%
into the UFO subject.

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.126 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:03:34.126 --> 00:03:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think it makes a lot
of people uncomfortable, right?

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.980 align:middle line:84%
So I was surprised
to find, number 1,

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.670 align:middle line:84%
that the controversy is not
about whether Bigfoot is real

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.470 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.910 align:middle line:84%
I was actually new
to this a year ago.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And when I started
doing this project,

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.410 align:middle line:90%
I dove into the research.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing I found was
that people like Jane Goodall

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.430 align:middle line:84%
were on the record
saying that Bigfoot was

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.920 align:middle line:90%
real or probably real, right?

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
newspaper articles

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.350 align:middle line:84%
going back to the 1600s
through the 1920s talking

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.260 align:middle line:84%
about giant skeletons
being found and being

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.640 align:middle line:90%
sent to universities.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And they named
the scientists who

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.670 align:middle line:84%
were taking possession
of these things.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a matter
of is it real.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.560 align:middle line:90%
The debate is, is it an ape?

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Is it just a normal
mundane animal,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.540 align:middle line:84%
or is it an
interdimensional being?

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.460 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's not whether
Bigfoot is real.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.800 align:middle line:90%
It's what is Bigfoot?

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.880 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And as far as I can
tell, the majority

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.290 align:middle line:84%
of the Bigfoot community
believes that this is just

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.880 align:middle line:90%
another great ape.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.460 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think you can go
15 minutes researching Bigfoot

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.790 align:middle line:84%
without encountering
credible testimony

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.220 align:middle line:84%
from many, many,
many people talking

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.850 align:middle line:84%
about the same kinds of
paranormal experiences

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.220 align:middle line:84%
that they're experiencing
when they encounter Bigfoot.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.500 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, you just went
to cross the country.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.960 align:middle line:84%
How many interviews
did you do, and what

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.330 align:middle line:90%
areas did you venture into?

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So we've done probably 25,
30 interviews at this point.

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.260 align:middle line:90%
I've actually lost count.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.120 align:middle line:90%
We have been to Alaska.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.590 align:middle line:84%
We did a town hall in Juneau,
which was really cool.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.820 align:middle line:84%
We spent a week in Tennessee
in the National Forest.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.160 align:middle line:90%
We've been to Montana.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.815 align:middle line:90%
And we're still filming.

00:05:30.815 --> 00:05:33.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, what have you learned?

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.830 align:middle line:84%
Before you answer, I've
always been on the fence.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.870 align:middle line:84%
But I've made something very
clear to my audience, which

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.590 align:middle line:90%
is this.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:51.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if Bigfoot
exists, but yet, we

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.120 align:middle line:84%
have the Patterson-Gimlin
film, which

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.940 align:middle line:90%
I believe is 100% authentic.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And that if the UFO community
had a piece of footage

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.620 align:middle line:84%
like the Patterson-Gimlin
film, it would be case closed.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.670 align:middle line:84%
But yet, I'm still on
the fence about Bigfoot.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:09.780 align:middle line:90%
Same for you?

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Not anymore.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.340 align:middle line:84%
I am completely convinced
that Bigfoot is real.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.970 align:middle line:84%
I have met too many people,
firemen, police officers,

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.150 align:middle line:84%
paramedics, credible
witnesses who

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.700 align:middle line:84%
are telling me the same
kinds of experiences,

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.470 align:middle line:90%
the same kinds of detail.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.600 align:middle line:84%
They have no incentive
to make this up.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.070 align:middle line:90%
They're not getting famous.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.200 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them are really
nervous to talk to us.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.730 align:middle line:90%
They're afraid of the ridicule.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like they're being
embraced by the wider Bigfoot

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.220 align:middle line:84%
community, because
like I said when

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.360 align:middle line:84%
you talk about the paranormal
aspects of Bigfoot, that

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.320 align:middle line:84%
doesn't make you super popular
with this broader Bigfoot

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.120 align:middle line:90%
community.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Can't both exist?

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.760 align:middle line:84%
Can't there be two
versions of Bigfoot?

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Can it be an undiscovered
or lost species

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.900 align:middle line:84%
that is DNA, physical,
and just hiding

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.430 align:middle line:84%
from us, an intelligent
species, and also

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:11.200 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, an
interdimensional species?

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And they both coexist, and we're
talking about the same thing.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Anything's possible.

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, why not?

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.280 align:middle line:84%
For me, I don't
rule anything out.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>> When we go back and
we look at history,

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:30.350 align:middle line:84%
it's too easy to say what
about the panda, right?

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:32.120 align:middle line:90%
Panda was not supposed to exist.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And it was hiding out
from us in bamboo forest

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:38.150 align:middle line:84%
and very elusive,
extremely elusive,

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.030 align:middle line:84%
a mythical, mythological
creature, right?

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.190 align:middle line:84%
Almost I would say
a cryptid, right?

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:47.360 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly, it was discovered.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.500 align:middle line:90%
And now, they're in our zoos.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Is Bigfoot that
elusive, where if there

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.800 align:middle line:84%
is a biological side
of this, that it

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.415 align:middle line:84%
is possible to avoid contact
with us, with humans?

00:07:58.415 --> 00:08:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, I don't see how
this can be a purely biological

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.790 align:middle line:90%
mundane creature.

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:07.190 align:middle line:84%
We have too many
witnesses who have

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:10.760 align:middle line:84%
seen Bigfoot step behind
a tree and dematerialize,

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.410 align:middle line:90%
actually vanish in thin air.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:17.600 align:middle line:84%
You've got footprints that will
begin in the middle of the snow

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.300 align:middle line:84%
and end in the
middle of the snow.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.490 align:middle line:84%
You've got professional
trackers who

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:26.310 align:middle line:84%
are investigating this saying
this is actually impossible.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:28.500 align:middle line:84%
They've never seen this
with any other creature

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.470 align:middle line:90%
that can do this.

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So what's you're describing
then is a set of footprints

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:41.190 align:middle line:84%
where Bigfoot has materialized,
dropped onto the ground,

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:45.900 align:middle line:84%
taken a few steps, and
then de-molecularized,

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.730 align:middle line:84%
I guess is the
best way to put it,

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:51.600 align:middle line:84%
where you see the footprints,
but you don't see the entrance

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.810 align:middle line:90%
and exit from those.

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:53.610 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:57.420 align:middle line:84%
At a certain point, the
interdimensional hypothesis

00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.540 align:middle line:84%
becomes the most
rational explanation.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And not just because
of the footprints,

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:05.040 align:middle line:84%
because of all the other
phenomena associated

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.130 align:middle line:84%
with this including the
connection to orbs and UFO

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:09.930 align:middle line:90%
sightings.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:14.220 align:middle line:84%
If you were to make a heat
map of Bigfoot sightings

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.120 align:middle line:84%
and a heat map of UFO sightings,
it's basically the same map.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:23.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, I've got a still
shot I want to show you from

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:24.030 align:middle line:90%
your film.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And took a look at
this piece of footage,

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:29.700 align:middle line:90%
and we grabbed this shot.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And I cannot unsee what
I see in this image.

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:38.550 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
describe what I see.

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:44.220 align:middle line:84%
I see the entrance to a
wormhole, some type of portal,

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:49.150 align:middle line:84%
some type of vortex on this path
in the middle of the forest.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:52.470 align:middle line:90%
And I see a doorway.

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen the footage, and
I see something moving around

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:59.520 align:middle line:90%
in and out of that doorway.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.580 align:middle line:84%
Am I imagining this, or
is this what we see here?

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.570 align:middle line:84%
>> That is actually
what we see here.

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:08.370 align:middle line:84%
So unfortunately, I can't show
you the entire clip right now.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:10.290 align:middle line:90%
Our film is still in production.

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to be
making its debut in our film.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:17.820 align:middle line:84%
But this was shot by an amazing
researcher and author named

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.930 align:middle line:84%
Scott Carpenter in the Tennessee
National Forest near Knoxville.

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And we spent a week filming
with him a couple of months ago.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And so what he used
to do is he would

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:31.800 align:middle line:84%
put a GoPro on his
shoulder facing behind him

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.720 align:middle line:90%
and go into the forest.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:39.480 align:middle line:10%
And he captured all kinds
of amazing shots of Bigfoot,

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.680 align:middle line:10%
a white Bigfoot at one
point poking its head out

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.480 align:middle line:10%
of the trees.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:49.720 align:middle line:84%
He would sort of turn his back
to urinate or to do whatever,

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.610 align:middle line:84%
and the Bigfoot would pop
out of the trees behind him

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:53.410 align:middle line:90%
and watch him.

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:55.160 align:middle line:84%
So he started
capturing this stuff.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:59.200 align:middle line:84%
So this shot was taken on the
trail in the National Forest.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:03.160 align:middle line:84%
The camera is mounted on his
shoulder, shooting behind him.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And you see this portal,
this sort of sphere

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.620 align:middle line:84%
start to materialize,
and then within it,

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:12.940 align:middle line:90%
this humanoid Bigfoot figure.

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:16.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, Scott took us
back to this spot,

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:20.110 align:middle line:84%
this exact spot in the National
Forest where he shot this.

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And we had our camera crew,
and we had our EMF readers.

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:26.100 align:middle line:84%
And we were getting
zero EMF readings

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.850 align:middle line:84%
because we're in the
middle of the forest.

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:29.500 align:middle line:90%
There's no cell signal.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:34.330 align:middle line:84%
When we got to the exact spot
where this portal appeared,

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.940 align:middle line:84%
the EMF reader
started going berserk.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:39.100 align:middle line:84%
And it was actually
warning us that there

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:43.110 align:middle line:84%
was a dangerous level
of EMF in that area.

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And Scott unfortunately
made a joke at the time.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.450 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, we'll see
if I drop dead in a week.

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And tragically, he
passed away about a week

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.130 align:middle line:84%
after that from a
brain hemorrhage.

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:57.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying it's connected.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:00.340 align:middle line:84%
It was just a creepy coincidence
that he made that comment.

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:01.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Strange that he would say
something like that, and then--

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:04.740 align:middle line:90%
and-

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:05.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Damn.

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:06.940 align:middle line:90%
>> It comes to pass.

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:07.740 align:middle line:90%
Very strange.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.900 align:middle line:90%
But he did capture this footage.

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:19.530 align:middle line:84%
When we start to discuss the
amount of eyewitness testimony

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:25.950 align:middle line:84%
of a craft, something seen
in the skies and Bigfoot

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:28.480 align:middle line:84%
on the same evening
in the same area,

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.390 align:middle line:84%
this is where you
have to back up

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:33.525 align:middle line:84%
and say there has to
be a connection here.

00:12:33.525 --> 00:12:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>> In my mind, there's no doubt
that there's a connection.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:39.060 align:middle line:84%
We've spoken to
dozens and dozens

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:41.620 align:middle line:84%
of people and also
researchers who've

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.870 align:middle line:84%
talked to hundreds
of people themselves

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:47.800 align:middle line:84%
who have seen orbs
in UFOs in connection

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.020 align:middle line:90%
with these Bigfoot encounters.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And they're also experiencing
things like telepathy.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.210 align:middle line:84%
We have so many
accounts of Bigfoot

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:01.180 align:middle line:84%
being able to
mimic other animals

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:05.140 align:middle line:84%
in the forest, especially
birds, even mimicking humans.

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And people will hear
their wife calling them.

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:10.660 align:middle line:90%
And it turns out she wasn't.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:11.980 align:middle line:90%
It was Bigfoot.

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:15.670 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot
of strange stuff.

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And when you take
it all together,

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:20.650 align:middle line:84%
it's very clear that we're not
dealing with just a mundane

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:22.150 align:middle line:90%
terrestrial animal.

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:23.690 align:middle line:84%
>> This is where
it gets difficult.

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:26.340 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going
to ask you directly.

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:31.400 align:middle line:84%
How do you explain the
non-physical interdimensional

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:36.710 align:middle line:84%
aspect of this going physical,
so physical that we're making

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:38.540 align:middle line:90%
footprints in the ground?

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:41.810 align:middle line:84%
So interdimensional
at one point.

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:43.880 align:middle line:90%
Teleported if you will, right?

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.260 align:middle line:90%
Steps out of a vortex.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:49.070 align:middle line:84%
But now, it's a
physical, solid creature

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:51.990 align:middle line:84%
with weight and girth
and everything else,

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:57.890 align:middle line:84%
so much to put imprints into
the ground, the dirt, the Earth,

00:13:57.890 --> 00:13:59.240 align:middle line:90%
snow.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.940 align:middle line:84%
That's a difficult thing
to wrap your head around.

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, not just
footprints, hair samples.

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:08.270 align:middle line:84%
There have been
DNA samples where

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:10.280 align:middle line:84%
according to the
DNA analysis that

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:13.490 align:middle line:84%
was done on the mother's
side, it's human dating back

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:14.790 align:middle line:90%
tens of thousands of years.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And on the father's
side, it was unknown.

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:19.190 align:middle line:84%
It didn't match anything
that's ever been cataloged,

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:21.080 align:middle line:90%
which is kind of weird.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:26.190 align:middle line:84%
But also, scat
that's left behind.

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:29.190 align:middle line:84%
We've gone out in the
process of making this film,

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:32.460 align:middle line:84%
and we've tried to
acquire new hair samples.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:36.780 align:middle line:10%
So we partnered with Dave
Paulides of Missing 411,

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:39.990 align:middle line:10%
who's one of the world's
experts in Bigfoot.

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And so according to him, Bigfoot
loves McDonald's pancakes

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:47.280 align:middle line:90%
with syrup.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:51.390 align:middle line:84%
So we go into the woods, and
we will put McDonald's pancakes

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:53.460 align:middle line:90%
with syrup up in a tree.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And we put tape
around it, hoping

00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:00.120 align:middle line:84%
that Bigfoot will reach
in to get the pancakes,

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.520 align:middle line:84%
and we'll be lucky enough
to capture a hair sample.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.420 align:middle line:90%
>> And?

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>> We're still working on it.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>> You're still working on it.

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:07.130 align:middle line:90%
Well, I like--

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:07.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, good luck.

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:09.940 align:middle line:90%
>> I like pancakes and syrup.

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:15.920 align:middle line:84%
But OK, it's one
thing to discuss

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:20.030 align:middle line:84%
an interdimensional
being going solid,

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:22.400 align:middle line:84%
but in the paranormal
community, I

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.930 align:middle line:84%
never hear a discussion
of a ghost or an entity

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:31.130 align:middle line:84%
transforming from that into
something purely physical.

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:34.370 align:middle line:84%
Why are we only hearing
this about Bigfoot?

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we're not because
this is what we see with UFOs.

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And actually,
there's an FBI memo

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.970 align:middle line:84%
that you can see
on the FBI website.

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:46.320 align:middle line:90%
It's from July 8, 1947.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we have
the memo here.

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:49.207 align:middle line:90%
Can you pull that up, Josh?

00:15:49.207 --> 00:15:50.332 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, let me pull it up.

00:15:50.332 --> 00:15:53.960 align:middle line:84%
>> July 8, 1947, what's
special about that date?

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:59.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the same day
that Colonel Jesse Marcel-

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:00.145 align:middle line:90%
>> Roswell.

00:16:00.145 --> 00:16:03.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Put out the press
release that they found--

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.558 align:middle line:84%
that the Army found a crashed
disk containing bodies

00:16:06.558 --> 00:16:08.350 align:middle line:84%
before they tried to
walk that back and say

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:09.590 align:middle line:90%
it was a weather balloon.

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:13.960 align:middle line:10%
So this report was submitted
to the FBI on the same date

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.760 align:middle line:10%
by a special agent.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And it offers an
interdimensional explanation

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.750 align:middle line:84%
for the flying
saucer phenomenon.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the
most amazing documents

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:26.680 align:middle line:90%
I've ever come across.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And I just don't think
it gets enough attention.

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:33.580 align:middle line:84%
So it says things like that
these visitors are human-like

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:35.260 align:middle line:90%
but much larger in size.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:36.520 align:middle line:10%
Oh, kind of like a Bigfoot.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.720 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.760 align:middle line:84%
They are not
excarnate Earth people

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.190 align:middle line:90%
but come from their own world.

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And they do not
come from any planet

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.030 align:middle line:84%
the way we understand
the word planet,

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:50.590 align:middle line:84%
but come from an etheric planet
that interpenetrates our own

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:52.315 align:middle line:90%
but is not perceptible to us.

00:16:52.315 --> 00:16:53.980 align:middle line:90%
>> it says here--

00:16:53.980 --> 00:17:01.500 align:middle line:84%
it says the visitors
are human-like

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.764 align:middle line:90%
but are larger in size.

00:17:03.764 --> 00:17:04.710 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:08.730 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a very interesting
point to make in that,

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:13.110 align:middle line:84%
that the visitors are like--
it sounds like Bigfoot to me.

00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:16.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, considering that
according to witness accounts,

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:21.300 align:middle line:84%
Bigfoot tends to be between
7 and 10 or 11 feet tall,

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:23.339 align:middle line:84%
maybe that's what they're
referring to here.

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:25.255 align:middle line:84%
But there are a lot
of ET races out there.

00:17:25.255 --> 00:17:26.880 align:middle line:84%
So I don't want to
jump the gun and say

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.280 align:middle line:90%
that Bigfoot is an ET race.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.300 align:middle line:84%
But where this gets
really interesting,

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:36.150 align:middle line:84%
it says that the bodies of
these visitors and the craft

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:42.060 align:middle line:84%
can materialize at will upon
entering the vibratory rate

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:43.245 align:middle line:90%
of our dense matter.

00:17:43.245 --> 00:17:44.045 align:middle line:90%
>> End quote.

00:17:44.045 --> 00:17:44.845 align:middle line:90%
>> End quote.

00:17:44.845 --> 00:17:46.410 align:middle line:84%
>> By the way, that's
in quotes, yes.

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and that they can
then disappear into the ether.

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:52.740 align:middle line:84%
So this is what
we see with UFOs.

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:56.018 align:middle line:84%
And it's also what hundreds
and hundreds of witnesses,

00:17:56.018 --> 00:17:58.560 align:middle line:84%
probably a lot more than that,
but just hundreds that we know

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.810 align:middle line:90%
about have seen Bigfoot do.

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:02.560 align:middle line:84%
I can't count the
number of times

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.270 align:middle line:84%
I've had a witness
tell us we saw

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:08.080 align:middle line:84%
Bigfoot walk behind a tree
and totally dematerialize.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:11.680 align:middle line:84%
Stan Gordon reports on
a woman in Pennsylvania

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:15.640 align:middle line:84%
who heard a creature trying
to bang down her front door.

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.920 align:middle line:84%
She opens the door
with her shotgun.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.450 align:middle line:84%
There's a Bigfoot
standing there.

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:20.410 align:middle line:90%
She shoots it.

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:22.840 align:middle line:84%
It dematerializes
right in front of her.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you have one
person saying that,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.140 align:middle line:90%
maybe they're crazy.

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:28.570 align:middle line:84%
But when you've got hundreds
and hundreds of people

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:31.425 align:middle line:84%
giving the same kind of details,
I take that really seriously.

00:18:31.425 --> 00:18:38.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So when we have
sightings of UFOs that--

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:42.070 align:middle line:84%
I've had myself personally and
so have you and so has Josh.

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:45.460 align:middle line:84%
But where something
just appears in the sky

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.750 align:middle line:84%
and disappears in the
sky in front of you,

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:49.510 align:middle line:84%
when you turn around
and try to tell

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:51.850 align:middle line:84%
somebody what you
have just witnessed,

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:54.190 align:middle line:90%
you do sound a little crazy.

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And then you apply that
to the Bigfoot phenomena,

00:18:57.310 --> 00:19:01.720 align:middle line:84%
that's like saying my brother
was running across the living

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.670 align:middle line:84%
room, and he
disappeared, and then

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:05.260 align:middle line:84%
he reappeared right
in front of me.

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:09.890 align:middle line:84%
You can't repeat that story
even if it's what you just saw.

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like we're talking
about the same phenomenon that

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.995 align:middle line:84%
is also being spoken
about in the FBI document.

00:19:15.995 --> 00:19:17.100 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I always try
to read the room before I

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:21.550 align:middle line:90%
start talking about this.

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:24.420 align:middle line:90%
But I find that when you--

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:26.340 align:middle line:84%
most of the time,
when you start being

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:28.260 align:middle line:84%
open about your
experiences, you find

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.240 align:middle line:84%
that there's a lot
of people around you

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.880 align:middle line:84%
who've had similar
experiences who

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.900 align:middle line:84%
were afraid to speak up, but now
feel more comfortable doing so.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.510 align:middle line:84%
I think these experiences are
way more common than people

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:40.410 align:middle line:90%
suspect.

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's because of this weird
self-enforced code of silence

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:47.700 align:middle line:84%
we all have that we think that
this sort of thing is rare.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:49.197 align:middle line:90%
It's not rare at all.

00:19:49.197 --> 00:19:51.030 align:middle line:84%
I think the majority
of people have actually

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:52.485 align:middle line:84%
had some kind of
paranormal experience.

00:19:52.485 --> 00:19:53.285 align:middle line:90%
>> Agreed.

00:19:53.285 --> 00:19:57.185 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, is the world
ready for this?

00:19:57.185 --> 00:19:58.300 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm ready.

00:19:58.300 --> 00:19:59.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready for Bigfoot, Jimmy--

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you ready for Bigfoot
to take center stage like this,

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:04.390 align:middle line:90%
and can the world handle it?

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:06.030 align:middle line:90%
>> I live in Los Angeles.

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And if you mention Bigfoot,
and people roll their eyes.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:12.450 align:middle line:84%
But traveling the country,
everything between LA

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:15.540 align:middle line:84%
and New York to
make this film, I

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.450 align:middle line:84%
am just blown away by
every town we go to.

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:21.510 align:middle line:84%
There's Bigfoot
stickers in car windows.

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:23.100 align:middle line:84%
On the sides of
buildings, people

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.200 align:middle line:84%
have painted
Bigfoot silhouettes.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.800 align:middle line:84%
It's this huge part of
Americana, American culture,

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.950 align:middle line:84%
that I just had
no idea was there,

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:34.080 align:middle line:84%
as well as Native
American culture.

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:38.040 align:middle line:84%
You go to places
like Arizona and--

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.820 align:middle line:84%
we spent a lot of
time in Alaska,

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:44.190 align:middle line:84%
which has a very open and
celebrated Native American

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:45.190 align:middle line:90%
culture.

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's just extraordinary
how front and center

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:49.620 align:middle line:90%
the Bigfoot stuff is.

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you see any
footprints yourself?

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:54.750 align:middle line:84%
What did you see as
you were traveling?

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:58.830 align:middle line:84%
I myself, I've seen a
set of Bigfoot prints,

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:00.510 align:middle line:90%
and it's well documented.

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And I cannot forget the chill as
I looked at something that deep

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.870 align:middle line:84%
into the hard packed
Earth that's this big.

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:15.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at my feet, and
I'm thinking the size of me,

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm not making a
dent in this dirt.

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:21.340 align:middle line:84%
So what made this,
and how big was it?

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, four prints,
nothing before, nothing after.

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:28.540 align:middle line:90%
Did you see any footprints?

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Not in the
wild, but we have--

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:32.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Not in the wild?

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:33.440 align:middle line:90%
What, just in the city?

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.240 align:middle line:90%
What is it--

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, well, we've met with a
number of researchers who have

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:40.370 align:middle line:84%
taken casts of these
prints in the wild.

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:44.770 align:middle line:84%
So we got to examine those
and interview those people.

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:49.570 align:middle line:84%
We haven't encountered
a Bigfoot ourselves

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:52.700 align:middle line:90%
that we managed to capture yet.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.300 align:middle line:84%
But we have had some
spooky experiences.

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.580 align:middle line:84%
We were in Wellsville,
New York, which

00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:59.350 align:middle line:84%
is right on the
Pennsylvania border.

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And we were in the middle of the
wilderness with our guide who--

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.870 align:middle line:84%
a guy named Todd,
who's been capturing

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:08.970 align:middle line:84%
a lot of orb footage
in association

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:10.590 align:middle line:90%
with his Bigfoot sightings.

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And our camera crew suddenly
hears this loud yawn right

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:17.250 align:middle line:90%
behind them.

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And we are in the
middle of nowhere.

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.090 align:middle line:90%
There is nobody around.

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And then our cameras
start shutting off.

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:27.910 align:middle line:90%
The batteries seem to drain.

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that's
a consistent theme with lots

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:33.400 align:middle line:84%
of different paranormal
investigations.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:37.570 align:middle line:84%
You have ghost hunters who will
experience this, UFO hunters.

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:41.500 align:middle line:84%
We've experienced it on the
set of our UFO documentaries

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.660 align:middle line:90%
with certain individuals.

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:47.090 align:middle line:84%
They'll step onto a set, and
the cameras just shut down.

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:49.450 align:middle line:84%
They either overheat or
the batteries will drain.

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:53.260 align:middle line:84%
So our director of photography
on this film-- his name

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:56.050 align:middle line:84%
is Clifton Stommel,
really brilliant guy

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:58.990 align:middle line:84%
who's invented a lot of
technology for Black magic.

00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:04.240 align:middle line:84%
He had a theory that it's
not the batteries that are

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:08.080 align:middle line:84%
draining, that instead, it's
these big EMF fields that are

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.350 align:middle line:84%
coming either from the Bigfoot
or from the UFO that are

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:15.430 align:middle line:84%
causing high levels
of resistance inside

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:20.020 align:middle line:84%
the electronics, which makes the
device think that the battery

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:21.610 align:middle line:84%
is drained when
it actually isn't.

00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:24.880 align:middle line:84%
So to test this, we
modified our equipment,

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:28.370 align:middle line:84%
and we were using these
external battery packs that over

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:30.500 align:middle line:90%
provide power to the device.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:34.170 align:middle line:84%
And they give more range
of voltage internally.

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And this way, the battery
can overcome any resistance.

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And our cameras
stopped shutting off.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:43.070 align:middle line:84%
So our little
experiment worked and--

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:44.750 align:middle line:84%
so this is a little
tip for the rest

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:46.430 align:middle line:90%
of the paranormal community.

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:48.920 align:middle line:84%
If you're out there
trying to capture stuff,

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.110 align:middle line:84%
it's not that your
batteries are draining.

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:52.880 align:middle line:84%
We don't think
that's what it is.

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:56.480 align:middle line:84%
It's these big EMF fields, and
there is a workaround for it.

00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:02.390 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the Bigfoot community
going to do when we do have

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:05.960 align:middle line:84%
the flying saucer land
on the 405 Freeway,

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:11.180 align:middle line:84%
the White House lawn, and
it's Sasquatch that steps off,

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:14.855 align:middle line:90%
and not a little Alien Gray?

00:24:14.855 --> 00:24:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm not sure.

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:18.890 align:middle line:84%
Michael Schratt, who I
believe was a mutual friend

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:20.810 align:middle line:84%
of ours and an
amazing researcher,

00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:24.830 align:middle line:84%
he has a couple cases in his
archive with credible witnesses

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:29.210 align:middle line:84%
actually seeing a flying saucer
land and a Bigfoot step off.

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:32.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, to me, that
doesn't necessarily

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:34.970 align:middle line:84%
mean that Bigfoot is
an extraterrestrial.

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:37.580 align:middle line:84%
I still think that
it fits into more

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.320 align:middle line:84%
of the interdimensional
hypothesis,

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.210 align:middle line:90%
but I can't possibly know.

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:43.040 align:middle line:84%
It's just that I have
to go with my gut.

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:46.970 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of how will
the Bigfoot community react,

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:49.700 align:middle line:90%
your guess is as good as mine.

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:55.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Is Bigfoot a positive thing?

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:58.490 align:middle line:84%
Are there negative
aspects to Bigfoot?

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:02.300 align:middle line:84%
>> So some of the Native
Americans who we've interviewed

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:05.870 align:middle line:84%
believe that there
is a negative aspect.

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:07.760 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
tribes that regard

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:10.310 align:middle line:84%
Bigfoot as a cannibal,
which is interesting.

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:12.560 align:middle line:84%
The word cannibal is interesting
because that suggests

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:15.800 align:middle line:84%
that it's human or
related to humans, which

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.960 align:middle line:84%
is a whole other aspect
to this that we're

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.520 align:middle line:90%
exploring in this film.

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:23.150 align:middle line:84%
But as far as I can tell
and with all the research

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:25.190 align:middle line:84%
we've done in cases
we've reviewed,

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:29.060 align:middle line:84%
I can't find one confirmed
credible case of a Bigfoot

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:30.590 align:middle line:90%
harming a human being.

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:32.990 align:middle line:90%
They seem to not like us.

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:37.520 align:middle line:84%
They will do things to scare
us off like throw rocks,

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:41.660 align:middle line:84%
but they've never hurt
somebody as far as I can tell.

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know about
you, but you got cameras.

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:45.680 align:middle line:90%
You're going across the country.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:47.357 align:middle line:90%
Surely, you've seen something.

00:25:47.357 --> 00:25:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so Michael, what's some
of the best evidence you have

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:51.060 align:middle line:90%
in this film?

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, for me personally,
the thing that really struck

00:25:55.660 --> 00:26:01.150 align:middle line:84%
a nerve was the audio that
we've acquired from Ron Morehead

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:02.770 align:middle line:90%
and from Scott Nelson.

00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:06.835 align:middle line:84%
Ron Morehead famously recorded
the Sierra Sounds with--

00:26:06.835 --> 00:26:09.640 align:middle line:90%
>> The Samurai arguments?

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.080 align:middle line:90%
>> It's what it sounds like.

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And there's some really
chilling howling in there.

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And we interviewed a guy
named Scott Nelson, who

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.430 align:middle line:90%
is a linguistic expert.

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:24.730 align:middle line:84%
He used to be a Russian
translator for the military

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:25.990 align:middle line:90%
during the Cold War.

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:28.300 align:middle line:90%
So he's an expert in languages.

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And in our film, he
breaks down how this is

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:34.510 align:middle line:90%
a language that's being spoken.

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And you can find
structure in it,

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:40.030 align:middle line:84%
but it's being spoken
very, very quickly.

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And we interviewed Ron Morehead
about the Sierra Sounds.

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And he shared with us that
during that expedition,

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:55.310 align:middle line:84%
they were experiencing their
car doors being opened and shut

00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:57.440 align:middle line:90%
and just slammed by something.

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:01.190 align:middle line:84%
And what we've learned
in making this film is

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:04.940 align:middle line:84%
it's very common apparently
for Bigfoot hunters

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:07.880 align:middle line:84%
to return to their
vehicles and find the doors

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:10.400 align:middle line:84%
all opened up on a car
that's been locked.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And this actually happened
to us in Tennessee.

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And we're traveling
around with about $100,000

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.440 align:middle line:90%
worth of film equipment.

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:21.140 align:middle line:84%
So we keep our Van
totally locked.

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And we walked back to
our van after lunch,

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:25.700 align:middle line:90%
and all the doors were open.

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:27.200 align:middle line:90%
All the equipment was there.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.470 align:middle line:84%
No one had broken into it,
but all the doors were open.

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And for us, that
just totally gave

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:36.230 align:middle line:84%
us chills that this was a sign
from Bigfoot to say, yeah,

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:37.550 align:middle line:90%
we know what you're up to.

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>> We're not-- have you seen the
videos of black bears opening

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:44.030 align:middle line:90%
up cars, opening up front doors?

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And they don't even
have opposing thumbs.

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:49.410 align:middle line:84%
So I would assume Bigfoot
could do that quite easily.

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:51.260 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't sound
like a surprise.

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:54.500 align:middle line:84%
But what would surprise
me is DNA evidence.

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:57.200 align:middle line:84%
I've done a lot of interviews
with different Bigfoot

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.310 align:middle line:90%
researchers.

00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And every time I
say the words, well,

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:05.028 align:middle line:84%
but there's a lack
of DNA evidence,

00:28:05.028 --> 00:28:07.070 align:middle line:84%
and then I get the
counterargument, well, there's

00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:08.720 align:middle line:90%
lots of DNA evidence.

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:09.980 align:middle line:90%
What did you find?

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:14.750 align:middle line:84%
>> So Scott Carpenter, the
researcher who shot the portal

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:18.890 align:middle line:84%
that we just discussed, he
wrote an amazing book about

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:24.770 align:middle line:84%
the famous DNA study on Bigfoot
that Dave Paulides was also

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:26.060 align:middle line:90%
involved in.

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And Jeff Meldrum
has criticized it.

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And you could always
find an expert

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:37.950 align:middle line:84%
on either side to make whatever
case you're looking for.

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:42.800 align:middle line:84%
But it seems to me that this
thing was really compelling.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And they found human DNA on
the mother's side and unknown

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:52.820 align:middle line:84%
on the father's side, which
is very unusual that you're

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:56.210 align:middle line:84%
going to have a sample
that doesn't match anything

00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:59.750 align:middle line:84%
in any of our worldwide
database of DNA.

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:01.430 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of weird.

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Michael Mazzola, thank
you so much, my friend.

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:06.320 align:middle line:90%
Great conversation.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.000 align:middle line:90%
And there you go.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.590 align:middle line:90%
There's another Into the Vortex.

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:13.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host Jimmy Church,
and we'll see you next time.

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:17.000 align:middle line:90%
