00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm radio and television
host Jimmy Church.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And I am here to uncover
the truth about some

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.660 align:middle line:90%
of life's biggest mysteries.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.230 align:middle line:84%
If this is revealed,
everything has to be rewritten.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.060 align:middle line:10%
My guest today is Wendy
Kennedy, a channeler

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.940 align:middle line:10%
and a spiritual teacher
renowned for her connection

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.240 align:middle line:10%
to the 9D Pleiadian
Collective who serves

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.120 align:middle line:10%
as a conduit for their wisdom.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.090 align:middle line:84%
>> We call 2019 to
2026 frequency wars,

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.510 align:middle line:90%
and you're in the middle of it.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And this will help you
as you come into more

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.030 align:middle line:90%
of a Galactic community.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.720 align:middle line:84%
>> As always MUFON Field
Investigator Josh--

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.300 align:middle line:90%
Josh, can you pull up the map?

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.250 align:middle line:10%
>> --joins us to
help set the scene.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Join us as we dive deep to
get to the bottom of some

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.810 align:middle line:84%
of the most intriguing
questions of our time.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.280 align:middle line:84%
>> It will take another probably
about 18 months or so for more

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.180 align:middle line:90%
information to start coming out.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.670 align:middle line:84%
But right now when
we look at it,

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.005 align:middle line:84%
most likely 2026 will be
the year of direct contact.

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:15.278 align:middle line:90%

00:01:15.278 --> 00:01:25.050 align:middle line:90%


00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome to "Into the Vortex."

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host Jimmy Church.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm here with Josh.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And today, we're going
to talk channeling

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.980 align:middle line:90%
with Wendy Kennedy, our guest.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And before we get
into this, this

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.730 align:middle line:84%
is going to be a
heavy show, Josh.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.900 align:middle line:84%
When you think about
channeling-- we've all seen it

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.660 align:middle line:84%
and wondered about it--
what goes through your mind?

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.020 align:middle line:90%
Is this something that is real?

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.360 align:middle line:90%
Is it something else going on?

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.490 align:middle line:84%
Or is it a direct communication
to something off planet?

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:55.290 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there's a lot
of charlatans out there,

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.200 align:middle line:90%
but it's definitely real.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And I know today, we
have a very special guest

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.653 align:middle line:84%
that is a profound channel
and an inspiration.

00:02:02.653 --> 00:02:03.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm really excited about it.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.903 align:middle line:90%
So I think it's 100% REAL.

00:02:04.903 --> 00:02:06.600 align:middle line:90%
>> So, Wendy, welcome.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.980 align:middle line:84%
Let me start with this, what's
your definition of channeling?

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.170 align:middle line:84%
>> To me, it's bringing
in energy and putting it

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.790 align:middle line:90%
into a recognizable form.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.950 align:middle line:10%
So the source of that energy
can be people who've passed.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:21.970 align:middle line:90%
It can be source energy.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.350 align:middle line:90%
It can be guides.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.280 align:middle line:84%
It can be anything
that's creative.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.480 align:middle line:90%
It can be source itself.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And then the form can be direct
channeling, automatic writing,

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.220 align:middle line:90%
dancing, singing, art.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.530 align:middle line:84%
So there are lots of ways
that we channel energy.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.720 align:middle line:10%
And to me, it's kind
of a broad definition.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm not really a stickler
to say, oh, well, channeling

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.100 align:middle line:90%
is different than mediumship.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.560 align:middle line:10%
Any creative expression is
a form of channeling to me.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm sure that
the story is long.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.150 align:middle line:84%
So I want the short
version of it, if we can.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.800 align:middle line:84%
Was there a moment when you
went, oh my goodness, something

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.960 align:middle line:84%
is reaching out to
me and you found out

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.250 align:middle line:90%
that you had this ability?

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.140 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, I started having
visions and I didn't know what

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.940 align:middle line:10%
they were.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.230 align:middle line:84%
So I was researching
those, and along the way

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.317 align:middle line:90%
I came across channeling.

00:03:06.317 --> 00:03:07.400 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what it was.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.510 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know
anybody who did it.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.260 align:middle line:84%
I just knew I was
supposed to be doing it.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260 align:middle line:84%
It was something it was
a deep hole within me.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
doing some research

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.290 align:middle line:84%
on that, found a couple
of books with exercises,

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.460 align:middle line:90%
and it took me about a year.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And I started with
automatic writing.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And then about a year later, I
was hearing it well in advance.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.520 align:middle line:10%
And so they said, it's time
to put down the pen and just

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.420 align:middle line:10%
direct channel.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.760 align:middle line:10%
And then when I did
that, that's when

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.857 align:middle line:10%
my guides that I
work with publicly

00:03:33.857 --> 00:03:35.690 align:middle line:10%
came through the ninth
dimensional Pleiadian

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:36.590 align:middle line:10%
collective.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there an offworld ET
component to this that you

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.530 align:middle line:90%
recognize?

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>> It can be a lot
of different things.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.770 align:middle line:90%
It might just be source energy.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.020 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's hard to
label exactly what you're

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.820 align:middle line:90%
bringing in.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:49.642 align:middle line:90%
We do our best.

00:03:49.642 --> 00:03:51.350 align:middle line:84%
Just like meeting
somebody on the street,

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.660 align:middle line:84%
we have to take the
word who they are

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.890 align:middle line:90%
or who they present to be.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.680 align:middle line:90%
So sometimes it's ETs.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.890 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes they're more angelic.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.720 align:middle line:84%
But for me, my
personal experience

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.870 align:middle line:84%
I work with different beings
from different star systems,

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.770 align:middle line:84%
my own angelic
guides, and that's

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.360 align:middle line:90%
kind of where my focus has been.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.130 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's
different for everybody

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.900 align:middle line:84%
depending in part on
their belief system

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.480 align:middle line:84%
and how the guides present
themselves for them.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Does the process of a reverse
itself where they reach out

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.600 align:middle line:90%
to you?

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>> They're pretty respectful of
my boundaries because I think

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.925 align:middle line:84%
if they were constantly
knocking at my door,

00:04:28.925 --> 00:04:31.010 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't be very receptive.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.570 align:middle line:90%
That's not my personality.

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.540 align:middle line:84%
So they wait for me to ask
questions a lot of times.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.530 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they'll kind of give
me nudges and repeated patterns

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.330 align:middle line:90%
and things.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say, OK, I need
to sit down and check in.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.800 align:middle line:84%
But they're pretty
respectful with me.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.650 align:middle line:84%
>> When we talk about higher
dimensional consciousness,

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.080 align:middle line:84%
clarify that for me
and for everybody else,

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.502 align:middle line:84%
what exactly are
we talking about?

00:04:55.502 --> 00:04:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm just talking about
a consciousness that exists

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.300 align:middle line:90%
in a higher frequency range.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.700 align:middle line:84%
So dimensions are
just frequency ranges.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And then dimensions
have different sets

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:05.692 align:middle line:90%
of rules to them.

00:05:05.692 --> 00:05:06.650 align:middle line:90%
So you can play a game.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.540 align:middle line:84%
It's like playing
football or basketball.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And they say different
beings will define dimensions

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.063 align:middle line:84%
differently depending
on their belief system

00:05:17.063 --> 00:05:18.980 align:middle line:84%
or whatever system they're
using to define it.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.550 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of the day,
it's just a range of frequency

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.110 align:middle line:90%
that gets that label.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.260 align:middle line:10%
And as we go into
a different range,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.330 align:middle line:10%
then we have different rules.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.370 align:middle line:90%
>> When you finish--

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use the word
communication, channeling,

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.600 align:middle line:84%
when you finish, do you remember
or do you have to write it down

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.470 align:middle line:90%
or record it?

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.430 align:middle line:84%
Or is this consciously
stored and you can recall?

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.080 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, it's
like a lucid dream.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.150 align:middle line:90%
So I'm semi conscious.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm aware of what's happening.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.930 align:middle line:84%
I may not know in advance of
the words that are coming out,

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.140 align:middle line:90%
but it's also very rich to me.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:59.345 align:middle line:84%
So I might say it's a
nice day, but I also

00:05:59.345 --> 00:06:01.220 align:middle line:84%
know it's 70 degrees,
there's a light breeze,

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.570 align:middle line:84%
the birds are chirping,
the grass is green.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.207 align:middle line:84%
So there's all this
other information,

00:06:04.207 --> 00:06:06.290 align:middle line:84%
which is why I think when
you were saying you hear

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.600 align:middle line:84%
channeling, you know
it sounds different

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.690 align:middle line:84%
because we're picking up all of
this other information subtly.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.430 align:middle line:84%
So for me, if I want
to remember something,

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.480 align:middle line:84%
I do the automatic writing
because it does pull it

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.990 align:middle line:84%
in a more physical way for
me, which makes it easier

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.890 align:middle line:90%
for me to remember.

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.893 align:middle line:10%
Otherwise, it's
kind of in and out

00:06:23.893 --> 00:06:25.310 align:middle line:10%
unless it's a piece
of information

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.080 align:middle line:10%
that I really need to remember.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.050 align:middle line:10%
But they have a habit of going
through things again and again

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:35.756 align:middle line:10%
and again just so
we really get it.

00:06:35.756 --> 00:06:37.760 align:middle line:84%
>> When we see
somebody's channel,

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.270 align:middle line:84%
especially the good
channelers that are out there,

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.990 align:middle line:90%
it looks fun.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.500 align:middle line:84%
It looks like it's
something that everybody

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.790 align:middle line:90%
would love to be able to do.

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:49.910 align:middle line:90%
Can anybody channel?

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:50.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.860 align:middle line:90%
And we do channel.

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.153 align:middle line:84%
I love it when people will
open up and start channeling.

00:06:55.153 --> 00:06:56.820 align:middle line:84%
They have no idea
that they're doing it.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.400 align:middle line:84%
They're just bringing
in higher information

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.650 align:middle line:90%
because the frequency changes.

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:00.920 align:middle line:90%
You can sense it.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.810 align:middle line:90%
But we all have the ability.

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.625 align:middle line:84%
It's just like all of us being
able to play an instrument.

00:07:05.625 --> 00:07:07.250 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to do
that for our living?

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.600 align:middle line:90%
Are we going to be a virtuoso?

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.910 align:middle line:84%
No, but we can
still do it for fun.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.220 align:middle line:84%
We can gain access to
higher information.

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And it just requires
practice and repetition.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:21.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there trickster,
trickster information coming

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:26.840 align:middle line:84%
in where you have to use
discernment and somebody may be

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:32.726 align:middle line:84%
messing with you and then you
have to figure out what is

00:07:32.726 --> 00:07:33.590 align:middle line:90%
trustworthy?

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And my guides were really
big on using discernment.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.950 align:middle line:84%
How does this resonate with
me and checking in with me

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.490 align:middle line:84%
and not just taking
it at their word?

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And I learned very early
on when the energy would

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.720 align:middle line:84%
shift because I was very
fortunate to work with two

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.920 align:middle line:90%
other women who channeled.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.300 align:middle line:90%
And for us, it was like play.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.890 align:middle line:90%
We get together every day.

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:57.620 align:middle line:10%
One of us would be channeling,
one would ask the question,

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.800 align:middle line:10%
and the odd man out would
get to listen and check in.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.460 align:middle line:84%
So when the person channeling
was saying the same thing

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:09.600 align:middle line:84%
that you were hearing, it was
very easy to get confirmation.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And I learned very quickly,
but we noticed all of a sudden

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:13.280 align:middle line:90%
the energy would shift.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And it was like, did
anybody notice that?

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And so it was much easier
when there were three of us

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.620 align:middle line:84%
because oh, yeah,
it is different.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:23.530 align:middle line:10%
And so it made it much--

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:27.483 align:middle line:10%
it was a much quicker
way to learn to recognize

00:08:27.483 --> 00:08:28.650 align:middle line:10%
when the energy would shift.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think this happens
to people when they first

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:31.890 align:middle line:90%
start to channel.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's not to
scare somebody off,

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.380 align:middle line:84%
but it's to learn what
your own energy feels,

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:40.440 align:middle line:84%
where are you vibrating,
and what are your own fears.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.350 align:middle line:90%
>> A test maybe?

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, because if you're
holding a lot of fear

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:46.900 align:middle line:84%
in your energetic field,
they can connect with that.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And as you go up, as you
clear out your own judgments,

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:53.400 align:middle line:84%
you increase your own
frequency, that stops happening.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.610 align:middle line:84%
You close those access
points in essence.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.160 align:middle line:84%
So that happened to
me a lot early on.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.700 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't happen so much today.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:01.500 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.690 align:middle line:90%
So let's dive deep a little bit.

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:08.970 align:middle line:84%
Because it is so mainstream now,
who is visiting this planet?

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And do you channel and ask those
questions about who is here

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:15.270 align:middle line:90%
today?

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:16.830 align:middle line:90%
Do you have that information?

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:19.500 align:middle line:10%
>> So they say there are a
lot of beings here today,

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.340 align:middle line:10%
a lot of hybrid projects going
on, not all with humanity,

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:27.690 align:middle line:10%
a lot with the other life forms
on the planet because Earth is

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:28.860 align:middle line:10%
a grand experiment.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:32.510 align:middle line:84%
It had thousands of worlds worth
of genetic material donated

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:33.310 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:35.610 align:middle line:84%
So that's why a
lot of these beings

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.730 align:middle line:84%
are here working with
the life in our oceans

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:40.410 align:middle line:84%
and some of the
terrestrial life.

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:45.300 align:middle line:84%
>> The amount and the varied
species that are visited,

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.950 align:middle line:84%
it's got to be an
infinite number.

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:48.390 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, it is.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:51.330 align:middle line:84%
I think we have this idea
that there are the Nordics

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.420 align:middle line:84%
and there the reptilians,
but there's so

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.010 align:middle line:90%
many species who are present.

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And some of them just are
not interested in what

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.920 align:middle line:84%
humanity is doing as much
as some of the other--

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.370 align:middle line:90%
specifically the aquatic life.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:05.790 align:middle line:84%
The guides were talking
about that recently

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.590 align:middle line:84%
with some of the
Dolphins and the whales

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:09.382 align:middle line:84%
and how they are working
and communicating.

00:10:09.382 --> 00:10:11.860 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:13.740 align:middle line:90%
>> What is 9D?

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:17.192 align:middle line:90%
Is 9D just four better than 5D?

00:10:17.192 --> 00:10:19.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the first thing they
say is all the dimensions are

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:20.170 align:middle line:90%
different.

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:20.970 align:middle line:90%
They're not better.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:21.928 align:middle line:90%
They're just different.

00:10:21.928 --> 00:10:23.610 align:middle line:84%
It's like basketball
or football.

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:26.400 align:middle line:90%
And it's non-physical.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:32.460 align:middle line:84%
So they describe three through
seven as being more physical,

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.947 align:middle line:84%
and they get lighter
in density in terms

00:10:34.947 --> 00:10:36.030 align:middle line:90%
of the physical structure.

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:39.180 align:middle line:84%
But 9 and up they're
just beings of light.

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:43.800 align:middle line:10%
So they're aligned
with a stellar body

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.540 align:middle line:10%
rather than incarnating
to a planet.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:48.900 align:middle line:84%
So they align with Alcyone
in the Pleiadian star system.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And they're record
keepers of sorts the group

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:52.020 align:middle line:90%
that I work with.

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And they also monitor
timelines just

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:57.720 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that there's
not too much corruption

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.590 align:middle line:90%
of timelines.

00:10:58.590 --> 00:10:59.640 align:middle line:90%
So they maintain that.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.200 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of
keepers of timelines.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:06.060 align:middle line:84%
>> We can't be the only planet
and species that they're doing

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.200 align:middle line:90%
this with, right?

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.850 align:middle line:90%
This is universal.

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:10.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>> The Pleiadian star
system, which sits up there

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:16.200 align:middle line:84%
and it's so great
when you see it,

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.530 align:middle line:84%
ancient cultures had to
notice that too as well.

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:21.763 align:middle line:84%
You look up in the sky,
and you see the sisters

00:11:21.763 --> 00:11:23.430 align:middle line:84%
and they're there and
they're beautiful,

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:25.380 align:middle line:90%
and they're grouped together.

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:29.640 align:middle line:84%
Did ancient cultures
here on this planet

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.530 align:middle line:90%
have that same communication?

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:33.150 align:middle line:90%
Were they able to channel?

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:36.450 align:middle line:84%
Did they recognize the
energy coming from there?

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:38.160 align:middle line:10%
>> I think they were
Pleiadians here.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.710 align:middle line:84%
I think they had a more
direct interaction,

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:44.740 align:middle line:84%
and they knew that they were
also seeded from the Pleiades.

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:47.620 align:middle line:84%
So I think some of
the ancient monuments

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.660 align:middle line:84%
that we have are aligned
with the Pleiades.

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.820 align:middle line:10%
And they act like antenna,
which make it easier

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:53.110 align:middle line:10%
to connect with that system.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:54.940 align:middle line:10%
>> Do you have an
example of that?

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:57.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Not off the top of my
head because some of that,

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.847 align:middle line:10%
like I said, it's a
bit of lucid dreams.

00:11:59.847 --> 00:12:01.930 align:middle line:84%
So I'd have to go back and
look into some of that.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:05.350 align:middle line:84%
But they're saying that
some of the monuments

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:07.150 align:middle line:90%
are aligned with the Pleiades.

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, is the 9D evolutionary?

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:16.480 align:middle line:84%
In other words, will we be
energy beings in 10,000 years?

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.150 align:middle line:84%
Would we even
recognize ourselves?

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:20.890 align:middle line:10%
>> So, yes.

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:24.190 align:middle line:84%
So we're changing our
physical structure,

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:25.720 align:middle line:84%
and we will eventually
move through

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:29.110 align:middle line:84%
that as we stay with the
progression of Earth.

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:30.725 align:middle line:84%
But there are
aspects of ourselves

00:12:30.725 --> 00:12:32.350 align:middle line:84%
that are already
beings of light having

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:35.710 align:middle line:84%
those experiences because past,
present, and future are one.

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:37.170 align:middle line:90%
It's all concurrent.

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:39.670 align:middle line:84%
But they say we're definitely
going through physical changes

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:40.470 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And that will continue as we
become stewards for the planet.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, we will become
stewards for the Galaxy.

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:49.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, what would be our role?

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:52.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, what's our role in
this Galactic community?

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.180 align:middle line:90%
And what are the expectations?

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And are we adult enough
to have that seat?

00:12:57.930 --> 00:12:59.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, we're getting there.

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:02.610 align:middle line:84%
We're learning right now because
this is an advanced school.

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:06.000 align:middle line:84%
This is a school of
mastery of duality,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.270 align:middle line:84%
integration of duality,
releasing judgments.

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:11.680 align:middle line:10%
So as we go through
that process,

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.330 align:middle line:10%
we are able to access
high levels of compassion.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And they say that is our
gift to the universe.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And even though they can access
the frequency of compassion,

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:25.140 align:middle line:84%
it's a much different
experience where we are

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.390 align:middle line:90%
because it's so difficult here.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.160 align:middle line:90%
The frequencies are so dense.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And we've all had
those lower experiences

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:37.140 align:middle line:84%
that when we come across
someone else who is struggling,

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.920 align:middle line:84%
we're able to access compassion
in a much stronger way.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:45.360 align:middle line:84%
So the bandwidth of compassion
that we access is more intense.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And they say that is the gift
that we bring to the universe

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:53.860 align:middle line:84%
because it will help those
who perhaps don't run

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.800 align:middle line:84%
a lot of emotion to
start accessing some

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.460 align:middle line:84%
of that compassion because there
are some beings who are running

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:03.833 align:middle line:84%
some hybrid programs and
experience and experiments who

00:14:03.833 --> 00:14:06.250 align:middle line:84%
don't have a lot of compassion,
who aren't really thinking

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:11.410 align:middle line:84%
about the ramifications of
what's going on when they do

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:14.770 align:middle line:84%
these experiments and people are
left with all of this baggage.

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:19.400 align:middle line:84%
So it helps them
to grow and mature.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.120 align:middle line:84%
So it has this massive ripple
effect through the universe

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.020 align:middle line:90%
when we go through this process.

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>> But let's-- you
want to do this?

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:27.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's do it.

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:28.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited.

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:29.060 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm nervous.

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:29.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Me too.

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:30.308 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't get nervous.

00:14:30.308 --> 00:14:31.570 align:middle line:90%
--weird energy right now.

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:33.610 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:36.073 align:middle line:90%
Let me know when it's OK to--

00:14:36.073 --> 00:14:37.240 align:middle line:90%
>> You can go ahead and ask.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.115 align:middle line:90%
>> I have permission?

00:14:38.115 --> 00:14:39.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:39.550 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:40.350 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you.

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:44.260 align:middle line:10%
Who am I speaking with?

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:45.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, hello, dear.

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:47.925 align:middle line:84%
This is the 9th dimensional
Pleiadian Collective.

00:14:47.925 --> 00:14:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And it is a pleasure
and an honor

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.130 align:middle line:84%
to have the opportunity
to connect with you.

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:55.840 align:middle line:84%
So let us just
say that there are

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.790 align:middle line:84%
many people who have
lots of questions,

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:00.790 align:middle line:90%
and you're thinking about yours.

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:02.830 align:middle line:84%
But know that your guides
hear your questions,

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:05.163 align:middle line:84%
and they'll put the information
in your energetic field.

00:15:05.163 --> 00:15:08.110 align:middle line:84%
So all your questions are
heard and always answered.

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:09.520 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter
of whether you

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:11.870 align:middle line:84%
are tuned in to the frequency
and the volume's up.

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.870 align:middle line:84%
All right, so what would
you like to know about?

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:17.190 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm a talking
head in the media.

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:21.030 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of responsibility
to the information

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:22.320 align:middle line:90%
that I share.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:29.100 align:middle line:84%
Is our media on this
planet handling ET contact

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:31.500 align:middle line:90%
and disclosure responsibly?

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it depends on whether
you're talking about mainstream

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:36.690 align:middle line:84%
or whether you're talking
about alternative.

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:39.300 align:middle line:84%
But there are some,
yes, who are very

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.960 align:middle line:84%
respectful of it, who are
doing their best to share

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:42.760 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.330 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot that's just
being hidden from you frankly.

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And also a lot of
interaction that's

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.940 align:middle line:84%
already happening with
ETs that is happening

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:54.280 align:middle line:84%
on the personal level, not so
much in the bigger way, that's

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.080 align:middle line:90%
coming.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:58.140 align:middle line:84%
The next two years are going to
be really interesting for you

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:01.380 align:middle line:84%
as you go through some
of this transition.

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:04.590 align:middle line:84%
There are deadlines that
ETs have kind of made

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:06.840 align:middle line:84%
with your governments
that disclosure

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.170 align:middle line:90%
needs to start happening.

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why you're
seeing some of this.

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.510 align:middle line:84%
They've been given
the opportunity

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:17.340 align:middle line:84%
to present their
narrative, if you will.

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:20.547 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, some of
these ETs are going

00:16:20.547 --> 00:16:22.380 align:middle line:84%
to start taking matters
into their own hands

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:24.480 align:middle line:84%
because it does have
a massive impact

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.132 align:middle line:84%
to the rest of the universe
this developmental process.

00:16:27.132 --> 00:16:28.590 align:middle line:84%
So there's only so
far that they'll

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:33.100 align:middle line:84%
allow the game to go to the
darker edge, if you will.

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And you're already
seeing it swing back.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:37.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And thank you
for answering that.

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:39.810 align:middle line:90%
I have another question.

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:45.860 align:middle line:84%
What is the difference
between the 9D Collective

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:50.540 align:middle line:84%
and the other Pleiadian
information that others

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:53.150 align:middle line:90%
claim to channel and receive?

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:56.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the Pleiadian star
system is an open cluster

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:57.860 align:middle line:90%
of about 750 stars.

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And there are about
350 inhabited planets,

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:04.230 align:middle line:90%
high civilization planets.

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:06.290 align:middle line:90%
So it's quite vast.

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:08.510 align:middle line:90%
And that's the physical.

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:11.329 align:middle line:90%
We're talking 5D, 350 in 5D.

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:14.270 align:middle line:90%
So it's a very vast system.

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:16.315 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot of
beings just showing up

00:17:16.315 --> 00:17:18.440 align:middle line:84%
presenting their perspective
and their information.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:22.160 align:middle line:84%
So we go by the 9th Dimensional
Pleiadian Collective.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.800 align:middle line:84%
It's a way of
defining who we are.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And there are other beings
from that star system

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.180 align:middle line:84%
who have their own
wisdom to share,

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:31.160 align:middle line:90%
their own perspective to share.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And here's the thing
about channeling,

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.600 align:middle line:84%
our information
that we present is

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.410 align:middle line:90%
colored through our experience.

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And as Wendy translates
the frequencies,

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:41.760 align:middle line:90%
it's colored by her experience.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And as you experience
the information,

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:47.460 align:middle line:84%
it's colored by
your information,

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.360 align:middle line:90%
your experiences of life.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:52.320 align:middle line:84%
So there is some coloring
that often happens.

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And the clearer the channel is,
the clearer the information is.

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:59.010 align:middle line:84%
The clearer you are, the
clearer you can receive it.

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:01.560 align:middle line:84%
And even the information
that we are sharing it's

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.090 align:middle line:90%
going directly to you.

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:05.850 align:middle line:84%
Wendy's just making it
available to your mind

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:07.710 align:middle line:84%
as she translates
it into language,

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:10.350 align:middle line:84%
but the raw data is presented
in your energetic field.

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:13.960 align:middle line:84%
So it's just a
different perspective.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.980 align:middle line:84%
It would be like you
talking to somebody

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:19.530 align:middle line:84%
in Ireland about their
perspective and experience

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:22.200 align:middle line:90%
and somebody in the UK.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.350 align:middle line:84%
They're all earthlings,
they're all terrans,

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:28.523 align:middle line:84%
but they just have a
different perspective of life.

00:18:28.523 --> 00:18:29.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you for that.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.630 align:middle line:90%
Can I ask one more question?

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:32.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:37.020 align:middle line:84%
>> The disclosure that
is going to happen,

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:40.610 align:middle line:84%
is it out of the
government's control?

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:44.300 align:middle line:84%
Is it going to happen
anyway and they are only

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:46.247 align:middle line:84%
adapting to the
situation and trying

00:18:46.247 --> 00:18:47.330 align:middle line:90%
to get out in front of it?

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:48.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:50.390 align:middle line:84%
They were given a
deadline, and they

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:52.320 align:middle line:84%
could do what they wanted
up until that point.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that a
deadline can now be presented

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.577 align:middle line:84%
is that enough of
humanity is seeing

00:18:57.577 --> 00:18:59.660 align:middle line:84%
some of the corruption
that is going on the planet

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:01.670 align:middle line:84%
that they are taking
their power back.

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And that was one
of the things that

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.540 align:middle line:84%
needed to happen before
ETs could show up.

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:07.970 align:middle line:84%
You have to stand in your
power, because if you

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:10.310 align:middle line:84%
don't stand in your power
at the human-to-human level,

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:12.710 align:middle line:84%
you will not be able
to do it human to ET,

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:14.510 align:middle line:90%
human to the Galactic community.

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And that was paramount to
beings of the light who

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:22.010 align:middle line:84%
want you to stand in your power
to be stewards for your planet.

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:24.252 align:middle line:84%
So they were waiting
for this to happen.

00:19:24.252 --> 00:19:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And right now, you look out
at the state of the world

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:27.480 align:middle line:90%
and it seems a big mess.

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.772 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to break things
down to build things up.

00:19:29.772 --> 00:19:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to happen
very, very quickly.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.053 align:middle line:84%
As you start to break
some of this stuff down,

00:19:35.053 --> 00:19:37.470 align:middle line:84%
you will build rapidly because
your state of consciousness

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:39.420 align:middle line:84%
is now getting higher
and higher and higher.

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:42.100 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to thank the Palladian
Collective for answering these

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:42.900 align:middle line:90%
questions.

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:44.400 align:middle line:10%
I do have one more.

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:48.870 align:middle line:84%
Is humanity at
the point of being

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:53.610 align:middle line:84%
able to understand what
is about to be revealed?

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:55.270 align:middle line:90%
It's one thing to see it.

00:19:55.270 --> 00:20:01.050 align:middle line:84%
It's another thing to have the
ability to accept the knowledge

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:04.240 align:middle line:90%
and understand.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:07.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it will resonate with
you deeply because there is

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:09.010 align:middle line:84%
a part of you that
already knows this.

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:12.160 align:middle line:84%
There is a part of you that
is already aware of this.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.423 align:middle line:84%
It just requires some
shifting in your thinking.

00:20:14.423 --> 00:20:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And you've seen enough
that has happened

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:17.860 align:middle line:90%
over the last several years.

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.860 align:middle line:84%
We call 2019 to
2026 frequency wars,

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:22.180 align:middle line:90%
and you're in the middle of it.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And you've seen enough
that has gone on

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:28.840 align:middle line:84%
and things have shifted
very rapidly that you've

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:30.280 align:middle line:90%
had to be adaptable.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And this will help you
as you come into more

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:35.300 align:middle line:90%
of a Galactic community.

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:38.540 align:middle line:84%
But there is a part of you that,
as we said, already knows this.

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:40.270 align:middle line:90%
So it's coming into a truth.

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:43.780 align:middle line:84%
It's not that you have
to learn something new.

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:45.580 align:middle line:84%
It's just remembering
who you are.

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:46.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh.

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:47.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.497 align:middle line:84%
I know Jimmy and I are ready
for disclosure right now,

00:20:49.497 --> 00:20:50.830 align:middle line:90%
we're ready for the information.

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:51.630 align:middle line:90%
We can take it.

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:53.863 align:middle line:84%
Give me the most
profound statements

00:20:53.863 --> 00:20:55.030 align:middle line:90%
about the nature of reality.

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:56.700 align:middle line:90%
>> You were ready yesterday.

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:57.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.710 align:middle line:84%
But moving forward
with disclosure,

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:04.070 align:middle line:84%
does it need to happen slower so
people don't lose their minds,

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:05.648 align:middle line:84%
so people don't
panic in the streets?

00:21:05.648 --> 00:21:07.190 align:middle line:84%
Does this process
need to happen over

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:10.340 align:middle line:84%
several years in order for the
public to fully understand it

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:12.230 align:middle line:84%
and not to cause
chaos in the streets?

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:14.580 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's already
unfolded over several years.

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:15.980 align:middle line:90%
It's already out there.

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:18.230 align:middle line:84%
You've got programs
such as this where

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:19.650 align:middle line:90%
people are talking about it.

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:21.380 align:middle line:90%
So it is out there.

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And there will always be
people who will hold fear.

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:26.750 align:middle line:84%
But as you are going
through this process

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:29.060 align:middle line:84%
at the human level of
dealing with your fears,

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:32.240 align:middle line:84%
dealing with your institutions,
taking back your power,

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.310 align:middle line:84%
it will make it much
easier for you then

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:36.980 align:middle line:84%
to deal with some of
the disclosure stuff

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:38.550 align:middle line:90%
as above so below.

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:41.090 align:middle line:84%
So as you heal the
fear programs you

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:43.760 align:middle line:84%
have here of control
trust manipulation,

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:47.400 align:middle line:84%
then you heal it
inter-dimensionally as well.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:49.970 align:middle line:84%
So you won't fear
that in that way

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:52.470 align:middle line:84%
because you're learning
how to trust in yourself.

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:54.020 align:middle line:84%
This is why the
personal development

00:21:54.020 --> 00:22:00.080 align:middle line:84%
piece is so important in the
whole disclosure aspect of it.

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And that is why so
many benevolent ETs

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:05.540 align:middle line:84%
have stood in the background
because we were waiting

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:07.640 align:middle line:84%
for you to stand in
your power so that we

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:10.130 align:middle line:84%
didn't show up and
generate more fear that

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:11.540 align:middle line:90%
was counterproductive.

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:16.850 align:middle line:84%
So it will take another probably
about 18 months or so for more

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:19.020 align:middle line:90%
information to start coming out.

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:20.990 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
when we look at it

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:23.360 align:middle line:84%
and we're not big on
predictions, but right now

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.820 align:middle line:84%
when we look at it,
most likely 2026

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:29.000 align:middle line:84%
will be the year
of direct contact.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you for answering that.

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:32.990 align:middle line:84%
There's been talk
about frequency wars,

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:35.840 align:middle line:90%
and we mentioned it earlier.

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.400 align:middle line:90%
What is that exactly?

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:42.020 align:middle line:10%
>> So from 2019 to 2026, there
is a period where there is

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:45.260 align:middle line:10%
a lot of vying for the
control of your energy field.

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:46.843 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
your emotions,

00:22:46.843 --> 00:22:48.260 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
your thoughts,

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:50.260 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking about
your physical structure.

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:55.100 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
manipulation that's

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:58.910 align:middle line:84%
been going on on the planet,
off-world manipulation as well

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:00.180 align:middle line:90%
as human manipulation.

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And we don't want to go
into too much of that,

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:07.420 align:middle line:84%
but this is the period really
where they've kind of doubled

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:10.270 align:middle line:84%
down on that in terms
of spinning information

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:11.920 align:middle line:84%
to get you to think
a particular way

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:16.480 align:middle line:84%
or to feel a particular way,
to socially condition you,

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:20.620 align:middle line:84%
to keep you under control
because as humans, you

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:24.650 align:middle line:84%
have the ability to rise to such
a powerful height very, very

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:25.450 align:middle line:90%
quickly.

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And these beings are
trying to gain power

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:29.920 align:middle line:90%
by keeping you suppressed.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And really it's a game
that has come full course.

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:38.140 align:middle line:84%
They cannot take it
where they want to go,

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.280 align:middle line:90%
but they're still trying.

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's this period that
you're really seeing the efforts

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:44.260 align:middle line:90%
that they're trying to make.

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And you taking back
your power to say, no,

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:49.360 align:middle line:90%
why am I thinking this way?

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.660 align:middle line:90%
Why am I feeling this way?

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:52.240 align:middle line:84%
Why are things the
way that they are?

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:54.850 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they should be different--
you're questioning things.

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's this period
that will help

00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:59.050 align:middle line:84%
you to stand back in
your power and take

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:01.840 align:middle line:90%
control of your own frequency.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Are you in communication

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:08.720 align:middle line:84%
with all of the governments
of the world and state actors,

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.750 align:middle line:90%
or is there just a few?

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:17.570 align:middle line:10%
And what about as you think
about that for us, and again,

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:22.320 align:middle line:10%
thank you, what about
the principal players--

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:26.100 align:middle line:10%
China, Russia,
the United States,

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:31.300 align:middle line:10%
Spain, Australia, Canada,
the big kids table--

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:33.640 align:middle line:10%
are they all in
communication with you?

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So remember, we're
9th dimensional.

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:39.210 align:middle line:84%
So they're more in
contact with some

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:40.980 align:middle line:90%
of the 5th dimensional beings.

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And those beings are working
with all the governments

00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:46.980 align:middle line:90%
of the world, not just a few.

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And more than that,
there are species

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:54.390 align:middle line:84%
who are working with
individuals and helping

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:57.390 align:middle line:84%
to teach individuals to
hold their resonance,

00:24:57.390 --> 00:24:59.820 align:middle line:84%
not to be in fear
because that goes

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.050 align:middle line:90%
into the collective mindset.

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:02.970 align:middle line:84%
It goes into the
collective records,

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:05.400 align:middle line:84%
which then makes it much
easier for other human beings

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.660 align:middle line:84%
to access that frequency so that
they will not be in fear when

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:09.660 align:middle line:90%
this disclosure happens.

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's one thing to have
the idea in theory of an ET

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:13.620 align:middle line:90%
standing in front of you.

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:16.420 align:middle line:84%
It's another to have
the physical experience.

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:21.240 align:middle line:84%
So there will be a period of a
bit of shock across the board

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:25.560 align:middle line:84%
because it completely alters
your perception of reality.

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot put the genie
back in the bottle at that

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:28.820 align:middle line:90%
point.

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:30.340 align:middle line:90%
You will move on to a new phase.

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:34.260 align:middle line:84%
So it is varied the
species who are working

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.300 align:middle line:90%
with different governments.

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:40.740 align:middle line:90%
And it's more of--

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:42.330 align:middle line:84%
we hate to use
this term, but it's

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:45.330 align:middle line:84%
more of a federation where there
are different star systems that

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:46.140 align:middle line:90%
are represented.

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.057 align:middle line:84%
And they will work with
different governments,

00:25:48.057 --> 00:25:51.392 align:middle line:84%
but the Federation
is working with all

00:25:51.392 --> 00:25:53.100 align:middle line:84%
of the governments of
the world and then,

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:56.190 align:middle line:84%
again, at the individual
level prepping people

00:25:56.190 --> 00:26:00.270 align:middle line:84%
at the individual level
so that helps humanity.

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:01.320 align:middle line:90%
>> One last question.

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank, again,
the Collective for speaking

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:05.820 align:middle line:90%
with us.

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:12.270 align:middle line:84%
Did this same interaction and
assistance and observation

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:16.230 align:middle line:84%
occur with ancient
civilizations here on Earth?

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And I'm specifically speaking
of ancient Egypt, ancient Sumer,

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:25.320 align:middle line:84%
South American cultures,
Asian cultures.

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.518 align:middle line:84%
Has this been going on
for thousands of years?

00:26:27.518 --> 00:26:30.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's a little different
now because you've forgotten

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:31.630 align:middle line:90%
who you are.

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:33.340 align:middle line:84%
You've forgotten your
true divine nature,

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:35.260 align:middle line:84%
and these ancient
cultures remembered that.

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.570 align:middle line:84%
They remembered their
divine connection.

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:40.900 align:middle line:84%
They remembered more
of their history

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:44.260 align:middle line:84%
in terms of being seeded
from different star systems.

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And they had a much
more direct interaction.

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And as you went into the
decline of some of these higher

00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:57.200 align:middle line:84%
civilizations, they still
had a sense of that.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.990 align:middle line:84%
Where you are today,
you're completely

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:01.540 align:middle line:84%
cut off from that information
or you were and it's

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:05.360 align:middle line:84%
starting to come back out
over the last 80 years.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:08.210 align:middle line:90%
So it was slightly different.

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:11.437 align:middle line:84%
It was already in
their psyche that that

00:27:11.437 --> 00:27:12.520 align:middle line:90%
was part of who they were.

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:13.810 align:middle line:90%
They were part of the stars.

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:17.020 align:middle line:84%
They were part of a
greater community.

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.700 align:middle line:84%
It was passed down
to them, and there

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:20.620 align:middle line:90%
was a remembrance of that.

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:22.240 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:22.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:24.567 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for
answering the question.

00:27:24.567 --> 00:27:26.720 align:middle line:90%
Wendy, you can come back to us.

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember the
conversation that we just had?

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:32.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's it'll fade
pretty quickly.

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:35.325 align:middle line:84%
There might be some bits and
pieces that I'll remember.

00:27:35.325 --> 00:27:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Probably by tonight I'll be
like, what did we talk about?

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:39.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Wendy, I noticed
your voice changing.

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Do you know that your
voice is changing?

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:42.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:46.610 align:middle line:84%
So it's really just
elongated vowels

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:49.430 align:middle line:84%
that the guides can work
with the frequency and alter.

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:52.365 align:middle line:84%
So when I first started, they
sounded way more British.

00:27:52.365 --> 00:27:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And then there was a period
where they sounded a bit more

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:57.320 align:middle line:84%
Australian because those were
the frequencies that they

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:58.230 align:middle line:90%
needed to work with.

00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:00.892 align:middle line:84%
And now it's kind of a
combination of all of that,

00:28:00.892 --> 00:28:01.850 align:middle line:90%
and it'll shift and go.

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:04.250 align:middle line:90%
But it's no specific dialect.

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:07.287 align:middle line:84%
It's just tones and sounds
that they use to resonate.

00:28:07.287 --> 00:28:08.870 align:middle line:84%
So it's like you're
getting a healing.

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>> The vocabulary is a
little different too.

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:14.883 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, sometimes they use
words and I'm like, it must be.

00:28:14.883 --> 00:28:16.550 align:middle line:84%
In my consciousness,
but it's not a word

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:18.570 align:middle line:84%
that I would use in
day-to-day conversation.

00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And I've been like, OK, is that
really what that word means?

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:22.380 align:middle line:90%
Do I need to go look that up?

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:25.310 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, they'll pull from
my memory banks for that.

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:26.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Wendy.

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:27.660 align:middle line:90%
Amazing conversation.

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:31.650 align:middle line:84%
This is a powerful piece of
energy I'm holding right here.

00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:34.380 align:middle line:84%
For "Into the Vortex" and
Josh, I'm Jimmy Church.

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:35.880 align:middle line:90%
We'll see you next time.

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:39.230 align:middle line:90%
