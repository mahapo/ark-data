00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.480 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm radio and television
host Jimmy Church.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And I am here to uncover
the truth about some

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.680 align:middle line:90%
of life's biggest mysteries.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.220 align:middle line:84%
If this is revealed,
everything has to be rewritten.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.080 align:middle line:84%
My guest today is Daniel
Sheehan, a Harvard Law School

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.360 align:middle line:84%
constitutional
litigation attorney,

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.150 align:middle line:84%
at the heart of the
pivotal legal cases

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.770 align:middle line:84%
and social movements
of our generation,

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.740 align:middle line:90%
including disclosure.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>> He stated flat out that the
government was in possession

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.660 align:middle line:84%
of an intact nonhuman
origin spacecraft,

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.530 align:middle line:84%
and that there was biological
evidence of nonhuman

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:48.670 align:middle line:90%
intelligence.

>> As always, MUFON
field investigator Josh--

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh, can you
pull up the map?

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.860 align:middle line:84%
>> --joins us to
help set the scene.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.210 align:middle line:84%
Join us as we dive deep to
get to the bottom of some

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.360 align:middle line:84%
of the most intriguing
questions of our time.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.980 align:middle line:84%
>> This is an absolutely
transhistorical event

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.725 align:middle line:90%
that's taking place here.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome to "Into the Vortex."

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Jimmy Church.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And my guest today
is Daniel Sheehan.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.810 align:middle line:84%
He's a civil rights
attorney that

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.470 align:middle line:84%
is hot on the pursuit of social
justice and transparency,

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.350 align:middle line:84%
certainly with disclosure
and the ET question.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, the action that we've
had over the last five years

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.350 align:middle line:90%
has been tremendous.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.550 align:middle line:84%
But the question that
I have is transparency

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.830 align:middle line:84%
and where are we
today with disclosure

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.670 align:middle line:90%
and how are we moving forward.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.270 align:middle line:84%
So, Josh, do you
feel transparency?

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.458 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel honesty from the
media and other organizations?

00:01:55.458 --> 00:01:56.750 align:middle line:90%
>> I think it's getting better.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.670 align:middle line:90%
It's getting better, definitely.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.190 align:middle line:84%
But, overall, we have
a lot of work to do.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Daniel, five years, six
years of pretty rapid stuff,

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.520 align:middle line:84%
but I don't think anything
compares to what has happened

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.360 align:middle line:84%
over the last couple of months,
where we thought that December

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.400 align:middle line:84%
of 2017 and the days of
disclosure that were there,

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.380 align:middle line:84%
it was about as good
as it was going to get.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.670 align:middle line:90%
And it was pretty big.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Over the last couple
of months, we've

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.930 align:middle line:90%
had a hearing in Congress.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.140 align:middle line:84%
We've had a presentation
in front of the Congress

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.980 align:middle line:90%
in Mexico.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.780 align:middle line:84%
We've had the recent NASA
committee put together

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.160 align:middle line:90%
for UAPs.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.690 align:middle line:84%
But all of this has been in
the interest of transparency

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.120 align:middle line:90%
with the public.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.410 align:middle line:90%
Is it truly transparent?

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>> It's getting toward it
right now that, as I mentioned,

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.670 align:middle line:84%
there's legislation now that is
being drafted in Congress right

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.180 align:middle line:84%
now to increase
the transparency.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.600 align:middle line:84%
The primary motive
of the Congress

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.450 align:middle line:84%
at this particular moment is to
extract all of the UFO and ET

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.380 align:middle line:84%
or what they call nonhuman
intelligence information out

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.500 align:middle line:84%
of the executive branch and
the military contracting

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.030 align:middle line:84%
corporations and get it
transferred to Congress to put

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.520 align:middle line:84%
into the Senate and House
intelligence committees

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.070 align:middle line:84%
so that they can get
it and evaluate it.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And there's a presumption
in a new statute

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.410 align:middle line:84%
they're going to pass
in December to get

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.310 align:middle line:84%
the vast bulk of that out to
the public within 180 days.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.000 align:middle line:84%
Then there's going to be some
that are going to be kept--

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.860 align:middle line:90%
they say postponed.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.250 align:middle line:84%
But they have to have a strict
schedule pursuant to which

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.530 align:middle line:84%
all of that information is
going to be disclosed as well.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And, ultimately,
only the president

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.120 align:middle line:84%
will be able to make a
decision to retain or continue

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.670 align:middle line:84%
to postpone a given
piece of information.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.520 align:middle line:84%
But the whole presumption
of the new statute

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.020 align:middle line:84%
is going to be to
expose it to the world.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.010 align:middle line:84%
>> We just had the
hearing in Congress.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.690 align:middle line:90%
Pull that up, Josh.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.410 align:middle line:84%
Pull up Tim Burchett
and de Luna.

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, here, we have one of the
most extraordinary moments

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.420 align:middle line:84%
in the history of disclosure
and certainly for Congress

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.620 align:middle line:84%
to put something
like this together.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And it was pretty aggressive,
and I think that we need that.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.640 align:middle line:90%
But then we had David Grusch.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And his testimony and the
statements that he said

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.910 align:middle line:90%
were dramatic.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.500 align:middle line:84%
Nonhuman biologics were
suddenly part of the vernacular.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is part of the
conversation and recovery

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.540 align:middle line:90%
of craft and--

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Intact extraterrestrial.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Intact craft,
addresses, and everything.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.530 align:middle line:90%
These were big revelations.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.440 align:middle line:84%
But the questions coming
back from Congress

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.730 align:middle line:90%
seemed to be on point.

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.900 align:middle line:84%
But what about the
transparency on this?

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.970 align:middle line:84%
They seem to be
taken by surprise.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the fact is that
virtually all the people that

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.850 align:middle line:84%
were there, it was
a subcommittee.

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.340 align:middle line:84%
It was the national security
subcommittee of the House

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.420 align:middle line:90%
Oversight Committee.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.480 align:middle line:84%
I was there and talking
with the staff people

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.070 align:middle line:90%
when we were doing it.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And they had not expected
David Grusch to tell them

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.550 align:middle line:90%
what he did in the open.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.170 align:middle line:84%
He told them flat out that
based upon his role in being

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.070 align:middle line:84%
an official in a position
overseeing and investigating

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:34.920 align:middle line:84%
the UFO issue or the UAP issue,
he stated flat out that we were

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.330 align:middle line:84%
in possession,
the government was

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:42.450 align:middle line:84%
in possession of an intact
nonhuman origin spacecraft.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.970 align:middle line:84%
That's how he characterized
it, and that there

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:49.770 align:middle line:84%
was biological evidence of
nonhuman intelligence connected

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:50.790 align:middle line:90%
to that craft.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, one would have thought
that that was going to end up

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.090 align:middle line:84%
on the front page of the "New
York Times" the next day,

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.110 align:middle line:90%
but it didn't.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.440 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is millions
of people saw it.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.910 align:middle line:84%
That went out all
across the country.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And it was rebroadcast
and rebroadcast.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking with Dave just
before he gave the testimony

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.960 align:middle line:90%
and then just after.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.570 align:middle line:90%
I've been talking to his lawyer.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking to the members
of the Oversight Committee.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.647 align:middle line:84%
So it was clear that they
want to get that information,

00:06:21.647 --> 00:06:23.730 align:middle line:84%
even that he wasn't able
to give them the details.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.800 align:middle line:90%
They said, for example--

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.740 align:middle line:84%
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,
she said, where do we

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.110 align:middle line:90%
go to find this craft?

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I can't tell
you that in open session.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.920 align:middle line:84%
But he agreed he
would give it to them.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.800 align:middle line:90%
So I met with the staff.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.850 align:middle line:84%
I met with AOC and with Jamie
Raskin right after the hearing

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:46.030 align:middle line:84%
and said, we can get you
hooked up with David Grusch

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.480 align:middle line:84%
to get to the
first-person witnesses.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.063 align:middle line:84%
He was the second-party
witness saying

00:06:51.063 --> 00:06:53.230 align:middle line:84%
he's talked to them who
have said they've been there

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:54.917 align:middle line:84%
with the craft so
that they need to get

00:06:54.917 --> 00:06:56.500 align:middle line:84%
the names of the
people that have been

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.210 align:middle line:90%
there, put their hand on it.

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me jump in because
that's a very important point.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.660 align:middle line:90%
This is a world issue.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.690 align:middle line:84%
This isn't just an
American issue, for sure.

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.660 align:middle line:84%
But when you say
these things in public

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.520 align:middle line:84%
that you have the
addresses and you're

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.933 align:middle line:84%
going to provide the
locations of this,

00:07:11.933 --> 00:07:14.350 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to go ahead
and do this to the committee,

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:19.150 align:middle line:84%
doesn't that tip the hat to the
corporations and anybody that

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.090 align:middle line:84%
is working in a
special access program

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:26.440 align:middle line:84%
to move and suddenly have
a shell game, where you can

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.960 align:middle line:84%
take the craft and move
it to another location

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.400 align:middle line:90%
or to another country?

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And then we lose
that transparency.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And anything that would
be presented is nullified.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.690 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that a concern?

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:41.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one of the things that
you'll know during my career

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.830 align:middle line:84%
in all of this, having been
involved in the Watergate

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:48.520 align:middle line:84%
burglary and the Pentagon
Papers, et cetera,

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:53.710 align:middle line:84%
the effort to conceal and lie
and manipulate after the public

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:57.490 align:middle line:84%
knows about a thing gets the
people in more trouble than

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:58.570 align:middle line:90%
the issue itself.

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.460 align:middle line:84%
The cover-up is worse
than the event sometimes.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And so if they start
doing that kind of thing

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.280 align:middle line:84%
and get caught
doing it, it's going

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.670 align:middle line:84%
to be like hiding the papers
after the Congress has

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:10.990 align:middle line:90%
subpoenaed them.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:14.950 align:middle line:84%
So there's a parallel
track and understanding

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:16.760 align:middle line:90%
what it is they have.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And if they try to conceal
it or lie about it, what

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.410 align:middle line:90%
is going to be done about that?

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And so the new statute
that is being drafted

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:27.460 align:middle line:84%
has got subpoena power so
that the Congress can actually

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:31.900 align:middle line:84%
subpoena the actual persons
and take depositions from them

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.850 align:middle line:84%
and say, did you have it at
the time we notified you?

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:36.250 align:middle line:90%
Did you move it anywhere?

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:38.780 align:middle line:84%
If you did, where did
you move it, et cetera?

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:43.710 align:middle line:84%
So there's an inquisitional
process that is now starting.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And Congress is going to
extract this information

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:50.190 align:middle line:84%
from the executive branch and
from the private corporations,

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:54.450 align:middle line:84%
these military contractors,
and that they not only have

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.370 align:middle line:84%
subpoena power, but
they have the power

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:57.870 align:middle line:90%
to hold them in contempt.

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And what they've done
very extraordinarily

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.000 align:middle line:84%
in the new statute that
is going to be passed,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.180 align:middle line:84%
they have actually
exercised eminent domain

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.460 align:middle line:84%
on behalf of the United
States government

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.310 align:middle line:84%
to control and seize
and take custody

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:14.040 align:middle line:84%
of all of this material,
including the craft.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, I have a copy
of the new provision.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.120 align:middle line:84%
Josh, you've got a copy
of it there, too, as well.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.780 align:middle line:90%
This is a really big deal.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:27.870 align:middle line:84%
>> It is a government mandate
that all of these agencies turn

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:30.870 align:middle line:84%
over all the material
they have, every email,

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:36.330 align:middle line:84%
every internal memo, every phone
call, every audiotape or film.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Everything has to be turned
over to this new committee.

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And the president is going
to appoint nine people

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:46.090 align:middle line:84%
to survey all of
this information

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:48.010 align:middle line:90%
and release it to the public.

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:49.540 align:middle line:90%
That's what their job is.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's over a seven-year
period under the statute.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:58.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, it is literally
titled Unidentified Anomalous

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:00.850 align:middle line:90%
Phenomena Disclosure.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.530 align:middle line:90%
What does that actually mean?

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And are we talking about
actual transparency?

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:08.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there is one
provision in the statute--

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:11.950 align:middle line:84%
this is a 25-page statute
that is going to go

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:13.990 align:middle line:84%
into the National Defense
Authorization Act.

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And there's one
provision that allows

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:21.380 align:middle line:84%
the agency that possesses the
information to apply for--

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.770 align:middle line:84%
to this nine-person
committee, apply

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:28.090 align:middle line:84%
for the authority to postpone
the public disclosure of this.

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:31.480 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it's going to get
disclosed within 180 days

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.490 align:middle line:84%
from the receipt
of the information

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:37.540 align:middle line:84%
so that there's this heavily
operational presumption here

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:40.090 align:middle line:84%
on behalf of disclosure
to the public.

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:41.917 align:middle line:90%
And it's the statute.

00:10:41.917 --> 00:10:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And they have subpoena
power, and they

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.120 align:middle line:90%
have investigative power.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.710 align:middle line:84%
This committee is
going to have--

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:48.330 align:middle line:84%
it's a nine-person
committee that

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.190 align:middle line:90%
is mandated by the statute.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:51.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Who's going to
assemble the committee?

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>> The president
nominates nine people.

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:58.260 align:middle line:10%
And then it goes
to the Congress,

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.540 align:middle line:10%
and it goes to the Senate
Intelligence committee.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And it goes to the Senate
Homeland Security committee.

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And then if they approve
of the particular nominee,

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:09.120 align:middle line:90%
it goes to the full Senate.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.260 align:middle line:84%
This is like Supreme
Court justices.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:12.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:16.448 align:middle line:84%
OK, so who assembles the
proposed list of nominees?

00:11:16.448 --> 00:11:17.490 align:middle line:90%
>> There are eight of us.

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:20.340 align:middle line:84%
There are eight entities
that are designated

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:22.800 align:middle line:84%
in the statute, one of
which is the Majority

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.010 align:middle line:84%
Leader of the Senate and the
Minority Leader of the Senate,

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:27.780 align:middle line:84%
the Majority Leader
of the House,

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.610 align:middle line:84%
the Speaker of the
House, and the Minority

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:31.830 align:middle line:84%
Leader, the
Secretary of Defense,

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:38.280 align:middle line:84%
and our group, which is called
the UAP Disclosure Foundation,

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.110 align:middle line:84%
is how it's referred
to in the statute.

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:44.980 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the New Paradigm
Institute that is a 501(c)(3)

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:49.270 align:middle line:84%
public interest organization
working with such groups as The

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:52.480 align:middle line:84%
Sol Foundation, which Garry
Nolan is putting up over

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.530 align:middle line:90%
at Stanford.

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:57.100 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be surveying
the 501(c)(3) public interest

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.880 align:middle line:84%
organizations to find out
who they might recommend.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.900 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to recommend
a list of 18 people, two

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:09.100 align:middle line:84%
persons for each of the nine
slots, a primary and a backup.

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.020 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
going to be doing.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Will there be an opportunity
for civilians and members

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:20.290 align:middle line:84%
of our community to
be involved in this?

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Because if transparency
is the issue,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.940 align:middle line:84%
we can't have a full staff
of military and Intelligence

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:32.560 align:middle line:84%
Agency spooks on this
because transparency is not

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.980 align:middle line:90%
part of their game.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.597 align:middle line:84%
How can we get that
into this committee?

00:12:36.597 --> 00:12:38.680 align:middle line:84%
>> It's going to be
extraordinarily important that

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.070 align:middle line:84%
the people that are on
the committee are trusted

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:44.770 align:middle line:84%
by the president because he's
ultimately going to be the one

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:47.320 align:middle line:90%
that selects out of them all.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.470 align:middle line:84%
We could recommend having
the Pope on it or something.

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:53.080 align:middle line:84%
But it's up to the president
because the president

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:57.122 align:middle line:84%
nominates, and then
the Senate will ratify.

00:12:57.122 --> 00:12:59.080 align:middle line:84%
It's with the advice and
consent of the Senate.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:02.470 align:middle line:84%
This is just like appointing
Supreme Court justices.

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:04.870 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be this
tribunal of nine people.

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.480 align:middle line:84%
This is an absolutely
transhistorical event

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.860 align:middle line:90%
that's taking place here.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:14.830 align:middle line:84%
>> The interest that the
world has shown about contact

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:18.670 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial intelligence
visitations to this world,

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:20.980 align:middle line:84%
it has now become
a conversation.

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:22.840 align:middle line:90%
It's now part of pop culture.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.490 align:middle line:90%
The movement is started.

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:25.810 align:middle line:90%
It's right in front of us.

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:28.990 align:middle line:84%
The world has an extreme
interest in this.

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:32.270 align:middle line:84%
But not only is
transparency important,

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.300 align:middle line:84%
but when we put this
committee together,

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:37.390 align:middle line:84%
is it about future
investigations?

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:41.830 align:middle line:84%
Or is it about craft that
are in our possession,

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:45.740 align:middle line:84%
reverse engineering technology
and what we know now?

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.620 align:middle line:84%
What's the purpose
of the committee?

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:51.010 align:middle line:84%
The world wants to know
if we have made contact,

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:54.250 align:middle line:84%
if we are currently
communicating with ET.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:56.150 align:middle line:90%
Are they visiting this planet?

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:59.350 align:middle line:84%
Do we have warehouses
full of flying saucers?

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:01.420 align:middle line:84%
This is what the
world wants to know.

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:02.620 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what this focus is on.

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:07.450 align:middle line:90%
And they have to report--

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:12.070 align:middle line:84%
this committee has to report
to Congress every 90 days

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:14.470 align:middle line:90%
if anything new is discovered.

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:17.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's not only looking
at the past information,

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:19.480 align:middle line:84%
but it's looking at all
the information that's

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.910 align:middle line:84%
going to take place over
the next seven years.

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:25.310 align:middle line:84%
There's a seven-year time period
for this particular panel,

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:26.110 align:middle line:90%
this board.

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:31.180 align:middle line:84%
It's called the UAP
Records Review Board.

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:35.200 align:middle line:84%
It's based on the Kennedy
assassination documents review

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.220 align:middle line:90%
committee that was put together.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:38.590 align:middle line:90%
So that's what this is.

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:41.710 align:middle line:84%
So they're going to
be looking at past--

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:44.140 align:middle line:84%
under the statute,
everything that we

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:47.650 align:middle line:84%
came to know 25
years ago or earlier

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:51.040 align:middle line:84%
has to be released within
the first 180 days.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:56.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, when David Grusch
and Fravor and Ryan Graves,

00:14:56.170 --> 00:15:01.930 align:middle line:84%
when they got up, swore under
oath, and had that moment--

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:06.310 align:middle line:84%
and it was historical to have
this subject in the house being

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:10.930 align:middle line:84%
discussed-- as important as
that was, right after that,

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:14.230 align:middle line:84%
it appears the statements
that have been made is there

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:16.010 align:middle line:84%
aren't going to be
any more UFO hearings.

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:16.810 align:middle line:90%
We're done.

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:19.690 align:middle line:84%
It seemed like there
was too much too soon,

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:21.620 align:middle line:90%
and we got ahead of our skis.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think it caught
people by surprise.

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:25.960 align:middle line:90%
But that stops transparency.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Aren't we supposed
to have hearings?

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:29.030 align:middle line:90%
Were you surprised about that?

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:30.940 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
have any more hearings.

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:32.350 align:middle line:84%
>> I thought the genie
was out of the bottle,

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:34.250 align:middle line:84%
and we were heading
straight towards that path.

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And it seems like we have
a little bit of a hiccup

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.078 align:middle line:84%
right now, which
I'm nervous about.

00:15:37.078 --> 00:15:40.840 align:middle line:84%
>> So how do we continue
with transparency?

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And how do we move
forward with more hearings

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:46.340 align:middle line:84%
when it seems like
somebody behind the scenes

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.650 align:middle line:84%
flipped the switch
from up to down?

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:51.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I just came back in
yesterday from Washington.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.563 align:middle line:90%
I was in Washington for 10 days.

00:15:52.563 --> 00:15:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And I was meeting with people
from the Senate Intelligence

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.218 align:middle line:84%
committee staff,
meeting with people

00:15:57.218 --> 00:15:58.760 align:middle line:84%
over at the House
Oversight Committee

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:01.070 align:middle line:84%
here to have this
exact discussion.

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:04.130 align:middle line:84%
They're now all
focusing on getting

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:05.660 align:middle line:90%
this panel put together.

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:08.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a major
thing that they're

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.780 align:middle line:84%
deciding to delegate to
this particular panel

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:14.030 align:middle line:84%
the authority to
start extracting

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:16.880 align:middle line:84%
all of this information so
they can get a look at it.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And intelligence
committees are going

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.720 align:middle line:84%
to have to assign
a special staff.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.270 align:middle line:84%
They all have to have
security clearances in order

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:24.410 align:middle line:90%
to look at this stuff.

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:27.980 align:middle line:84%
But beneath all of that,
there is a huge building

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:31.580 align:middle line:84%
political advantage to
people in the Congress

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:34.220 align:middle line:84%
to get this information
released to the people,

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.890 align:middle line:84%
all the way up until they
hit a certain spot, which

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:39.455 align:middle line:84%
is the executive branch
people are taking

00:16:39.455 --> 00:16:41.330 align:middle line:84%
a position that there
are certain things that

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:42.842 align:middle line:90%
can't be disclosed.

00:16:42.842 --> 00:16:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And so what I say when I'm in
meetings with those people is

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:46.500 align:middle line:90%
I say, like what?

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, what
can't be disclosed?

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Is it going to be the
national security issue,

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:55.120 align:middle line:84%
that label that is put on
anything that they don't want

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:55.920 align:middle line:90%
revealed?

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.260 align:middle line:84%
>> That's very
vague and overbroad.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:03.210 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm planning to do is to
apply constitutional standards

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:05.760 align:middle line:84%
that support our
democracy to say that,

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:09.300 align:middle line:84%
look, that we have to
presume that the people have

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.460 align:middle line:84%
to participate in these
fundamental decisions.

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:13.260 align:middle line:84%
There's no more
fundamental decision

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.750 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to be
making in the next 10 years

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:18.480 align:middle line:84%
than how we're going to set
up the protocols for dealing

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:22.560 align:middle line:84%
with potential extraterrestrial
or potentially extradimensional

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:26.130 align:middle line:84%
civilization, a whole
nonhuman species that

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:29.230 align:middle line:84%
has this kind of technology
that is capable of doing this.

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And so the people have
to be involved in this.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And so the process of
bringing in this panel

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:38.130 align:middle line:84%
to filter the information, to
get it out as much as they can

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:41.530 align:middle line:84%
to the public, that's
their charge is to do that.

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:43.560 align:middle line:84%
But we all know,
from having dealt

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.590 align:middle line:84%
with the bureaucracies in
Washington, they read it as to,

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:49.200 align:middle line:84%
how can they get
away with revealing

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.590 align:middle line:90%
as little as possible?

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And so the reason that the
New Paradigm Institute has

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:58.440 align:middle line:84%
been set up is to monitor
that, to watchdog that process

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.630 align:middle line:84%
to say, OK, what's the
latest information that's

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:01.710 align:middle line:90%
being withheld?

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole
process in here

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.430 align:middle line:84%
of them having to
give a summary of what

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:08.590 align:middle line:84%
it is they're concealing,
which is interesting.

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:10.350 align:middle line:84%
How do you reveal
what the nature

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:12.630 align:middle line:84%
of what you're concealing
is without revealing it?

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:15.750 align:middle line:84%
So in our office, we're
setting up the office.

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:19.140 align:middle line:84%
We've got it now,
right on Capitol Hill.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.930 align:middle line:84%
We've been given an
office that is actually

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:24.090 align:middle line:90%
in the federal enclave.

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:26.190 align:middle line:84%
It's right in between
the United States Supreme

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:29.110 align:middle line:84%
Court and the Russell
Senate Building.

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:32.110 align:middle line:84%
So we're in the enclave,
our office, the New Paradigm

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:32.910 align:middle line:90%
Institute.

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And we've got the
conference centers

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.080 align:middle line:84%
for bringing the people
together to have the discussion.

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:40.440 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be the citizen
center for extracting

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.038 align:middle line:90%
this information.

00:18:42.038 --> 00:18:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to know
all the people that

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:45.330 align:middle line:90%
are on the committee.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.310 align:middle line:84%
We're going to know
who all their staff is.

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:50.790 align:middle line:84%
So we're setting it up to try
to-- and we want to do this

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:54.270 align:middle line:84%
in cooperation with other
501(c)(3) organizations,

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:58.050 align:middle line:84%
such as The Sol Foundation
that Garry Nolan is doing over

00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:00.750 align:middle line:90%
at Stanford and others.

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And what we want to do is
stop any of the organizations

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:06.310 align:middle line:84%
from trying to compete
with each other.

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:07.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's back up for a second.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:09.870 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not being cavalier.

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:15.960 align:middle line:84%
When David Grusch said, we
couldn't get access to a SCIF,

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:21.300 align:middle line:84%
I have addresses, I have names,
I can provide you everything

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:26.490 align:middle line:84%
that you need, but we need to do
that in a special environment,

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:29.760 align:middle line:84%
and that those SCIFs
were not provided

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.970 align:middle line:84%
to the members of the committee
to have this done, shouldn't

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:38.740 align:middle line:84%
that be the moment where the
UFO attorney comes in and says,

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.040 align:middle line:84%
wait a minute, this
is about transparency

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.390 align:middle line:90%
and about disclosure.

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:43.920 align:middle line:90%
This has to happen.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'll tell you
what the attorney did.

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And that was saying,
you don't need a SCIF.

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:51.900 align:middle line:90%
I'll sit right down with you.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.690 align:middle line:84%
If you want to have Grusch's
private cell phone number

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:57.150 align:middle line:84%
and you want to meet with him
in a confidential setting,

00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:58.770 align:middle line:84%
you've got the
security clearances

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:00.500 align:middle line:84%
and ask him what
the information is.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.250 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to bring
everybody together

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:05.280 align:middle line:84%
in a big formal meeting
in a SCIF somewhere.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.370 align:middle line:84%
So what my job is, in
part, is to figure out

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:10.950 align:middle line:84%
what is the actual process
that can be followed here

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:12.840 align:middle line:84%
that will get the
information, first,

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.090 align:middle line:84%
into the hands of the
right people in Congress

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:17.640 align:middle line:84%
and then get them to
help make the decision

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.320 align:middle line:90%
to get it out to the people.

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.870 align:middle line:84%
That's the process that's
going on right now.

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:24.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Do we know if that
information has been

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.530 align:middle line:90%
transferred?

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:30.990 align:middle line:84%
The list of corporations,
the locations of these craft,

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:33.150 align:middle line:84%
and the biologics
and all of that,

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:35.440 align:middle line:84%
has that information been
handed over to Congress?

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting question, Jimmy.

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:40.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't know yet.

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:43.700 align:middle line:84%
I know that the
contact information

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.630 align:middle line:90%
has been provided to them.

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And I know that they know
they don't need a SCIF.

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:50.900 align:middle line:84%
They don't need to go through
some bureaucratic effort

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:52.760 align:middle line:84%
of getting somebody
else to authorize

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.050 align:middle line:90%
them to get this information.

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:56.070 align:middle line:90%
They can get it in that--

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:59.930 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going back
in to Washington

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:03.920 align:middle line:84%
after we get done here and
meet with them to find out

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.320 align:middle line:84%
that-- now, they may take the
position that since I don't

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.030 align:middle line:90%
have a security clearance.

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And I won't accept a
security clearance.

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:12.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's been offered
a number of times.

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:17.060 align:middle line:84%
But I will not do that, because
I am the people's advocate.

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:20.600 align:middle line:84%
And so my job is to get the
information to the people.

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:23.210 align:middle line:84%
We want everybody to be
confident that there's

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:25.580 align:middle line:84%
someone in Washington
making sure

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:27.980 align:middle line:84%
that the maximum possible
amount of information

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:29.270 align:middle line:90%
is going to be made public.

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's the New
Paradigm Institute.

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, to be clear, we're
talking about extraterrestrial

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:35.780 align:middle line:90%
intelligence.

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:36.545 align:middle line:84%
>> Or extraterrestrial
dimension.

00:21:36.545 --> 00:21:37.962 align:middle line:84%
>> We're talking
about ET contact.

00:21:37.962 --> 00:21:41.620 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about flying
saucers and all of this.

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:42.420 align:middle line:90%
>> It's in here.

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:44.970 align:middle line:84%
>> And to be transparent,
well, let's talk about that

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:48.600 align:middle line:84%
specifically because I think
this is very, very important.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:53.680 align:middle line:84%
When we have members,
elected officials

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.030 align:middle line:84%
trying to have access
to an Air Force base

00:21:57.030 --> 00:22:01.350 align:middle line:84%
and are denied access,
representatives that

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:03.930 align:middle line:84%
have those clearances
and have the right

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:07.560 align:middle line:84%
to represent the people
and to ask and see

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:11.610 align:middle line:84%
images and video and the
evidence of these reported

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:14.430 align:middle line:84%
sightings, and we're
denied that access.

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:16.290 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about the people.

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:20.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, will the
provisions in the NDAA

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:23.730 align:middle line:84%
allow our elected officials
and civilians access

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:27.150 align:middle line:84%
to all of this
information and not

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:29.710 align:middle line:84%
be denied at the gates
of an Air Force base?

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:34.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the answer is no
because the fact is that

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.370 align:middle line:84%
isn't the proper
process to do this.

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:40.100 align:middle line:84%
This is the responsible
way to do this.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And as the people's
advocate, I'm

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:44.310 align:middle line:84%
looking at this
saying that this is

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:47.610 align:middle line:84%
a bill that I could have
written on behalf of the people.

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:49.470 align:middle line:90%
That's how good this bill is.

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:52.950 align:middle line:84%
>> If this gets included and
this becomes legislation,

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:57.630 align:middle line:84%
this becomes law, and this
is in the NDAA for next year,

00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:01.170 align:middle line:84%
then we're not going to hear
about a senator being denied

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:06.300 align:middle line:84%
access, and that we will
continue to have transparency.

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:09.630 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the process for
generating transparency.

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:13.350 align:middle line:84%
It's clearly going to be an
existential process of getting

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:16.500 align:middle line:84%
more and more and more
transparency with resistance

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.180 align:middle line:84%
from what they call
the legacy group.

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:19.440 align:middle line:90%
It's identified in here.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.390 align:middle line:84%
The legacy group are
the group of people

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:24.300 align:middle line:84%
that have been retaining
this information in lying

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:27.460 align:middle line:84%
to Congress and lying
to presidents, in fact,

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:31.507 align:middle line:84%
in lying to members of the
House and Senate, both.

00:23:31.507 --> 00:23:33.840 align:middle line:84%
They say, well, we don't know
what you're talking about.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.220 align:middle line:90%
We don't have any program going.

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:37.050 align:middle line:84%
They've just been
lying blatantly.

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And the Congress, basically,
is fed up with that now.

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>> How long does this last?

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:46.165 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is there a
time limit to this?

00:23:46.165 --> 00:23:46.965 align:middle line:90%
Is this a year?

00:23:46.965 --> 00:23:47.765 align:middle line:90%
Or this is--

00:23:47.765 --> 00:23:49.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Seven years, seven years.

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:50.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Seven years.

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:51.982 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a seven-year
sunset clause on this.

00:23:51.982 --> 00:23:56.598 align:middle line:84%
So from those who are familiar
with how Washington works,

00:23:56.598 --> 00:23:58.530 align:middle line:84%
you know that the
other side is going

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:01.200 align:middle line:84%
to be dragging their heels
as much as they possibly can.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to try to
put off the revelation of what

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:07.230 align:middle line:84%
would be the family jewels
all the way to the end

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:09.010 align:middle line:90%
of the seven-year period.

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:11.370 align:middle line:84%
Our job as the New
Paradigm Institute

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:15.690 align:middle line:84%
and the people's advocate
is to get that done faster

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:18.640 align:middle line:84%
to get as much information
out as possible

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:19.930 align:middle line:90%
as soon as possible.

00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:21.750 align:middle line:84%
That's our dynamic
that's going on.

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want it to
be a strict dialectic

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.960 align:middle line:84%
of the good guy citizens versus
the bad guy government people.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.690 align:middle line:84%
I want people inside the
government structures

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:31.800 align:middle line:90%
on our side.

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.510 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we have here.

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:36.870 align:middle line:84%
At this point in time, we
have both political parties,

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:39.570 align:middle line:84%
the leaders of both political
parties, both houses

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:43.140 align:middle line:84%
of Congress, and
certain important people

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:45.150 align:middle line:84%
inside the executive
branch itself

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:48.750 align:middle line:84%
and inside the actual
UAP investigatory

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:52.860 align:middle line:84%
community inside the military
and intelligence agencies

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:54.970 align:middle line:90%
all on our side.

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And so what I want to do
is to have our side be

00:24:57.270 --> 00:25:01.140 align:middle line:84%
as expansive as possible,
reduced to the absolute minimum

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:03.205 align:middle line:90%
who the other side is.

00:25:03.205 --> 00:25:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And then we have to make a
decision as to whether they're

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:07.620 align:middle line:90%
going to get amnesty.

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:12.270 align:middle line:84%
>> How do we ensure further
testimony and hearings in both

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:13.350 align:middle line:90%
the House and the Senate?

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>> By having the
citizens demand it.

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.000 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.930 align:middle line:84%
In addition to this inside
baseball operation that's

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:24.780 align:middle line:84%
going on, there has to
be the outside game,

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:27.120 align:middle line:84%
that we need to have
citizen pressure put

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.040 align:middle line:84%
on all the elected
representatives

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:32.190 align:middle line:84%
to accelerate the rate at
which this information is

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:33.330 align:middle line:90%
being made public.

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And this mechanism
exists by means

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:37.957 align:middle line:84%
of which that pressure can
be exerted, because you

00:25:37.957 --> 00:25:39.660 align:middle line:90%
know where to direct it.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.010 align:middle line:90%
You know who the committees are.

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:42.280 align:middle line:90%
You know who the members are.

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.480 align:middle line:90%
You know how to focus that.

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And we have basically
a law office set up

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:51.160 align:middle line:84%
on Capitol Hill right now to
watchdog this entire process

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.260 align:middle line:84%
and to serve as the
people's advocate

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.630 align:middle line:84%
to get the maximum amount
of this information made

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:56.780 align:middle line:90%
public as soon as possible.

00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:58.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, who's the watchdog?

00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:00.910 align:middle line:84%
Because if we have a
whistleblower come forward

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:06.910 align:middle line:84%
under protection and under
oath and gives an address,

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:09.310 align:middle line:84%
a warehouse where
there is a craft that

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:13.870 align:middle line:84%
is being reverse engineered that
is not made on this planet--

00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:18.070 align:middle line:84%
clearly, we're talking about an
extraterrestrial intelligence,

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:19.420 align:middle line:90%
a craft here.

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:20.800 align:middle line:90%
I want to be very clear--

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.840 align:middle line:90%
who's the watchdog?

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.780 align:middle line:84%
Shouldn't there be
somebody put together,

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:28.420 align:middle line:84%
a team going to this
location, and we

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:32.080 align:middle line:84%
have a watchdog observing
what is actually going on?

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:35.620 align:middle line:84%
Because that has to
be the next step.

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>> It's in the
statute, specifically.

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:40.310 align:middle line:84%
It states that the
members of this board,

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:43.850 align:middle line:84%
this nine-person board of
review have the authority

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:47.540 align:middle line:84%
to go to the sites
and physically inspect

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:50.300 align:middle line:84%
the materials and to
take them into custody

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:51.770 align:middle line:90%
for the government.

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And they have the right to
generate subpoena power,

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:58.670 align:middle line:84%
to get the attorney
general to issue subpoenas.

00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:01.490 align:middle line:84%
They have a right to
go to court and order

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:03.770 align:middle line:90%
them to produce this stuff.

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:05.588 align:middle line:84%
Now, what people
say, of course, well,

00:27:05.588 --> 00:27:07.130 align:middle line:84%
that could take
forever if they start

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:09.350 align:middle line:84%
dragging you through the courts
and the whole nine yards.

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:11.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, the fact of the
matter is that they

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:13.520 align:middle line:84%
are authorized to go
directly to the site

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:18.140 align:middle line:84%
itself and demand to have
access to that information.

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:21.590 align:middle line:84%
And they can be held
in contempt of Congress

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:23.217 align:middle line:90%
for refusing to do it.

00:27:23.217 --> 00:27:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
you're going to start

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.883 align:middle line:84%
see the bite on this thing
the first that happens.

00:27:26.883 --> 00:27:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, what if we have--

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:29.900 align:middle line:90%
this is my biggest fear.

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:32.200 align:middle line:90%
And, Josh, you can laugh.

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:36.590 align:middle line:84%
This is my biggest fear is that
we have that Al Capone's vault

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:39.110 align:middle line:90%
moment where we show up.

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:41.230 align:middle line:90%
We're live streaming.

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:42.530 align:middle line:90%
Everybody is there.

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:46.210 align:middle line:84%
We've got the news, and we
swing open the hangar doors,

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:47.560 align:middle line:90%
and they're empty.

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:50.200 align:middle line:90%
What do we do with that?

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And is that breaking
the law if they

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:58.180 align:middle line:90%
have moved a craft off site?

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:04.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it will be punishable
as contempt of Congress.

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And then you would
move to have them

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:11.440 align:middle line:84%
indicted by the attorney general
for contempt of Congress.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that like witness
tampering almost?

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's
destruction of evidence.

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.645 align:middle line:90%
>> Destruction of evidence.

00:28:16.645 --> 00:28:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and it's obstructing
justice, you know.

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:22.482 align:middle line:84%
And so it's peculiar here
in this particular case.

00:28:22.482 --> 00:28:23.440 align:middle line:90%
It's a little esoteric.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.980 align:middle line:84%
But since there's no criminal
charges at issue here

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:31.270 align:middle line:84%
and there's no at least civil
litigation going right now,

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:33.640 align:middle line:84%
the way in which they
would be held in contempt

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:36.370 align:middle line:84%
would be held in
contempt of Congress, who

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:38.693 align:middle line:90%
are demanding this information.

00:28:38.693 --> 00:28:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
they'll do is they'll

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.020 align:middle line:90%
go through issuing subpoenas.

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:44.220 align:middle line:84%
If they don't
voluntarily cough it up,

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:47.630 align:middle line:84%
there's this particular
time period in which

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:49.380 align:middle line:90%
they have to give it over.

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:52.580 align:middle line:84%
They have 300 days from
the passage of this statute

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:55.550 align:middle line:90%
on December 22 of 2023.

00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:58.790 align:middle line:84%
They have 300 days,
basically, almost one year,

00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:04.760 align:middle line:84%
to gather this all together and
give it over to this committee.

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And the committee
then has 180 days

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:15.680 align:middle line:84%
within which to release
it all to the public.

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And the agency that
produces the information

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:24.170 align:middle line:84%
has the right to petition
to have it exempted.

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And they have this
very burdensome--

00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:29.270 align:middle line:84%
it has to be clear and
convincing evidence

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:32.210 align:middle line:84%
that any revelation of
that particular information

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:34.250 align:middle line:84%
is going to cause
substantial damage

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:35.630 align:middle line:90%
to the national security.

00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:37.517 align:middle line:84%
And they have to be
specific about that.

00:29:37.517 --> 00:29:39.350 align:middle line:84%
You can't just say, oh,
it's going to damage

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:40.440 align:middle line:90%
the national security.

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.523 align:middle line:84%
That's what they said in
the Pentagon Papers case.

00:29:42.523 --> 00:29:44.763 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can't publish
anything in these papers,

00:29:44.763 --> 00:29:46.430 align:middle line:84%
because it's going
to irrevocably damage

00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:48.222 align:middle line:84%
the national security
of the United States.

00:29:48.222 --> 00:29:52.130 align:middle line:84%
So when I was in chambers for
the "New York Times," I said,

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:53.058 align:middle line:90%
like what?

00:29:53.058 --> 00:29:55.100 align:middle line:84%
He said, oh, we can't tell
you, because you don't

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:56.540 align:middle line:90%
have the proper clearances.

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:58.670 align:middle line:84%
And then the judge said,
Murray Gurfein said, well,

00:29:58.670 --> 00:29:59.280 align:middle line:90%
what about me?

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.530 align:middle line:90%
You can tell me what it is.

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:02.822 align:middle line:10%
And he said, no, you don't
have the clearances, either.

00:30:02.822 --> 00:30:04.665 align:middle line:90%
That's that old line.

00:30:04.665 --> 00:30:06.290 align:middle line:84%
We're the only ones
that are in charge.

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:07.790 align:middle line:90%
We know best for everybody.

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:09.800 align:middle line:84%
That's what's got
to get stopped.

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's the statute
that is here to stop it.

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And our job as the New Paradigm
Institute is to enforce it,

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.580 align:middle line:84%
is to make sure that the
citizens are constantly

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:23.450 align:middle line:84%
notified about what's going on,
brought up to date every week.

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:29.270 align:middle line:84%
What we're going to do is have
probably weekly shows telling

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:30.410 align:middle line:90%
what happened this week.

00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>> I think this is
where we are right now.

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.370 align:middle line:84%
When you look at
this legislation

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:39.260 align:middle line:84%
and you look what's going
into the NDAA, is the Senate--

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:42.100 align:middle line:84%
are they fully
clear that this is

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:48.700 align:middle line:84%
an extraterrestrial
alien contact, UFO issue?

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.890 align:middle line:90%
Or is it hidden under--

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:55.780 align:middle line:84%
are the discussions that they're
having are UAP and adversarial

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:59.200 align:middle line:84%
Chinese and Russian
secret weapons,

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.650 align:middle line:84%
that this is an off
world conversation?

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>> This is an off
world conversation.

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:05.470 align:middle line:90%
They know it.

00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And all the other stuff
is explicitly excluded,

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:11.050 align:middle line:84%
saying we're not talking
about anything that has

00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:12.395 align:middle line:90%
been produced by human beings.

00:31:12.395 --> 00:31:14.020 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking
about anything that's

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:16.840 align:middle line:84%
been produced by Russia or
China or any other country

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:18.130 align:middle line:90%
or even us.

00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:21.220 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
the other stuff.

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
subject is here.

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's the information
they have to turn over.

00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:27.280 align:middle line:90%
What about that stuff?

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And they talk right about--
they include it in definitions.

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Pull up the
definition session.

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:33.550 align:middle line:90%
I've got to see this.

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Page four, they say it
includes everything from flying

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:39.400 align:middle line:90%
saucers.

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:46.670 align:middle line:10%
It says UFOs, flying saucers,
extraterrestrial life,

00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:49.190 align:middle line:10%
all forms of nonhuman
intelligence,

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:51.470 align:middle line:10%
submerged objects.

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:52.455 align:middle line:90%
All of them are here.

00:31:52.455 --> 00:31:53.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Doesn't seem real.

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:53.900 align:middle line:90%
It's surreal.

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:54.590 align:middle line:90%
It's so surreal.

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:55.040 align:middle line:90%
>> It's crazy.

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:55.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:59.720 align:middle line:84%
>> So these nine appointees,
so they get appointed.

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:03.440 align:middle line:84%
How do we guarantee that
they don't get compromised?

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:07.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they're going to be
like any Supreme Court justice

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:12.170 align:middle line:84%
or like any other Senator or
anything that if, in fact,

00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:14.870 align:middle line:84%
they were approached and someone
tries to compromise them,

00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:17.660 align:middle line:84%
they're going to be
duty-bound to report that.

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And it'll be a
contempt of Congress

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:23.930 align:middle line:84%
because this is a
government agency.

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:26.330 align:middle line:84%
They're actually creating
a government agency.

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And so they say
they're to be treated

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:30.050 align:middle line:84%
as a government
agency for purposes

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:31.890 align:middle line:90%
of subpoena power, et cetera.

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And so that would be an attempt
to interfere in a government

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:37.872 align:middle line:84%
process, obstruct a
government process.

00:32:37.872 --> 00:32:38.705 align:middle line:90%
That's what this is.

00:32:38.705 --> 00:32:40.920 align:middle line:84%
This process of
disclosure is underway.

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And if you try to
interfere with it,

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:44.670 align:middle line:90%
you can be criminally charged.

00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:49.520 align:middle line:84%
>> So what do we do when we
have whistleblowers that testify

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:53.750 align:middle line:84%
special access programs and
corporations and reverse

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:56.080 align:middle line:84%
engineering and
alien technology?

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.220 align:middle line:84%
The question comes
up about patents.

00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And who actually
owns this technology?

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:02.090 align:middle line:90%
Is this going to be addressed?

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:03.440 align:middle line:90%
>> It's already addressed.

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:07.040 align:middle line:84%
This statute asserts
eminent domain

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:11.270 align:middle line:84%
over all of the materials
and all the technology

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:13.970 align:middle line:84%
so that it comes into the
possession of the United States

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:15.170 align:middle line:90%
government.

00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:18.020 align:middle line:84%
I've already raised it in
a number of discussions

00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:22.610 align:middle line:84%
to not allow anybody who has
access to this information

00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:26.960 align:middle line:84%
to try to seek a private right
of intellectual property to it.

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:29.090 align:middle line:84%
It's not like at
the universities

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:32.360 align:middle line:84%
where they can get a
patent or something.

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:35.240 align:middle line:84%
We've taken a position
they can't do that.

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's a
public interest operation

00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:39.740 align:middle line:84%
that we have at the
New Paradigm Institute

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:42.120 align:middle line:84%
to keep anything like
that from happening.

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they
put into this statute

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:45.950 align:middle line:84%
that they're
commandeering and taking

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:48.650 align:middle line:84%
government possession of
all of the information.

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh, do you think that
Congress is doing the right

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:51.750 align:middle line:90%
thing?

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:52.740 align:middle line:90%
>> I hope so.

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:54.050 align:middle line:84%
I know we've been
burned in the past

00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:55.280 align:middle line:90%
before by other committees.

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:56.655 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping this
is the real deal.

00:33:56.655 --> 00:33:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Like, how historic
is this moment?

00:33:58.250 --> 00:33:59.750 align:middle line:90%
Is this as big as I think it is?

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, this is bigger
than you think it is.

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:07.190 align:middle line:84%
This is vastly bigger than
the Church Committee that

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:09.409 align:middle line:84%
was put together
and held hearings

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:11.870 align:middle line:84%
all summer long into
the violations of law

00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:15.949 align:middle line:84%
by the CIA in their
assassination programs

00:34:15.949 --> 00:34:17.179 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's of the scale of
the Watergate burglary

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:26.030 align:middle line:84%
and probably more than
that, because this actually

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:31.280 align:middle line:84%
impacts our future for
the next thousand years.

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:34.940 align:middle line:84%
We are putting together--
they're charged in this statute

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:40.630 align:middle line:84%
with putting together a
controlled disclosure campaign

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:42.429 align:middle line:90%
and giving it to the president.

00:34:42.429 --> 00:34:49.020 align:middle line:84%
>>But, Danny, if the
decision about UFO, UAP,

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:53.340 align:middle line:84%
ET disclosure ultimately
rest with the president,

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:56.429 align:middle line:84%
how can we be assured
that it's going

00:34:56.429 --> 00:35:01.800 align:middle line:84%
to be honest, transparent,
bipartisan, and even further

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:02.970 align:middle line:90%
nonpartisan?

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:06.570 align:middle line:84%
>> What I can say is that in my
many months of being involved

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:10.890 align:middle line:84%
in this process of this statute
is that I know what the basic

00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:12.060 align:middle line:90%
issue is going to be is.

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:15.390 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything--
is there anything

00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:18.870 align:middle line:84%
that any of us that are
in the long-standing UFO

00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:22.260 align:middle line:84%
community are going
to agree should not

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:24.890 align:middle line:90%
be shared with the people?

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And I have a hard time thinking
that there is any such thing.

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:29.080 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:31.930 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, I
haven't been told what it is.

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And I don't go into
hypothesizing to them

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:37.113 align:middle line:84%
what I might find
acceptable, because I

00:35:37.113 --> 00:35:38.030 align:middle line:90%
don't want to do that.

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:40.240 align:middle line:84%
I want them to tell
me what they think

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:43.850 align:middle line:84%
needs to be kept secret because
if I don't agree with it

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:45.400 align:middle line:84%
and I think most
of our community

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:49.060 align:middle line:84%
doesn't agree with it, we're
going to continue to demand it,

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:51.700 align:middle line:84%
and that they're going to have
to earn the trust of the people

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:54.140 align:middle line:84%
if they're going to try to
retain anything from us,

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:56.530 align:middle line:84%
which they do not have
at the present time.

00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:58.300 align:middle line:84%
The government of
the United States

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:02.140 align:middle line:84%
does not have the
confidence of the majority

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:04.900 align:middle line:90%
of people at the present time.

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:08.652 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a brand new day when
the UFO vote comes into play.

00:36:08.652 --> 00:36:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I think it's going to
be huge in the next election,

00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:11.910 align:middle line:90%
honestly.

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:13.510 align:middle line:90%
>> It's coming into play.

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:14.780 align:middle line:90%
Danny, thank you so much.

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:16.510 align:middle line:90%
What a great conversation.

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:20.490 align:middle line:84%
For "Into the Vortex,"
I'm Jimmy Church.

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:25.000 align:middle line:90%
