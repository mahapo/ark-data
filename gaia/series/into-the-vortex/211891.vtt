on persistent covert

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.930 align:middle line:90%
100% it is.

I'm your host, Jimmy Church.

And today, my guest is UFO
whistleblower Mike Herrera.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And what's intriguing
about Mike and what

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.860 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be
discussing today

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.710 align:middle line:84%
is whistleblower
protection and the ability

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.030 align:middle line:84%
now that we know a whistleblower
can come forward and be

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.220 align:middle line:84%
protected and not
worry, hopefully,

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.660 align:middle line:84%
about his career, his
family, or personal effects

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.590 align:middle line:90%
and protection.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And Josh, when we talk
about whistleblowers,

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.740 align:middle line:84%
and specifically
UFO whistleblowers,

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.790 align:middle line:84%
now we're getting into black
projects and intelligence

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.690 align:middle line:84%
agencies and the
military and very deep,

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.630 align:middle line:90%
possibly very dark areas.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:00.680 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready for this?

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.590 align:middle line:90%
This is going to be--

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.423 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be one
of those conversations.

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>> This is
super-serious material,

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.640 align:middle line:84%
but I am overly excited, but I'm
trying to temper it to keep it

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.030 align:middle line:90%
serious.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.250 align:middle line:10%
So yeah, I'm really excited
for this conversation.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.680 align:middle line:90%
- Mike, let's start here.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.440 align:middle line:84%
First off, thank you
for coming forward.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, thank you for
allowing me to be here.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>> The first thought that
everybody thinks about is this

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.230 align:middle line:84%
is, well, you have the
fantastical part of it,

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.340 align:middle line:84%
the unbelievable part, but
then the intimidation part.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.920 align:middle line:84%
You have the government
cover-up part.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And there are probably two
different factions when it

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.240 align:middle line:84%
comes to this that want
this information to come out

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.890 align:middle line:90%
and those that don't.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And those that don't
will do anything

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.240 align:middle line:90%
to protect these secrets.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.320 align:middle line:84%
Have you felt that kind of
pressure, and does it occur?

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So I do know for
a fact that it does.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And as far as the
cover-up aspect of it,

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.230 align:middle line:84%
there are people in the
government who know about this

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.880 align:middle line:84%
who are pretending
that they don't.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.040 align:middle line:84%
The other aspect of
it, too, is maybe

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.680 align:middle line:84%
because they're afraid to speak
out because of retaliation

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.410 align:middle line:84%
from these agencies or these
organizations that have access

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.060 align:middle line:84%
to this stuff on
a regular basis.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.000 align:middle line:10%
if these guys have
a monetary system

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.220 align:middle line:10%
where they're in
their own self, where

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.220 align:middle line:10%
they can generate their own
funds, have their own military,

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.400 align:middle line:10%
so to speak, have their
own Navy, Air Force,

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.100 align:middle line:10%
if you will, and they have
access to technologies that

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.270 align:middle line:10%
are more cutting-edge than
what our current military has

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.600 align:middle line:10%
and our most sophisticated
planes, like the F-35, F-22,

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.630 align:middle line:10%
and B2, and what they
have is multiples

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.590 align:middle line:10%
of what that would be.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, to be clear, we're
talking about extraterrestrial

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.790 align:middle line:84%
intelligence, crash
retrievals, contact with ET.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Let's not beat
around the bush here.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.230 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking about
adversarial technology,

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.810 align:middle line:84%
some kind of foreign
technology department,

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:49.980 align:middle line:90%
and we're looking into that.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.710 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
off-world craft

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.470 align:middle line:84%
and extraterrestrial
civilizations.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>> As you started
to get into this,

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.780 align:middle line:84%
did you have a knowledge of
ET, or did you have a contact

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:04.680 align:middle line:90%
experience?

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.150 align:middle line:84%
Or was this something
completely new to you?

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So in 2009 when I had
my event that I witnessed,

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.040 align:middle line:90%
I was against it.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.250 align:middle line:84%
I didn't believe in any
of that kind of stuff.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.160 align:middle line:84%
But seeing that craft
there in Indonesia in 2009,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.300 align:middle line:90%
the kind of technology--

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.817 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was very well
versed in modern-day aircraft.

00:04:22.817 --> 00:04:24.900 align:middle line:84%
I could tell what weapons
systems they have on it,

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.700 align:middle line:90%
things like that.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.060 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be a pilot,
especially a fighter pilot.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.110 align:middle line:84%
So seeing something like that
and understanding what its

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.110 align:middle line:84%
nature was, something that
didn't make a sound when it

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.132 align:middle line:84%
flew when I saw it
bank over the horizon,

00:04:36.132 --> 00:04:38.590 align:middle line:84%
something that could just hover
there, as massive as it is,

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.960 align:middle line:84%
seemed like it's weightless--
and it just emitted

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.820 align:middle line:90%
a transformer-type noise--

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.380 align:middle line:90%
it confirmed two things for me.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.450 align:middle line:84%
One, that we have this
kind of technology--

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.610 align:middle line:84%
and I mean humans
have access to this--

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.420 align:middle line:84%
and it also confirms that they
got it from someplace that

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.450 align:middle line:90%
is not of Earth but off-world.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, I have an image here.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.200 align:middle line:90%
Josh.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.840 align:middle line:84%
I have an image
here that Josh is

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.240 align:middle line:84%
going to pull up
that depicts what

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.160 align:middle line:90%
you witnessed in Indonesia.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And this will help
people understand.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.540 align:middle line:84%
It's the theater
of the mind, right?

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.570 align:middle line:84%
We can talk about it, but
we also have a visual here.

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.120 align:middle line:84%
So describe what
we're looking at here.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Does that accurately
show the craft?

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it does.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And that craft was about
300 feet in diameter.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:23.890 align:middle line:90%
It was pretty massive.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.170 align:middle line:84%
The scale of the vehicles
underneath on that landing

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.890 align:middle line:84%
platform are very close to
what the distance would be.

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.200 align:middle line:84%
When we came down
that slope, we were

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.360 align:middle line:84%
intercepted by a team of
operators, Deep Black, that

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.350 align:middle line:90%
were American.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.090 align:middle line:90%
They spoke English very well.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.190 align:middle line:84%
Their dialects were the
same as you and I talking.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.773 align:middle line:84%
They had the same
kind of gear that we

00:05:43.773 --> 00:05:46.330 align:middle line:84%
did but a little bit more
high-speed, American weapons

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.870 align:middle line:84%
systems, American IR
lasers, things like that.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.993 align:middle line:90%
So knowing at that time--

00:05:54.993 --> 00:05:56.410 align:middle line:84%
we had been briefed
that there may

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.380 align:middle line:84%
have been other
special operations

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.960 align:middle line:84%
groups out there trying to
handle business of their own.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.830 align:middle line:84%
But all of a sudden, having
them point their weapons at us,

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.010 align:middle line:84%
and taking our weapons
from us and complying

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.490 align:middle line:84%
with their measures to simply
put it, to not be killed,

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.510 align:middle line:84%
and then seeing this
craft in the background

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.870 align:middle line:84%
and seeing how they were
putting these trucks

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.090 align:middle line:84%
with these containers
onto that craft,

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.910 align:middle line:84%
and then watching that craft
leave so fast and how--

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, what would that
indicate to you at that point,

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.120 align:middle line:90%
us or them?

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's suggesting
that it may look ET,

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.638 align:middle line:84%
but it may be us and
our construction.

00:06:34.638 --> 00:06:36.430 align:middle line:84%
Is that what you were
thinking at the time?

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, because there wouldn't
be a human element to it if it

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.240 align:middle line:90%
was ET.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.810 align:middle line:84%
>> So what went
through your mind?

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.180 align:middle line:90%
What were you thinking?

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.802 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, honestly,
I, to a degree,

00:06:45.802 --> 00:06:47.260 align:middle line:84%
thought we were
going to be killed,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.582 align:middle line:84%
because this is something
that you don't stumble onto.

00:06:50.582 --> 00:06:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Not just anybody stumbles
onto this, especially

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:53.680 align:middle line:90%
humanitarian missions.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.050 align:middle line:84%
We were armed,
and we had M16A4s.

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.223 align:middle line:84%
But at that time,
I thought, yeah,

00:06:58.223 --> 00:07:00.640 align:middle line:84%
we could have been killed the
way they were talking to us.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.723 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I thought.

00:07:01.723 --> 00:07:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're saying that that
craft was landing and taking

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.590 align:middle line:84%
off from, ascending
and descending,

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:11.330 align:middle line:84%
from an existing
platform in the jungle?

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:12.130 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:15.683 align:middle line:84%
That platform was a
part of that craft.

00:07:15.683 --> 00:07:16.600 align:middle line:90%
That's the difference.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.120 align:middle line:90%
So imagine this.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.150 align:middle line:84%
One solid piece-- because
this went up into the craft.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.030 align:middle line:84%
It was completely--
when this thing went up,

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.550 align:middle line:84%
it was level on the
bottom of the craft.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:28.520 align:middle line:90%
It went into it.

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.830 align:middle line:84%
This craft, the top
part raised down,

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.760 align:middle line:84%
this one raised up,
met it in the middle,

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.970 align:middle line:84%
and then proceeded to
raise up past the tree line

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.940 align:middle line:84%
and left to clear that, and
then it went over the tree line

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.070 align:middle line:84%
towards the ocean, several
thousand miles an hour,

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:41.528 align:middle line:84%
without breaking
the sound barrier,

00:07:41.528 --> 00:07:44.510 align:middle line:84%
without disturbing any of the
trees, any of the coconuts,

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:45.980 align:middle line:90%
any of the vegetation, nothing.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.050 align:middle line:90%
No rotor wash or exhaust, none.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:52.020 align:middle line:84%
>> So that would be
like a tractor trailer.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:56.240 align:middle line:84%
The craft is the tractor,
and the foundation

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.590 align:middle line:90%
would be the trailer.

00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's some kind of
container and compartment

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.190 align:middle line:84%
that is being
transported by the craft?

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:02.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:04.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Very, very interesting.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.400 align:middle line:84%
That's something that you
would never expect to see.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And they've had aircraft that
kind of did the same thing.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Big transport
planes at the bottom

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:13.320 align:middle line:90%
would come off like that.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.810 align:middle line:90%
So I'm wondering if they put--

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.348 align:middle line:84%
in reference of that aircraft,
put it more high-tech,

00:08:17.348 --> 00:08:18.890 align:middle line:84%
and now they have
something that they

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:23.180 align:middle line:84%
can deploy, get stuff on
there, move it out real quick.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.310 align:middle line:84%
It's like a bug-out
operation, if you will.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Quickly, who makes
up these black teams?

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:29.550 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I want to know.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:30.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I think everybody
should know.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:34.105 align:middle line:84%
But during 1947, they
had the National Security

00:08:34.105 --> 00:08:35.730 align:middle line:84%
Act that was established
and was signed

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:37.150 align:middle line:90%
by the president at that time.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:40.140 align:middle line:84%
That's when this black team
organization had been birthed,

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.520 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:45.330 align:middle line:84%
So you have this organization
that, more than likely

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.400 align:middle line:84%
at that time, was handling
the crash retrievals

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.500 align:middle line:84%
in a militaristic
sense, people that

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.910 align:middle line:84%
are different parts
of the government,

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:53.700 align:middle line:84%
or even military
branches that are

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.000 align:middle line:84%
more refined that are able to
handle this kind of nature.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing things that
the conventional government

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.920 align:middle line:84%
does not have access to,
or knowledge, because they

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.030 align:middle line:90%
want to keep it very segmented.

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:04.830 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:08.160 align:middle line:10%
Now, during the '90s when the
Clinton administration came

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.590 align:middle line:10%
into power, they got wind of
the black team's existence

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:12.660 align:middle line:10%
because they wanted to
know if ETs were real.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.710 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to know
if craft were real.

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:16.575 align:middle line:84%
They have different
factions within those

00:09:16.575 --> 00:09:18.700 align:middle line:84%
or different groups in the
black team where they're

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.110 align:middle line:90%
doing their own things--

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:23.290 align:middle line:84%
unregulated, of
course, no oversight

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:26.593 align:middle line:84%
from the president or Congress,
or anybody, for that matter.

00:09:26.593 --> 00:09:28.510 align:middle line:84%
But you have the good
guys in the organization

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.740 align:middle line:84%
that are willing to come
out and talk about that.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:34.750 align:middle line:84%
So as this sits to this
day, there's only one

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.520 align:middle line:84%
big black team, and
there's a blue team.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.172 align:middle line:90%
And that's what is transpiring.

00:09:39.172 --> 00:09:41.380 align:middle line:84%
You have the blue team,
which is trying to figure out

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.230 align:middle line:84%
what black team is still
doing, but within black team,

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:46.390 align:middle line:84%
you have a war going
on with itself,

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:48.250 align:middle line:90%
with these good and bad guys.

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:51.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, we hear a lot about
special-access programs.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.020 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of talk
about that right now.

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
the term is used

00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:59.770 align:middle line:90%
too freely and too loosely.

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:03.130 align:middle line:84%
This would indicate to me
a special-access program

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:06.220 align:middle line:84%
at a level that most of
us wouldn't understand.

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.600 align:middle line:84%
What's your definition of
a special-access program?

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.400 align:middle line:90%


00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Just how we would use it,
special access meaning that

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.830 align:middle line:84%
only a certain type of people
that hold certain clearances

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:19.830 align:middle line:84%
or read into it are going
to have access to that.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:23.370 align:middle line:84%
John Q. Public will not because
he has no business being inside

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.920 align:middle line:84%
of a program because he's
not with the organizations,

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.380 align:middle line:84%
let alone doing the work,
whatever it might be.

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:29.730 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.248 align:middle line:84%
And the way that
it works is-- let's

00:10:31.248 --> 00:10:32.790 align:middle line:84%
say if you're working
on a propulsion

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:35.520 align:middle line:84%
system on a craft, like
an airplane, for example,

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.930 align:middle line:90%
and it's classified.

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:38.685 align:middle line:84%
I'm working on the
weapons system.

00:10:38.685 --> 00:10:40.560 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to know
what I'm working on,

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.240 align:middle line:84%
just like I'm not going to
know what you're working on.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.282 align:middle line:84%
They keep it very
compartmentalized for a reason.

00:10:44.282 --> 00:10:45.150 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:46.900 align:middle line:90%
What about the funding of this?

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And if you are going
to fund it and you're

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:53.070 align:middle line:84%
dealing with the
backwards engineering

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:59.370 align:middle line:84%
of some off-world technology,
who determines what corporation

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:03.542 align:middle line:84%
is working on said tech, and who
determines how it gets funded?

00:11:03.542 --> 00:11:06.000 align:middle line:84%
>> What I understand-- and this
is what I've been told from

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.710 align:middle line:84%
some of these guys in
this organization--

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:10.530 align:middle line:84%
is that they embezzle funds
out of the black budget

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:14.080 align:middle line:84%
of the government with these
special-access programs.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.110 align:middle line:84%
They will say something costs
$2 billion to $3 billion

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:19.060 align:middle line:84%
when it really
cost $100 million,

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.980 align:middle line:84%
and they will funnel
the rest of it

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:24.490 align:middle line:84%
to their own means,
whatever it is,

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:28.690 align:middle line:84%
developing weapons systems
or craft or any kind

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:29.530 align:middle line:90%
of other technology.

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:31.155 align:middle line:84%
Now, what people have
got to understand

00:11:31.155 --> 00:11:35.230 align:middle line:84%
is that the flying stuff that
people are so enamored by

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:36.580 align:middle line:90%
is just transport.

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:37.930 align:middle line:90%
It's boring to them.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:39.430 align:middle line:84%
There's other stuff
that they have

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:41.143 align:middle line:84%
that is far more
interesting, stuff

00:11:41.143 --> 00:11:42.310 align:middle line:90%
that I have no knowledge of.

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:44.860 align:middle line:84%
I know of some weapon
systems that they told me

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:47.620 align:middle line:84%
that exist that they
use on a regular basis,

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.020 align:middle line:84%
but they all think the
flying aspects are boring.

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:55.900 align:middle line:84%
>> The weapon systems, transport
systems, flight systems,

00:11:55.900 --> 00:12:01.030 align:middle line:84%
whatever we're talking
about here in this case,

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:05.080 align:middle line:84%
do they all have
extraterrestrial origins?

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:08.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, and I'll explain why.

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:10.240 align:middle line:90%
When I was briefed on this--

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.840 align:middle line:84%
and after I briefed Senate
Intelligence Committee,

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.540 align:middle line:84%
among other people, and came out
publicly with this information,

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:20.260 align:middle line:84%
I got a hold of a lot of people,
disturbed a lot of people.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.180 align:middle line:84%
This organization
that's been doing it,

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:24.280 align:middle line:84%
they have some good guys
in this organization that

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.608 align:middle line:90%
are wanting to come forward.

00:12:25.608 --> 00:12:27.400 align:middle line:84%
They're whistleblowers
in their own degree,

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.320 align:middle line:84%
but they can't come
out the way that I did.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.270 align:middle line:84%
They can't pursue
anything because they're

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:32.600 align:middle line:90%
tight-knit in this group.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:36.700 align:middle line:84%
It's maybe a big organization,
to a degree, on a global scale,

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:41.710 align:middle line:84%
but it's still small in
a matter of relativity.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:43.270 align:middle line:90%
It's very intertwined.

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:46.370 align:middle line:84%
People are very well woven
into it in all aspects,

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:50.110 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the judicial
system, entrepreneurship,

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:52.810 align:middle line:84%
military applications, law
enforcement, you name it.

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:55.520 align:middle line:84%
They're well woven into
almost every industry.

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's easy for
them to communicate

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:59.540 align:middle line:84%
when somebody has defected
out of that organization.

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:01.450 align:middle line:84%
So they're very
worried about that.

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:06.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I was told
and what I was shown

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:08.360 align:middle line:84%
was the containers
I talked about that

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.500 align:middle line:84%
were these trucks were
driving onto this platform

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.375 align:middle line:84%
and these containers
that they were pulling--

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:15.680 align:middle line:84%
and they had an HVAC
system on the top of them--

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.397 align:middle line:84%
that is what got these guys'
attention because they saw

00:13:18.397 --> 00:13:20.230 align:middle line:84%
and they were using
these same exact things.

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:21.890 align:middle line:90%
>> HVAC being air conditioning.

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Air conditioning or oxygen
supply, things like that.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.000 align:middle line:90%
Climate control, you name it.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.380 align:middle line:84%
They didn't
specifically tell me.

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:30.242 align:middle line:84%
But that's what
they're used to seeing,

00:13:30.242 --> 00:13:32.200 align:middle line:84%
and that's what they were
used to transporting.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:36.700 align:middle line:84%
So the guy that contacted me
through some of my contacts

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:41.020 align:middle line:84%
and briefed me on what they were
doing with these people was--

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:43.630 align:middle line:84%
it was still nerve-wracking
because they're still

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:45.020 align:middle line:90%
using a human element.

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:48.385 align:middle line:84%
So what's going on is
they're screening people

00:13:48.385 --> 00:13:49.510 align:middle line:90%
from third-world countries.

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:51.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.050 align:middle line:90%
Stop right there.

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:59.240 align:middle line:84%
You're suggesting that these
containers contain humans?

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>> When you suggest human
trafficking coming from other

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:10.160 align:middle line:84%
countries, what is so special
about that they would need

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.960 align:middle line:90%
somebody from another country?

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, look at this
system this country is

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:14.630 align:middle line:90%
in, for example.

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:15.650 align:middle line:90%
Look at the influence.

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:18.200 align:middle line:84%
You have social media basically
programming the youth,

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.190 align:middle line:90%
and television, you name it.

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:21.648 align:middle line:84%
So if you have
countries and people

00:14:21.648 --> 00:14:23.732 align:middle line:84%
who live in those countries
that don't have access

00:14:23.732 --> 00:14:25.340 align:middle line:84%
to stuff like
that, they're going

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:27.860 align:middle line:84%
to have to fill their time
with other realistic means

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:30.890 align:middle line:84%
of interaction, stimulating
their conscience system

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:32.730 align:middle line:90%
in a lot of different ways.

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:36.590 align:middle line:84%
So if they're not
"programmed," quote unquote,

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:39.830 align:middle line:84%
by media or whatever, you
name it-- social media,

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:41.250 align:middle line:90%
for example--

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:43.848 align:middle line:84%
they're going to be more of a
naturally higher elevation when

00:14:43.848 --> 00:14:45.890 align:middle line:84%
it comes to consciousness
because they don't have

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:48.560 align:middle line:84%
anything clouding their judgment
or their ability to learn that.

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.760 align:middle line:90%
>> For what purpose?

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.910 align:middle line:84%
>> The purpose, in itself, is to
connect to technology that this

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:55.680 align:middle line:84%
black team cannot
connect to naturally.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.240 align:middle line:90%
They are not elevated enough.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Flight control systems?

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:00.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Any kind of
technology advanced.

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:02.370 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, it could be
flight control systems.

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:04.030 align:middle line:90%
It could be numerous things.

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:06.660 align:middle line:84%
But in our world, the only
thing that we're accustomed to

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:08.695 align:middle line:90%
is the UFO aspect of craft.

00:15:08.695 --> 00:15:11.070 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we're going to
reference this to a lot of.

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:12.612 align:middle line:84%
But they have other
technologies that

00:15:12.612 --> 00:15:14.130 align:middle line:84%
are way more
mind-blowing than that.

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:14.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Such as?

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:17.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Weapons systems, among
other things that I'm not

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.420 align:middle line:90%
in the knowledge of.

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:21.270 align:middle line:84%
I just know of certain weapon
systems and this craft.

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:26.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, because the black team
cannot access this technology,

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:29.132 align:middle line:84%
they have a machine that
hooks up to these individuals.

00:15:29.132 --> 00:15:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And these individuals come
from third-world countries

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.020 align:middle line:84%
that are not very hospitable
places to want to live.

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:35.700 align:middle line:84%
So if they're given
a lavish lifestyle

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.780 align:middle line:84%
where they're given all
the resources they need,

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:39.530 align:middle line:84%
they're taken care of,
they're always fed,

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:41.330 align:middle line:84%
they're always hydrated,
they have medical attention,

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.710 align:middle line:84%
they have housing, they
have whatever they want,

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:45.320 align:middle line:84%
they have a choice to either
stay on these programs

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.120 align:middle line:90%
or go back.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.680 align:middle line:90%
They always stay.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:51.490 align:middle line:84%
These subjects are also
flooded with serotonin

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:53.500 align:middle line:84%
and a bunch of
other chemicals that

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.210 align:middle line:84%
produce the same
responses to keep

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:57.190 align:middle line:90%
them elevated at consciousness.

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And the reason being
is because if you're

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:00.550 align:middle line:84%
feeling good all
the time and you're

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:02.450 align:middle line:90%
at an elevated consciousness--

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:03.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Happy.

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:04.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, happy.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:07.047 align:middle line:84%
You're able to access
technology very easy.

00:16:07.047 --> 00:16:09.130 align:middle line:84%
You can't be evil or greedy
or anything like that.

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:09.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Or sad.

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:10.763 align:middle line:90%
>> Or sad, right.

00:16:10.763 --> 00:16:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people who do
meditation and things like that

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.597 align:middle line:84%
understand how
this concept works.

00:16:14.597 --> 00:16:17.410 align:middle line:84%
So they flood these people
with these chemicals.

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And they unfortunately die
after a certain amount of time.

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's not immediate, but
prolonged use at these levels

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:24.620 align:middle line:90%
does.

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:26.828 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like somebody
going through chemotherapy.

00:16:26.828 --> 00:16:27.857 align:middle line:90%
They feel good.

00:16:27.857 --> 00:16:29.440 align:middle line:84%
They're dying, but
they're giving them

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.580 align:middle line:84%
drugs that make them
feel good, and they

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:31.830 align:middle line:90%
don't feel like they're dying.

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:34.187 align:middle line:84%
So they'll say, yeah, I
feel good all the time.

00:16:34.187 --> 00:16:35.770 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of the
same thing with this.

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:39.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, if they're at an elevated
consciousness also chemically,

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.830 align:middle line:84%
and they have these machines,
and the black team has

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:45.070 align:middle line:84%
these machines that hook up
to these individuals, which

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:47.720 align:middle line:84%
then these individuals
hook up to this technology,

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:51.290 align:middle line:84%
and relay to the black team
of how they could utilize it,

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:54.050 align:middle line:84%
how they could benefit from it,
what they could turn it into,

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:57.860 align:middle line:84%
they're basically kind of the
seeing-eye dog for this team.

00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:59.110 align:middle line:90%
That's what they use them for.

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.450 align:middle line:84%
The people that are not
at that genetic level

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:03.610 align:middle line:84%
to possess a consciousness
that's higher--

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:06.310 align:middle line:84%
more than the average
person, so to speak--

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:07.839 align:middle line:90%
they're used from other means.

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:11.200 align:middle line:84%
They're used for facilities
maintenance, scrubbing toilets,

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.150 align:middle line:84%
anything that they
basically can keep

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:15.160 align:middle line:84%
self-sufficient without
having to hire people

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.270 align:middle line:90%
from the outside.

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:19.510 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is they
have a breeding program that

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:21.400 align:middle line:84%
they've explained to
me of taking somebody,

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.830 align:middle line:84%
the best people that have a
higher morale-- a morality,

00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:25.630 align:middle line:90%
anyway--

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:27.790 align:middle line:84%
they have higher intelligence,
they have higher brawn,

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:29.457 align:middle line:84%
they have higher
understanding, and they

00:17:29.457 --> 00:17:31.720 align:middle line:84%
use these people to also
help work on things too.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:35.170 align:middle line:84%
>> This conversation has
gotten dark for me personally.

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And I know the feelings
that this generates

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:40.460 align:middle line:90%
and this subject matter.

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:41.950 align:middle line:90%
It's delicate.

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:44.650 align:middle line:84%
But is there a positive
side from this?

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:46.982 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the positive
aspect, I think,

00:17:46.982 --> 00:17:48.440 align:middle line:84%
would be the
knowledge to come out.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And if the positive
is the knowledge

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:51.447 align:middle line:84%
comes out to the right
people, then they

00:17:51.447 --> 00:17:55.330 align:middle line:84%
will put a good sense of
getting this well-regulated

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:58.250 align:middle line:84%
in a way that's not going
to be harmful to people.

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:01.880 align:middle line:10%
I mean, granted, it's a
risk, but at the same token,

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:06.800 align:middle line:10%
the relieving factor is
that they're provided for.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.570 align:middle line:84%
They're not like
what I was originally

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:11.720 align:middle line:84%
thinking-- taken against their
will, kidnapped, if you will.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.220 align:middle line:90%
They're actually provided for.

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:14.390 align:middle line:90%
They're well taken care of.

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.880 align:middle line:84%
They actually participate
on their own free will.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think if that is the case,
down the road in the future--

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.970 align:middle line:84%
it may be 10, 20, 30
years from now-- who's

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:25.400 align:middle line:84%
to say that a normal person
couldn't get recruited

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.940 align:middle line:84%
into a program, one that has
the safety net that they're not

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:31.790 align:middle line:84%
having to partake in an
illegal nature right now?

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:35.360 align:middle line:84%
But it could be the point
where humans can interface

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.610 align:middle line:84%
with different
technologies that may even

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:40.640 align:middle line:84%
expand human consciousness to
a degree that would even change

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.110 align:middle line:90%
our world for the better.

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:45.320 align:middle line:84%
>> The questions
about shootdowns,

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.330 align:middle line:90%
it reminds me of David Grush.

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:51.330 align:middle line:10%
And now we've got "biologics"
out there as a word these days.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:52.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:53.990 align:middle line:84%
That reminds me--
when they shoot down

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:56.348 align:middle line:84%
these craft, the ones
that are ET-based,

00:18:56.348 --> 00:18:57.890 align:middle line:84%
what do they know
about the biologics

00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:59.265 align:middle line:84%
aboard those craft
or the beings?

00:18:59.265 --> 00:19:00.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, they retrieve them.

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:01.790 align:middle line:90%
And they do have them.

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:03.538 align:middle line:90%
I know that for a fact--

00:19:03.538 --> 00:19:04.580 align:middle line:90%
at least what I was told.

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:07.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, they didn't go too
much into the specifics

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:10.820 align:middle line:84%
of what they look like or
what even the craft look like,

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:13.610 align:middle line:84%
for example, but
they did confirm

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:16.430 align:middle line:84%
that they do have biologics
in their possession.

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:18.590 align:middle line:84%
How they have them stored
or how they have them

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:20.450 align:middle line:84%
in these installations,
I have no idea.

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:22.010 align:middle line:84%
But they confirmed
that they do have

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:23.315 align:middle line:90%
biologics in these facilities.

00:19:23.315 --> 00:19:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Are any of these biologics
working side by side with

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:27.590 align:middle line:90%
humans?

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't think so, not if
they're shooting them down

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:33.548 align:middle line:84%
and they have the remains that
they keep at these facilities.

00:19:33.548 --> 00:19:35.090 align:middle line:84%
I think what they're
doing is they're

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:38.000 align:middle line:84%
shooting these beings
down with their craft,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.470 align:middle line:84%
reverse engineering,
however they

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:42.230 align:middle line:84%
do that with the psionic
perpetual programs.

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:44.630 align:middle line:84%
At least these individuals
are able to relay to them.

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And the reason being
is because they

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:48.620 align:middle line:84%
would have told me if these
people could communicate

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:49.460 align:middle line:90%
with the ETs.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:53.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you take this
information to the Senate

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:54.740 align:middle line:90%
and the Intelligence Committee?

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:55.773 align:middle line:90%
Did you share this?

00:19:55.773 --> 00:19:58.190 align:middle line:84%
>> I did not share this, but
the gentleman that briefed me

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:01.100 align:middle line:84%
on this information that's
in this organization did.

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>> And?

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:04.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the member of the
Senate Intelligence Committee

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:07.340 align:middle line:84%
got a hold of me because I
warned him about this first,

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.680 align:middle line:84%
saying that there's a contact
I've been speaking with.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:13.100 align:middle line:84%
Because what I was
not expecting--

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.470 align:middle line:84%
and this kind of turned
my world upside down--

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:19.040 align:middle line:84%
was when I talked about my
testimony in Washington, DC,

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.860 align:middle line:84%
among other platforms,
I was not expecting

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:24.110 align:middle line:84%
to hear from the horse's
mouth of what they were doing

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:25.800 align:middle line:90%
and why.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:29.490 align:middle line:84%
I was expecting to get flak,
which I already am getting.

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:31.860 align:middle line:84%
I was expecting to get
people who were interested,

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:34.380 align:middle line:90%
and in between all of that.

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:37.380 align:middle line:84%
But I was not expecting to have
people in this organization

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:39.940 align:middle line:84%
get a hold of me and explain
why they're doing it.

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And the only reason
why is because when

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:45.090 align:middle line:84%
it comes to this
whole trafficking

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:47.520 align:middle line:84%
aspect and human trafficking,
everybody assumes it's

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.050 align:middle line:90%
like Hollywood.

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:50.730 align:middle line:84%
It's the conspiracies
going around

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:54.090 align:middle line:84%
where they're doing organ
harvesting, blood sacrifices.

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:55.710 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's heard about that.

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:58.350 align:middle line:84%
These guys were
ruffled up so much

00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:01.590 align:middle line:84%
with what I blew the
whistle on and started

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:04.977 align:middle line:84%
talking about the human
trafficking aspect.

00:21:04.977 --> 00:21:06.560 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
be looped into what

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.300 align:middle line:84%
these other elitists are
doing because that's not

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:09.100 align:middle line:90%
what they're doing.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:13.190 align:middle line:84%
>> But can it still be
defined as human trafficking

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:17.840 align:middle line:84%
in the classic pop-culture
version of it if it's done

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:18.920 align:middle line:90%
voluntarily?

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.390 align:middle line:90%
I find that very interesting.

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:22.183 align:middle line:90%
>> It's perception-based.

00:21:22.183 --> 00:21:24.350 align:middle line:84%
It just depends on what
side of the fence you're on.

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:25.760 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's no--

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.843 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it would be
easy to defend if you were.

00:21:27.843 --> 00:21:28.643 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:28.643 --> 00:21:30.500 align:middle line:84%
But here's the thing
that's interesting.

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Just like how the
United States does

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.180 align:middle line:84%
with supplying labor to other
countries to have stuff done--

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:37.850 align:middle line:84%
building, you name it-- these
guys are doing the same thing.

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:43.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, if this is the case,
if I'm understanding you

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:46.880 align:middle line:84%
correctly, this is a
very heavy subject.

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:52.440 align:middle line:84%
If we're looking at and we
observe a craft in the sky,

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:58.140 align:middle line:84%
it could be ET from
another star system, sure.

00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:02.100 align:middle line:84%
It could be us and
our own technology

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.050 align:middle line:90%
flown by Air Force pilots.

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:05.040 align:middle line:90%
It could be drones.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.610 align:middle line:90%
It could be autonomous.

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:07.860 align:middle line:90%
So we have different versions.

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And it could be
all of the above.

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:13.470 align:middle line:84%
But some of these craft,
you're suggesting these

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:16.800 align:middle line:84%
are humans, us,
that are stepping up

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.700 align:middle line:84%
because of their own cognitive
abilities and their higher

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.050 align:middle line:90%
levels of consciousness.

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:25.775 align:middle line:84%
And they are able to interface
with these subsystems.

00:22:25.775 --> 00:22:27.150 align:middle line:84%
Am I understanding
you correctly?

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:28.567 align:middle line:84%
>> That's exactly
what I'm saying,

00:22:28.567 --> 00:22:30.800 align:middle line:84%
and that's exactly
what I was told.

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:32.630 align:middle line:84%
>> What do we do with
this information?

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:36.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is this something where
the media can handle something

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:37.640 align:middle line:90%
like this?

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.950 align:middle line:84%
Is the world ready
for something--

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:43.200 align:middle line:84%
this is really, really
big and heavy stuff.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.723 align:middle line:84%
>> It is, because the reason
why a lot of people are not

00:22:45.723 --> 00:22:48.140 align:middle line:84%
interested in that subject--
because it doesn't talk about

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:48.940 align:middle line:90%
ETs.

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:50.630 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't talk
about aliens, per se.

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:51.430 align:middle line:90%
that's.

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:53.510 align:middle line:84%
What everybody is
so infatuated with.

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:56.450 align:middle line:84%
In comparison to that, having
humans flying this technology

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:58.800 align:middle line:84%
seems boring in
comparison to that.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's not the meat and
potatoes, so to speak,

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:02.868 align:middle line:84%
but it is an explanation
for why people

00:23:02.868 --> 00:23:04.160 align:middle line:90%
are seeing what they're seeing.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.743 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you're seeing
something that's

00:23:05.743 --> 00:23:08.450 align:middle line:84%
unexplainable like a
craft that has no seams,

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:13.340 align:middle line:84%
no ridges, has light that you
can't replicate, very pure, as

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.660 align:middle line:84%
opposed to what I saw, which
had rivets, it had seams,

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:18.500 align:middle line:84%
it had bolts, it had
everything-- manufactured,

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.540 align:middle line:84%
you can tell the difference
between both of those.

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:25.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, my interpretation is that
maybe the Black Team had pilots

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:27.480 align:middle line:90%
that know how to do this.

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they came up with ways to
navigate with these craft that

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:33.450 align:middle line:84%
dumb it down enough for the
black team to actually utilize

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:36.100 align:middle line:84%
for their own purpose instead
of having to use the people.

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.310 align:middle line:90%
And they call it--

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:40.740 align:middle line:84%
it's called psionic
perpetual program,

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:42.570 align:middle line:90%
or P3 is what it's dubbed.

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:44.970 align:middle line:84%
That's what they have
in their inner works,

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:47.010 align:middle line:90%
is what it's known as.

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:49.320 align:middle line:84%
Psionic is what
they label them as,

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.670 align:middle line:90%
psionic people or individuals.

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:54.270 align:middle line:84%
So if they're able
to help them utilize

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:56.790 align:middle line:84%
this technology for their own
means, which they're doing--

00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:58.687 align:middle line:84%
because the weapon
systems that they're

00:23:58.687 --> 00:24:00.270 align:middle line:84%
creating from this
technology, they're

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:03.510 align:middle line:84%
using that to
establish dominance

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:05.690 align:middle line:90%
not only through other means--

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:07.492 align:middle line:84%
not even a conventional
military force

00:24:07.492 --> 00:24:08.950 align:middle line:84%
would have this
kind of technology.

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:12.060 align:middle line:84%
But this gentleman had told
me over their installation

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:15.940 align:middle line:84%
that they have that they took
me to, they're shooting down ET

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:19.060 align:middle line:90%
craft two to three times a year.

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:19.860 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:22.290 align:middle line:90%
First, I can't let this go.

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:25.860 align:middle line:84%
You said they took you
to this installation.

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:26.940 align:middle line:90%
Where was it?

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:28.670 align:middle line:84%
>> I cannot give
you specifications.

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:30.000 align:middle line:90%
That's out West.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.090 align:middle line:90%
>> In the United States?

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:31.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:33.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Western United States.

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:41.115 align:middle line:84%
And these craft that are being
shot down, are they ET craft,

00:24:41.115 --> 00:24:43.980 align:middle line:90%
or are these piloted by humans?

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:45.840 align:middle line:90%
Are we shooting down earthlings?

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.270 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's basically
all of the above.

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:49.650 align:middle line:90%
I'll explain why.

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:52.440 align:middle line:84%
Two to three times a year,
they're shooting down ET craft.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:55.072 align:middle line:84%
And they have a
scalar weapon system.

00:24:55.072 --> 00:24:57.030 align:middle line:84%
The way they described--
the EMP weapon systems

00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:58.560 align:middle line:90%
they have are so refined.

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:00.540 align:middle line:90%
They're so surgical.

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:01.980 align:middle line:90%
So they can hit ET craft.

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:03.670 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
what distance it's at.

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And it basically stuns
it, and it brings it down

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.473 align:middle line:84%
to the ground, and they
have retrieval teams

00:25:07.473 --> 00:25:09.100 align:middle line:90%
ready to go to work.

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.850 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that they
do is they shoot down

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:14.640 align:middle line:84%
other reverse-engineered
craft that

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.610 align:middle line:84%
belonged to different agencies
or different organizations.

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Piloted by who?

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:19.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Humans.

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, is that murder, Josh?

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:23.670 align:middle line:90%
>> I think technically.

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:25.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if they're killed,
but most of the time,

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:26.370 align:middle line:90%
they're not killed.

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:27.510 align:middle line:90%
>> What happens?

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:29.843 align:middle line:84%
>> They interrogate them,
figure out who they're working

00:25:29.843 --> 00:25:32.520 align:middle line:84%
for and what they're doing, and
then they contact the agency

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.210 align:middle line:84%
and say we have
this person here.

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:36.038 align:middle line:84%
What do you want to
do with this vehicle?

00:25:36.038 --> 00:25:37.830 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time they
destroy the vehicles,

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:39.520 align:middle line:90%
they're never recovered.

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.750 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing that's very
upsetting about this is they

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:45.210 align:middle line:84%
don't restrict the
airspace 24/7 like you

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:47.130 align:middle line:84%
would see over a regular
military installation

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:48.180 align:middle line:90%
and these bases.

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And this is a known fact
throughout the world

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.290 align:middle line:90%
in this group.

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And the reason being is
because if you're flying out

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:56.040 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of nowhere,
but all of a sudden,

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:58.710 align:middle line:84%
it's a restricted airspace, but
you visibly cannot see anything

00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:01.980 align:middle line:84%
on the distance, then what
the hell is out there?

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:03.660 align:middle line:84%
So if they only do
it at certain times

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:06.810 align:middle line:84%
where they're doing operations,
and they have private aircraft

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:08.430 align:middle line:84%
that does not respond
to them trying

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:11.470 align:middle line:84%
to divert them off course,
they shoot them down.

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:12.562 align:middle line:90%
They shoot them down.

00:26:12.562 --> 00:26:13.770 align:middle line:90%
They dispose of the wreckage.

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:16.060 align:middle line:84%
They dispose of the corpses,
and they file a missing persons

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:16.860 align:middle line:90%
report.

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:20.290 align:middle line:84%
Because they're so hell-bent on
keeping their secrets secret.

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:22.180 align:middle line:90%
Their locations are secret.

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:24.730 align:middle line:84%
All they care about is
making sure they're not

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:26.650 align:middle line:84%
compromised in that
way, because there's

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:28.960 align:middle line:84%
multiple different
agencies, whether they're

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.740 align:middle line:84%
the good government
or other means,

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:34.690 align:middle line:84%
that they don't want
to have discovering

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:36.070 align:middle line:90%
these installations at all.

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:38.770 align:middle line:84%
>> What did you see when you
went to the installation?

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:41.570 align:middle line:84%
>> I can tell you I saw the
installation, and that's it.

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:43.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Above ground, below ground?

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:44.300 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't say.

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:45.270 align:middle line:90%
I can't get specific.

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:46.670 align:middle line:90%
>> So it was below ground.

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:47.960 align:middle line:90%
How far below ground?

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:49.160 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't say.

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Were there ET craft there?

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't say.

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.055 align:middle line:90%
>> So there was ET craft?

00:26:53.055 --> 00:26:53.855 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't say.

00:26:53.855 --> 00:26:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>> And the reason why
I'm saying all of this--

00:26:56.810 --> 00:27:00.080 align:middle line:84%
and again, thank you for
confirming everything

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:00.980 align:middle line:90%
that I had just--

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:07.700 align:middle line:84%
but if this is going on on
US soil with US tax dollars,

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.470 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't the public
have a right to know?

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And at what point is
there a separation

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:16.730 align:middle line:84%
between national security
and a need to know

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:20.600 align:middle line:84%
and keeping it from the public
and the public's right to know?

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:21.690 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree.

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:23.450 align:middle line:84%
I think it should be
public information

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:25.820 align:middle line:84%
if people's money, hard
work, and tax dollars

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:27.120 align:middle line:90%
are going towards this.

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:28.910 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is
you have a group that

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:31.430 align:middle line:84%
does things very illegal,
very unconstitutional,

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:33.530 align:middle line:84%
that nobody knows about,
and they're making

00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:36.110 align:middle line:90%
a very good payout off of it.

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:39.090 align:middle line:84%
They make money hand over
fist with this so much.

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And so if they were to sell
this technology to the public,

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.700 align:middle line:84%
for example, they're not
going to make as much money

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.620 align:middle line:84%
compared to them
monopolizing it and using it

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:47.770 align:middle line:90%
for their own means.

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:49.710 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they do.

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:53.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's a funding
mechanism-- not only that,

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:55.900 align:middle line:84%
but it secures their livelihood
because they're making money.

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:56.700 align:middle line:90%
It's cash.

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.063 align:middle line:90%
It's untraceable.

00:27:59.063 --> 00:28:00.480 align:middle line:84%
They can keep it
on them, whatever

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.510 align:middle line:90%
they want to do with it.

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:04.620 align:middle line:84%
They siphon funds out
of the black budget too.

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:06.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, the specifics of
that, I have no idea.

00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:09.750 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that they do a
lot of cash-based transactions

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:11.280 align:middle line:84%
of what they're
either purchasing,

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.975 align:middle line:90%
selling, whatever it might be.

00:28:12.975 --> 00:28:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think that having
all the branches of government

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:26.040 align:middle line:84%
right now exposed to this where
the money is being dispersed--

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:30.000 align:middle line:84%
there isn't any accountability
of where this money is going,

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.720 align:middle line:84%
but it's one thing to have
it going to a weapon system

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:36.070 align:middle line:84%
that you don't want our
adversaries to know about.

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:39.210 align:middle line:84%
I think we all understand that,
and we can make sense of it.

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:42.090 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole other matter
when the Senate and Congress

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:43.770 align:middle line:84%
and the White House
is finding out

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:47.730 align:middle line:84%
that this funding is
going to extraterrestrial

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:50.550 align:middle line:84%
backwards-engineering
weapons development,

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:52.960 align:middle line:84%
and it's catching
them by surprise.

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.960 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that
there will now start

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:58.223 align:middle line:84%
to be an accountability with
the special access programs?

00:28:58.223 --> 00:29:00.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that's what
they're working on right now.

00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:01.890 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what
the big push is.

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And there's some speculations
of some laws dropping here

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.160 align:middle line:84%
in the near future talking
about eminent domain and all

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.110 align:middle line:90%
this technology.

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:12.277 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, if
people are using

00:29:12.277 --> 00:29:13.860 align:middle line:84%
this in very illegal
means and they're

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:16.290 align:middle line:84%
murdering innocent
people, I think

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:19.140 align:middle line:84%
it should be stopped 100%, or
at least government intervention

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:21.600 align:middle line:84%
at some point-- because
of the severity of this,

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:22.960 align:middle line:90%
getting the government involved.

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Because if they're involved
with this and people

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.930 align:middle line:84%
know about it in the government
and they put a stop to it,

00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:30.358 align:middle line:84%
a lot of innocent things
can stop being destroyed.

00:29:30.358 --> 00:29:32.400 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is the
narrative of them pushing.

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:36.170 align:middle line:84%
Because if you have
somebody who's not getting--

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:38.142 align:middle line:84%
there's no regulation
on what they're doing,

00:29:38.142 --> 00:29:39.600 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
continue to do it,

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:41.600 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to push
it as far as they can.

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And they pushed it far enough
to where this group is well

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:48.885 align:middle line:84%
woven within every
industry in the government.

00:29:48.885 --> 00:29:51.978 align:middle line:84%
You could be in a room with
senators or congresspeople,

00:29:51.978 --> 00:29:54.270 align:middle line:84%
and there may be people
sitting in those seats that are

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:55.950 align:middle line:90%
a part of this organization.

00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:57.583 align:middle line:90%
You just don't know.

00:29:57.583 --> 00:29:58.750 align:middle line:90%
And that's how they operate.

00:29:58.750 --> 00:29:59.670 align:middle line:90%
>> We have Gillibrand.

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:02.160 align:middle line:90%
We have the NDAA.

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.960 align:middle line:90%
We have this whistleblower--

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm putting whistleblower
in quotes, how it's

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:10.770 align:middle line:90%
defined in the legislature--

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:14.910 align:middle line:84%
protections, and not only
about career but anything that

00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:18.810 align:middle line:84%
would come back from your
employers and so forth,

00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:21.600 align:middle line:84%
and retirement and
everything else.

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.220 align:middle line:90%
We have that in play.

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:28.320 align:middle line:84%
If all of this is going on,
there are a lot of witnesses.

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:31.350 align:middle line:84%
There are so many, not
only at corporations

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:32.700 align:middle line:90%
but the military aspect.

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Who was guarding
the doors of this?

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Who is standing in
front of the craft

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:39.420 align:middle line:90%
that you showed us earlier?

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:42.060 align:middle line:84%
Will this allow those
whistleblowers--

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:44.520 align:middle line:84%
we should have hundreds
of whistleblowers

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.170 align:middle line:90%
like yourself coming forward.

00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:47.532 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, there already is.

00:30:47.532 --> 00:30:49.740 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is there's
a lot of people that are--

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:53.160 align:middle line:84%
it's, again, whatever side
of the fence you're on.

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:57.570 align:middle line:84%
If you're naturally
open-minded, you're

00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:00.180 align:middle line:84%
going to tune more into this and
start putting things together

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:02.670 align:middle line:84%
and start explaining
things to yourself on why

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:03.810 align:middle line:90%
this is legitimate.

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:06.130 align:middle line:84%
Then you have people who
don't have that ability

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:08.130 align:middle line:84%
to change their mindset,
who ridicule everything

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:08.970 align:middle line:90%
that they don't know.

00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:12.677 align:middle line:84%
>> The biggest problem with this
is everybody's ego around it.

00:31:12.677 --> 00:31:14.010 align:middle line:90%
They think they know everything.

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:14.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:16.110 align:middle line:84%
But if you go home,
you go to work

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:18.270 align:middle line:84%
for eight to 10 hours
a day, and you go home,

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:20.190 align:middle line:84%
and you sit in front
of a television screen,

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:22.590 align:middle line:84%
you are one of the
most misinformed people

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:25.110 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, because you're
allowing something to tell you

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:26.590 align:middle line:90%
what's going on.

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:29.910 align:middle line:84%
We weren't expecting to stumble
on what we do, but here I

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:32.160 align:middle line:84%
am meeting with people
involved in these programs

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.650 align:middle line:84%
and these organizations
that are doing this,

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:36.960 align:middle line:84%
and they're providing
me the intelligence

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.300 align:middle line:90%
and how they do the operations.

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:42.120 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but what
made this interesting,

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:45.780 align:middle line:84%
like I said, with them ruffling
their feathers enough for them

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:48.240 align:middle line:84%
to approach me and say, this
is what we're doing and why,

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:50.370 align:middle line:90%
and you're the voice for us--

00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:52.830 align:middle line:84%
because between the Senate
Intelligence Committee

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:55.675 align:middle line:84%
and the government, I was like,
OK, this puts me in a hard spot

00:31:55.675 --> 00:31:58.050 align:middle line:84%
because there's things I know
that the government doesn't

00:31:58.050 --> 00:31:58.990 align:middle line:90%
know.

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And so the black team, to keep
their-- at least the good guys

00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:05.670 align:middle line:84%
in this organization, to
keep them out of it publicly,

00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:06.960 align:middle line:90%
what am I going to have to do?

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:10.440 align:middle line:84%
It put me in a tough
spot until, naturally,

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:11.875 align:middle line:90%
that connection bridged.

00:32:11.875 --> 00:32:14.250 align:middle line:84%
So now you have the Senate
Intelligence Committee talking

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:15.820 align:middle line:90%
to these people as well.

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And the only reason why
they came out-- or come in

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:20.700 align:middle line:84%
and releasing the
information to them

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:22.890 align:middle line:84%
is because they personally
said that it edifies

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:25.080 align:middle line:90%
and corroborates my account.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:26.550 align:middle line:90%
Only reason why.

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:28.890 align:middle line:84%
I beat them to the
punch with this.

00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:32.280 align:middle line:84%
But now that I came out, and
now they see how this has

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:36.570 align:middle line:84%
transpired with my account and
how the public has reacted,

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:37.980 align:middle line:90%
yes, there's--

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:38.910 align:middle line:90%
do I get threatened?

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I got helicopters
hovering over my house,

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:43.860 align:middle line:84%
or they're now going to my dad's
house, hovering over his house.

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And now they're recently doing
it over my uncle's house.

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:48.750 align:middle line:84%
Anybody I talk to
on a regular basis

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:50.368 align:middle line:84%
is starting to
see things happen.

00:32:50.368 --> 00:32:52.410 align:middle line:84%
It's like they think I'm
transferring information

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:53.160 align:middle line:90%
to them or something.

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:53.960 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.620 align:middle line:84%
But now, all of a
sudden, this is--

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.420 align:middle line:90%
it's getting a little weird.

00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it going to stop you?

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.180 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And the only reason
why is because what

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:04.860 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about is making
these bad guys uncomfortable.

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:07.390 align:middle line:84%
They're spending money
trying to intimidate us.

00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:09.600 align:middle line:84%
I know how much it costs
to fill up a helicopter

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.028 align:middle line:84%
and keep it on
station, and I know

00:33:12.028 --> 00:33:13.320 align:middle line:90%
how much money they're wasting.

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:15.090 align:middle line:84%
But the issue with
it is it's not

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:16.620 align:middle line:90%
their money they're wasting.

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:18.540 align:middle line:84%
More than likely, it's
the money that they're

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:21.600 align:middle line:84%
siphoning from the black budget,
among the other illegal means

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:26.115 align:middle line:84%
that they're wasting people's
lives, to get into this money,

00:33:26.115 --> 00:33:27.490 align:middle line:84%
or they're ruining
people's lives

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:29.215 align:middle line:90%
by selling narcotics or drugs.

00:33:29.215 --> 00:33:31.090 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the other
aspect that they do,

00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:32.260 align:middle line:90%
as well as weapons.

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:34.630 align:middle line:84%
Anything that they basically
could turn into a funding

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:36.220 align:middle line:90%
mechanism, they will do.

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:42.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, I think we can expect
soon hearings and testimony

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:45.220 align:middle line:84%
with the Senate and the
Senate Intelligence Committee.

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:49.030 align:middle line:90%
Have you been asked to testify?

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Not in open source,
but closed door, yes,

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:52.840 align:middle line:90%
I already have, twice.

00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:54.850 align:middle line:84%
>> But would you do it
in a public setting?

00:33:54.850 --> 00:33:55.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I would.

00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:56.980 align:middle line:90%
100%.

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>> I can only imagine the
pressure of making that kind

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:00.940 align:middle line:90%
of decision.

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And you would have to have
a certain set of guarantees.

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:04.390 align:middle line:90%
Wouldn't you, Josh?

00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:05.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.727 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and that's the
problem, is they're not able

00:34:07.727 --> 00:34:09.040 align:middle line:90%
to guarantee it.

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:12.429 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what's the protection
if somebody stops me in traffic

00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:15.159 align:middle line:84%
and knows who I am that's
a part of this organization

00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:19.054 align:middle line:84%
or any ill-mannered person,
and they decide to kill me

00:34:19.054 --> 00:34:19.929 align:middle line:90%
right then and there?

00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:21.530 align:middle line:84%
Then all of a sudden,
Washington gets word of it.

00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:22.850 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's already too late.

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:25.420 align:middle line:84%
So the protection aspect,
I don't think, is--

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:28.270 align:middle line:90%
it's more of just a placebo.

00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:34.730 align:middle line:84%
>> This has unfolded very
quickly where, for the last 70,

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:37.520 align:middle line:84%
80 years, it's been a
different conversation.

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:40.330 align:middle line:84%
It's been a lot of ridicule
and teasing in the community

00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:43.210 align:middle line:84%
and dismissing and hosting
and imagination, psychosis,

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:47.770 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want to label
this ET situation with.

00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:50.350 align:middle line:90%
It's certainly not the case now.

00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:54.219 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think,
suddenly, the Department

00:34:54.219 --> 00:34:57.310 align:middle line:84%
of Defense and intelligence
agencies and the White House

00:34:57.310 --> 00:34:59.440 align:middle line:84%
and the branches
of the government

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:04.760 align:middle line:84%
are suddenly OK with talking
about UFOs and ET and contact?

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:06.710 align:middle line:90%
>> So a couple of reasons why.

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:08.860 align:middle line:84%
One-- there's too many
people in the government who

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:10.120 align:middle line:84%
have witnessed
something, or there's

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:12.190 align:middle line:84%
people that are working
on these programs that

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:14.425 align:middle line:84%
have came to the government,
just like I have.

00:35:14.425 --> 00:35:16.300 align:middle line:84%
So there's too much
noise being made on that.

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:17.980 align:middle line:90%
Not only that, but the public--

00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:20.410 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people are seeing
unexplainable things

00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:23.520 align:middle line:90%
in the sky.

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:25.128 align:middle line:84%
The proof is,
yeah, there's a lot

00:35:25.128 --> 00:35:26.670 align:middle line:84%
of people taking
videos and pictures.

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:29.100 align:middle line:84%
We know that there's
people hoaxing

00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:30.450 align:middle line:90%
some of those images or videos.

00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:31.950 align:middle line:90%
You can tell as clear as day.

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:33.960 align:middle line:84%
But you have the
genuine footage.

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:37.260 align:middle line:84%
So I think because there's
been a lot of noise lately,

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:38.910 align:middle line:84%
you've had a lot
of prominent people

00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:41.960 align:middle line:84%
that have came up
to the plate to bat

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.730 align:middle line:84%
to get the attention
of the government

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:46.010 align:middle line:84%
to say this is a legitimate
issue that you guys have

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:49.130 align:middle line:84%
no idea what's going on or how
it's even being pulled off,

00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:51.500 align:middle line:84%
or you guys have had-- for
the last 70 or 80 years,

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:53.400 align:middle line:84%
have had the wool
pulled over your face.

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And now here's people that are
slightly pulling that veil off.

00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And now that these Senate
Intelligence Committee members,

00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:02.780 align:middle line:84%
or even the special
intelligence service,

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:04.797 align:middle line:84%
or any of these
committees, for example--

00:36:04.797 --> 00:36:07.130 align:middle line:84%
now that they're getting wind
because they actually have

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:09.560 align:middle line:84%
proof, the thing I don't
understand is that they say

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:10.520 align:middle line:90%
they don't.

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:11.990 align:middle line:90%
They're provided testimonies.

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:14.090 align:middle line:84%
They're provided
documentation, even,

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:16.220 align:middle line:84%
by people I know who
have came forward.

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:18.128 align:middle line:90%
And they're trying to play dumb.

00:36:18.128 --> 00:36:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if
it's because they

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:22.490 align:middle line:84%
don't want these other
guys to know what they're

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:24.240 align:middle line:84%
doing at first until
they actually have it

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:25.960 align:middle line:84%
as a law and everything
is put in place,

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:28.410 align:middle line:84%
and then they can go ahead
and proceed with knowledge.

00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:30.960 align:middle line:84%
A little bit of knowledge
can be a dangerous thing

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.130 align:middle line:90%
in this world.

00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's why-- is it a risk
for me talking about this?

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:37.510 align:middle line:90%
100%, it is.

00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:41.180 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is if nobody
does, then how does it get out?

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to thank you
for coming forward,

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:45.660 align:middle line:84%
and I'm excited about
our next conversation.

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:46.980 align:middle line:90%
And let's see where this leads.

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>> 100%.

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:49.620 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully I got new
information by then.

00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:51.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike Herrera.

00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:52.740 align:middle line:90%
And there you go.

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:56.400 align:middle line:84%
It's "Into the Vortex,"
