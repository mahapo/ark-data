the truth about some

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.820 align:middle line:90%

Congressional hearings,
whistleblowers.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And one thing they always
ask me to drive home

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.480 align:middle line:84%
is the intentions of
extraterrestrial life.

And Josh this is going
to be one of those shows.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.700 align:middle line:90%

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.575 align:middle line:90%

You received a document.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.770 align:middle line:90%
September 9th, 2020.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.750 align:middle line:90%
The Pyramid Code.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.900 align:middle line:84%
Now for those that
haven't heard this,

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.600 align:middle line:84%
and yes, that may be the
case, take us through that.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.570 align:middle line:90%
What is the Pyramid Code first?

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll
take it from there.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.780 align:middle line:84%
>> So on February 6th of 2020, I
was invited to a formal meeting

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.660 align:middle line:84%
with an organization that I
work with today known as TLS.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.490 align:middle line:90%
TLS stands for The Light System.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.160 align:middle line:84%
We might want to elaborate
on that at some point.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.120 align:middle line:84%
I can give more information
on who they are.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.880 align:middle line:90%
But first with the Pyramid Code.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.150 align:middle line:84%
February 6th, 2020, I'm
invited to this meeting.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.640 align:middle line:84%
In that meeting, a lot of
incredible things happened.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.560 align:middle line:84%
It lasted for about
12 hours until it

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.940 align:middle line:84%
had to come to an end
for certain purposes.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.138 align:middle line:84%
And it just blew my
mind from beginning

00:02:49.138 --> 00:02:51.430 align:middle line:84%
to end on what happened
throughout that entire meeting.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And that was my
first time meeting

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.640 align:middle line:84%
with multiple individuals from
the organization TLS itself.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.160 align:middle line:84%
During that meeting,
somebody in the meeting

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.750 align:middle line:84%
from the organization was asked
to document the Pyramid Code

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:04.550 align:middle line:90%
document.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:05.910 align:middle line:90%
And that took about four months.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.150 align:middle line:84%
It was given to me
in June of 2020.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.440 align:middle line:90%
I read this document.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.910 align:middle line:90%
It's all about ancient Egypt.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.730 align:middle line:84%
It's all about actually
a memory that somebody

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.823 align:middle line:84%
has in-depth with details
from ancient Egypt.

00:03:15.823 --> 00:03:17.990 align:middle line:84%
Who built the pyramids, how
they built the pyramids,

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.750 align:middle line:84%
why they built the pyramids, and
how that's relevant to what's

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.150 align:middle line:84%
going on in the world today
with high technologies back

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.920 align:middle line:84%
then being used today
around the world.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.400 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, by governments,
and in some cases,

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.230 align:middle line:84%
by individuals
behind the scenes who

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.300 align:middle line:90%
we're not going to name here.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.865 align:middle line:84%
After I read that,
I had this urge

00:03:34.865 --> 00:03:35.990 align:middle line:90%
to share it with the world.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:37.490 align:middle line:84%
But the man who
wrote it didn't want

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.657 align:middle line:84%
to share it with the world,
because his identity was

00:03:39.657 --> 00:03:40.500 align:middle line:90%
a part of it.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.800 align:middle line:84%
So I kept going back and
forth and back and forth

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.720 align:middle line:84%
and back and forth with
him until we came down

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.700 align:middle line:84%
to a compromise with the
organization as well.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.300 align:middle line:84%
Now the organization wanted
this document to be shared.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.800 align:middle line:84%
I wanted this
document to be shared.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Did you feel that--

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.000 align:middle line:90%
I have to jump in.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you feel that the
document and its contents were

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:57.680 align:middle line:90%
authentic?

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.347 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's the
only reason, I mean,

00:03:59.347 --> 00:04:00.900 align:middle line:90%
I resonated with it so much.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And I felt that it was so
powerful to bring to people,

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.100 align:middle line:90%
that why not share it?

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.233 align:middle line:84%
Just because some guy doesn't
want his identity to be shared,

00:04:08.233 --> 00:04:09.400 align:middle line:90%
we're not going to share it?

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.730 align:middle line:84%
So I kept fighting
and arguing with him

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.400 align:middle line:84%
back and forth until we
came down to a compromise.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.570 align:middle line:84%
That compromise was they told me
you can be the one to share it.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.473 align:middle line:84%
The compromise is
you're going to remove

00:04:20.473 --> 00:04:22.890 align:middle line:84%
the identities, especially the
guy who wrote it from that.

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
change the names.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to
do it, you're going

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:26.890 align:middle line:90%
to be the one to put it out.

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.340 align:middle line:84%
So they gave me a date, and
that's the September 9th date.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.400 align:middle line:84%
09/09 at 9:00 AM
Eastern time of 2020.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.780 align:middle line:90%
And here's what happened.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:34.780 align:middle line:90%
It was very interesting.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.405 align:middle line:84%
I still can't believe
it till this day.

00:04:36.405 --> 00:04:39.130 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, before we get there,
because it was extraordinary.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>> There must have been
something in that document that

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.300 align:middle line:84%
said, OK, I'm going to
take a chance on this.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.840 align:middle line:84%
What was that one thing that
stood out for you that you

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.250 align:middle line:90%
were willing to roll the dice?

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.890 align:middle line:84%
Because this could
go really wrong.

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.370 align:middle line:84%
>> I'll tell you the truth, I
didn't see it as a huge risk.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Not when it comes to the
history of ancient Egypt.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Because you know a
lot of those things.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.642 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people know
a lot of those things.

00:05:05.642 --> 00:05:08.080 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very obvious
that human beings--

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.260 align:middle line:84%
there was something that
transcended human beings

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.760 align:middle line:84%
as we know them that went and
built something like that.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of even
archaeologists and people

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.790 align:middle line:84%
like Graham Hancock that's
coming out and showing you,

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.190 align:middle line:84%
hey, guys, there's something
else going on here.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.050 align:middle line:90%
So that wasn't the risk for me.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.960 align:middle line:90%
The risk for me was--

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.440 align:middle line:84%
within this actual
document was the revelation

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.380 align:middle line:84%
of this organization that's
coming to me and saying,

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.610 align:middle line:90%
share this with the world.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And my fear was, at
the end of the day,

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.430 align:middle line:90%
I come from real estate.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.980 align:middle line:84%
I come from a commercial
real estate family.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.230 align:middle line:84%
I have nothing to do with
the spiritual world in terms

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:41.030 align:middle line:90%
of my background.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.210 align:middle line:90%
>> That was your degree.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:43.920 align:middle line:84%
That's what you were
doing at the time.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.470 align:middle line:84%
>> It had nothing to do with
me and I was also very young.

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:47.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>> So my fear was, who the
hell's going to believe me?

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.590 align:middle line:84%
On what basis would
anybody believe me?

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.677 align:middle line:84%
The reason why I took that
risk was because I said,

00:05:55.677 --> 00:05:57.510 align:middle line:84%
listen, if I'm going
to operate out of fear,

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:58.920 align:middle line:84%
there's always going
to be somebody that's

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.870 align:middle line:84%
not going to believe you
based on what you do,

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.400 align:middle line:84%
even if you bring proof
and evidence to the table.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.860 align:middle line:84%
We see that even
in the world now,

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.930 align:middle line:84%
in the scientific realm
and the medical realm,

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.230 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.530 align:middle line:90%
So it rang true in my heart.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.070 align:middle line:90%
It made a lot of sense to me.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.280 align:middle line:84%
It's something that I
was always interested

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.590 align:middle line:84%
in growing up, watching
"Ancient Aliens,"

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:17.980 align:middle line:90%
shows on Gaia, things like that.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.410 align:middle line:84%
It just made sense and I said,
I'm given an opportunity.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:22.210 align:middle line:90%
Let's take it.

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.630 align:middle line:84%
People are going to call me
crazy regardless of what I do.

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.838 align:middle line:84%
So let's at least do something
that I think is right.

00:06:26.838 --> 00:06:28.150 align:middle line:90%
>> So let's circle back.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.930 align:middle line:84%
Nine, nine, nine,
nine, nine, right?

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.160 align:middle line:90%
It's all nines.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.990 align:middle line:90%
It's 2020.

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.490 align:middle line:90%
You do the big reveal.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:36.310 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>> So I just want to give
some context over here.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.070 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have a social
media following.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.060 align:middle line:90%
I barely had a website.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.790 align:middle line:84%
I had three or six
visits to my website.

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And I built jasonshurka.com
just for the purpose of putting

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.220 align:middle line:90%
this document out there.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.370 align:middle line:84%
Barely any Instagram following,
barely any social media,

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:54.960 align:middle line:90%
barely any website visits.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.980 align:middle line:84%
I put this document out 09/09
at 9:00 AM Eastern time in 2020.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.800 align:middle line:84%
In three hours, Jimmy, it
reached every continent

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.780 align:middle line:84%
on Earth with the
exception of Antarctica

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.570 align:middle line:84%
and millions of people in
a period of three hours.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And from there, it
just kept going.

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And then people
that were connected

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.232 align:middle line:84%
to-- not in a political
way, but people

00:07:12.232 --> 00:07:14.190 align:middle line:84%
that were connected to
the Trump administration

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:15.780 align:middle line:90%
at the time started calling.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.070 align:middle line:90%
His family started calling.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.300 align:middle line:84%
They're like, what's
going on here?

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.100 align:middle line:90%
Who are you?

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.320 align:middle line:90%
Who do you work for?

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And then that's a whole other
story of what it evolved to.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.370 align:middle line:84%
But it started getting
very interesting in terms

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.070 align:middle line:84%
of the people that showed
interest into this thing.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And it was very credible
people in the world.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.710 align:middle line:84%
Ex-agents from
large organizations,

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:36.390 align:middle line:84%
from big organizations
out there,

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:38.370 align:middle line:84%
that know a thing or
two with their realm

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.380 align:middle line:84%
that have been doing
this for 30, 40 years.

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.210 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly they're coming
to me and saying,

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:43.630 align:middle line:90%
how do you know this?

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.878 align:middle line:84%
And that's what gave me
credibility around the world.

00:07:45.878 --> 00:07:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Because at the end of
the day, I was a kid.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:48.640 align:middle line:90%
I was 22.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.440 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And so can we circle
back for a second?

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.210 align:middle line:84%
Because we know now
where we are today.

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And not only with the
document, but we're

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:00.640 align:middle line:84%
going to discuss TLS
here in a second.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And there is a paradigm
shift in the world right now,

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.460 align:middle line:90%
and we feel all of that.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:06.690 align:middle line:90%
But let's back up.

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:07.881 align:middle line:90%
Why you?

00:08:07.881 --> 00:08:10.860 align:middle line:84%
Why were you selected
to go to that meeting

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.950 align:middle line:84%
where you were exposed to
this if you didn't have--

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:15.330 align:middle line:90%
you weren't an influencer.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.160 align:middle line:84%
You didn't have a
social media following.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.650 align:middle line:84%
You didn't launch
jasonshurka.com

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:20.910 align:middle line:90%
till after the document.

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:23.520 align:middle line:84%
So why were you called
to this meeting?

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.250 align:middle line:84%
>> The same reason why you
were chosen to host this show.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.980 align:middle line:84%
Because you're the perfect fit
for the job that you're doing.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.170 align:middle line:84%
You have an energy
with what you do.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:33.659 align:middle line:84%
And your energy matches
"Into the Vortex."

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:36.210 align:middle line:84%
My energy happened to match
in their perspective what

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:38.429 align:middle line:84%
they asked me to do, which
is be a spokesperson.

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:41.575 align:middle line:84%
I've developed my
spoke-- speaking skills

00:08:41.575 --> 00:08:43.950 align:middle line:84%
and my communication skills
over the past 3 and 1/2 years

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:44.650 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:46.560 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at me 3 and
1/2 years ago and today,

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.430 align:middle line:90%
it's like two completely--

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:48.510 align:middle line:90%
>> It is two different people.

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Two different people.

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.090 align:middle line:90%
So in short, it's an energy.

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:53.340 align:middle line:84%
It's something that the
individual has, that they see,

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.870 align:middle line:84%
that they can read
and they help develop.

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:56.370 align:middle line:84%
Now just to put
it out there, I'm

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.080 align:middle line:90%
not some special person here.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.960 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's chosen for a
specific perspective in life

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:01.840 align:middle line:90%
as a whole.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.810 align:middle line:84%
So the TLS organization,
they're made up

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.210 align:middle line:90%
of about 8,500 initiated agents.

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:07.930 align:middle line:90%
By the way, I'm not one of them.

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:10.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm not formally initiated
into the organization.

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:10.980 align:middle line:90%
Not yet, at least.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.290 align:middle line:84%
So you can consider what
I'm going through right now

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:14.650 align:middle line:90%
as like a form of training.

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:17.790 align:middle line:84%
So right now, they ask me
to speak on their behalf.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:18.930 align:middle line:90%
They like certain things.

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:21.180 align:middle line:84%
They give me pointers along
the way, and they help me.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.190 align:middle line:84%
But in short, the
answer to your question

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:25.620 align:middle line:84%
is it was a specific energy
that they were looking

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.320 align:middle line:84%
for, and for whatever reason
that I'm still learning up

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.610 align:middle line:84%
until this day, I
match that criteria.

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:32.230 align:middle line:84%
>> What are we
talking about here?

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:36.180 align:middle line:84%
What do you have to go
through to be a member of TLS?

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.450 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say it depends
what your job is going to be.

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:41.970 align:middle line:84%
So for somebody like me, I'm
going through that right now.

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:42.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:44.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Right now, they're going
to be watching this episode.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:44.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.538 align:middle line:84%
>> They're listening to
everything that's going

00:09:46.538 --> 00:09:48.840 align:middle line:84%
on always, and it's
a form of training.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.360 align:middle line:84%
The actual initiation
ceremony happens

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.460 align:middle line:90%
on December 23rd of every year.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.230 align:middle line:84%
They have a big venue
that they do it at.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:56.768 align:middle line:90%
It's all secure and undercover.

00:09:56.768 --> 00:09:58.560 align:middle line:84%
Everybody goes there,
and that's where they

00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.760 align:middle line:90%
honor all the new initiates.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.560 align:middle line:84%
I have yet to be invited
to that ceremony.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.680 align:middle line:84%
But it happens on December
23rd of every single year.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh, have you
been there yet?

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.290 align:middle line:90%
Do you have your invitation?

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:08.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Not yet, Jimmy.

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:08.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm working on it.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Does it freak you out when
you hear something like this,

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:12.660 align:middle line:90%
Josh?

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:16.740 align:middle line:84%
Where the question
on everybody's mind--

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.180 align:middle line:84%
I've asked this
question so much.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.980 align:middle line:90%
Who's really running the world?

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.000 align:middle line:90%
Who are the families?

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.590 align:middle line:90%
Where are these dark rooms?

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:24.150 align:middle line:90%
Where are the board rooms?

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:28.530 align:middle line:84%
We have this fixation on
that, and it's an honest thing

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:29.370 align:middle line:90%
to think about.

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:30.310 align:middle line:90%
Do you think about that?

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:30.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:31.833 align:middle line:90%
I want to know the answer.

00:10:31.833 --> 00:10:33.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, who?

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:34.620 align:middle line:90%
Are we talking about families?

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:35.940 align:middle line:90%
Is it corporations?

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.610 align:middle line:90%
Is it dynasties?

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:40.140 align:middle line:90%
What's really going on?

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.320 align:middle line:84%
>> You're saying in terms of the
people that TLS are operating

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.820 align:middle line:90%
against, in a way.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.440 align:middle line:84%
>> It goes both
ways, doesn't it?

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.310 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
those on the inside,

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:50.060 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
those on the outside.

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.590 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have ones and
zeros, light and dark, right.

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:53.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Good and bad and
good against evil.

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:58.830 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so one thing I
want to say over here,

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:01.530 align:middle line:84%
for anybody that might
be thinking something is,

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.360 align:middle line:84%
I want to get this
out of the way.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.790 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people when they
hear about TLS, they're like,

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:06.930 align:middle line:90%
how do we know what's real?

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:08.050 align:middle line:90%
What's really going on here?

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:09.570 align:middle line:84%
How do we know you're
not making it up?

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
answers to that,

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:12.412 align:middle line:84%
but we're not going
to get into that.

00:11:12.412 --> 00:11:16.020 align:middle line:84%
I think the reality of
TLS as an organization

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.400 align:middle line:90%
is something very exciting.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Because I think we can
all agree that there

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:23.580 align:middle line:84%
are dark, evil people in
the world doing not so

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.830 align:middle line:84%
great things with
their own service

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:27.810 align:middle line:90%
to self-interests and agendas.

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:29.190 align:middle line:90%
We see it with corporations.

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.545 align:middle line:84%
We see it with
undercover organizations.

00:11:31.545 --> 00:11:33.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure everybody
watching this can probably

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.000 align:middle line:84%
name multiple organizations
out there that we know

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.070 align:middle line:84%
are doing things with
negative purposes

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:39.480 align:middle line:90%
in their own self-interests.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.790 align:middle line:84%
But how many times can
we name organizations

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:42.750 align:middle line:90%
that are positive?

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And everybody gets
stuck on that.

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And they're like,
oh, well, we only

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:46.770 align:middle line:84%
pay attention to
all the negative,

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:48.090 align:middle line:84%
we never pay attention
to the positive.

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:48.890 align:middle line:90%
>> That's so true.

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:51.450 align:middle line:84%
>> So if we can agree
that the negative exists,

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:53.040 align:middle line:84%
then according to
the law of balance,

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.690 align:middle line:84%
doesn't it make sense that
the exact opposite would exist

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:56.490 align:middle line:90%
as well?

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:57.505 align:middle line:90%
TLS is not the only one.

00:11:57.505 --> 00:11:59.130 align:middle line:84%
There are many
organizations out there.

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:01.530 align:middle line:84%
I just happen to work
with TLS directly.

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And the way that the light
works as opposed to the dark

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:08.100 align:middle line:84%
is the light does not work
out in the open to show,

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.860 align:middle line:84%
hey, come give us your power
and this is our identity.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:13.240 align:middle line:84%
Because that only leads to
a messiah complex and an ego

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.040 align:middle line:90%
trip.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.270 align:middle line:90%
They work undercover.

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:17.040 align:middle line:84%
They do things from
behind the scenes.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.290 align:middle line:84%
They use certain
people like myself,

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:21.400 align:middle line:84%
maybe even sometimes you
with other organizations,

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.200 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.940 align:middle line:84%
But they would
use certain people

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.010 align:middle line:84%
to influence the world
in a positive way.

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:27.985 align:middle line:84%
Through shows like
"Into the Vortex."

00:12:27.985 --> 00:12:29.610 align:middle line:84%
Through certain
movements that somebody

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:31.410 align:middle line:84%
would lead to help the
world, whether it's

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:34.480 align:middle line:84%
medically, politically,
spiritually, physically,

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.280 align:middle line:90%
whatever it may be.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.520 align:middle line:84%
There's so many different
avenues to go and help

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:38.320 align:middle line:90%
the world.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.140 align:middle line:84%
So that's really
why TLS is here.

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And they use many
different avenues, mediums,

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:43.650 align:middle line:90%
and individuals to do that.

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:45.360 align:middle line:90%
Who's really running the world?

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.090 align:middle line:84%
The people that TLS is trying
to stop while also waking up

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:49.890 align:middle line:90%
the masses.

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
people, they always

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:54.990 align:middle line:84%
ask me, if TLS is so powerful,
why does the world still

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:56.890 align:middle line:84%
have so much evil
in the world today?

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:58.140 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is very simple.

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:00.845 align:middle line:84%
No organization can
actually stop something

00:13:00.845 --> 00:13:02.970 align:middle line:84%
at the essence of it all,
because the essence of it

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:04.380 align:middle line:90%
all is we the people.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.068 align:middle line:84%
It's our collective
consciousness.

00:13:06.068 --> 00:13:07.110 align:middle line:90%
It's like going to India.

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:08.550 align:middle line:90%
I was just there in February.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:10.680 align:middle line:84%
I thought before I went
to India that if you

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.740 align:middle line:84%
raise billions of dollars, you
can really change this country.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And little did I know,
once I get there,

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.660 align:middle line:84%
I understood very
quickly that it

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:19.410 align:middle line:84%
had nothing to do with
the amount of money

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:21.618 align:middle line:84%
that you poured into that
country to help the people.

00:13:21.618 --> 00:13:22.860 align:middle line:90%
You need to educate them.

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:25.050 align:middle line:84%
You need to change the
collective awareness

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:26.940 align:middle line:84%
of the individuals
living in that country

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.450 align:middle line:84%
if you want to
change the country.

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:30.305 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you could
pour $100 billion.

00:13:30.305 --> 00:13:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>> That goes for the rest
of the world, doesn't it?

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:33.780 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm using
that as an example.

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, sure.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>> But the point over here is
beyond just trying to take down

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.950 align:middle line:84%
or stop the damage of the
evil people in the world,

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:44.190 align:middle line:84%
the real goal of
this organization is,

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.650 align:middle line:84%
how do we raise the
collective level of awareness?

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Because everything is
a reflection of that.

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:51.960 align:middle line:84%
If we raise our collective
level of awareness and step

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.970 align:middle line:84%
into universal awareness
once and for all,

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:56.040 align:middle line:84%
you won't see certain
people in power

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.240 align:middle line:84%
in an evil way existing
in the first place,

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.550 align:middle line:84%
because the reflection
would not be that.

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:05.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Isn't that something that
has occurred for as long

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:06.790 align:middle line:90%
as humanity has been here?

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:11.140 align:middle line:84%
There's always been
a dark force in play

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:13.150 align:middle line:90%
that has been kept in check.

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And we can look
back historically.

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:17.680 align:middle line:84%
As crazy as the world
is today, Jason,

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.030 align:middle line:90%
it's a pretty nutty place.

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:22.120 align:middle line:84%
But we've been through some
pretty crazy situations

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.960 align:middle line:84%
just in the last 100 years,
where things have always

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.340 align:middle line:90%
been kept in check.

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:30.790 align:middle line:84%
Right, so is that the
purpose of an organization

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:34.360 align:middle line:84%
like TLS, to keep it in
check, to keep it back,

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:38.130 align:middle line:84%
but it's something that we don't
necessarily need to know about?

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:42.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I would actually argue that,
do we really know that that

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.750 align:middle line:84%
darkness always
existed in history?

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:47.608 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the history that we think
we know and the history that we

00:14:47.608 --> 00:14:49.400 align:middle line:84%
do know that was
documented, which I'm sure

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.500 align:middle line:90%
was changed to a large degree.

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.340 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there was always
darkness and light.

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:54.790 align:middle line:90%
But was it always like that?

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:56.600 align:middle line:84%
If you go to a
spiritual perspective,

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.000 align:middle line:84%
if everything emerged
out of this one place

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.100 align:middle line:84%
and everything comes
from that oneness,

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.613 align:middle line:84%
then I would say that everything
comes from a good place.

00:15:03.613 --> 00:15:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And then through the free will
of humanity, at some point,

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:06.830 align:middle line:90%
we decided--

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:08.840 align:middle line:84%
or beyond humanity,
life as a whole,

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.550 align:middle line:90%
we decided to create a split.

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:12.890 align:middle line:84%
And we decided to go
more towards negatively

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:14.120 align:middle line:90%
polarizing situations.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
there was a need

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.210 align:middle line:90%
for organizations like TLS.

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:20.720 align:middle line:84%
Because TLS didn't
exist when creation

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.860 align:middle line:84%
started, if you want to call it
that for lack of a better term.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.440 align:middle line:84%
They came to being
about 5,000 years ago.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.972 align:middle line:84%
Because there was something
that happened 5,000 years ago.

00:15:29.972 --> 00:15:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And if you go
biblically speaking--

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.055 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not a religious
man whatsoever.

00:15:33.055 --> 00:15:36.140 align:middle line:84%
I look at the Bible as
more of a historical book.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:39.420 align:middle line:84%
If you go biblically speaking,
something happened in Genesis.

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And it was the sons of God and
Hebrew they call them Elohim.

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:44.370 align:middle line:84%
Other people called
them the Anunnaki.

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Came down from the heavens
or from other places

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.160 align:middle line:84%
and mated with the
daughters of man.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And before that, there was
no religion as we know it.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.440 align:middle line:84%
It was only after
that Judaism came.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And then Christianity
and Islam came.

00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:59.340 align:middle line:84%
That's when religion
started as we know it.

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:01.830 align:middle line:84%
There was some form of
genetic manipulation

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:03.600 align:middle line:84%
that happened
through interbreeding

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.740 align:middle line:90%
of different races.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:08.040 align:middle line:84%
It literally says it in the
Bible in that historical text

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.140 align:middle line:84%
itself, where there
was an interbreeding

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:11.070 align:middle line:90%
of different races.

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:13.770 align:middle line:84%
In Hebrew, Bnei
Elohim and Bnei Adam.

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:15.840 align:middle line:84%
The sons of God and
the sons of Adam.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.070 align:middle line:84%
Or the daughters of
Adam in that way.

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:18.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>> So what I'm trying to say
over here is I'm not so certain

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:25.570 align:middle line:84%
that there was always
evil in the world.

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:27.190 align:middle line:90%
I think evil is a choice.

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that there
was a point in time where

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.260 align:middle line:90%
we decided to make that choice.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.440 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
history we don't know.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:40.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, when you have a
spiritual leader or guidance

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:42.870 align:middle line:90%
by any definition or any title--

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:46.050 align:middle line:84%
shaman, Indigenous
cultures-- they're all

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:47.530 align:middle line:90%
going to say the same thing.

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:50.132 align:middle line:84%
It is about positive
and negative.

00:16:50.132 --> 00:16:51.090 align:middle line:90%
Those are the energies.

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:53.010 align:middle line:84%
That's the electricity
of the universe.

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:55.140 align:middle line:84%
We're always going
to have that balance.

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.300 align:middle line:84%
That's the way the
world works, right?

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:01.035 align:middle line:84%
But we want to keep
that darkness in check.

00:17:01.035 --> 00:17:03.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's the way
the world of duality works.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.243 align:middle line:84%
That's not the way the
world of singularity works.

00:17:05.243 --> 00:17:07.319 align:middle line:84%
And if everything merges
out of singularity,

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:09.960 align:middle line:84%
then there had to be a buffer
zone in between the singularity

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.069 align:middle line:90%
and the duality.

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:12.849 align:middle line:90%
Now, I agree with you.

00:17:12.849 --> 00:17:14.400 align:middle line:84%
My question for
you now is, do you

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.880 align:middle line:84%
believe that there are planets
out there right now that

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.470 align:middle line:90%
don't experience war?

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:21.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:23.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you believe that
there are planets, nations,

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:26.250 align:middle line:84%
and races out there, no
matter how far they may be,

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:28.120 align:middle line:84%
that don't have evil
or corruption as a part

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:28.920 align:middle line:90%
of their society?

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.170 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a part of evolution.

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's why this show is
called "Into the Vortex,"

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:34.795 align:middle line:84%
because Jason just
spun the vortex--

00:17:34.795 --> 00:17:35.670 align:middle line:90%
>> He did, didn't he?

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>> --and became the
host of the show.

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:40.830 align:middle line:84%
But that is one of the
most amazing points

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:44.850 align:middle line:84%
that we can bring up, is
that the universe is so big.

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:47.350 align:middle line:90%
We don't understand its bigness.

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:48.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:48.960 align:middle line:90%
>> We really don't.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.590 align:middle line:84%
We can't wrap our
head around that.

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:54.780 align:middle line:84%
But what we do understand now
is that every star that you see

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.860 align:middle line:90%
has a planetary system with it.

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:59.100 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the
development of a star,

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.810 align:middle line:90%
is the creation of planets.

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Now if it's really that
big, our Milky Way,

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:06.210 align:middle line:90%
and it's a numbers game, right?

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:07.237 align:middle line:90%
Right, exactly.

00:18:07.237 --> 00:18:08.070 align:middle line:90%
It's a numbers game.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:11.020 align:middle line:84%
How many civilizations
are out there?

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:12.900 align:middle line:90%
Well, the answer is infinite.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:17.220 align:middle line:84%
But they would have to go
through the same evolutionary

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:19.170 align:middle line:84%
processes that
we've gone through

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:21.210 align:middle line:84%
and are going through
here on this planet.

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Will we get to love
and light and unicorns?

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:26.020 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah, eventually.

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:26.820 align:middle line:90%
>> I think we will.

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:28.123 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:18:28.123 --> 00:18:29.790 align:middle line:84%
>> But through that
hardship, obviously.

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:30.590 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that, do we
always have to go to the abyss?

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:36.720 align:middle line:84%
Do we have to go to the
edge of the cliff, right,

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.390 align:middle line:84%
and take a look before
we can get to the good?

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:40.500 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Because sometimes you have
to jump off the cliff before you

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:43.120 align:middle line:90%
fly.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.100 align:middle line:90%
That's how birds do it.

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:48.000 align:middle line:84%
The mom kicks the bird off
the nest and lets them fly.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.130 align:middle line:90%
It's scary on the way down.

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:50.880 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're going
through right now.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And there's a silver lining in
what we're going through right

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:53.550 align:middle line:90%
now because it's--

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:54.420 align:middle line:90%
>> What is that?

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.875 align:middle line:84%
>> As scary as the
world is right now,

00:18:56.875 --> 00:18:58.500 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people I
see around the world,

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.380 align:middle line:84%
they go into fear
for human reasons.

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.700 align:middle line:90%
It's very normal.

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.580 align:middle line:84%
When you see wars going on, when
you see people getting sick,

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:08.183 align:middle line:84%
when you see or feel this
feeling of helplessness

00:19:08.183 --> 00:19:09.600 align:middle line:84%
and hopelessness
because everybody

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.370 align:middle line:84%
tells you there's
nothing within you

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:12.893 align:middle line:84%
anymore that you
have your own power

00:19:12.893 --> 00:19:15.060 align:middle line:84%
and you have to depend on
everything outside of you,

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.050 align:middle line:84%
that's what the current
world looks like.

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:19.000 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time
over the past three,

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.060 align:middle line:84%
four years specifically,
because that hardship

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:24.850 align:middle line:84%
has been escalating,
so have questions.

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:27.070 align:middle line:84%
Questions looking
for an alternative.

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And that alternative is now
making us find the answers

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.060 align:middle line:90%
within us once again.

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:34.630 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, it's the way
that the process works.

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:37.172 align:middle line:84%
If you want to
shoot a slingshot,

00:19:37.172 --> 00:19:39.130 align:middle line:84%
the further you want it
to fly, the further you

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:39.760 align:middle line:90%
have to pull it back.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:39.970 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like potential
and kinetic energy.

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:44.650 align:middle line:84%
So right now, we're building
up this potential energy.

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And the kinetic energy
is when you release.

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:49.340 align:middle line:84%
That release is up to us
when we want it to happen.

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:51.550 align:middle line:84%
So the silver lining
in the hardship

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:53.230 align:middle line:90%
is a basic law of the universe.

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:55.330 align:middle line:84%
The harder something
gets, the bigger

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:57.370 align:middle line:84%
the seed of beauty
within that hardship.

00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:00.130 align:middle line:84%
The greater the gift you can
extract from that hardship.

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:02.203 align:middle line:84%
The greater opportunity
there is to grow.

00:20:02.203 --> 00:20:04.120 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going more
into the spiritual realm,

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.540 align:middle line:90%
but it's how energy works.

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.600 align:middle line:84%
It's how potential and
kinetic energy work.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:11.140 align:middle line:84%
So right now when things are
really escalating and getting

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:13.660 align:middle line:84%
crazy, there's a part
of me, the human part,

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.952 align:middle line:84%
that says, oh my god, I have
to look out for my family.

00:20:15.952 --> 00:20:16.752 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:16.752 --> 00:20:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>> But then there's the
spiritual part where I'm like,

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:20.230 align:middle line:90%
this is exciting.

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:22.540 align:middle line:84%
Because the quicker
this happens,

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:24.160 align:middle line:84%
the faster we're
getting to the world

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.330 align:middle line:90%
that we deserve to live in.

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:26.530 align:middle line:90%
>> You brought up a point.

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:27.790 align:middle line:90%
Let's circle back.

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:31.330 align:middle line:84%
Where we are at a point
of asking questions

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:32.960 align:middle line:90%
like never before.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.370 align:middle line:90%
We are seekers of knowledge.

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:38.290 align:middle line:84%
20 years ago, 25 years
ago, there was no internet.

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:42.760 align:middle line:84%
Now we have instantaneous
access to not only information,

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.580 align:middle line:84%
but sharing that
information once we have it.

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:49.885 align:middle line:84%
That control is no longer
with those dark forces, right?

00:20:49.885 --> 00:20:51.010 align:middle line:90%
And that's what's going on.

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:52.390 align:middle line:90%
We're finding out things.

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:55.600 align:middle line:84%
When you launched the
Pyramid Code, that's

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.790 align:middle line:90%
exactly what happened, isn't it?

00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:00.190 align:middle line:84%
>> There's another
"Into the Vortex"

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:03.220 align:middle line:84%
moment we can have here on
seeing the silver lining

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:07.365 align:middle line:84%
in the control of, let's say,
censorship of information with

00:21:07.365 --> 00:21:09.490 align:middle line:84%
what we're seeing with
technology and the internet.

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:09.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Look how many new platforms
are being built right now.

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.480 align:middle line:90%
Because there is the need.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.910 align:middle line:84%
Because when they corner
us into a place of saying,

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:19.030 align:middle line:84%
you can't do this, you're going
to have 10 other soldiers stand

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:20.105 align:middle line:90%
up and say, watch me.

00:21:20.105 --> 00:21:21.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do it and
I'm going to build it.

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.460 align:middle line:84%
So what we call the
mainstream media that

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:27.730 align:middle line:84%
was controlling and brainwashing
a lot of people for a long time

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:29.020 align:middle line:90%
is still trying to do it.

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:31.390 align:middle line:84%
But they're becoming more
and more and more diluted.

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:35.980 align:middle line:84%
Because with the amount of
potential of censorship,

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:37.930 align:middle line:84%
there's now that
much more potential

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:40.130 align:middle line:84%
of creating new platforms
to overcome that.

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:41.830 align:middle line:84%
So now it's
independent journalists

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:44.110 align:middle line:84%
that are almost starting
to run the world as opposed

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:47.530 align:middle line:84%
to these big news conglomerates
that are run by the same--

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:51.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Hasn't it always been
that way with the human mind?

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:56.410 align:middle line:84%
The human mind has
always wanted answers.

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:58.120 align:middle line:90%
Are we alone in the universe?

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Right, what happens
after we die?

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:01.180 align:middle line:90%
Why are we here?

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:02.680 align:middle line:90%
What's our purpose of being?

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.360 align:middle line:84%
These are fundamental
questions that

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:05.680 align:middle line:90%
go back to the dawn of man.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.190 align:middle line:90%
They've always been there.

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And they've controlled
this information.

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:13.340 align:middle line:84%
They've tried to hold
this information back.

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:15.910 align:middle line:84%
But today, Jason, it's not
that kind of party, is it?

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:16.730 align:middle line:90%
>> 100%.

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's worth
diving into why they do that.

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:21.510 align:middle line:84%
Because in a
spiritual war, which

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:23.340 align:middle line:84%
is what the basis of
everything really is,

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:26.730 align:middle line:84%
the basis of every war is, how
do we make the people weak?

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:29.250 align:middle line:84%
You do that through
suppressing and really

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:31.230 align:middle line:90%
taking away awareness.

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Now knowledge or information is
a stepping stone to knowledge.

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Knowledge is a stepping
stone to awareness.

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And an aware society
cannot be controlled.

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:41.910 align:middle line:84%
It's only a society
that's not aware

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:45.130 align:middle line:84%
that can be deceived and
therefore divided and confused.

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:47.430 align:middle line:84%
So that's why information
is the first step that

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:49.620 align:middle line:84%
eventually leads to
true awareness that

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:50.640 align:middle line:90%
leads to freedom.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.530 align:middle line:84%
If you happen to
be somebody that

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:55.470 align:middle line:84%
wants to control the world,
you can only control the world

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:56.770 align:middle line:90%
by dividing the people.

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:59.370 align:middle line:84%
You can only divide the people
by making sure they know

00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:00.720 align:middle line:90%
what you want them to know.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.430 align:middle line:84%
Meaning what you don't
want them to know

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:05.070 align:middle line:84%
will be information you
suppress with the intention

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:07.740 align:middle line:84%
of ultimately suppressing
awareness, which is what makes

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.370 align:middle line:90%
us strong as human beings.

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:11.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about you, but
TLS is about as mysterious

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:12.750 align:middle line:90%
as it gets.

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:13.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:15.345 align:middle line:84%
So what does TLS want
to share with the world

00:23:15.345 --> 00:23:16.810 align:middle line:90%
today through you as a vessel?

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think there are multiple
different topics that TLS wants

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:20.290 align:middle line:90%
to share.

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:22.540 align:middle line:84%
One that's extremely relevant
that we didn't touch up

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:25.840 align:middle line:84%
too much in this episode today
is extraterrestrial life.

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.270 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of disclosure
going on all around the world

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:30.730 align:middle line:84%
right now-- congressional
hearings, whistleblowers,

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:31.790 align:middle line:90%
so on and so forth.

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And one thing they always
ask me to drive home

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:36.760 align:middle line:84%
is the intentions of
extraterrestrial life.

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:39.250 align:middle line:84%
There will come a point where
this becomes extremely open.

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:42.700 align:middle line:84%
But on the way, there will
be a narrative being spun,

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:45.250 align:middle line:84%
that's already being spun
around the world, of a threat

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:46.570 align:middle line:90%
to national security.

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:48.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to keep
it real simple.

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.570 align:middle line:84%
Extraterrestrial life is not
a threat to national security.

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:51.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Cheers to that.

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:52.570 align:middle line:90%
>> They're here to help.

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:53.530 align:middle line:90%
They're here to guide.

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:54.670 align:middle line:90%
They're here to assist.

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And they're here to help
us liberate ourselves.

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:58.570 align:middle line:84%
So I would say please
keep that in mind

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:01.720 align:middle line:84%
for anybody watching this today
when certain narratives are

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.000 align:middle line:84%
spun when it comes to
extraterrestrial life

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.458 align:middle line:84%
and their technology,
specifically.

00:24:05.458 --> 00:24:06.258 align:middle line:90%
>> Why?

00:24:06.258 --> 00:24:07.840 align:middle line:84%
Why do they want
to use the fear?

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:08.770 align:middle line:90%
The threat narrative.

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, but
then turn around and spin,

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:17.800 align:middle line:84%
we can't discuss that in the
interest of national security.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:21.080 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be wash,
rinse, repeat with this.

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think it's a
very, very simple answer.

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:26.290 align:middle line:84%
We always have to follow the
money and see who has to gain

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:29.740 align:middle line:84%
and who has to lose from
a technology like what

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:31.330 align:middle line:90%
these beings have.

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:33.940 align:middle line:84%
Basically what their technology
works on is free technology.

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:34.990 align:middle line:90%
Free energy.

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Free energy would put a lot of
people out of business today.

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:39.157 align:middle line:84%
Those are the people
that run the world,

00:24:39.157 --> 00:24:40.120 align:middle line:90%
without naming names.

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:41.680 align:middle line:84%
So there will always
be a narrative

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.570 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that we
the people stay away

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:46.330 align:middle line:84%
from the very things
that would take all power

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:49.060 align:middle line:84%
and control out of the hands of
the people that currently have

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:50.650 align:middle line:84%
power and control
around the world.

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And extraterrestrial life
with their technology

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.070 align:middle line:90%
is a huge threat to that.

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:56.170 align:middle line:84%
That's a big purpose
that they have an agenda

00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:59.390 align:middle line:84%
to spin a narrative to keep us
away from something like that.

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:00.910 align:middle line:84%
The other thing
that I would say is

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:04.060 align:middle line:84%
one of their really big missions
and messages that they want

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:07.660 align:middle line:84%
to drive home is what I already
said, universal awareness

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:09.100 align:middle line:90%
and moving away from fear.

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.140 align:middle line:84%
The frequency of
fear makes us sick.

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:13.420 align:middle line:84%
The frequency of fear
keeps us confused.

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:15.250 align:middle line:90%
Confusion keeps us divided.

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:19.330 align:middle line:84%
When we can see the opportunity
and the gift in every hardship,

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:21.880 align:middle line:84%
it makes life so much
easier to move through.

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.920 align:middle line:84%
Because suddenly
we see when there's

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.110 align:middle line:84%
a war, instead of being
scared, which is normal.

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:29.422 align:middle line:84%
We also see the
beautiful part of that

00:25:29.422 --> 00:25:30.880 align:middle line:84%
in terms of where
that can lead us,

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.630 align:middle line:84%
because more people
are going to wake up.

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:34.750 align:middle line:84%
So the next few years are
going to be crazy just

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:36.298 align:middle line:90%
like the last few years were.

00:25:36.298 --> 00:25:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And what they always
drive home to me

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:40.132 align:middle line:84%
and what I'm going to drive
home to you guys here today

00:25:40.132 --> 00:25:42.730 align:middle line:84%
and all the viewers is, do
not operate out of fear.

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Fear is the last
thing that we need

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:47.470 align:middle line:84%
to operate out of if we want to
make this world a better place.

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:49.420 align:middle line:90%
Always find the silver lining.

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:50.830 align:middle line:90%
Always find the lesson.

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:53.260 align:middle line:84%
If you can find the
lesson and pass the test,

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.690 align:middle line:84%
we will have no reason
on a spiritual level

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:57.280 align:middle line:90%
to need to repeat that test.

00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:58.250 align:middle line:90%
And that's how we grow.

00:25:58.250 --> 00:25:59.710 align:middle line:90%
That's how we ascend.

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:04.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Your life, right, your
growing up, were you aware,

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:08.830 align:middle line:84%
did you ask yourself these
big conspiracy questions?

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And now are you sitting back,
going it's crazier than I ever

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:13.540 align:middle line:90%
imagined

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:16.750 align:middle line:84%
>> First of all, I was raised
into a family that was always

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:17.950 align:middle line:90%
asking questions.

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:20.860 align:middle line:84%
It was always very
aware and called

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:24.520 align:middle line:84%
ahead of the curve of what most
people knew regarding events

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.290 align:middle line:84%
or orchestrated events,
things like that,

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:27.640 align:middle line:90%
without getting into details.

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:31.422 align:middle line:84%
When I was four years old, my
great grandfather passed away.

00:26:31.422 --> 00:26:32.380 align:middle line:90%
His name was Aba Aaron.

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:33.790 align:middle line:90%
We call him that in Hebrew.

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And when he died, I was
four, my sister was eight.

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:40.368 align:middle line:84%
My mom sat us down on the
stairs of our home in Brooklyn

00:26:40.368 --> 00:26:42.160 align:middle line:84%
when we used to live
in Brooklyn, New York.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And she said Ashley,
Jason, I have

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:46.360 align:middle line:90%
to share some news with you.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Aba Aaron, your
great-grandfather,

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:50.180 align:middle line:90%
is no longer with us.

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:53.520 align:middle line:84%
The first reaction of my
sister was she was crying.

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.850 align:middle line:84%
My first reaction was I
asked, how did he die?

00:26:56.850 --> 00:27:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And she said, he went to
sleep and he never woke up.

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:01.050 align:middle line:90%
And I smiled.

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:02.730 align:middle line:84%
That was my first reaction
as a four-year-old.

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:04.260 align:middle line:84%
I smiled, I thought it was
the most beautiful thing

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:05.190 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:07.530 align:middle line:84%
But then people
around me, my sister,

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:09.630 align:middle line:84%
other people around
me looked at me like,

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:12.150 align:middle line:90%
what's wrong with this kid?

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:13.530 align:middle line:90%
Why is that his reaction?

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:15.315 align:middle line:84%
There's something
wrong with him.

00:27:15.315 --> 00:27:17.190 align:middle line:84%
Fast forward five years,
my grandfather died.

00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.990 align:middle line:90%
He had Alzheimer's.

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.910 align:middle line:90%
He was suffering.

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:21.120 align:middle line:84%
My mother sits us
down on a Wednesday.

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:22.412 align:middle line:90%
She sits me and my sister down.

00:27:22.412 --> 00:27:23.212 align:middle line:90%
Saba died.

00:27:23.212 --> 00:27:24.180 align:middle line:90%
Your grandfather died.

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:26.580 align:middle line:84%
I already knew how he died--
because of Alzheimer's.

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And I was happy and my
sister, again, was very sad.

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And everybody around me
started looking at me

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:32.080 align:middle line:84%
like, there's something
wrong with you.

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.760 align:middle line:84%
Why are you happy that
your grandfather died?

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:35.220 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't happy that
he died, I was happy

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:36.637 align:middle line:84%
that he was put
out of his misery.

00:27:36.637 --> 00:27:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And I felt in my heart that
he went to a better place.

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.440 align:middle line:90%
But I was nine years old.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:44.388 align:middle line:84%
So the common and
the natural reaction

00:27:44.388 --> 00:27:46.180 align:middle line:84%
was, maybe there's
something wrong with me.

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:48.492 align:middle line:84%
And I started dimming
my light a little bit.

00:27:48.492 --> 00:27:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And I started putting a mask
on because I wanted to fit in.

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:52.380 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to
be the weird one.

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:53.680 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to
be the odd one out.

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sharing
this because I know

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:57.342 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of people
watching this show right now

00:27:57.342 --> 00:28:00.410 align:middle line:84%
feel the same exact way with
how they think about the world.

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
period of 10 years

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:05.540 align:middle line:84%
up until the age of 18
or 19 where I completely

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:06.340 align:middle line:90%
put a mask on.

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:09.550 align:middle line:84%
And I completely changed the
way that I expressed myself,

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:11.080 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't
want to be weird.

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.882 align:middle line:84%
And then there came a
point where I said--

00:28:12.882 --> 00:28:15.340 align:middle line:84%
I would watch "Ancient Aliens,"
but I wouldn't tell anybody

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:16.700 align:middle line:90%
that I was watching it.

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:17.662 align:middle line:90%
>> We've all done that.

00:28:17.662 --> 00:28:19.870 align:middle line:84%
>> I was watching Gaia, but
I wasn't telling anybody.

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:21.037 align:middle line:90%
>> We've all done that, yes.

00:28:21.037 --> 00:28:23.285 align:middle line:84%
>> So there came a point
where after injuries,

00:28:23.285 --> 00:28:25.660 align:middle line:84%
my shoulder dislocated a bunch
of times, tons of surgery,

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:27.605 align:middle line:84%
staph infection in my
leg, I said, listen,

00:28:27.605 --> 00:28:29.980 align:middle line:84%
maybe I'm trying to be told
something by something bigger

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:32.350 align:middle line:84%
than me, step into your purpose
and do what you came here

00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:33.150 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And I lost friends,
and I lost family.

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:36.208 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
changed in my life.

00:28:36.208 --> 00:28:38.680 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of loss
and even more gain.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:41.170 align:middle line:84%
Because finally, I was
actually living in purpose

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:42.370 align:middle line:90%
with what I came here to do.

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's the most gratifying
thing in the world.

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.340 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:49.350 align:middle line:84%
So I'm reminded of
the movie "Stargate."

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:50.400 align:middle line:90%
Now stay with me.

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.200 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.625 align:middle line:90%
>> There's a scene.

00:28:53.625 --> 00:28:55.250 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite
scenes in the movie.

00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:56.250 align:middle line:90%
It's not what you think.

00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:58.970 align:middle line:84%
It's James Spader is
doing his presentation

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:00.320 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning of the movie.

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And he's talking about the
pyramids and the Great Pyramid.

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:05.180 align:middle line:90%
And he's doing this at a museum.

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:07.280 align:middle line:84%
He's got a big crowd
in front of him.

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:12.290 align:middle line:84%
But at that moment, he gets
asked the question that's

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:14.090 align:middle line:90%
on everybody's mind.

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:16.380 align:middle line:90%
And he gives the wrong answer.

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And the question was,
"OK, that's all great.

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:22.340 align:middle line:84%
But who built the
Great Pyramid?"

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And Spader's answer
was the wrong one.

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.960 align:middle line:90%
"Well, I don't know."

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.730 align:middle line:90%
And the room empties.

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:30.140 align:middle line:90%
Right, it empties.

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:32.570 align:middle line:90%
It's because we want to know.

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:35.330 align:middle line:84%
The dogma that's been
fed to us doesn't fit.

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:36.900 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make any sense.

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:38.070 align:middle line:90%
We can look at it.

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:39.950 align:middle line:84%
We know what's being
taught in the schools.

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:40.880 align:middle line:90%
We know what's there.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.560 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't add up.

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.510 align:middle line:90%
You got the Pyramid Code.

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:45.860 align:middle line:90%
You got the secrets.

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:48.200 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to ask you
the James Spader question

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.040 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Jason, who built
the Great Pyramid?

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:54.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe it was
extraterrestrial life that came

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:58.080 align:middle line:84%
here from another planet and
used human beings to help them

00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:58.990 align:middle line:90%
with that knowledge.

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:01.080 align:middle line:84%
So there were architects
and there were builders.

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.300 align:middle line:84%
The architects were the
individuals with the higher

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:04.890 align:middle line:90%
awareness, with the technology.

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:07.470 align:middle line:90%
The builders were not slaves.

00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:09.030 align:middle line:84%
Now I come from a
Jewish background.

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:10.680 align:middle line:84%
People get mad at
me when I say that.

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.810 align:middle line:84%
Because in Jewish
history, we're taught

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:16.500 align:middle line:84%
to believe that the Jews were
slaves in Egypt for 400 years.

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:17.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Let my people go.

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:18.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Let my people go.

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:20.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Now that happened
closer to the end,

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:22.980 align:middle line:84%
where the pharaohs started
getting more corrupt.

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And there's a reason why the
pharaonic lineage is no longer

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:26.270 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:27.720 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
get more corrupt,

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.790 align:middle line:90%
you end up self-destructing.

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:31.140 align:middle line:90%
You end up destroying yourself.

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.678 align:middle line:84%
And they no longer
exist in that same way.

00:30:33.678 --> 00:30:35.970 align:middle line:84%
But there was a long period
of time where they weren't.

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:38.345 align:middle line:84%
There was a long period of
time where they were extremely

00:30:38.345 --> 00:30:40.980 align:middle line:84%
evolved before they mated
with the daughters of man.

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:43.650 align:middle line:84%
Before they diluted their
genetic pool in their DNA

00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:45.100 align:middle line:90%
and manipulated that.

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:47.573 align:middle line:84%
And that's the people
that I believe built them.

00:30:47.573 --> 00:30:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, it's not
just in Egypt, as you know.

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:51.100 align:middle line:90%
It's all around the world.

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:53.100 align:middle line:84%
So there's something
going on here

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:56.970 align:middle line:84%
with the shape of the pyramid,
mystically speaking, that's

00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:58.478 align:middle line:84%
bigger than what
most people think.

00:30:58.478 --> 00:31:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's very
obvious it's not just

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:01.565 align:middle line:90%
a tomb for the pharaohs.

00:31:01.565 --> 00:31:03.190 align:middle line:84%
There's something
bigger going on here.

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:06.025 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a shape
that's perfect preservation.

00:31:06.025 --> 00:31:07.650 align:middle line:84%
There's something
bigger going on here.

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:09.610 align:middle line:90%
And we can go--

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:10.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's go there.

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:12.220 align:middle line:90%
What is going on?

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:15.090 align:middle line:84%
I just got back
from Egypt recently.

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And when I look at the
ancient structures,

00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:23.700 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter where you
go, I have to just sit back

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:27.330 align:middle line:84%
and go, huh, how
did this happen?

00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:29.190 align:middle line:90%
There is a purpose here.

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:31.230 align:middle line:90%
I can't figure it out.

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:33.407 align:middle line:90%
I'm on that quest for knowledge.

00:31:33.407 --> 00:31:35.490 align:middle line:84%
But when you say that
there's something else going

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:37.630 align:middle line:84%
on with the Great Pyramid,
what do you think it is?

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:40.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'll tell you exactly
what the document says from

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:40.770 align:middle line:90%
my memory.

00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:42.850 align:middle line:84%
Because the last time I read
it, it was two years ago.

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:44.808 align:middle line:84%
So I encourage everybody
to read this document.

00:31:44.808 --> 00:31:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's free for
everybody to read.

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:48.900 align:middle line:84%
Open, translate into
10 different languages

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:50.940 align:middle line:84%
with audiobooks on
YouTube as well.

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:53.520 align:middle line:84%
But from my memory, if my
memory serves me right,

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.380 align:middle line:84%
there were many different
purposes for it.

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Number one, there
were people buried

00:31:57.450 --> 00:32:01.110 align:middle line:84%
over there the pharaohs over
there that were buried or--

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:03.000 align:middle line:84%
the high priests over
there that were buried

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.970 align:middle line:84%
were buried because they had a
specific energy in their bodies

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:08.370 align:middle line:84%
that were used to
preserve certain chambers

00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:09.520 align:middle line:90%
within the pyramid.

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:14.220 align:middle line:84%
The pyramid was built using
electromagnetic pulsation

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:16.590 align:middle line:84%
and electromagnetic
laser pulsation.

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:18.550 align:middle line:84%
That's why, as I'm
sure you've seen,

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:20.850 align:middle line:84%
there are many visuals
of lasers coming out

00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:22.242 align:middle line:90%
of the apex of the pyramid.

00:32:22.242 --> 00:32:23.700 align:middle line:84%
There are also
lasers that come out

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:24.908 align:middle line:90%
of the bottom of the pyramid.

00:32:24.908 --> 00:32:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Because the pyramid
were used as crafts.

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:29.290 align:middle line:84%
Now a lot of people say,
how is that possible?

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:30.210 align:middle line:90%
It's just stone.

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:31.710 align:middle line:90%
Stone can't move.

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:33.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, stone can move
because it's just

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:36.705 align:middle line:84%
a part of anything
else that's alive

00:32:36.705 --> 00:32:39.190 align:middle line:90%
if you define life as energy.

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they
understood things back then.

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:43.295 align:middle line:84%
There was this universal
field of consciousness

00:32:43.295 --> 00:32:44.670 align:middle line:84%
that everything
was connected to.

00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:48.630 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, the actual pyramids
amongst many other tools

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:51.150 align:middle line:84%
that they were using
were crafts to move.

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:54.780 align:middle line:84%
The apex with that laser,
the electromagnetic laser

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:57.990 align:middle line:84%
pulsation, was used to remain
in constant communication

00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:59.220 align:middle line:90%
with other planets.

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:01.770 align:middle line:90%
In other solar systems as well.

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Beyond just our solar system
and outside of our galaxy,

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:06.180 align:middle line:90%
beyond the Milky Way galaxy.

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:09.840 align:middle line:84%
It was used as a
lighthouse in a way.

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:12.600 align:middle line:84%
To give light and to also show
people where they're traveling.

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:14.580 align:middle line:84%
It was used in
ways to communicate

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:17.970 align:middle line:84%
with other races, other
nations, and so on and so forth

00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:18.900 align:middle line:90%
on other planets.

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:21.540 align:middle line:84%
But the main purpose of
the pyramid and the shape

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:24.450 align:middle line:84%
itself is to connect
the physical world

00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:26.040 align:middle line:90%
with the spiritual world.

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And there's a mysticism
numerologically

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:29.400 align:middle line:90%
speaking behind the shape.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:32.220 align:middle line:84%
For example, there's five
points on the pyramid.

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:34.530 align:middle line:84%
The apex and the four
vertices on the bottom.

00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:35.550 align:middle line:90%
Five.

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:37.967 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to go
into the Hebrew language,

00:33:37.967 --> 00:33:40.050 align:middle line:84%
because the Hebrew language
is not a Jewish thing.

00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:42.058 align:middle line:84%
The pharaohs use
the Hebrew language.

00:33:42.058 --> 00:33:44.100 align:middle line:84%
The Hebrew language is
called the Hebrew language

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:46.260 align:middle line:84%
because the Hebrews
adopted it when

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:47.710 align:middle line:90%
they became the Jewish nation.

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:49.950 align:middle line:84%
According to history, when
they received the Torah

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:52.710 align:middle line:84%
on Mount Sinai, they
used the Hebrew language,

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:56.160 align:middle line:84%
which is made up of what Arabic
is actually spoken as well,

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:57.640 align:middle line:90%
just a different language.

00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:00.293 align:middle line:84%
So it's the same letters
the same alphabet the reason

00:34:00.293 --> 00:34:01.710 align:middle line:84%
why that alphabet
is so important,

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:03.877 align:middle line:84%
and then I'll get to the
shape of the pyramid itself

00:34:03.877 --> 00:34:05.910 align:middle line:84%
so we can understand the
numerology behind it,

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:09.270 align:middle line:84%
is because Hebrew is one of
the few languages that was not

00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:10.770 align:middle line:90%
created, it was discovered.

00:34:10.770 --> 00:34:12.520 align:middle line:90%
It's a mathematical language.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.760 align:middle line:84%
So each letter,
according to Gematria,

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:16.889 align:middle line:84%
has a certain number
associated with it.

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:19.020 align:middle line:84%
Aleph is one, Bet
is two, Gimel is

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:20.530 align:middle line:90%
three, and so on and so forth.

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:22.710 align:middle line:84%
So five represents
the letter Hei,

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:24.570 align:middle line:84%
which is the fifth
letter of the alphabet.

00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:26.250 align:middle line:90%
Hei represents God.

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:29.280 align:middle line:84%
Just like in other languages,
anything to represent God

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:31.560 align:middle line:84%
is something that you
have to breathe with.

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:34.449 align:middle line:90%
So for example, Jehovah.

00:34:34.449 --> 00:34:37.270 align:middle line:84%
Yehovah, that comes from
the Hebrew language.

00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:40.319 align:middle line:84%
So you have your five points,
which is the letter Hei.

00:34:40.319 --> 00:34:41.400 align:middle line:90%
It represents--

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.540 align:middle line:90%
>> The base and the top?

00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:44.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Correct, the top
and the four vertices.

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:46.222 align:middle line:90%
Then you have eight lines.

00:34:46.222 --> 00:34:48.389 align:middle line:84%
If you count the amount of
lines that the pyramid is

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:52.389 align:middle line:84%
made up of-- one, two, three,
four, five, six seven, eight.

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:54.260 align:middle line:90%
That represents infinity.

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:57.010 align:middle line:90%
Then you have 10 surfaces.

00:34:57.010 --> 00:35:01.840 align:middle line:84%
You have four sides
and one bottom.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.790 align:middle line:90%
The outside and the inside.

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:06.430 align:middle line:84%
So there's outside surfaces
and inside surfaces.

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:09.190 align:middle line:90%
The number 10 represents giving.

00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:11.710 align:middle line:84%
By the way, in Hebrew,
the word "ten," [HEBREW],,

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:13.060 align:middle line:90%
means "to give."

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:16.222 align:middle line:84%
In Judaism, they consider
mystical Judaism.

00:35:16.222 --> 00:35:18.430 align:middle line:84%
They consider that there
are 10 different dimensions.

00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And God consciousness is
the 10th dimension of being.

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:25.060 align:middle line:84%
Each dimension is
infinite in and of itself.

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:26.680 align:middle line:90%
But 10 represents giving.

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And the energy of God is
to give unconditionally.

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:30.320 align:middle line:90%
It's to give.

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:33.100 align:middle line:84%
So I'm giving you a few numbers
of how the pyramid is built

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:35.020 align:middle line:84%
and why that shape
is that shape.

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:37.803 align:middle line:84%
And beyond that, the last
thing is in the document.

00:35:37.803 --> 00:35:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is just information
that's in the document.

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:41.830 align:middle line:84%
Everybody can do what
they want with this.

00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:44.260 align:middle line:84%
Is there's a very big
emphasis on the fact

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:47.050 align:middle line:84%
that around the world
or in the cosmos,

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:49.810 align:middle line:84%
everything is a sphere with
the exception of one star.

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And they call that
the pyramid star.

00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:56.100 align:middle line:84%
The pyramid star is a planet
that the organization says

00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:57.450 align:middle line:90%
is in the shape of a pyramid.

00:35:57.450 --> 00:36:00.120 align:middle line:84%
Meaning there is a mystical
nature to the pyramid

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.380 align:middle line:84%
shape in nature
in and of itself.

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:04.620 align:middle line:84%
I believe the awareness
of that planet

00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:08.830 align:middle line:84%
is what caused for these beings
and higher races to go and say,

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:10.530 align:middle line:84%
we understand the
shape of the pyramid,

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:13.560 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to use that on
our planets beyond just Earth.

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:16.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, how do we tie all of
this-- and I want to thank you.

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:17.800 align:middle line:90%
This has been an amazing--

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:18.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>> --conversation.

00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:21.870 align:middle line:90%
And I had big expectations.

00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:23.820 align:middle line:90%
We went way beyond that.

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:24.720 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:27.120 align:middle line:84%
How do we tie it all
together and how do we

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:29.250 align:middle line:90%
start to move forward?

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:32.340 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say the goal of the
organization, my goal as well,

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:33.840 align:middle line:84%
this is why I aligned
with them, is,

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:36.510 align:middle line:84%
how do we reach a state
of universal awareness?

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Universal awareness is the
equivalent of the awareness

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:40.710 align:middle line:90%
that you have in your body.

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:42.807 align:middle line:84%
Just like you would
never take a hammer

00:36:42.807 --> 00:36:44.640 align:middle line:84%
and break your own leg
because it's your leg

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:47.950 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to hurt, that's
how humanity works as a whole.

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:50.040 align:middle line:84%
So within the word
humanity, if you take out

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:52.960 align:middle line:84%
the H, the M, and the A, you're
left with the word unity.

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.320 align:middle line:90%
We forgot that.

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.440 align:middle line:84%
So when there's a
starving child in Africa,

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:57.910 align:middle line:84%
when there's a
genocide in Syria,

00:36:57.910 --> 00:37:00.850 align:middle line:84%
when there's all these things
going on around the world,

00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:02.570 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people say,
I'm OK in America.

00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:03.370 align:middle line:90%
Everything's fine.

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:04.558 align:middle line:90%
I'm OK in my country.

00:37:04.558 --> 00:37:06.100 align:middle line:84%
Everything's fine
because I have food

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:07.630 align:middle line:90%
on the table for my family.

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:10.510 align:middle line:84%
We've forgotten and we're
so numb to this idea

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:12.520 align:middle line:84%
of universal awareness
that we don't

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:13.968 align:middle line:84%
feel the pain of
what's going on.

00:37:13.968 --> 00:37:15.260 align:middle line:90%
in the other side of the world.

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And until we feel that, things
will continue happening around

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:20.140 align:middle line:90%
the world to make us feel that.

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:20.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>> So the quicker we can feel
and wake up out of this coma

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:27.220 align:middle line:84%
of awareness and get rid of the
anesthesia in our collective

00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:30.130 align:middle line:84%
body so we could see the world
once and for all for what it

00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:33.250 align:middle line:84%
truly is, the quicker we can
feel starvation in Africa,

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:36.490 align:middle line:84%
poverty in India, and genocides
occurring all around the world,

00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:38.620 align:middle line:84%
the quicker we will
start to take action.

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately,
once we truly reach

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.580 align:middle line:84%
a state of universal
awareness, this world

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:46.452 align:middle line:84%
will no longer know war
or corruption or greed

00:37:46.452 --> 00:37:47.410 align:middle line:90%
or any of those things.

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:48.410 align:middle line:90%
We'll know the opposite.

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:51.270 align:middle line:84%
There will be a world of peace,
of unity, compassion, love,

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:52.070 align:middle line:90%
respect.

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:53.052 align:middle line:90%
And so on and so forth.

00:37:53.052 --> 00:37:54.760 align:middle line:84%
But we have to move
through that process.

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:55.645 align:middle line:90%
>> It's going to sting.

00:37:55.645 --> 00:37:56.445 align:middle line:90%
>> I love that.

00:37:56.445 --> 00:37:58.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Kind of like
ripping off a Band-Aid.

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:00.500 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to do it,
but you got to do it.

00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:01.300 align:middle line:90%
>> No choice.

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>> And you have to do
that to move forward.

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:03.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:05.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Jason Shurka, amazing.

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:05.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:06.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much, my friend.

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:07.628 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much.

00:38:07.628 --> 00:38:09.160 align:middle line:90%
>> This is "Into the Vortex."

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:11.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm Jimmy Church, and
we'll see you next time.
