>> I'm radio and television
host, Jimmy Church.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And I'm here to uncover
the truth about some

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.630 align:middle line:90%
of life's biggest mysteries.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.200 align:middle line:84%
If this is revealed,
everything has to be rewritten.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.670 align:middle line:84%
My guest today is John Michael
Godier, a science communicator

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.400 align:middle line:84%
and futurist whose
documentaries explore

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.120 align:middle line:84%
advanced technologies and the
mysteries of the universe.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.518 align:middle line:90%
>> There's probably life out.

00:00:34.518 --> 00:00:36.060 align:middle line:84%
There there's probably
a lot of life,

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.440 align:middle line:84%
and there's probably
intelligent life.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.650 align:middle line:90%
That's why I look for it.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Technical assistant Josh--

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh, can you
pull up the map?

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.010 align:middle line:10%
>> --also joins us to
help set the scenes.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.120 align:middle line:84%
Join us as we deep dive to
get to the bottom of some

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.750 align:middle line:84%
of the most intriguing
questions of our time.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think there will be an
announcement about alien life?

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.078 align:middle line:90%

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome to "Into the Vortex."

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host Jimmy
Church, and this

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.860 align:middle line:84%
is an exciting time for all of
humanity with the James Webb

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.120 align:middle line:90%
Space Telescope.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.682 align:middle line:84%
Josh, today we have
John Michael Godier.

00:01:20.682 --> 00:01:21.640 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready for this?

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm excited the implications
about the telescope are

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.840 align:middle line:84%
profound, and I'm excited
to hear more from you.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely extraordinary.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.090 align:middle line:90%
And welcome, John.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.280 align:middle line:90%
But we got to go straight here.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.690 align:middle line:84%
What is the James
Webb Space Telescope?

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.950 align:middle line:10%
>> A long time in coming because
it has taken several decades

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.250 align:middle line:10%
to get this telescope to become
a reality after initially

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.280 align:middle line:10%
planning and funding it.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.100 align:middle line:84%
But it had cost overruns and
took a very, very long time

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.900 align:middle line:90%
to get right.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.210 align:middle line:10%
However, once it
was launched, which

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.953 align:middle line:10%
was a picture perfect
launch, it was truly perfect.

00:01:54.953 --> 00:01:56.370 align:middle line:10%
Nothing went wrong
with the launch

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.495 align:middle line:10%
and the deployment of Webb.

00:01:57.495 --> 00:02:00.510 align:middle line:10%
It had over 250
possible failure points,

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.430 align:middle line:10%
and not a single
thing went wrong.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.680 align:middle line:10%
The telescope deployed
and positioned itself

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.810 align:middle line:10%
at L2, which is a
gravitational point that's

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.940 align:middle line:10%
advantageous for a
telescope like this,

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.460 align:middle line:10%
and began test photography
a few months ago.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.090 align:middle line:10%
Now, we are at the point where
actual science is being done,

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.340 align:middle line:10%
and we're getting the first
images from the telescope.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And they're
spectacular, beating out

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.590 align:middle line:90%
anything we've ever had before.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:27.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, the stated mission is to
look for extraterrestrial life

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.160 align:middle line:84%
out there, not only
in our Milky Way,

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.780 align:middle line:90%
but throughout the universe.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.930 align:middle line:84%
In your view, what do you
think the stated mission is?

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the stated
mission for James W.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.930 align:middle line:84%
Webb Space Telescope is
effectively to study many

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.780 align:middle line:84%
different astronomical phenomena
using the infrared spectrum.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.690 align:middle line:10%
So it will do a
variety of science,

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.940 align:middle line:10%
but including in that is
looking for exoplanets.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.980 align:middle line:10%
Because this
telescope is uniquely

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.610 align:middle line:10%
suited for being able
to try to characterize

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.760 align:middle line:10%
the atmospheres of
exoplanets-- distant ones.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.140 align:middle line:10%
And if you can do
that-- and it's

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.740 align:middle line:10%
done by these planets passing
in front of their star

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.260 align:middle line:10%
blocking a little bit
of light and coloring

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.190 align:middle line:10%
that light with
their atmosphere,

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.710 align:middle line:10%
which allows the
scientists to look

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.980 align:middle line:10%
at the spectroscopy of
this exoplanet's atmosphere

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.630 align:middle line:10%
and see what it's made up of.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.062 align:middle line:10%
Well, if you start seeing weird
levels of oxygen and methane,

00:03:16.062 --> 00:03:17.520 align:middle line:10%
things that shouldn't
be there-- we

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.850 align:middle line:10%
call them disequilibriums, where
the oxygen should be present.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.980 align:middle line:10%
It should react with
everything and rust everything

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.910 align:middle line:10%
and do all of these
sorts of things.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.670 align:middle line:84%
But if something is
replenishing that,

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.090 align:middle line:84%
as what happens here on Earth,
what's doing that here on Earth

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.360 align:middle line:90%
is plant life.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.180 align:middle line:84%
So that would be
a good indicator

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.740 align:middle line:84%
that there is some type of
biosphere on that exoplanet

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.030 align:middle line:84%
if you start seeing
those weird levels.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.990 align:middle line:10%
The other things that you may
see are things like CFCs--

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.060 align:middle line:10%
artificial chemicals
in an atmosphere

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.060 align:middle line:10%
that might tell you
that possibly there

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.490 align:middle line:10%
is an extraterrestrial
civilization burning

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.800 align:middle line:10%
a hole in their ozone
layer with that.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.485 align:middle line:90%
That was freon, essentially.

00:03:54.485 --> 00:03:55.860 align:middle line:10%
And those are the
types of things

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.570 align:middle line:10%
that James Webb
can start to look

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.390 align:middle line:10%
for to try to get
some idea if there

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.070 align:middle line:10%
is a technosignature there.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.470 align:middle line:10%
But fundamentally, it
will try to characterize

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.280 align:middle line:10%
all types of
exoplanet atmosphere

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.890 align:middle line:10%
so that we got a
sampling of what

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.860 align:middle line:10%
atmospheres are possible on
exoplanets in the universe.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.390 align:middle line:10%
And that will be
one thing it does.

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.280 align:middle line:10%
But it will also
fundamentally look

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.800 align:middle line:10%
at the very furthest
reaches of the universe

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.250 align:middle line:10%
that it can at the very
beginning, just after the Big

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.380 align:middle line:10%
Bang, and look at
the earliest galaxies

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.230 align:middle line:10%
and how they formed, and
even the earliest stars.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.990 align:middle line:10%
There are stars
that we hypothesize

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.990 align:middle line:10%
exist called Population III
stars that are very, very

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.660 align:middle line:10%
early, have only mostly
hydrogen and helium in them,

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.820 align:middle line:10%
were amongst the first
stars in the universe.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.160 align:middle line:10%
And through
gravitational lensing,

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.170 align:middle line:10%
we can actually see
examples of these.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.570 align:middle line:10%
One of them is known as
Earendel, which is a candidate,

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.560 align:middle line:10%
and see what the very
earliest universe looked like,

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.660 align:middle line:10%
as far as galaxies and stars go.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's jump back for a second.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.260 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned biosphere.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.970 align:middle line:90%
What is a biosphere?

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:54.870 align:middle line:90%
>> You live in one.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, it is
an atmosphere that

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.360 align:middle line:84%
is conducive for
life, a biogenesis,

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.760 align:middle line:90%
to arise in and then adapt.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.620 align:middle line:84%
Because what life
on Earth did was

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.960 align:middle line:84%
it started with Earth's
original atmosphere

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.530 align:middle line:90%
and then oxygenated it.

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.250 align:middle line:84%
So once we had the very
simple anaerobic life

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.310 align:middle line:84%
arise on this planet, it
started producing oxygen

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.080 align:middle line:90%
once it hit photosynthesis.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And that oxygenated
our atmosphere,

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.510 align:middle line:84%
giving a very reactive
element for more complex life

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:22.470 align:middle line:90%
to evolve.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we ended up
here is through that very, very

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.060 align:middle line:84%
long-- billions of years
long process of Earth

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.250 align:middle line:84%
changing its own
biosphere in order

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.950 align:middle line:90%
to be more habitable for life.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.590 align:middle line:10%
Unfortunately, that didn't
benefit the very earliest life

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.620 align:middle line:10%
on Earth, which oxygen
is poisonous to them.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.870 align:middle line:84%
So they now live
deep below the Earth

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.270 align:middle line:84%
where there is no
oxygen and they--

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're looking
essentially for other Earths?

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.740 align:middle line:84%
>> And a technosignature,
which we hear this a lot today,

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.300 align:middle line:84%
and the imagination just
goes with what that may be.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.870 align:middle line:84%
What is a technosignature
and why would we look for it?

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, a biosignature
is the sign of life.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.960 align:middle line:84%
You're looking for
algae and plants

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.757 align:middle line:84%
because those would be the
most obvious signatures.

00:06:12.757 --> 00:06:14.340 align:middle line:10%
With a technosignature,
you're looking

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.440 align:middle line:10%
for the mark of a civilization.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.630 align:middle line:10%
You're looking for
the mark of technology

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.730 align:middle line:10%
on the signal you see
with the telescope.

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.440 align:middle line:10%
And there are many
ways this can happen.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.880 align:middle line:10%
Radio astronomers look
for radio signals.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.260 align:middle line:10%
And here, we're looking for
visual cues at exoplanets

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.430 align:middle line:10%
with JWST to try to determine
if there is a technosignature

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.200 align:middle line:10%
that we can tease out of that.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.788 align:middle line:10%
And, of course, that
remains to be seen.

00:06:37.788 --> 00:06:39.330 align:middle line:10%
But if you see
something weird, there

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.640 align:middle line:10%
are things that
it could pick up.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:50.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Today, we understand now that
every star that we can see from

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.760 align:middle line:10%
our backyard has at
least one planet.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:58.770 align:middle line:84%
This is an assumption now that
was fantasy just 20 years ago.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:02.700 align:middle line:84%
We still were wondering if
there were other planets

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.090 align:middle line:90%
beyond our solar system.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, we know that every star
has a planet next to it.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.900 align:middle line:84%
The James Webb Space Telescope,
their deep field image--

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.800 align:middle line:84%
Josh, can you pull
up the deep field?

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Certainly.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.060 align:middle line:10%
>> When we look at the
deep field as opposed

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:23.940 align:middle line:10%
to Hubble's original deep field
image, and we look at this.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:28.590 align:middle line:10%
First, we see a collection of
galaxies that goes on nearly

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:29.850 align:middle line:10%
to infinity.

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:34.930 align:middle line:10%
And each one of those
galaxies has 50 billion

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.090 align:middle line:10%
to a trillion stars in it.

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.750 align:middle line:10%
And each one of those
stars has a planet.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:45.100 align:middle line:10%
So we are potentially
looking at in this image

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:49.300 align:middle line:10%
hundreds of trillions, trillions
of trillions of planets.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.210 align:middle line:10%
And it goes on
nearly to infinity.

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.200 align:middle line:84%
>> It is possible that planets
actually outnumber stars

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.000 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:56.980 align:middle line:90%
We don't know yet.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:00.550 align:middle line:10%
But it is possible that if--
each one of those stars--

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:03.520 align:middle line:10%
each one of those galaxies
of 100 billion suns or more

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.190 align:middle line:10%
may have more than
just one planet.

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:08.950 align:middle line:10%
They may have eight
planets like ours does.

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:11.470 align:middle line:10%
If enough of those
happen, then planets

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:15.550 align:middle line:10%
outnumber even stars and the
observable universe, which is

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.320 align:middle line:10%
a staggering amount of planets.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.720 align:middle line:10%
There is no possible
way that this

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.180 align:middle line:10%
could be the only one like
this that's inhabited.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:25.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Are you of the same mind--
you've been writing about

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:29.350 align:middle line:10%
science and reporting on it
not only in our community,

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:33.820 align:middle line:10%
but through other media
outlets for many years.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:39.039 align:middle line:84%
Are you now on board with
where science is today,

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:43.549 align:middle line:84%
that there is not only life
out there, but infinite life,

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:47.410 align:middle line:84%
and we have no idea how much
life is actually out there?

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:50.140 align:middle line:84%
>> I would take the position
that I'm skeptical that we

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:51.460 align:middle line:90%
would be alone.

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:52.780 align:middle line:90%
How could that be?

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.190 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how could that be?

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:56.080 align:middle line:84%
If we were alone
in the universe,

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.850 align:middle line:84%
just generally
speaking, this would

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:01.870 align:middle line:84%
be like the island from Lost,
where chemical processes happen

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:03.505 align:middle line:90%
here and nowhere else.

00:09:03.505 --> 00:09:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think that
gets mentioned enough,

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:08.690 align:middle line:84%
that when you say that
we are probably alone,

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:09.760 align:middle line:90%
that's a tall order.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Because why should
we be special?

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Why should this
planet be magical?

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:17.060 align:middle line:90%
It'd be a unicorn.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:21.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's completely reasonable
to say there's probably

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:21.980 align:middle line:90%
life out there.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.720 align:middle line:84%
There's probably a lot of
life, and there's probably

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.500 align:middle line:90%
intelligent life.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:25.550 align:middle line:90%
It would not surprise me.

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:27.170 align:middle line:90%
That's why I look for it.

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:31.220 align:middle line:10%
>> Is the James Webb Space
Telescope the pinnacle--

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:35.000 align:middle line:10%
the highest point of our
technology to this point?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.740 align:middle line:10%
Is this the most extreme thing
that we have developed yet?

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:42.270 align:middle line:10%
>> It's our best, most
capable instrument to date,

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.600 align:middle line:10%
but it will eventually
be superseded.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.690 align:middle line:90%
There's bigger we can do.

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:46.940 align:middle line:90%
We can do all sorts of things.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.900 align:middle line:84%
If you really want to search for
extraterrestrial intelligence,

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.990 align:middle line:84%
build a radio telescope on the
far side of the moon, where

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:55.970 align:middle line:84%
you're blocking all
radio signals from Earth,

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.243 align:middle line:84%
and you're only hearing
that from space.

00:09:58.243 --> 00:09:59.660 align:middle line:84%
There are many
directions we could

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.265 align:middle line:90%
go to continue this search.

00:10:01.265 --> 00:10:03.140 align:middle line:84%
It's just that James
Webb's got a good chance

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:04.015 align:middle line:90%
of finding something.

00:10:04.015 --> 00:10:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And the amount of mysteries,
just natural mysteries,

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.450 align:middle line:84%
that'll come from this
telescope is staggering.

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:15.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, I don't think that
most people understand

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:18.800 align:middle line:84%
the importance of what is
actually going on here.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.740 align:middle line:84%
It's one thing to
find an exoplanet.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.770 align:middle line:84%
But it's another thing
to be able to peer

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:30.650 align:middle line:84%
into that exoplanet atmosphere
that is uncountable light

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:31.520 align:middle line:90%
years away.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.960 align:middle line:84%
We obviously cannot see it, but
we can through the James Webb,

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:40.710 align:middle line:84%
and look at its atmosphere and
see what is happening on that

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:41.510 align:middle line:90%
planet.

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:44.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, even if you don't
see a biosignature or anything

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.750 align:middle line:84%
that's suggesting life, we still
don't know what atmospheres are

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:49.910 align:middle line:90%
possible on exoplanets.

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.770 align:middle line:84%
We see the atmospheres
of our solar system.

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:56.270 align:middle line:84%
But what else is possible that
we don't have an example of?

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:59.468 align:middle line:84%
What interesting
scientific profiling,

00:10:59.468 --> 00:11:01.010 align:middle line:84%
which is important
to people like me,

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:02.630 align:middle line:84%
science fiction
authors, where you

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:04.580 align:middle line:84%
want to try to imagine
what alien planets look

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:05.810 align:middle line:90%
like up close.

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:10.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, what does a different
atmospheric makeup mean?

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:12.290 align:middle line:84%
Do you even need the
atmosphere that we

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:14.180 align:middle line:90%
have for a situation for life?

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.520 align:middle line:84%
Or could some weird other
mix of gases happen?

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.890 align:middle line:90%
So those questions are all open.

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you have the ability
yourself to look at the data

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:30.950 align:middle line:84%
as it's coming in and what
is currently being observed

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:33.770 align:middle line:84%
by the James Webb
Space Telescope.

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:38.060 align:middle line:84%
What can you tell me about
some of the focus of projects

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.010 align:middle line:84%
right now and what
they are looking at?

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>> It is very,
very comprehensive.

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:45.392 align:middle line:84%
That telescope is constantly
observing right now,

00:11:45.392 --> 00:11:47.600 align:middle line:84%
and the schedules of
observation are being published.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.460 align:middle line:10%
So it's looking at everything
from the TRAPPIST-1 planets,

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.430 align:middle line:10%
which are obviously
of great interest,

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:54.860 align:middle line:10%
all the way to distant galaxies.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:59.210 align:middle line:10%
It's spending time on
everything to give a nice mix

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:03.800 align:middle line:10%
to the scientists requesting
research time on the telescope.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.370 align:middle line:84%
That's not to say
that James Webb--

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:07.970 align:middle line:84%
if you see another Oumuamua
or something like that,

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:11.720 align:middle line:84%
that telescope can turn on it on
a dime and make an observation.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:12.800 align:middle line:90%
They leave that in.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:17.210 align:middle line:84%
There's built-in time for
opportunistic observations.

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:20.270 align:middle line:84%
But the comprehensiveness
of the schedule

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:22.530 align:middle line:84%
shows just how capable
the telescope is.

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:26.150 align:middle line:84%
So for a few hours it'll
look at exoplanets-- various

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.990 align:middle line:90%
exoplanets.

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:30.320 align:middle line:84%
For a few more hours it'll
look at a very distant galaxy.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.730 align:middle line:84%
A few more hours,
something else.

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And then it might turn
towards Jupiter, whatever.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:35.750 align:middle line:90%
They're very dynamic.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:38.960 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to look at some other
images real quick before we

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.230 align:middle line:90%
continue.

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:42.890 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at
Stephan's really quick.

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And this-- I want
your comments here.

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:48.710 align:middle line:10%
This is an extraordinary image.

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:53.780 align:middle line:10%
And my question has always been,
how did we look at this before,

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.210 align:middle line:10%
and what do we see, and
what's the difference here?

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:58.140 align:middle line:10%
And what is actually going on?

00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:59.930 align:middle line:10%
This is a pretty amazing image.

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:02.570 align:middle line:10%
>> That is a group of galaxies
interacting and colliding

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:04.310 align:middle line:10%
galaxies called
Stephan's Quintet.

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:07.010 align:middle line:10%
And what you're seeing
there is one of the galaxies

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:07.820 align:middle line:10%
is not involved.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.080 align:middle line:10%
It's a foreground object.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.930 align:middle line:10%
But the other three you can see
are intermixing and interacting

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:13.730 align:middle line:10%
with each other--

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:14.780 align:middle line:10%
trading stars.

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:16.700 align:middle line:10%
There are planets
and stars being

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.850 align:middle line:10%
traded between those
galaxies gravitationally.

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:22.070 align:middle line:10%
And what you're seeing is
that a sort of collision.

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:24.140 align:middle line:10%
It's very slow, coalescing.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:27.380 align:middle line:10%
Now, what's different between
images we've seen of this--

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:29.210 align:middle line:10%
and this particular
group of objects

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:30.830 align:middle line:10%
was discovered in
the 19th century.

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:32.990 align:middle line:10%
We've known about it
for a very long time.

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:35.580 align:middle line:10%
What we're seeing is,
number one, in infrared,

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:37.700 align:middle line:10%
which gives you details
that you normally

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.820 align:middle line:10%
wouldn't see because visible
light can be blocked by dust.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:44.150 align:middle line:10%
Infrared makes it through
much more efficiently,

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:46.630 align:middle line:10%
and you can actually see
through these dust clouds

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:47.630 align:middle line:10%
and see what's in there.

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:50.120 align:middle line:10%
So you get a much,
much greater ability

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.410 align:middle line:10%
to see stuff going on there.

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:53.330 align:middle line:10%
And it's at much
higher resolution

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.310 align:middle line:10%
than we've ever
photographed before.

00:13:55.310 --> 00:14:01.180 align:middle line:10%
>> This next image
IC 5332, Josh.

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.950 align:middle line:10%
>> It's an extraordinary image.

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:05.990 align:middle line:10%
That is an infrared
image of a Galactic core.

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:08.410 align:middle line:10%
And you can see all of the
filaments of gas and dust

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:10.540 align:middle line:10%
and star-forming
regions in that.

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:13.690 align:middle line:10%
And you can see that they--
how they're interacting.

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:16.972 align:middle line:10%
And astronomers can look
at that and determine

00:14:16.972 --> 00:14:18.430 align:middle line:10%
the Galactic
evolution that's going

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:22.277 align:middle line:10%
on there as stars form and all
sorts of things happen there.

00:14:22.277 --> 00:14:23.110 align:middle line:90%
>> So Galactic core.

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:24.902 align:middle line:84%
You mean, that's the
beginning of a galaxy?

00:14:24.902 --> 00:14:26.650 align:middle line:84%
>> That is the very
center of a galaxy.

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:27.580 align:middle line:90%
>> As it's forming?

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:27.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And we happen to see
this one face-on.

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:32.740 align:middle line:84%
So you're looking at
it basically face-on.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And you're looking
at the exact center.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:37.123 align:middle line:10%
Now, I don't know anything
about this particular galaxy,

00:14:37.123 --> 00:14:39.040 align:middle line:10%
but there's probably a
supermassive black hole

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:39.520 align:middle line:10%
right in the center.

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.630 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, I was just
noticing the same thing,

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:42.910 align:middle line:10%
and that was my comment.

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:48.460 align:middle line:10%
But again, every speck
of light that we see here

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:52.400 align:middle line:10%
is a sun, a star,
with a solar system.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.200 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.060 align:middle line:10%
And the number is
just astonishing.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.700 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I think
there's something

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:02.980 align:middle line:10%
on the order in the observable
universe of 246 trillion stars.

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:07.210 align:middle line:10%
Well, a certain percentage
of those, like 90-something%

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:10.210 align:middle line:10%
are red dwarfs, which we
think might be habitable.

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:12.560 align:middle line:10%
Then another few percent
are orange dwarfs-- type K

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:13.360 align:middle line:10%
orange dwarfs.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:16.240 align:middle line:10%
And then you get
our sun, a type G.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.970 align:middle line:10%
That's the majority of
those stars are habitable.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:22.600 align:middle line:10%
It's-- again, the numbers just
don't allow us really to be

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.230 align:middle line:10%
alone, especially-- and it can
get worse because we don't know

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:28.060 align:middle line:10%
what the geometry
of the universe is.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:32.020 align:middle line:84%
But it appears to be a sort of
flat geometry, as they call it.

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And that just simply means
that if you run a railroad

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:39.320 align:middle line:84%
track across the universe,
the tracks will never meet.

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.610 align:middle line:84%
So it's a-- just a geometry
just like we're familiar with.

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:44.110 align:middle line:90%
It seems to be flat.

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:47.740 align:middle line:84%
That could have the implication
of three different geometries,

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:49.370 align:middle line:90%
but one of them is infinite.

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And if the universe is infinite,
there's not only alien life,

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:54.430 align:middle line:84%
there are exact
copies of us outside

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:57.160 align:middle line:84%
of the observable universe, and
there are an infinite number.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:57.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Two.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:59.620 align:middle line:90%
>> What are they pointed at now?

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And before you answer,
is there something

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.890 align:middle line:84%
that you're not
comfortable talking about,

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:09.560 align:middle line:84%
in that they are
looking at something,

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:12.440 align:middle line:84%
and they are suspecting
life on that planet.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:16.715 align:middle line:84%
And today, I'm here to tell
you what planet that is.

00:16:16.715 --> 00:16:19.400 align:middle line:90%


00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I can give you a
number of them that are hinting.

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.950 align:middle line:10%
Mars and Venus both
are hinting strongly

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:26.930 align:middle line:10%
at at least microbial life.

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:28.760 align:middle line:10%
Probably nothing
greater than that.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:30.800 align:middle line:10%
We don't know about Europa.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:31.850 align:middle line:10%
There's hints there.

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:33.260 align:middle line:10%
And Enceladus, for that matter.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.140 align:middle line:10%
Because those ice shell
moons contain entire oceans--

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:39.410 align:middle line:10%
more liquid water than
Earth has in Europa.

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:41.990 align:middle line:84%
So there are candidates
for biosignatures.

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And there are also candidates
for technosignatures.

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:46.940 align:middle line:84%
I'd say probably
the one that needs

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:50.540 align:middle line:84%
the biggest follow-up is a star
known as Przybylski's star.

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:53.270 align:middle line:10%
And this was
discovered in the 1960s

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:57.830 align:middle line:10%
as having a very chemically
anomalous makeup.

00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:59.660 align:middle line:84%
A team in Russia went
and took another look

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.030 align:middle line:84%
at this star thinking, well,
that was a pretty weird star.

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.780 align:middle line:90%
We should take a look.

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:05.119 align:middle line:84%
They looked at it, and they
found transuranic elements

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:09.230 align:middle line:84%
in it-- plutonium and higher
in the periodic table that

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:12.980 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't exist in those
numbers in nature, suggestive

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:15.500 align:middle line:84%
of physics, of some type
of island of stability,

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:19.520 align:middle line:84%
where there's a stability way
up there that things decay down

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.525 align:middle line:90%
and come down to.

00:17:20.525 --> 00:17:22.400 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, you need
something making that.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.970 align:middle line:84%
You need a neutron star
bombarding this otherwise

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:29.300 align:middle line:84%
normal star to get some kind
of nuclear weirdness going,

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.420 align:middle line:90%
and that isn't occurring.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:32.450 align:middle line:84%
So why this thing--
this is the only star

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:35.420 align:middle line:84%
we've ever seen that has
these elements in it.

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:38.600 align:middle line:84%
If they are indeed there and
it's not a measurement problem,

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.910 align:middle line:84%
well, that could be a
technosignature very easily.

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And it was actually advanced as
a technosignature-- plutonium

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.860 align:middle line:84%
and a star, salting a
star with plutonium,

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.770 align:middle line:84%
by Carl Sagan and
Joseph Shklovsky

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:51.470 align:middle line:84%
way back in the 1960s,
that if you ever

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:53.690 align:middle line:84%
saw that, it's a
good technosignature.

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:57.470 align:middle line:84%
>> You've been writing
about this for so long now.

00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:59.630 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a
favorite star, if you

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:03.800 align:middle line:84%
were a betting man,
that would have a planet

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.690 align:middle line:90%
with extraterrestrial life?

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:10.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Do I have a favorite one?

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:14.080 align:middle line:10%
Well, I think the best chance
is the TRAPPIST-1 planets--

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.480 align:middle line:10%
the three that are within
the habitable zone.

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:17.600 align:middle line:90%
But there are others.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:22.000 align:middle line:84%
There are other ones that could
have surface liquid water.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.970 align:middle line:84%
But my favorite candidates are
right here in the solar system

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:26.860 align:middle line:84%
because they hint
and hint and hint.

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:28.570 align:middle line:84%
And that would be
Mars and Venus.

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:32.550 align:middle line:84%
Because you just
see things that--

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:34.560 align:middle line:90%
it's just too earthlike.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:38.060 align:middle line:84%
You start seeing phosphine
in Venus's atmosphere, which

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:39.310 align:middle line:90%
has survived peer review.

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:40.110 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:41.652 align:middle line:84%
There's not very
many things that can

00:18:41.652 --> 00:18:42.840 align:middle line:90%
create that except microbes.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And there you would
have-- if it's present.

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.950 align:middle line:84%
If it turns out
there's microbial life

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:48.510 align:middle line:84%
in the upper
atmosphere of Venus,

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:50.940 align:middle line:84%
you have a very, very
different history of life

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:52.950 align:middle line:90%
there than you do here on Earth.

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:54.662 align:middle line:84%
But it does kind
of give you clues

00:18:54.662 --> 00:18:57.120 align:middle line:84%
on what it's going to be like
hundreds of millions of years

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.010 align:middle line:84%
in the future here
on Earth as life

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:01.620 align:middle line:90%
tries to adapt to a dying star.

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's get into hypotheticals
here for a second.

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:08.670 align:middle line:84%
If we are at this
peak of technology

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:12.780 align:middle line:84%
and this exciting
time of peering out,

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:14.700 align:middle line:84%
and it seems that
everything that we

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.950 align:middle line:84%
look at now not
only has a planet,

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:19.770 align:middle line:84%
but it's in the
Goldilocks zone, and we've

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:21.870 align:middle line:90%
got too much to study now.

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:23.400 align:middle line:90%
That's where we are.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:28.720 align:middle line:84%
But ET must be going through
the exact same thing.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.950 align:middle line:84%
They have their own version of
the James Webb Space Telescope.

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:34.200 align:middle line:84%
They're looking out
into the universe

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.670 align:middle line:90%
and across the Milky Way.

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:38.610 align:middle line:90%
And they see our Earth.

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:40.260 align:middle line:90%
They see our planet.

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:43.800 align:middle line:84%
Depending on how far
away they are from us,

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.620 align:middle line:84%
they could see us
nearly in real time.

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:50.290 align:middle line:84%
They could see nearly you and I
having this conversation right

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:51.090 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:55.110 align:middle line:84%
Or they could look at the
distant past and dinosaurs

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:58.740 align:middle line:84%
and extreme methane
going on in this planet.

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:00.490 align:middle line:84%
But they would be
doing the same thing.

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:04.210 align:middle line:84%
They are looking out
for planets with life.

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:05.010 align:middle line:90%
>> They are.

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And before I dig into that,
one odd thing about this

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.920 align:middle line:84%
is that because a
telescope can only

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:14.040 align:middle line:84%
work a certain way, like an
infrared telescope like James

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:17.080 align:middle line:84%
Webb, it can only
operate a certain way.

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.200 align:middle line:84%
So if you have an alien
civilization with science,

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.307 align:middle line:84%
their telescope, at
least superficially,

00:20:21.307 --> 00:20:22.890 align:middle line:84%
is going to look a
lot like James Webb

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:25.090 align:middle line:84%
because they're using the
same physical principles.

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:26.910 align:middle line:84%
So if you ever want
to see what maybe

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:29.760 align:middle line:84%
a piece of alien
technology might look like,

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.088 align:middle line:84%
a radio telescope or
an optical telescope

00:20:32.088 --> 00:20:33.630 align:middle line:84%
is a good candidate
because they work

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:36.900 align:middle line:84%
on rules that are common
to the entire universe.

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:41.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, what they would see is
that every civilization doing

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:43.530 align:middle line:84%
science with a large enough
telescope in the Milky Way

00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:47.700 align:middle line:84%
galaxy knows this planet
has a biosphere because it's

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:52.170 align:middle line:84%
been screaming an oxygen methane
biosphere, a very unnatural one

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:55.650 align:middle line:84%
outside of the context of
nature itself instead of life,

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:56.940 align:middle line:90%
for billions of years.

00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:58.860 align:middle line:84%
The entire galaxy
has seen this planet,

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:02.160 align:middle line:84%
and is aware that it's
here and hosts a biosphere.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.950 align:middle line:84%
What they can't see is
us because we've only

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:07.380 align:middle line:84%
been producing technosignatures
for about 100 years--

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:08.310 align:middle line:90%
a little longer.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And the radio waves
and indications of that

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:13.170 align:middle line:84%
haven't propagated
out far enough.

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:15.870 align:middle line:84%
They're only out
about 100 light years.

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:18.442 align:middle line:84%
And so most of the
galaxy has not--

00:21:18.442 --> 00:21:19.650 align:middle line:90%
doesn't know that we're here.

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:22.410 align:middle line:84%
They just would know that
there's a biosphere here.

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:28.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, If that's the
case and they visit,

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:31.780 align:middle line:84%
would we know what
we are looking at?

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Would we understand that we
were looking at a species?

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, it would
indicate thousands of species,

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:45.970 align:middle line:84%
not just one, if they
all know that we're here.

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:48.385 align:middle line:84%
Would we know what
we are looking at?

00:21:48.385 --> 00:21:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's a good question
because we only have a sampling

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:51.810 align:middle line:90%
of one.

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:52.920 align:middle line:90%
We know what we look like.

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:53.720 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:54.520 align:middle line:90%
Put it this way.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.890 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't look like
anything you're familiar with,

00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:58.240 align:middle line:90%
you're never going to see it.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.080 align:middle line:90%
You'll just miss it.

00:21:59.080 --> 00:21:59.935 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's--

00:21:59.935 --> 00:22:00.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Why?

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, because you don't have
any indicators on what to look

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:03.690 align:middle line:90%
for.

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:05.920 align:middle line:84%
We can think of a Dyson
sphere, so we look for that.

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:09.140 align:middle line:84%
We can think of radio waves,
so we can look for that.

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:11.680 align:middle line:84%
But what about things like a
nanotechnological cloud where

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.930 align:middle line:84%
this civilization has uploaded
itself into this nanotechnology

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:15.730 align:middle line:90%
cloud?

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:17.938 align:middle line:84%
We have absolutely no idea
what that would look like.

00:22:17.938 --> 00:22:19.810 align:middle line:84%
We're just-- haven't
thought that far ahead,

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:22.090 align:middle line:84%
so we don't know
what to look for.

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:23.830 align:middle line:90%
So it just depends.

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:26.920 align:middle line:84%
Because as Arthur Clarke
once said long ago,

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.080 align:middle line:84%
"Any sufficiently
advanced technology

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.543 align:middle line:90%
will appear as magic."

00:22:30.543 --> 00:22:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, there is
some wisdom to that

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.180 align:middle line:84%
because we don't know
what they can do.

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:36.940 align:middle line:84%
What's a-- what would our
civilization's technology

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:38.500 align:middle line:90%
look like in a million years?

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:41.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can't really
extrapolate out that far.

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:43.210 align:middle line:84%
So it may be that
we're invisible,

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:47.500 align:middle line:84%
and that we live in a cloud
uploaded to a supercomputer.

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And you'd never see that
anywhere outside of Earth.

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:51.520 align:middle line:90%
So you just don't know.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:54.340 align:middle line:84%
But what you can do is
take shots in the dark

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:57.010 align:middle line:84%
based on what you can
predict that they might do.

00:22:57.010 --> 00:22:59.530 align:middle line:90%
And that's all you've got.

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:06.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Would we see them coming in
that faster than light travel--

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:11.270 align:middle line:84%
well, then we wouldn't see them
coming until they were here.

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:14.570 align:middle line:84%
If they're folding space, or
if there's a wormhole involved,

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:18.320 align:middle line:84%
if they're ejecting out of
the back side of a black hole,

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.690 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't see
them arrive either.

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:23.000 align:middle line:84%
So that's a weird
technosignature

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.750 align:middle line:84%
to look for when we wouldn't
see it to begin with

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:28.820 align:middle line:84%
and wouldn't understand
it if we could.

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:31.830 align:middle line:84%
So we wouldn't see
them until we got here,

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:33.085 align:middle line:90%
which would explain a lot.

00:23:33.085 --> 00:23:34.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And it would
probably kill us.

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:38.540 align:middle line:84%
Because if you have something
coming out of warp, so

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:41.180 align:middle line:84%
to speak, and it's something
like an Alcubierre warp drive,

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:43.472 align:middle line:84%
the amount of radiation that
thing is going to kick off

00:23:43.472 --> 00:23:46.010 align:middle line:84%
would irradiate half the planet
and cause a mass extinction.

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:47.850 align:middle line:84%
That does not appear
to have happened.

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:51.348 align:middle line:84%
So it just doesn't look
like it occurs unless they

00:23:51.348 --> 00:23:52.640 align:middle line:90%
have some way of mitigating it.

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:53.940 align:middle line:90%
But how do you know?

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:55.580 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what would they do?

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:56.580 align:middle line:90%
What would they use?

00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:58.025 align:middle line:84%
So you just--
there's just no way

00:23:58.025 --> 00:24:01.790 align:middle line:84%
to-- you don't have any physical
indicators that you know about

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:03.110 align:middle line:90%
to look for.

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:05.360 align:middle line:84%
So without that
information about knowing

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:08.480 align:middle line:84%
what to look for first, you
can't really make a detection.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.710 align:middle line:90%
So it's all just guesswork.

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, maybe you can come
up with some ideas in maybe

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:14.490 align:middle line:90%
how you could detect it.

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:17.180 align:middle line:84%
But fundamentally,
it probably would

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:18.860 align:middle line:90%
be something you don't expect.

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:21.208 align:middle line:84%
And I imagine that they
probably don't want you to--

00:24:21.208 --> 00:24:23.750 align:middle line:84%
they probably don't want you to
know that they're there, so--

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, part of your research
has focused on the theory

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:31.910 align:middle line:84%
and the suggestion of
Von Neumann probes,

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:37.310 align:middle line:84%
and that would be a way to
go out and not only map,

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:42.530 align:middle line:84%
but check out other exoplanets
and move across the Milky Way

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:46.100 align:middle line:84%
very quickly with a
self-replicating system

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:47.420 align:middle line:90%
in place.

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:51.950 align:middle line:84%
With what is happening today
through our own military

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:54.740 align:middle line:84%
and observations of things
that we can't explain--

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:59.510 align:middle line:84%
the various UAPs, the Tic
Tac videos, the eyewitness

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:01.610 align:middle line:90%
testimony from pilots--

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:03.470 align:middle line:90%
suggests just that.

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And Von Neumann, in the late
'40s, came up with this theory,

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.070 align:middle line:84%
and it seems that we are
living through it today.

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that's
a possibility

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:17.270 align:middle line:84%
that these civilizations
could have now arrived

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:19.920 align:middle line:90%
through self-replicating probes?

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:20.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.510 align:middle line:84%
The Fermi paradox is
predicated on the notion

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:25.460 align:middle line:84%
that if you have
enough time, it's

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:27.810 align:middle line:84%
not hard to put a Von Neumann
probe in every star system

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:28.610 align:middle line:90%
in the galaxy.

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And the Milky Way is well
old enough, billions of years

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:34.340 align:middle line:90%
old enough, to have done it.

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:35.360 align:middle line:90%
So where are they?

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:39.020 align:middle line:84%
You would expect to see some
evidence of them everywhere.

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:40.500 align:middle line:90%
We don't.

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:44.310 align:middle line:84%
So the one way, in order
to defeat the challenges

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:46.290 align:middle line:84%
of crossing vast
amounts of space time,

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:48.300 align:middle line:84%
is to do it with a
robot that doesn't care

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:49.830 align:middle line:90%
about the passage of time--

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:51.100 align:middle line:90%
your Von Neumann probe.

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:53.070 align:middle line:84%
So it can go and
spend 100,000 years

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:54.790 align:middle line:90%
crossing space to get somewhere.

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:55.590 align:middle line:90%
It's a machine.

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:58.310 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't care, as long
as it's still working.

00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:59.310 align:middle line:90%
It just shows up.

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:02.220 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't-- passage of time
doesn't mean anything to it.

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:04.780 align:middle line:90%
There, it could print out--

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:06.510 align:middle line:90%
3D print out anything it wants.

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And if it 3D printed
out an atmospheric probe

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:13.830 align:middle line:84%
and entered the Earth's
atmosphere, which

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:15.960 align:middle line:84%
is the most interesting
exoplanet in the system

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.360 align:middle line:84%
and someone saw
it, there's a UAP.

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.790 align:middle line:84%
So there is a plausible--
completely plausible way

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:23.820 align:middle line:84%
through the Von Neumann
probe to play around

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:27.690 align:middle line:84%
with the idea of the UAP, as the
various groups like the Galileo

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:29.100 align:middle line:90%
Project study them.

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, what about
communication?

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:36.210 align:middle line:84%
Is that something
that we could expect

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:39.330 align:middle line:84%
to see with a technosignature--
how communication

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:41.520 align:middle line:84%
is happening, whether
it's through light

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.860 align:middle line:90%
or some other means?

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:47.310 align:middle line:84%
But wouldn't these probes,
whatever they may be,

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:52.260 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't they need to
communicate to a master

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:55.920 align:middle line:84%
situation and then back to
the home planet too as well?

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:57.965 align:middle line:90%
>> If the home planet matters.

00:26:57.965 --> 00:26:59.340 align:middle line:84%
If the Von Neumann
probe is like,

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:00.930 align:middle line:90%
I don't care where I'm from.

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:02.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm just here to do a job.

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And whatever that job is, you'd
need to know its motivations,

00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:06.570 align:middle line:90%
and you can't.

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:07.830 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how do we know?

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:10.950 align:middle line:84%
If it's motivation is to simply
sit here and watch and make

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:13.080 align:middle line:84%
sure that we never develop
artificial intelligence

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.990 align:middle line:84%
or nanotechnology, we won't
know anything about it

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.870 align:middle line:90%
until we do it.

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:18.412 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden it stops us,

00:27:18.412 --> 00:27:21.000 align:middle line:84%
and that was its
purpose and done.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.570 align:middle line:84%
So highly speculative
as that is,

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:27.700 align:middle line:84%
you just can't know the
motives of such a thing.

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:29.640 align:middle line:84%
So it may not
communicate back home.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Or it may communicate--
again, Clarke tech.

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:34.470 align:middle line:84%
You never know how
it could communicate.

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:37.080 align:middle line:84%
Or it's really directional and
never points its radio signal

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:37.740 align:middle line:90%
towards us.

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:38.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And there is also the mention
of certain frequencies.

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is from the
Department of Defense.

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:53.130 align:middle line:84%
This is also something that
came up in the UFO hearing

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:55.620 align:middle line:84%
with the subcommittee
specifically talking

00:27:55.620 --> 00:28:00.210 align:middle line:84%
about these frequencies, and
were we able to lock on to this

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:03.900 align:middle line:84%
and understand what was going
on and what the motivations were

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.750 align:middle line:84%
with these different craft
that have been spotted.

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:10.890 align:middle line:84%
Would we be able to lock
on to the home planet

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:12.180 align:middle line:90%
through these frequencies?

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And also, a GPS situation
here on our planet where

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:20.370 align:middle line:90%
they may be going to?

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:22.590 align:middle line:90%
Why focus on frequencies?

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:26.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's a
two-tiered answer.

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:30.750 align:middle line:84%
Because, as you know, radio
has an enormous number

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:33.840 align:middle line:84%
of frequencies--
just a huge dial--

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:37.090 align:middle line:84%
and a signal could be
placed at any of those.

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:40.050 align:middle line:84%
So how do you know where to
look on the dial for the radio

00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:41.130 align:middle line:90%
signal?

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:44.270 align:middle line:84%
There, with the UAP--
that's that frequency.

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:45.070 align:middle line:90%
I've heard of it.

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:47.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, but it
seems testable to me--

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:50.460 align:middle line:84%
somebody tune to that
frequency and start listening

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:51.780 align:middle line:90%
and see what you get.

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:54.150 align:middle line:84%
As far as the rest
of it, what do

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:57.660 align:middle line:84%
radio astronomers look for are
natural signals where it would

00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:00.510 align:middle line:84%
make sense that
everybody in the universe

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:02.520 align:middle line:90%
knows about these frequencies.

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.020 align:middle line:84%
So if you put a
signal there, you've

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:07.140 align:middle line:84%
got a better chance of somebody
seeing it than if it's randomly

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:08.460 align:middle line:90%
on the dial somewhere.

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And that is the 1420
megahertz hydrogen line.

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Neutral, natural hydrogen
emits radio at that frequency.

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:20.940 align:middle line:84%
The gas clouds of the universe
are producing radio waves

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:22.290 align:middle line:90%
at that frequency.

00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:24.000 align:middle line:90%
Anybody with science knows that.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.640 align:middle line:84%
No matter where they are
in the observable universe,

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.382 align:middle line:84%
they know about that
radio frequency.

00:29:28.382 --> 00:29:30.090 align:middle line:84%
So that would be a
good place to put one.

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly where we
saw the last signal in 1977.

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:37.230 align:middle line:84%
>> If you were running
the James Webb program,

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:39.930 align:middle line:84%
what would you focus
on in the near future?

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:43.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, exoplanets
because I'm biased.

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:45.400 align:middle line:84%
I want to see
exoplanet atmospheres

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.100 align:middle line:90%
and look for biosignatures.

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:51.600 align:middle line:84%
But that's-- you must leave
plenty of space for astronomy

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.390 align:middle line:84%
itself, and to look
at the early universe,

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:57.210 align:middle line:84%
and the things that James
Webb was really designed for--

00:29:57.210 --> 00:30:00.760 align:middle line:84%
to study the evolution
of the universe.

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.750 align:middle line:84%
So I'd have to temper my
enthusiasm on exoplanets

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:06.003 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that
it got that way.

00:30:06.003 --> 00:30:07.920 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, though,
it's in very good hands,

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:09.378 align:middle line:84%
and the management
of the telescope

00:30:09.378 --> 00:30:12.660 align:middle line:84%
is doing exactly what they
said they were going to do.

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:15.212 align:middle line:10%
And there's an excellent
plan-- very dynamic plan.

00:30:15.212 --> 00:30:16.420 align:middle line:90%
>> What a great conversation.

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:18.043 align:middle line:90%
What did you learn today, Josh?

00:30:18.043 --> 00:30:19.710 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot more that I
didn't know before.

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:20.510 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:21.570 align:middle line:90%
That was fascinating.

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:30.160 align:middle line:84%
>> In closing, Bill Nelson
just recently said a few pretty

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:31.390 align:middle line:90%
shocking things.

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:37.000 align:middle line:10%
And as the administrator of
NASA, to come out in public

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.740 align:middle line:10%
and say there's life out there.

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:41.180 align:middle line:90%
There's something here.

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:43.690 align:middle line:84%
There's something
visiting us, and it's

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:46.960 align:middle line:84%
NASA's job to figure
this out, and this

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.640 align:middle line:90%
is at the top of our list.

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:51.610 align:middle line:84%
Did that surprise you for
the administrator of NASA

00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:56.140 align:middle line:84%
to publicly say we're
not alone, and we're

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:57.255 align:middle line:90%
going to figure this out?

00:30:57.255 --> 00:30:58.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I was
surprised at that.

00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:00.047 align:middle line:84%
I was surprised
that we would even

00:31:00.047 --> 00:31:01.420 align:middle line:90%
have a congressional hearing.

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:03.837 align:middle line:84%
I was surprised at many things
that have developed lately.

00:31:03.837 --> 00:31:04.810 align:middle line:90%
So I'm just saying--

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:08.770 align:middle line:84%
all I'll say is look into it,
and let me know what you find.

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:10.810 align:middle line:90%
And then we'll talk about it.

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:13.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Fascinating conversation,
John Michael Godier.

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:14.300 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:15.583 align:middle line:90%
This is "Into the Vortex."

00:31:15.583 --> 00:31:16.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Jimmy Church.

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And Josh and I will
catch you next time.

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:22.680 align:middle line:90%
