>> I'm radio and television
host Jimmy Church,

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.750 align:middle line:84%
and I'm here to uncover
the truth about some

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.790 align:middle line:90%
of life's biggest mysteries.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.840 align:middle line:84%
If this is revealed,
everything has to be rewritten.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.440 align:middle line:84%
My guest today is Geraldine
Orozco, a hypnotherapist

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.230 align:middle line:84%
and international
speaker, an ET contact

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.820 align:middle line:90%
in the hybrid phenomenon.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>> I begin to feel my body
literally pulling apart.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.030 align:middle line:84%
These five beings are
coming out of this light.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Technical assistant Josh--

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.180 align:middle line:90%
Josh, can you pull up the map?

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.390 align:middle line:10%
>> Also joins us to
help set the scenes.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.500 align:middle line:84%
Join us as we deep dive to
get to the bottom of some

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.440 align:middle line:84%
of the most intriguing
questions of our time.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.140 align:middle line:84%
Could we expect direct
contact like you

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.420 align:middle line:84%
have had for the rest
of the world very soon?

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.906 align:middle line:90%

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.050 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to Into the Vortex.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Jimmy Church.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.430 align:middle line:90%
And today, it's abductions.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.990 align:middle line:90%
It's contactees.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.100 align:middle line:84%
It's what is going on, the
opposite of what the government

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.510 align:middle line:90%
is interested in.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And our guest is
Geraldine Orozco.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.012 align:middle line:84%
Geraldine, welcome
to Into the Vortex.

00:01:28.012 --> 00:01:29.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you so
much for having me.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.630 align:middle line:90%
It's an honor to be here, Jimmy.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, thank you so much, and
I'm going to steer this over

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.200 align:middle line:90%
to Josh for a second.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.930 align:middle line:84%
Josh, if you were abducted,
you made real contact,

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.500 align:middle line:90%
would you talk about it?

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.460 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.060 align:middle line:84%
But I have a lot of admiration
that you've come forward

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.480 align:middle line:90%
and talk so much about it.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.470 align:middle line:90%
We need more of that.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.210 align:middle line:90%
And I hope I would be like you.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's-- I think that's
such a consideration today

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.090 align:middle line:84%
because, Geraldine, our
government is interested

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.650 align:middle line:90%
in the subject apparently.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.660 align:middle line:84%
They're talking
about UFOs and UAPs.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And we've got reports and
congressional hearings

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.270 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of
excitement coming out

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.680 align:middle line:84%
of Washington DC,
everything but addressing

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.930 align:middle line:84%
the millions of
contactees and people

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.120 align:middle line:84%
that have had
abduction experiences.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.170 align:middle line:90%
Why do you think that is?

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well, in the
recent disclosure papers,

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.660 align:middle line:84%
there was mention of being
in proximity to the UFOs

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.270 align:middle line:84%
and people having
psychological side effects,

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.700 align:middle line:84%
physical side effects,
and even pregnancies--

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.750 align:middle line:90%
anomalous pregnancies.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.660 align:middle line:84%
So I think we're starting
to get into the conversation

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.730 align:middle line:90%
where hopefully--

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.690 align:middle line:90%
it's a very complex topic.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.200 align:middle line:84%
So this is something that
will develop for the public,

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.310 align:middle line:90%
I think, in segments.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.850 align:middle line:84%
It's something that has to be
kind of educational in parts.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And we're just going into that
topic because soon enough,

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.290 align:middle line:84%
we have to have the conversation
of who is flying the craft,

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.500 align:middle line:84%
who is behind this incredibly
advanced technology that

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.380 align:middle line:90%
our human body cannot sustain.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, of course.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you watched the
recent congressional hearing

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.130 align:middle line:90%
with the subcommittee.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.900 align:middle line:84%
If you were called to testify
to step up and discuss

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.780 align:middle line:84%
your experiences,
would you do it?

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:12.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:13.710 align:middle line:90%
No problem.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:14.840 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very
important that we

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.257 align:middle line:84%
start having these conversations
and taking them seriously

00:03:17.257 --> 00:03:20.480 align:middle line:84%
because the number of people
that are claiming having

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.000 align:middle line:84%
abduction experiences are in
the millions-- people that

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.570 align:middle line:90%
have some kind of contact.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And then resulting in PTSD,
psychological side effects,

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.080 align:middle line:90%
physical side effects.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And now we're going to get into
the topic of hybridization,

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.300 align:middle line:84%
which is another very,
very serious topic of women

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.470 align:middle line:90%
that are actually becoming--

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.660 align:middle line:84%
having these symptoms
of becoming pregnant,

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.440 align:middle line:84%
and a very specific outline
of how this contact is

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.970 align:middle line:90%
kind of playing out.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.690 align:middle line:84%
So definitely, there's
an impact in our society,

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.120 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of people that
are coming to the support

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.620 align:middle line:90%
groups like hybrid mother.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.260 align:middle line:84%
We talk about this, but
it's their only place

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.370 align:middle line:90%
to have the conversations.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.000 align:middle line:84%
They can't talk about
this anywhere else.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.792 align:middle line:84%
So we need to provide
support, whether it's

00:03:58.792 --> 00:04:03.080 align:middle line:84%
medical, psychological,
or just group support.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's back up and talk
about your own experience.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.770 align:middle line:84%
You've had things that have
happened throughout your life.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:16.760 align:middle line:84%
But as an adult, you've got a
home, and something happens,

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.140 align:middle line:90%
a light outside--

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.029 align:middle line:84%
the things that
we've heard before,

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:22.280 align:middle line:90%
but it went to the next level.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.010 align:middle line:84%
Can you walk us through that
evening and what happened?

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, October
13th actually 2013.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:35.100 align:middle line:84%
I went to bed around 12 o'clock
at night, and all of a sudden,

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.150 align:middle line:84%
I am woken up to an incredibly
bright light in my room

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.740 align:middle line:84%
where every single
one of the walls

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.370 align:middle line:90%
was covered in white light.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.270 align:middle line:84%
So I opened my
eyes, I look around,

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.270 align:middle line:90%
I look down at my phone.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.140 align:middle line:90%
I pick up my phone.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.240 align:middle line:90%
It says 3:33 in the morning.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.760 align:middle line:84%
It's the first time in my
life that I paid attention

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.410 align:middle line:84%
to any of these
consecutive numbers.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.820 align:middle line:84%
So I thought that
was interesting.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.880 align:middle line:84%
But my window is across my room,
so I had to get out of bed,

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.180 align:middle line:84%
walk over to the window,
and look outside the window

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.580 align:middle line:84%
with the blinds
closed, mind you.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.650 align:middle line:84%
So the bright light
is filling my room

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.760 align:middle line:90%
despite my blinds being closed.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.360 align:middle line:84%
So as I'm looking
outside, my entire body

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.610 align:middle line:84%
begins to paralyze
as I'm trying to see

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.450 align:middle line:90%
what's behind the white light.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And I begin to feel my body
literally pulling apart,

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.700 align:middle line:84%
and I feel myself
going through the wall

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.600 align:middle line:84%
and find myself outside of my
window on top of the garage.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.260 align:middle line:90%
My room is on top of a garage.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm here in front
of this bright light,

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.880 align:middle line:84%
I feel like we are in some kind
of a time space has frozen.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.000 align:middle line:84%
Nothing is moving, no
air, no space, no sound.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.090 align:middle line:84%
I can see to the left of me from
this incredibly bright light

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.060 align:middle line:84%
these five beings are
coming out of this light,

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.960 align:middle line:84%
and one of them approaches me,
and it's the first time that I

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.330 align:middle line:84%
ever saw such a incredible being
that was non-human 7-foot tall,

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:59.210 align:middle line:84%
grey colored body kind
of like an ant almost,

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:04.940 align:middle line:84%
a very exoskeleton type of body,
and eyes that were gigantic

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.080 align:middle line:90%
and dark and black.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And even though it was
terrifying at that moment,

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.550 align:middle line:90%
the being raised the hand.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And I heard telepathically
in my mind the word calm.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And when I heard
that the entire--

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.480 align:middle line:84%
all of the anxiety, the fear
just completely left my body.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.580 align:middle line:84%
So, at that moment, I
understood that I was not

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.800 align:middle line:84%
in control from
this moment forward.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And number two, that I
was dealing with something

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.282 align:middle line:84%
completely out of this
dimension because of the manner

00:06:38.282 --> 00:06:39.490 align:middle line:90%
of how the communication was.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:40.780 align:middle line:90%
It was telepathic.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.810 align:middle line:84%
So I'm brought on board the
craft, and they begin to--

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:47.080 align:middle line:84%
as I'm walking into
this white light,

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.690 align:middle line:84%
I begin to see more
of a form take shape.

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:56.290 align:middle line:84%
And the craft is almost like
a more inter-dimensional kind

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.560 align:middle line:84%
of a substance that looks like
a plasma that kind of shifts

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.450 align:middle line:90%
from plasma to a metal.

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And as I step into
the craft, I can

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:06.130 align:middle line:84%
feel that it's almost
as if it's conscious.

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:07.780 align:middle line:90%
It's like responding to me.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure how
else to explain that.

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:12.610 align:middle line:84%
But as I walk into
the craft, there

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.110 align:middle line:84%
are-- it's like hallways
that turns to the right

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.630 align:middle line:84%
and to the left, and I'm
directed to the left.

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And as I walk inside, the five
of them begin to move forward,

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.150 align:middle line:84%
and the other being
directs his hand again,

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.150 align:middle line:84%
and I begin to see a
kind of hologram that

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.810 align:middle line:84%
appears on top of this craft--
the interior of the craft.

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:35.110 align:middle line:84%
So as I'm being brought
inside this hologram

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:39.340 align:middle line:84%
that it looks like a very sloppy
green undulating hills and very

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:44.320 align:middle line:84%
blue sky, they have this picture
of this obtuse glass building

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.110 align:middle line:90%
that I'm being directed into.

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:51.340 align:middle line:84%
By the time I turn around,
I see two Greys and my aunt

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.380 align:middle line:84%
in her nightgown
walking in front of me.

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.270 align:middle line:84%
She is clearly
unconscious, her hair

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:56.652 align:middle line:90%
is shaggy in her nightgown.

00:07:56.652 --> 00:07:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And they take her in front of
me, and I want to scream out,

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:02.320 align:middle line:84%
but of course, I can't
scream out or move in a way

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.670 align:middle line:90%
that I can reach her.

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:09.370 align:middle line:84%
So she goes behind the hologram,
and immediately this hologram

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:12.310 align:middle line:84%
is removed, and I'm
now inside the craft

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:16.570 align:middle line:84%
looking around at
what is actually

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:20.710 align:middle line:84%
looking like this-- looks
kind of like a control

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:21.760 align:middle line:90%
room of some sort.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.100 align:middle line:84%
There's an oval
console on the left

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.220 align:middle line:84%
with this incredible
holographic structure

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:31.480 align:middle line:84%
like a hologram of the
universe planets and numbers

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.700 align:middle line:90%
and like rulers or--

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:37.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you understand what you
were looking at at that moment?

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:41.260 align:middle line:84%
Did you comprehend, and were
you able to wrap your head

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.830 align:middle line:90%
around this incredible moment?

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:43.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:48.910 align:middle line:84%
No, it was so overwhelming
that it really took--

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:51.340 align:middle line:84%
it was a process, and this
is just the beginning of it

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.040 align:middle line:84%
because later on, it gets
even more interesting.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.170 align:middle line:84%
But as I'm looking
around, I begin

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.360 align:middle line:84%
to notice that I can
see through the craft.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.340 align:middle line:84%
It's actually-- I can see
the stars beyond that.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And in front of me, are three
Greys holding this blue prism

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.050 align:middle line:90%
with eight layers.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:09.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's stop you right there.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.480 align:middle line:90%
You said Greys now with--

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.030 align:middle line:90%
is your mom, your aunt?

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:14.830 align:middle line:90%
>> My aunt.

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:16.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Your aunt was with two Greys.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.050 align:middle line:84%
When you say Greys,
are you describing

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:25.330 align:middle line:84%
a Grey alien, the typical Grey
that we would be familiar with?

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:27.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it would be.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.820 align:middle line:84%
One of them-- the
ones that I was--

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.160 align:middle line:84%
brought me into the craft
were about 7-foot tall.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.420 align:middle line:84%
So very tall, but the ones
inside showing me this hologram

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:41.350 align:middle line:84%
were about maybe 4 to
5-feet tall maximum.

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:47.230 align:middle line:84%
So they were shorter, a
little more stout, but still

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:49.450 align:middle line:90%
the same kind of shape and body.

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:50.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Very interesting.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And you mentioned-- now this
was a physical experience.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:59.410 align:middle line:84%
This wasn't an out-of-body dream
astral projection channeled

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:01.510 align:middle line:84%
event, this was
a physical event.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:04.240 align:middle line:84%
When you were on
top of your garage,

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:08.180 align:middle line:84%
you've metabolized
yourself through this wall,

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:11.815 align:middle line:84%
what do you think your
neighbors would have seen?

00:10:11.815 --> 00:10:13.510 align:middle line:90%
The street is lit up.

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:16.690 align:middle line:84%
There's some type of don't-- we
get aware that everything on is

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:17.920 align:middle line:90%
standing still.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.830 align:middle line:84%
If you were a neighbor
across the street

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:22.630 align:middle line:84%
or down the block
looking out the window,

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:24.190 align:middle line:90%
what would they have seen?

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:26.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I've thought
about this many times.

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it would have been
an incredibly bright light.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:32.630 align:middle line:84%
It-- not like a yellow light
like the sun, but white light.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:34.450 align:middle line:84%
So it would have
literally looked

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:37.000 align:middle line:84%
like a gigantic white light
in the middle of the-- it

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.280 align:middle line:84%
was huge, covering the
entire street and block.

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:47.170 align:middle line:84%
So to me, it was strange
that nobody would get up,

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:50.170 align:middle line:84%
and I do have very, very lovely
neighbors that are always very

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:51.910 align:middle line:90%
caring and looking out.

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:54.790 align:middle line:84%
So I thought that somebody
would have come out,

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:57.160 align:middle line:84%
and I would look around
to see who was awake.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it prompted
me to the next day

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.440 align:middle line:84%
to look and see if there
had been reported sightings.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, I would have liked to have
known if my neighbors had seen

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:11.870 align:middle line:84%
me come through a wall and
what their reaction to that

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:12.670 align:middle line:90%
would have been.

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And you said something else
that I found very interesting.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.110 align:middle line:84%
The craft is somewhere
in this area,

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:24.700 align:middle line:84%
but what you have described
is something much larger

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.880 align:middle line:84%
on the interior of the craft
than what would have been

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.400 align:middle line:90%
seen physically on the outside.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.320 align:middle line:90%
Is that-- does that sound right?

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, that's right.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:37.240 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's one of the
most incredible things

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:40.210 align:middle line:84%
is that when you're walking
into this light, truthfully

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:42.760 align:middle line:84%
you can't really tell when
the light ends and begins

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.320 align:middle line:90%
because it's so radiant.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And it seems as if the craft
is moving shape almost.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:53.650 align:middle line:84%
It seems as if it doesn't
keep a solid shape.

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:55.930 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so when you
go in, definitely, I

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:57.460 align:middle line:84%
mean enough for
the hallways enough

00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:00.600 align:middle line:84%
for going inside these
different rooms much larger.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:04.210 align:middle line:84%
>> It was bigger than the craft
that was above your house?

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:06.070 align:middle line:84%
It would appear
bigger on the inside.

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:09.670 align:middle line:84%
We've heard instances
like this in the past,

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:14.080 align:middle line:84%
but here's another part
with this, which, I think,

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:19.090 align:middle line:84%
is so important is, you
were given and shown--

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:20.740 align:middle line:90%
we'll get into this--

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:25.360 align:middle line:84%
information and some
of it very technical.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.860 align:middle line:90%
It's dealing with physics.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:28.090 align:middle line:90%
It's dealing with math.

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:31.330 align:middle line:84%
It's dealing with pieces
of knowledge that are

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.490 align:middle line:90%
hard for most to understand.

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:39.100 align:middle line:84%
Did you understand or did
you have to unpack this later

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.890 align:middle line:84%
because you have to turn
around and share this knowledge

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:45.070 align:middle line:84%
with everybody else so
they can understand it?

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:50.500 align:middle line:84%
Did you get the complexity
of what you were being shown?

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, so there were several--

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:56.560 align:middle line:84%
how I came into this information
were several segments.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.660 align:middle line:84%
I guess you could say
over the past few years.

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:01.870 align:middle line:84%
The contact
experience in 2013 was

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:05.590 align:middle line:84%
like a download of information,
but not information

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:07.210 align:middle line:84%
that I could quite
understand yet.

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:11.660 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until 2017 that I
began to really dive into that.

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And I began to channel
clearly the information that

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.210 align:middle line:90%
was being shared with me.

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:19.030 align:middle line:84%
So it took some
time, but also you'll

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.520 align:middle line:84%
understand that as a result
of the contact experience,

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.710 align:middle line:84%
I had activated
psychic abilities.

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that was my proof
of what had happened to me.

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:29.350 align:middle line:84%
I think if it wasn't for
the psychic abilities,

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:32.275 align:middle line:84%
I myself was in--
were in disbelief

00:13:32.275 --> 00:13:33.640 align:middle line:90%
of what had happened to me.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.280 align:middle line:84%
So it took a process a
couple of years for me

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:40.120 align:middle line:84%
to want to look into
this information.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Help me understand, and I'm
sure Josh is wondering the same

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:45.250 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:47.430 align:middle line:84%
This is very
complex information.

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:48.660 align:middle line:90%
How do you remember it?

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.140 align:middle line:90%
How do you save this data?

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:50.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:54.270 align:middle line:84%
So the interesting thing about
how this data came through

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:58.140 align:middle line:84%
is like a channeling but
more than just channeling.

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:04.410 align:middle line:84%
It was like actually traveling
the universe in these states.

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:07.530 align:middle line:84%
Literally seeing the
structure of the universe,

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:10.530 align:middle line:84%
seeing it, and experiencing
it through my body

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:12.550 align:middle line:90%
and through this universe.

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:15.720 align:middle line:84%
So, in a way, you're not
just listening to data,

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:18.180 align:middle line:84%
you're experiencing it,
and I think that's really

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:21.870 align:middle line:90%
how you really learn things.

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:26.050 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you translate it for
somebody like myself or even

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:26.850 align:middle line:90%
Josh--

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:29.440 align:middle line:84%
he's smarter than I am--
how do you translate it

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.770 align:middle line:90%
so we can understand it?

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Honestly, these
things seem very complex,

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.230 align:middle line:84%
but you can break them down
into something very simple

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:42.210 align:middle line:84%
as to simply understanding
the role that the human plays

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:43.630 align:middle line:90%
in the bigger picture.

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:46.470 align:middle line:84%
This information doesn't
have to be complex.

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:48.840 align:middle line:90%
It's in nature.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.360 align:middle line:84%
You're understanding
the mechanics of nature,

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.860 align:middle line:90%
and you see it all around you.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:53.970 align:middle line:90%
There is an order.

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:58.080 align:middle line:84%
There's an intelligence to
everything in this universe,

00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.610 align:middle line:90%
and it's quite mathematical.

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:00.720 align:middle line:90%
It's very beautiful.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.420 align:middle line:84%
If you understand that, you
can understand this information

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:05.490 align:middle line:84%
very easily in
terms of your role

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:08.100 align:middle line:84%
as a soul, your
role in the bigger

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.170 align:middle line:84%
picture with these
interdimensional beings.

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And I guess our science
is catching up and in

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:18.480 align:middle line:84%
a way providing lots
of amazing evidence

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.120 align:middle line:84%
to support these concepts
that have been channeled,

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.850 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not the first one that
channeled this information.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:25.680 align:middle line:84%
If you look back
in ancient texts,

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:29.100 align:middle line:84%
you're also going to read
the same kind of information.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.330 align:middle line:90%
So it's known.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:31.920 align:middle line:90%
It's in the field.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Geraldine, what exactly--

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.970 align:middle line:90%
what are we looking at?

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>> So this is my shin.

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:38.340 align:middle line:90%
>> It is your shin.

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:42.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so in this experience,
they put some kind of very slim

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:47.860 align:middle line:84%
metallic rod against my shin as
I'm being strapped like in this

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:48.660 align:middle line:90%
table.

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's an organic kind
of technology that comes in

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:56.620 align:middle line:84%
and touches me there, and
I'm physically feeling it.

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.920 align:middle line:84%
But the next day when I
look, I have this scar,

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:00.390 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't believe.

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:02.430 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't believe
that I actually had a--

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:03.900 align:middle line:90%
>> What was the purpose of it?

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:04.950 align:middle line:90%
Do you have any idea?

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:07.680 align:middle line:84%
>> As far as I know, the
implants that are created are

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:10.920 align:middle line:84%
in order to track your
body whatever you're doing,

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.210 align:middle line:90%
levels of your body.

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:15.390 align:middle line:84%
I also feel that they're
very interdimensional.

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:17.770 align:middle line:84%
Usually, implants
are in the body,

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:19.800 align:middle line:84%
but they're also very
interdimensional.

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:23.190 align:middle line:84%
So depending on what part of the
body these implants are put in,

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:27.720 align:middle line:84%
it will affect certain aspects
of your life, emotional levels,

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.750 align:middle line:84%
perspective even because
our body is pretty complex.

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:35.670 align:middle line:84%
So in the left shin,
represents the divine feminine.

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:37.920 align:middle line:84%
So it has to do very
much with the system

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.730 align:middle line:84%
of your uterus on the left
side this entire meridian line.

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:43.560 align:middle line:84%
We have a meridian
line in the body,

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.020 align:middle line:84%
and essentially,
they are literally

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:48.390 align:middle line:84%
linking to that
meridian line in order

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:51.750 align:middle line:84%
to connect up into the ovaries
and track what is happening.

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Fascinating.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And then we start to approach
a very delicate subject, which

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:03.570 align:middle line:84%
is a possible hybrid alien,
human hybrid program going on.

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:06.119 align:middle line:84%
And just like you
just stated, you're

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:10.079 align:middle line:84%
not the only person to come
forward and talk about this.

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:13.770 align:middle line:84%
I think this is a phenomena
that is difficult for people

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:18.339 align:middle line:84%
to discuss and the processes
involved, and, of course,

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:23.040 align:middle line:84%
being introduced to an
alien child of yours

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:25.109 align:middle line:90%
that is a hybrid.

00:17:25.109 --> 00:17:28.980 align:middle line:84%
Take us through that and when
you were first exposed to this

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:33.510 align:middle line:84%
and shown what possibly might
be your son or daughter.

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:35.580 align:middle line:90%
How do you process that?

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:38.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it was very shocking
because the moment that I saw

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:43.410 align:middle line:84%
the child, it was a telepathic
exchange of recognition

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:44.230 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:50.160 align:middle line:84%
I see the child, and I began to
get memories of all the times

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.420 align:middle line:90%
that I had spent with them.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:54.000 align:middle line:84%
They showed me eight little
lights from this prism.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:54.940 align:middle line:90%
We went in layers.

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:56.970 align:middle line:84%
The first layer
was alien language.

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:58.530 align:middle line:90%
The second layer--

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:00.300 align:middle line:90%
I was taken to the Pleiades.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And the third layer, they
showed me these eight lights.

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And from the eight lights,
four of these beings--

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.600 align:middle line:84%
these children manifested
themselves in this craft

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:13.500 align:middle line:84%
and one of them looked like
a little boy with curly hair.

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:14.850 align:middle line:90%
They had these massive eyes.

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:18.030 align:middle line:84%
The pupils are the size of
my-- this ocular socket.

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I look
at them in the eye,

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:23.010 align:middle line:84%
I recognize myself just in
their-- the way they move,

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:24.420 align:middle line:90%
the way they look.

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.010 align:middle line:84%
I see myself in
the child, and it

00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:29.443 align:middle line:84%
was an incredible powerful
feeling of maternal instinct

00:18:29.443 --> 00:18:31.110 align:middle line:84%
that comes over you
that you're thinking

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:33.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm happy to let go
of my life on Earth

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.380 align:middle line:90%
and just stay here with them.

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time
trying to process

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:40.290 align:middle line:84%
how could you have forgotten
that you had these children?

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:41.820 align:middle line:84%
What kind of
irresponsible person

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:45.660 align:middle line:84%
where am that I don't know
that these children exist?

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:46.980 align:middle line:90%
That was my first feeling.

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:51.640 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you saw your
first child, where was this?

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>> So, on board the craft,
when they were showing me from

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.630 align:middle line:84%
the holographic prism,
the eight levels,

00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:02.190 align:middle line:84%
the third level after
returning from the Pleiades,

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:05.550 align:middle line:84%
were showing me eight little
lights that then manifested

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:06.810 align:middle line:90%
into these children.

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And four of them
were in front of me.

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:13.200 align:middle line:84%
One of them being this
little boy, two girls,

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.990 align:middle line:90%
and one boy that was older.

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:17.670 align:middle line:90%
So it was on board the craft.

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:20.550 align:middle line:90%
>> So walk me through this.

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:23.010 align:middle line:84%
Did you immediately
go, wait a minute,

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:26.580 align:middle line:84%
there was that time two
years ago something--

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.260 align:middle line:90%
and then there was--

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:31.740 align:middle line:84%
is that what you started to
do to look back at your past

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:34.050 align:middle line:84%
where these
opportunities happened?

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:35.280 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't get it yet.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.510 align:middle line:90%
I didn't understand yet.

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:40.290 align:middle line:84%
It was too early,
but immediately I

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:41.830 align:middle line:90%
understood a little later.

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:43.470 align:middle line:84%
But what I understood
in that moment

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:45.730 align:middle line:84%
was that memories
started to come back.

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:46.860 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, oh, yes.

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:48.360 align:middle line:90%
I remember holding this child.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.760 align:middle line:84%
I remember being
with this child.

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:55.050 align:middle line:84%
I remember being on a silver
table and something being

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:57.400 align:middle line:90%
extracted from me several times.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.040 align:middle line:84%
So those are the
memories that came up,

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.428 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't
make sense to me.

00:20:00.428 --> 00:20:02.220 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand
what I was remembering,

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.840 align:middle line:90%
what I was seeing in my memory.

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And I also didn't
know how on Earth--

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:10.860 align:middle line:84%
planet Earth I was thinking
what governmental operation

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:13.290 align:middle line:90%
will help balance this.

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:15.360 align:middle line:90%
Like who manages this stuff?

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.050 align:middle line:90%
That was my thought.

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I can't imagine between
you and your parents and some

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:24.510 align:middle line:84%
of these moments
that were going down.

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:29.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm a father and having to
deal with a subject like this

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:33.810 align:middle line:84%
where that physically something
may have happened to you,

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:37.440 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to get a
doctor involved, and a family

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:41.670 align:middle line:84%
physician, and
questions arise, and you

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:44.490 align:middle line:84%
have to have this conversation
with your parents trying

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:48.090 align:middle line:84%
to figure out possibly
what may have gone on.

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:50.910 align:middle line:84%
How did you deal with it
and walk us through that?

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:56.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, so the very next
day when I wanted to call

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.920 align:middle line:84%
the police in the hospital
because I thought I need

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.190 align:middle line:90%
to talk to someone about this.

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:02.340 align:middle line:84%
How do I-- I was
thinking legally,

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:04.020 align:middle line:84%
like, how do I get
these children back?

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:06.870 align:middle line:84%
I know it sounds funny, but
that was my mind at the time,

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:09.190 align:middle line:84%
trying to understand
how to fit it.

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:13.260 align:middle line:84%
So that whole day, I felt
like I got hit by a truck.

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:14.290 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't move.

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:17.460 align:middle line:84%
I had these like burn marks
here underneath my cheeks,

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:20.460 align:middle line:90%
and I was out.

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:23.533 align:middle line:84%
So the following day on
Sunday, I call my parents,

00:21:23.533 --> 00:21:25.200 align:middle line:84%
and I let them know
what happened to me.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.742 align:middle line:84%
And I told them the
whole story just,

00:21:26.742 --> 00:21:29.280 align:middle line:84%
from beginning to end,
everything that happened.

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.663 align:middle line:84%
And I thought my parents were
going to just laugh or just

00:21:32.663 --> 00:21:34.830 align:middle line:84%
blow it off, but they were
actually very supportive,

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:36.180 align:middle line:84%
and they said, well, it's
very interesting what

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:37.135 align:middle line:90%
happened to you.

00:21:37.135 --> 00:21:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And I asked my father, and I
said, has anything like this

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:40.800 align:middle line:90%
ever happened to you?

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well,
I've had some contact.

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.890 align:middle line:84%
He said it very
like nonchalantly.

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:49.230 align:middle line:84%
So I couldn't believe
that first of all.

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:52.860 align:middle line:84%
It blew my mind because how can
we live in our family circles

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:54.675 align:middle line:84%
and not have these
conversations before?

00:21:54.675 --> 00:21:56.490 align:middle line:90%
He had had sightings.

00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:59.220 align:middle line:84%
My mother, my grandmother
had had sightings.

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:02.730 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, it
was nothing that big.

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:07.360 align:middle line:84%
So, in that moment, I felt
better just for that moment.

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.160 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Relief, right?

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Relief-- a little bit of
a relief to know that I'm not

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:13.920 align:middle line:90%
going crazy.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:18.120 align:middle line:84%
But the next day on Monday, when
I go to work with my client,

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:21.240 align:middle line:84%
and I begin to see her entire
multi-dimensional body that

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.498 align:middle line:84%
was proof to me that
what had happened

00:22:23.498 --> 00:22:25.290 align:middle line:84%
was something that
changed my life forever,

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:28.180 align:middle line:84%
and it did because I couldn't
leave my house for three months

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:28.980 align:middle line:90%
after that.

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:30.690 align:middle line:90%
It was such a powerful shift.

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:34.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Anybody listening to this
conversation right now is

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:39.210 align:middle line:84%
wondering how do you have
a possible pregnancy?

00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:43.080 align:middle line:84%
I say possible because
everything is a question mark

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:44.410 align:middle line:90%
at this point in your life.

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:49.350 align:middle line:84%
But how do you have a pregnancy
and not know about it?

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And was there evidence
of it physically?

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.580 align:middle line:90%
And how did you find that out?

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:55.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:57.787 align:middle line:84%
So when I started to
question how could I

00:22:57.787 --> 00:23:00.120 align:middle line:84%
have become pregnant, how did
I go through that process,

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:03.240 align:middle line:84%
I began to look back at
the history of the memories

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:04.530 align:middle line:90%
that I started to have.

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And linking them with anomalous
experiences in my life,

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:12.960 align:middle line:84%
missing time starting at
the age of 5 and then 16--

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.000 align:middle line:84%
and 16 something happened
to me when I lived--

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.370 align:middle line:84%
I was living in South
America for a couple of years

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:18.990 align:middle line:90%
in school.

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:20.820 align:middle line:84%
I went to an all-girls
Catholic school.

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:24.420 align:middle line:84%
I come from a very,
very spiritual family,

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:25.620 align:middle line:90%
very conservative.

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:28.140 align:middle line:84%
So honestly, at
that point, I really

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:30.450 align:middle line:84%
didn't even understand
what sex was.

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:36.250 align:middle line:84%
So I remember having the first
experience of missing time.

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:40.170 align:middle line:90%
And when I got back to my bed--

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:42.660 align:middle line:84%
I was walking home
from school one day,

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:45.840 align:middle line:84%
and then everything went black,
and I missed time until about 1

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.905 align:middle line:84%
in the morning where I
found myself in my bed.

00:23:47.905 --> 00:23:50.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't know anything that
happened in between that time.

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:53.220 align:middle line:84%
Nobody else knew
in the house, but I

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:56.500 align:middle line:84%
remember waking up to the
first time feeling aroused

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:57.750 align:middle line:90%
for the first time in my life.

00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:59.250 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know that feeling.

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And then, shortly
after, I started

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:05.130 align:middle line:84%
to have strange
symptoms like pregnancy.

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:06.660 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand
it at the time.

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:08.735 align:middle line:84%
My uncle, who was a
doctor, said, oh, you

00:24:08.735 --> 00:24:10.860 align:middle line:84%
must have food poisoning
because I was throwing up.

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:13.140 align:middle line:90%
I was having all these symptoms.

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And weeks go by,
and finally, I have

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:19.080 align:middle line:90%
miscarriage for the first time.

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.110 align:middle line:90%
And I'm so young.

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:20.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm a virgin.

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:24.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any contact
or anything like that.

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:25.660 align:middle line:90%
So that was the first time.

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:29.190 align:middle line:84%
But of course, we didn't
to link these things.

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:35.280 align:middle line:84%
So later on-- years later in
the US again same thing happens.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.930 align:middle line:90%
My cycle is off again.

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:38.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm not partnered.

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:39.420 align:middle line:90%
I become pregnant.

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:41.370 align:middle line:90%
I get really ill.

00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:42.520 align:middle line:90%
I go to the doctor.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:45.030 align:middle line:84%
The doctor says you have some
kind of amoeba that we cannot

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:45.900 align:middle line:90%
identify.

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:48.090 align:middle line:84%
He said have you been out of
the country in the past three

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:48.600 align:middle line:90%
months?

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:49.170 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:49.970 align:middle line:90%
Year?

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:51.000 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.820 align:middle line:84%
So they start giving
me antibiotics.

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:57.960 align:middle line:84%
I became completely allergic
to antibiotics, aspirin,

00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.220 align:middle line:90%
medication.

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:01.350 align:middle line:90%
My body changed completely.

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:03.300 align:middle line:84%
I cannot take anything,
and before that,

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:05.620 align:middle line:84%
I used to take medications
when I needed it.

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:08.700 align:middle line:84%
But from that moment on couldn't
take any kind of medication

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:09.520 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.220 align:middle line:90%
So another shift that happened.

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:13.620 align:middle line:84%
Then in between the
sickness, the doctor

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:17.190 align:middle line:84%
said, you have two months to
live if you don't recover.

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And my whole family started
kind of getting very concerned.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.020 align:middle line:90%
We didn't know what to do.

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:27.480 align:middle line:84%
I had this dream of being
in this white light,

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.810 align:middle line:84%
and this being comes towards
me, and everything just

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:32.250 align:middle line:90%
snaps into black.

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And the next day,
I'm absolutely fine.

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.560 align:middle line:90%
There's no more amoeba.

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.510 align:middle line:84%
I go to the doctor,
nothing, and I

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:41.640 align:middle line:84%
had been rushed to the
hospital like four or five

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.200 align:middle line:84%
times in the past two
weeks prior to that.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.470 align:middle line:90%
So I have the miscarriage again.

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:48.180 align:middle line:90%
No fetus.

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And that pregnancy was probably
around three months already.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you know how many hybrid
children that you have had?

00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:00.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in hypnotherapy,
I recover 24.

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:01.210 align:middle line:90%
>> 24?

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:02.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:03.120 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.630 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and four of
which I actually met,

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:10.440 align:middle line:84%
but pregnancies and miscarriages
probably five times.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And you have to understand
that these are not like things

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.200 align:middle line:90%
that happen commonly.

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.450 align:middle line:84%
Those are very specific
moments in my life

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:20.280 align:middle line:90%
that I was medically affected.

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:23.940 align:middle line:84%
When otherwise my cycle
is perfectly in time,

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:25.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm very healthy.

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:29.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Geraldine, but did your
family physician say that you

00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:30.780 align:middle line:90%
were pregnant?

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:31.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:34.747 align:middle line:84%
So in the times that I
became pregnant at 16,

00:26:34.747 --> 00:26:37.080 align:middle line:84%
I didn't take a pregnancy
test because I wasn't sexually

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:37.500 align:middle line:90%
active.

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.097 align:middle line:84%
And the time when
I became very ill,

00:26:39.097 --> 00:26:41.430 align:middle line:84%
I didn't take a pregnancy
test because I wasn't sexually

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:45.300 align:middle line:84%
active, but my cycle
was late 3 months.

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:49.320 align:middle line:84%
That never happens unless
I'm having these experiences.

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.590 align:middle line:84%
There were other instances
later when I became pregnant

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:56.430 align:middle line:84%
and had a miscarriage that I did
have a positive pregnancy test.

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:58.860 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, that
was when I was actually

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:00.720 align:middle line:90%
in a relationship.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:03.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you know
where they are now?

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:04.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:07.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Where are they?

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:12.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we have to get into
the topic of what is a hybrid.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's do it.

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:14.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's go.

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:16.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.870 align:middle line:90%
Geraldine, what is a hybrid?

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:20.573 align:middle line:84%
So to understand
what a hybrid is,

00:27:20.573 --> 00:27:21.990 align:middle line:84%
we have to understand
a little bit

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:26.860 align:middle line:84%
about how genetics and
insemination works.

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:31.090 align:middle line:84%
We have-- our DNA
is very complex.

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And in our DNA code
within just one cell,

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:37.260 align:middle line:84%
we can get the
history that goes down

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:39.390 align:middle line:84%
through the mitochondria,
which is basically

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:41.940 align:middle line:90%
an aggregate copy of the before.

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:44.400 align:middle line:84%
That means your entire
ancestral lineage.

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:48.600 align:middle line:84%
So in order to create
a new child, this DNA--

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.510 align:middle line:84%
this tiny little DNA
can be utilized in order

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:53.940 align:middle line:90%
to create an entire new human.

00:27:53.940 --> 00:28:00.930 align:middle line:84%
So in the egg, even more so
when we utilize this egg,

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:02.940 align:middle line:84%
basically what is
being done is that this

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:06.960 align:middle line:84%
is being spliced and combined
with other genetic data

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:07.990 align:middle line:90%
of other species--

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:10.980 align:middle line:90%


00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:12.700 align:middle line:90%
interdimensional species.

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:14.770 align:middle line:90%
So we have the idea.

00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:15.780 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about DNA.

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:21.420 align:middle line:84%
DNA-- only 2% of our DNA writes
the code that makes this body--

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:22.830 align:middle line:90%
2% to 3%.

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:25.800 align:middle line:84%
If you think about that that's
massive because the rest

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:30.270 align:middle line:84%
of the DNA then we're
not sure exactly how

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:32.910 align:middle line:84%
that links to the mechanisms
of our physical body.

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:36.960 align:middle line:84%
But within that 2% to 3%
writes every single function

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.260 align:middle line:90%
in this physical body.

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:40.800 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, what's
in the rest of that DNA?

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And previously, it was
shown that is junk DNA.

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:46.200 align:middle line:90%
It's dark DNA.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.390 align:middle line:84%
DNA that doesn't
necessarily directly

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:50.610 align:middle line:84%
or we don't know how
to map how it functions

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:52.570 align:middle line:90%
creation in the physical body.

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:54.930 align:middle line:84%
So this is where we
start understanding

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:57.900 align:middle line:90%
what holographic DNA is.

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:01.500 align:middle line:84%
It's actually within the
rest of this code of our DNA

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:05.280 align:middle line:84%
that we find information of
interdimensional instructions.

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:06.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>> So these species that are
being hybridized with the human

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:14.850 align:middle line:84%
are essentially utilizing not
only the base code of the DNA

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:19.530 align:middle line:84%
of the human but tuning in
to genetically modifying

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:23.410 align:middle line:84%
the holographic aspect of the
DNA, the rest of the data.

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:26.140 align:middle line:84%
So this is where these
interdimensional beings

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:26.940 align:middle line:90%
would fall.

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:30.730 align:middle line:84%
They are encoded within
the rest of that junk DNA.

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:36.240 align:middle line:84%
So when there is a splicing
done with the egg and the semen

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:39.450 align:middle line:84%
or the life force
of these beings,

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:42.120 align:middle line:84%
it begins to genetically
modify an organism that

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:45.510 align:middle line:84%
can be either seeded
inside of a woman's womb

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:49.080 align:middle line:84%
or it's just genetically
modified on a Petri dish.

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:51.700 align:middle line:10%
So there's different ways
that this is carried out.

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:54.540 align:middle line:10%
But essentially,
depending on how

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:57.480 align:middle line:10%
these combinations and genetic
modifications are done,

00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:02.460 align:middle line:10%
the organism that is born,
the child, the organism that

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:08.520 align:middle line:10%
is created will either
have more human DNA or more

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.900 align:middle line:10%
interdimensional aspects.

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:14.670 align:middle line:84%
So they're not all fully
physical beings, organisms.

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And you have to understand that
also the kind of technology

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:19.560 align:middle line:84%
that is being
utilized for the woman

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:25.930 align:middle line:84%
to be able to gestate this
kind of organism in the body,

00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:29.610 align:middle line:84%
they have to put all kinds
of things inside the body.

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:33.480 align:middle line:84%
Like literally during that
time that I became ill,

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.300 align:middle line:84%
they injected into
my womb some kind

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:41.010 align:middle line:84%
of a container within the womb,
a lining, artificial lining

00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:43.590 align:middle line:84%
that was able to sustain
that kind of organism

00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:46.050 align:middle line:84%
because, remember, that
otherwise the body will reject

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:46.850 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Will reject it.

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:52.680 align:middle line:84%
Can some of these hybrid
children walk down the street,

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:56.950 align:middle line:84%
go to school here,
and not be recognized?

00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:57.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:57.750 --> 00:31:00.600 align:middle line:84%
So this is the complex side
of the interdimensional

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.550 align:middle line:84%
hybridization
program, but now let's

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:05.220 align:middle line:84%
talk about the human
hybridization program

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:07.500 align:middle line:84%
because, actually, if
we begin to understand

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:10.410 align:middle line:84%
our own genetic data, we
begin to understand that

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:13.140 align:middle line:84%
within our own origins,
we have been hybridized

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:14.817 align:middle line:90%
since the beginning of time.

00:31:14.817 --> 00:31:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And so, this is where
things start to get complex.

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And I do think that
this is important

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:21.120 align:middle line:84%
because, by understanding
that information,

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:24.420 align:middle line:84%
you begin to understand how
our interdimensional contact is

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:28.260 align:middle line:84%
a result of what's being
expressed and activated

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:29.280 align:middle line:90%
in your DNA--

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.510 align:middle line:90%
>> That's always been there.

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:31.677 align:middle line:90%
>> That's always been there.

00:31:31.677 --> 00:31:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're suggesting
that Josh is a hybrid?

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:35.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:37.710 align:middle line:84%
>> That I'm a hybrid--
that we're all hybrids?

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:38.510 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:46.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, if we go back, science
would suggest and implore that

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:50.460 align:middle line:84%
Homo sapiens sapiens at the far
side of things is about 200,000

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:51.690 align:middle line:90%
years old.

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:53.940 align:middle line:84%
We've always searched
for the missing link.

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And before that,
we didn't have--

00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:00.240 align:middle line:84%
your beautiful forehead,
the cheekbones.

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:06.120 align:middle line:84%
We had hair, and we didn't look
as handsome as Josh does today.

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.850 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly, we just appeared.

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:11.920 align:middle line:84%
Is that what we're
talking about here

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:15.610 align:middle line:84%
was that an alien
intervention and maybe

00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:19.210 align:middle line:84%
snipping some of our DNA
and removing chromosomes?

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:21.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's very interesting.

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:24.080 align:middle line:84%
DNA is really-- it's
the code of life.

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:29.590 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, we all-- all
organisms have the same codes.

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:31.300 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter
of which codes

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:35.360 align:middle line:84%
are active and inactive in order
to create different organisms.

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:39.190 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about that,
how a human comes into form

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:42.460 align:middle line:84%
really depends on this
instruction manual

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:45.700 align:middle line:84%
that is called the
morphogenetic field from which

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:47.890 align:middle line:90%
emerges the form.

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And so we are the codification
of the human that has emerged

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:54.490 align:middle line:90%
from that morphogenetic field.

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, this
morphogenetic field

00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:00.290 align:middle line:84%
it's also genetically modified
based on our environment.

00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:03.820 align:middle line:84%
So that jump that we're finding
from the apes to the human

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:05.180 align:middle line:90%
is very interesting.

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:08.410 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, if you look
at the evolution of man,

00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:10.810 align:middle line:84%
even in the womb,
we ourselves go

00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:14.380 align:middle line:84%
through this incredible
process of first having tails,

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:15.250 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:19.000 align:middle line:84%
We literally are having
tails, and then we morph.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.960 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the fetus morph
process of all organisms,

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.000 align:middle line:84%
we seem to go through
the same patterns.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's really
beautiful because even

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:29.470 align:middle line:84%
within that is showing
us our evolution,

00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:32.020 align:middle line:84%
how somehow we have
evolved and been

00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:35.000 align:middle line:84%
genetically modified
into what we are today.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.330 align:middle line:84%
Another thing also
happens that when

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:40.510 align:middle line:84%
you start working with the
mechanisms of co-creation

00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:42.550 align:middle line:84%
of the physical
body, you can begin

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:47.620 align:middle line:84%
to activate alterations and
shifts in your genetic data.

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And we're learning more about
that today through epigenetics

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:54.234 align:middle line:90%
and also learning about healing.

00:33:54.234 --> 00:33:57.700 align:middle line:90%
Our DNA can really be edited.

00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:01.210 align:middle line:84%
We can somehow manage
this physical body

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:04.150 align:middle line:84%
into its highest
potential vibrancy

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:07.010 align:middle line:84%
and also in its
lowest point of death.

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:10.850 align:middle line:84%
And so hybrids play
a role in that.

00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And just really briefly,
every single generation

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:16.330 align:middle line:84%
of children that is
being born is genetically

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:19.840 align:middle line:84%
modified in alignment with
this next vibrational frequency

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:22.150 align:middle line:84%
that we're experiencing
as a collective.

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Kids today seem a lot smarter
than when you and I were kids.

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:26.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my kids are.

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:27.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:31.449 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's incredible to
see this dynamic change

00:34:31.449 --> 00:34:32.770 align:middle line:90%
immediately.

00:34:32.770 --> 00:34:35.650 align:middle line:84%
We haven't had to wait
for a million years

00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:38.830 align:middle line:84%
for these changes that seem to
be happening right now in front

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:39.860 align:middle line:90%
of us.

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:44.380 align:middle line:84%
You had mentioned earlier
that the information has

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:47.050 align:middle line:84%
come from many contact
experiences that

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:49.000 align:middle line:90%
came in stages.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.969 align:middle line:84%
When was the last
time this happened?

00:34:51.969 --> 00:34:52.989 align:middle line:90%
>> Contact experience?

00:34:52.989 --> 00:34:54.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>> The last time I had a contact
experience probably about maybe

00:34:58.730 --> 00:34:59.530 align:middle line:90%
a year ago.

00:34:59.530 --> 00:34:59.710 align:middle line:90%
I was--

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:00.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Very recently.

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:01.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>> What happened?

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:07.990 align:middle line:84%
>> I was at a conference in a
hotel room and a bright light

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:09.340 align:middle line:90%
appeared into the room.

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And I was taken into an
interdimensional realm where

00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:16.030 align:middle line:84%
several of the people that
were in this conference

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:17.280 align:middle line:90%
were also present.

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.760 align:middle line:90%
It's very interesting.

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:22.330 align:middle line:84%
My contact is so conscious and
lucid now that I can kind of

00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:24.730 align:middle line:84%
direct whether I want
to participate or not

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:27.440 align:middle line:90%
in these kinds of experiences.

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And so I understood very well
what they were doing there.

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:35.950 align:middle line:84%
It was a craft and
the people were naked,

00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:39.890 align:middle line:84%
and they were being put
through a kind of light beam.

00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:41.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure what it
did-- what it was,

00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:44.650 align:middle line:84%
but they were waiting in line to
go through that in this craft.

00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And I decided that
I didn't really

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:49.000 align:middle line:84%
want to participate in
that, and I immediately

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.400 align:middle line:90%
snapped out of it.

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:52.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Can I jump in for a second?

00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:53.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, sure.

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:59.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you say that people
attending this conference were

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:00.200 align:middle line:90%
there?

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:03.140 align:middle line:84%
Are these the people that were
going through the light beam?

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:04.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:08.450 align:middle line:84%
>> So the next day were you
having lunch and breakfast with

00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:11.010 align:middle line:84%
these same-- did you recognize
them from the night before?

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:13.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Did you guys talk about it?

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:16.325 align:middle line:10%
>> No, because I don't
know them that well.

00:36:16.325 --> 00:36:17.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Was I there?

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:18.930 align:middle line:90%
>> No, you weren't.

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:19.730 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:21.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I didn't go
through a light beam.

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.130 align:middle line:90%
Was Josh there?

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:22.620 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:22.970 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:24.140 align:middle line:90%
>> --make to a light beam.

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:24.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:26.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:30.350 align:middle line:84%
>> No, but I will say that
I have had other experiences

00:36:30.350 --> 00:36:32.850 align:middle line:84%
at conferences where
this has happened.

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:35.913 align:middle line:84%
And we consciously remember
it the next day, but--

00:36:35.913 --> 00:36:37.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Why do you think that is?

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.960 align:middle line:90%
Why UFO conference?

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the thing is that
it's two different things.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.130 align:middle line:84%
Some of these
contact experiences

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:47.180 align:middle line:84%
are interdimensional, and the
majority of them are military.

00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:48.830 align:middle line:90%
They're terrestrial.

00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:50.900 align:middle line:84%
The majority of these
experiences at conferences

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:52.220 align:middle line:90%
are terrestrial.

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:55.760 align:middle line:84%
So military abduction
type of experiences.

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Very interesting.

00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:02.960 align:middle line:84%
I think that, right
now, disclosure

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:05.810 align:middle line:84%
is happening in so
many different forms.

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:08.930 align:middle line:84%
Disclosure means something
different to somebody that

00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:10.650 align:middle line:90%
is dealing with one subject.

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:14.340 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily
alien or ET-related.

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:19.310 align:middle line:84%
But for us in our community,
disclosure has its own meaning.

00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:22.550 align:middle line:84%
But it seems to be
happening very quickly.

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:27.440 align:middle line:84%
Things are moving
rapidly right now.

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:30.110 align:middle line:84%
Could we expect direct
contact like you

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:34.780 align:middle line:84%
have had for the rest
of the world very soon?

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:37.030 align:middle line:84%
>> It's funny because in my
support group for the past

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:39.730 align:middle line:84%
three years, the majority
of my contactees--

00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:43.810 align:middle line:84%
they do have a lot of psychic
abilities but have been having

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:47.530 align:middle line:84%
dreams from all around the world
that there will be a collective

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:49.780 align:middle line:84%
sighting at some point,
which is very interesting.

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:52.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even I, myself
have had this vision.

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:55.780 align:middle line:84%
So I do believe that
somehow something will

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:57.340 align:middle line:90%
be orchestrated at some point.

00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:58.955 align:middle line:90%
I think that it's necessary.

00:37:58.955 --> 00:38:00.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
the government would

00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:03.970 align:middle line:84%
go through the trouble of
speeding up this conversation

00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:07.820 align:middle line:84%
if they didn't think
this was the next step.

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:11.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Are we ready as a species?

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:12.430 align:middle line:90%
>> I want to say yes.

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:14.565 align:middle line:84%
I think the majority
of us, in the back

00:38:14.565 --> 00:38:15.940 align:middle line:84%
of our mind we
have that question

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:17.180 align:middle line:90%
at some point in our life.

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And if you do surveys,
a lot of people

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:22.660 align:middle line:84%
are aware, obviously, that
we can't be the only ones.

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:26.570 align:middle line:84%
However, structurally and
fundamentally in our society,

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:28.750 align:middle line:84%
it's going to really
shake some things up.

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:30.907 align:middle line:84%
But I think we're
ready for that change.

00:38:30.907 --> 00:38:31.990 align:middle line:90%
>> I think we can feel it.

00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:32.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:33.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you feel it?

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:34.100 align:middle line:90%
>> I feel like--

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:36.340 align:middle line:84%
>> It's something-- something
is about to bust, man.

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:37.180 align:middle line:84%
>> It feels like it's
around the corner.

00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, my entire life,
it hasn't felt like this.

00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:40.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Geraldine.

00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:40.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:41.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:44.980 align:middle line:84%
This has been an absolute
incredible conversation.

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:46.540 align:middle line:84%
Your work is important,
and thank you

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:47.870 align:middle line:90%
for sharing your knowledge.

00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you so much
for having me here.

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:50.200 align:middle line:90%
It's been a pleasure.

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:51.857 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh, incredible.

00:38:51.857 --> 00:38:52.690 align:middle line:90%
>> That was awesome.

00:38:52.690 --> 00:38:53.857 align:middle line:90%
I could talk to her all day.

00:38:53.857 --> 00:38:55.120 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm your host Jimmy Church.

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:56.980 align:middle line:90%
This is Into the Vortex.

00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:59.970 align:middle line:84%
Josh and I will
catch you next time.

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:04.000 align:middle line:90%
