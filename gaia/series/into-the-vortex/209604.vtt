>> I'm radio and television
host, Jimmy Church,

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.070 align:middle line:84%
and I'm here to uncover
the truth about some

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.140 align:middle line:90%
of life's biggest mysteries.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.710 align:middle line:84%
If this is revealed,
everything has to be rewritten.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.960 align:middle line:84%
My guest today is
Adam Apollo, founder

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.380 align:middle line:84%
of several successful companies
and a featured speaker

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.470 align:middle line:84%
on future technologies and
unified physics at the White

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.970 align:middle line:90%
House and the United Nations.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the most
advanced machine imaginable.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Technical assistant Josh--

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.870 align:middle line:90%
Josh, can you pull up the map?

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:39.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.140 align:middle line:10%
>> --also joins us to
help set the scenes.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.160 align:middle line:84%
Join us as we deep dive to
get to the bottom of some

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.760 align:middle line:84%
of the most intriguing
questions of our time.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.230 align:middle line:84%
>> As soon as you consider
maybe a ship has a way to create

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.690 align:middle line:84%
a gravitational envelope
around it, suddenly, boom.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.140 align:middle line:90%
They can be here like that.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.580 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:11.890 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to
"Enter the Vortex."

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.030 align:middle line:84%
I am your host, Jimmy
Church, and today, our guest

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.140 align:middle line:90%
is Adam Apollo.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.550 align:middle line:10%
He has been researching
unified physics.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.600 align:middle line:84%
He's been teaching unified
physics and consciousness

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.270 align:middle line:84%
with different academies and
of course, his own companies,

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.140 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And Josh, today
is the show where

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.360 align:middle line:90%
you get your knowledge on.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.160 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready?

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.840 align:middle line:84%
The science of consciousness
is dear to my heart.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And I know, Adam, you're on
the frontier of this research.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm just looking forward
to this conversation.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:37.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.820 align:middle line:84%
>> We have to start
where it all starts--

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.960 align:middle line:90%
physics.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Orthodox academia and
the hard sciences,

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.820 align:middle line:84%
they don't want to
discuss consciousness,

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.290 align:middle line:84%
whether they can't measure it,
they can't put it into the lab,

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.860 align:middle line:90%
there's a denial there.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And there's a bona fide
line in the sand where

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:55.940 align:middle line:90%
they don't want to go here.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.760 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to
go there right now.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.290 align:middle line:90%
What is consciousness?

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Consciousness is an emergent
principle underlying the very

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.539 align:middle line:84%
evolution, diversity,
syntropy of spacetime itself.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.670 align:middle line:90%
It's harmonic.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.470 align:middle line:90%
It's geometric.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And everything that
exists is essentially

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.850 align:middle line:84%
a self-referencing,
self-learning feedback loop,

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.060 align:middle line:84%
connecting with
itself, evolving itself

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.860 align:middle line:84%
through this sort of
spread of frequency

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.100 align:middle line:84%
and harmonics and the way
that each of those harmonics

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.010 align:middle line:84%
play off of each other,
grow from each other,

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.360 align:middle line:84%
are in relationship
with each other.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.580 align:middle line:84%
It's a conversation happening
at the most fundamental levels

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.150 align:middle line:90%
of the universe itself.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.510 align:middle line:84%
>> When a physicist or a
scientist is asked that

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.150 align:middle line:84%
question-- and everybody wants
to get this out of a scientist.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.770 align:middle line:90%
What is consciousness?

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.350 align:middle line:90%
Immediately, they back down.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And the science is starting
to push towards consciousness

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.760 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.540 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that they want
to fight this and not

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.720 align:middle line:90%
answer the question?

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.230 align:middle line:90%
>> It's an old story.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:18.120 align:middle line:84%
It goes back hundreds of years
in the ancient philosophy that

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.940 align:middle line:84%
became what we know
now as physics,

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.670 align:middle line:84%
the ether was a
fundamental principle.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.150 align:middle line:84%
This understanding
that some part of us

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.390 align:middle line:84%
and some part of the field of
spacetime are the same thing.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.690 align:middle line:84%
But as we got into
the Enlightenment era,

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.100 align:middle line:84%
into the 1700s and 1800s,
there became a huge amount

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.640 align:middle line:84%
of pressure between
religious organizations

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.430 align:middle line:84%
and the scientists
and philosophers.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.730 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're talking
about consciousness,

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.300 align:middle line:84%
what makes us aware, you're
getting dangerously close

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.070 align:middle line:90%
to the concepts of God.

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And the concepts of God
were patented, trademarked,

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.920 align:middle line:84%
and owned by the religious
groups at the time,

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.040 align:middle line:84%
particularly the
Roman Catholic Church,

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.240 align:middle line:90%
to point fingers a little bit.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And so scientists had to try
to get outside of the space

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.070 align:middle line:84%
where the church
held domain and that

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:19.320 align:middle line:84%
meant trying to somehow explain
the fundamental faculties

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.910 align:middle line:84%
of the ether and actually break
them down enough so that they

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.450 align:middle line:84%
would no longer be defined in
the same realm as this story

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.770 align:middle line:90%
about God.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:35.370 align:middle line:10%
So a physicist who used to be
a philosopher, which philosophy

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.160 align:middle line:10%
was physics and then separated.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.490 align:middle line:84%
A physicist today
knows he can laugh.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.720 align:middle line:90%
He can ponder.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.890 align:middle line:90%
He can think.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.670 align:middle line:84%
He can ask questions because
he has consciousness.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.320 align:middle line:90%
She has consciousness.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.690 align:middle line:84%
They certainly understand
that they possess this,

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.380 align:middle line:84%
but they don't want to
talk about what it may be.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the case,
it must be a thing

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.960 align:middle line:90%
throughout the universe.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.340 align:middle line:84%
>> There's still a lingering
effect of Descartes' theories.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And Descartes essentially said
that the physics of the bodies

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.460 align:middle line:90%
of beings is automata.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.230 align:middle line:90%
Everything is mechanical.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.170 align:middle line:84%
You could understand a body
just by all of the parts

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.000 align:middle line:90%
and pieces that make it up.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And we still have
a strong thread

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.720 align:middle line:90%
of that in the core of physics--

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.860 align:middle line:84%
the idea that everything is
just a compilation of parts.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And so the physicists
now would say, oh,

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.630 align:middle line:84%
that's just neurological
impulses that are residually

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.090 align:middle line:84%
pinging because of the
patterns of the pings

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.200 align:middle line:84%
that I had prior to this moment
and that all I'm experiencing

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.730 align:middle line:84%
is the collection of
impulses that has aggregated

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.350 align:middle line:90%
to form my thinking right now.

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.690 align:middle line:84%
However, this misses certain
very fundamental pieces

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.010 align:middle line:90%
of phenomenology.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:02.050 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who's actually in the
field of either deep psychology

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.980 align:middle line:84%
or deep philosophy
knows and understands

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.220 align:middle line:84%
that you can't
actually get the result

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:14.920 align:middle line:84%
of an instantaneous inspiration
or impulse, a new idea,

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.100 align:middle line:84%
the magic of Satori,
as they would

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.090 align:middle line:84%
say in Eastern traditions, the
lightning bolts that bring us

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.430 align:middle line:84%
into new levels of innovation
and understanding--

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Inspiration.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>> --simply through some kind of
linear process of impulses that

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.760 align:middle line:84%
are essentially responding to
patterns that we experienced

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.560 align:middle line:90%
in the past.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.977 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'll give
you an example.

00:06:36.977 --> 00:06:38.620 align:middle line:90%
I'll throw this to Josh.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.200 align:middle line:84%
Josh, you can think
you can laugh.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.760 align:middle line:90%
You're thinking right now.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.190 align:middle line:84%
Do you ever wonder
why you can do that

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.235 align:middle line:84%
and where your
consciousness comes from?

00:06:47.235 --> 00:06:48.610 align:middle line:84%
>> More and more,
as I get older.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:49.985 align:middle line:84%
Not when I was
younger, but yeah,

00:06:49.985 --> 00:06:51.280 align:middle line:90%
I question that regularly.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.900 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's the
worldview of this.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.700 align:middle line:84%
I would think that
we know it exists.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.660 align:middle line:84%
Physics today, science
is trying to suggest

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.990 align:middle line:84%
that there is a little
piece of consciousness

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.760 align:middle line:90%
in every particle.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's their
way of quantifying

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.560 align:middle line:84%
the existence of
consciousness, and they're

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.790 align:middle line:84%
trying to figure out
where it comes from.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:17.020 align:middle line:84%
But if there's a little
piece of consciousness

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.440 align:middle line:84%
in every particle,
eventually, if you mass enough

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.900 align:middle line:84%
of it together, you
get consciousness.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And this grey mass between
our ears is because so many

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.930 align:middle line:84%
particles are
assembled together.

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:31.990 align:middle line:84%
But that would say
that consciousness is

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.640 align:middle line:90%
throughout the universe, then.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:38.290 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely, and
again, you can still

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.480 align:middle line:10%
see that residual
thinking from Descartes.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.600 align:middle line:84%
You add together all
the particles equals

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.370 align:middle line:90%
a state of consciousness.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Holography has
shown us something

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:49.750 align:middle line:84%
interesting and
different, where we

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:54.250 align:middle line:84%
know that the whole can exist
in each of the parts and that

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:57.100 align:middle line:84%
no matter which parts
you choose or pick

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.610 align:middle line:84%
or how small a portion of
the parts, the entire whole

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:01.840 align:middle line:90%
is reflected there.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.410 align:middle line:84%
Now in the field of
quantum mechanics, when

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:08.710 align:middle line:84%
we start actually looking at
the structure of spacetime,

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:13.180 align:middle line:84%
what we've come to understand
is that it's likely--

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.760 align:middle line:84%
and Lee Smolin and the
loop quantum gravity guys

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.740 align:middle line:84%
really kind of set
this in motion--

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.890 align:middle line:84%
that each point
in spacetime acts

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:25.060 align:middle line:84%
as like a bit, the same way a
computer bit works, but maybe

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.920 align:middle line:84%
not just isolated
to one and zero.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.220 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a quantum bit with
fluctuation between the one

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:31.300 align:middle line:90%
and zero, right?

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Of both.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:33.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Of both.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And so all of these little
quantum bits form this, right?

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:41.080 align:middle line:84%
But what are we talking
about when we're saying

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.400 align:middle line:90%
it's actually forming this?

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:46.360 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about those
quantum bits forming protons.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, I became deeply
interested in understanding

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.700 align:middle line:84%
the geometry of
the proton, mostly

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.580 align:middle line:84%
through doing a lot of work with
my colleague, Nassim Haramein,

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.110 align:middle line:90%
at the Resonance Academy.

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And as I dove
deeper into looking

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.510 align:middle line:84%
at the geometric
structures of the proton

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:05.530 align:middle line:84%
I became highly interested in
applying Buckminster Fuller's

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:10.720 align:middle line:84%
work and geodesics to the
understanding of how spacetime

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.650 align:middle line:90%
curves.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And what I found is that
in the vortices that

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:20.680 align:middle line:84%
would go into this nested ball
that makes up each proton,

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:24.100 align:middle line:90%
you have these vortex tunnels.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And the vortex
tunnels, when you look

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:29.500 align:middle line:84%
at their geometry from the
top, as if you're looking down

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.710 align:middle line:84%
into the proton, the
geometric structure

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:38.180 align:middle line:84%
is exactly the same as what
DNA looks like from the top.

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And this got me
thinking maybe protons

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:45.910 align:middle line:84%
are actually little hard
drives, storing information

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:47.380 align:middle line:90%
from the universe.

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out,
Jimmy, that if we

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.410 align:middle line:84%
count the amount of little bits,
those quantum fluctuations that

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:57.550 align:middle line:84%
make up a proton, it turns out
there's 10 to the 60th of them

00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:59.470 align:middle line:90%
inside of one proton.

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, I flipped the page
over to Planck's work,

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:06.250 align:middle line:84%
looking at all of the Planck
numbers and Max Planck,

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:08.350 align:middle line:84%
by the way, he is the
guy who pretty much

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:10.420 align:middle line:90%
started quantum mechanics.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And he counts time in a
unit called Planck seconds.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
that there's also

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:25.810 align:middle line:84%
10 to the 60th Planck seconds
in the lifetime of the universe.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, let's stop right there.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.970 align:middle line:90%
That is a huge number.

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And for anybody right now
listening to 10 of the 60th,

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.130 align:middle line:84%
it sounds like it's
being thrown out there.

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:42.950 align:middle line:90%
That is how big of a number?

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a 10 with
60 zeros after it.

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:47.210 align:middle line:90%
>> What's bigger than that?

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:48.560 align:middle line:90%
Not much, right?

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.285 align:middle line:90%
>> Not much.

00:10:50.285 --> 00:10:51.450 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a huge number.

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And so this would
also suggest to me

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:58.140 align:middle line:84%
that the ability to
measure consciousness,

00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.900 align:middle line:90%
which is the battle.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.240 align:middle line:84%
In physics is measuring
anything right?

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And even that is another
conversation in and of itself.

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.450 align:middle line:84%
But is this a way to
maybe quantify and measure

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:10.220 align:middle line:90%
consciousness?

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:16.090 align:middle line:84%
>> It is, because as we're
getting down to the structural

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:19.690 align:middle line:84%
fabric of spacetime itself,
we don't have the instruments

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:23.740 align:middle line:84%
to observe that small yet
because we're talking about

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:28.310 align:middle line:84%
literally the threshold of
the electromagnetic spectrum--

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:31.360 align:middle line:90%
the highest possible frequency.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And so we can't capture
that on camera yet.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.160 align:middle line:84%
But when we do, it's my
theoretical assessment

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.140 align:middle line:84%
that you will actually
be able to see

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:43.710 align:middle line:84%
every layer of the
energetic body talked

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:46.560 align:middle line:84%
about in all of these spiritual
traditions across the Earth.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.090 align:middle line:84%
You'll be able to
actually capture,

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:51.840 align:middle line:84%
on camera the spin of
a chakra, the nature

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:55.320 align:middle line:84%
of a nadi, the aspects
of entanglement that

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.800 align:middle line:84%
are traveling through that
fundamental field in space.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.390 align:middle line:84%
And what we're
actually measuring

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:04.470 align:middle line:84%
is gravity waves,
because gravity is just

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:08.290 align:middle line:84%
the fluctuation and curvature
of spacetime itself.

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:13.470 align:middle line:84%
So any impulse of consciousness
in spacetime, a movement

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.360 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness in spacetime--

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.070 align:middle line:90%
as above, so below--

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:20.700 align:middle line:84%
is represented in this
fundamental quantum field.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And this connects the
dots back because it

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:28.800 align:middle line:84%
says every proton is
remembering every moment that

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.580 align:middle line:84%
exists in the lifetime
of the entire universe.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And every proton is
exchanging information

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:42.030 align:middle line:84%
with other protons in a
shared learning field.

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:43.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, that sounds a
lot like you and me.

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Vast distances.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.175 align:middle line:90%
>> Vast distances.

00:12:47.175 --> 00:12:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's spin this
around, if we may.

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:54.060 align:middle line:84%
If there is an advanced
extraterrestrial civilization

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.800 align:middle line:84%
out there-- we'll
call it, ETC If there

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:59.940 align:middle line:84%
is an ETC out there that
understands this is a way

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:04.890 align:middle line:84%
to not only communicate in
real time over vast distances

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:07.050 align:middle line:84%
but also share
information, right?

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:08.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Absolutely.

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:11.010 align:middle line:10%
Gene Roddenberry
presented a great solution

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:12.250 align:middle line:10%
to this many years ago.

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:14.760 align:middle line:10%
And he talked about
in "Star Trek"--

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:18.150 align:middle line:10%
the writer of "Star
Trek-- the subspace relay.

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:20.550 align:middle line:10%
Now what the heck is
the subspace relay?

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:24.120 align:middle line:10%
Well, in physics, what
we're actually realizing

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:29.010 align:middle line:10%
is subspace would basically
be this Planck level field

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:33.090 align:middle line:10%
and that there'd be some
way to entangle points

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:34.530 align:middle line:10%
in this quantum field.

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:35.520 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.760 align:middle line:90%
We went ahead and did it.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And China teleported
information and structure,

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:47.670 align:middle line:84%
literally, molecular structure
teleported to a satellite

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:48.690 align:middle line:90%
and back.

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And that key, that understanding
that essentially you

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:58.320 align:middle line:84%
can connect two points in
spacetime and that information

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.750 align:middle line:84%
can be transferred
between those points

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:02.730 align:middle line:90%
and maybe not just information.

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:03.910 align:middle line:90%
Because what's matter?

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:08.190 align:middle line:84%
Matter is just a more complex,
curved form of information

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:09.790 align:middle line:90%
in the form of protons.

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:13.800 align:middle line:84%
So matter transmission
across spacetime

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:17.160 align:middle line:84%
without motion
through spacetime.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:23.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, again, the hard
sciences will say entangling one

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:27.090 align:middle line:84%
particle with another particle
and having it affect the other

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:29.490 align:middle line:84%
one in real time, not
at the speed of light,

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:32.100 align:middle line:84%
but in the speed of
now, that's one thing,

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:33.100 align:middle line:90%
and we can prove that.

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:37.680 align:middle line:84%
But it's another thing to use
that same concept with data

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.990 align:middle line:90%
transfer and communication.

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:44.730 align:middle line:84%
I would suggest that
if you understood

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:48.360 align:middle line:84%
how to entangle all the
particles in your mind,

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:52.260 align:middle line:84%
with the mind and the
brain, say, of Josh,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:56.550 align:middle line:84%
sitting next to me here,
that if all of our particles

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:59.920 align:middle line:84%
are entangled, we could share
any information that we wanted

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:00.720 align:middle line:90%
to.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Isn't this what
entanglement represents?

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:05.880 align:middle line:84%
>> It's more than a
postulation Jimmy.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.960 align:middle line:84%
It happens every
day all the time.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:12.760 align:middle line:84%
Think of a mother whose
child is outside playing.

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.980 align:middle line:84%
The child falls and
skins their knee.

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:16.120 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:19.810 align:middle line:84%
The mom suddenly has
alarm systems going off

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:25.030 align:middle line:84%
in her energetic body, and she
goes out to check on her child.

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:27.630 align:middle line:90%
Every mom can relate to this.

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:31.470 align:middle line:10%
Every person can relate
to this, because we've all

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:35.820 align:middle line:10%
had those moments
where we think about--

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:37.710 align:middle line:10%
we call it "your
ears burning" when

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:39.420 align:middle line:10%
someone's talking about you.

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:41.580 align:middle line:84%
We've all had some
experience of knowing

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.260 align:middle line:90%
someone was talking about us.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:48.930 align:middle line:10%
And yet, we spend very little
time actually cultivating

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:52.320 align:middle line:10%
the sensitivity to be
able to develop that

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.090 align:middle line:10%
to its fullest extent.

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Imagine a civilization
that has developed

00:15:56.790 --> 00:16:00.570 align:middle line:84%
that over hundreds of years
or even thousands of years

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:03.720 align:middle line:84%
as a core part of their
culture to the point

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.570 align:middle line:90%
where they're now using devices.

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:09.930 align:middle line:84%
Instead of just
augmenting my voice

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:12.030 align:middle line:84%
and transmitting
that over a phone

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:13.800 align:middle line:84%
to another location
on the planet,

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.990 align:middle line:84%
they're actually augmenting
that entanglement

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:21.300 align:middle line:84%
so that those telepathic
transmissions happen more

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.300 align:middle line:84%
clearly, more accurately,
and more exactly.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:25.110 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:28.950 align:middle line:84%
You've got to have that to
have a galactic civilization.

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:32.220 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so if Josh and I
are out in our starship--

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:33.840 align:middle line:90%
he's actually a starship pilot.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:36.450 align:middle line:84%
He's accredited, and
he's really good.

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:42.060 align:middle line:84%
If we're out in deep space and
we are going to a destination,

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:45.480 align:middle line:84%
to a star, and there
is another ETC that

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.400 align:middle line:90%
was just at that star system.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And we want
information about that

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:53.050 align:middle line:84%
and what we can expect
when we get there.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:58.170 align:middle line:84%
How do we know who we're talking
to and where they are in space?

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And how would they know where
we are and not communicating

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:04.710 align:middle line:90%
somewhere else in the universe?

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:09.329 align:middle line:84%
>> Well there are different
ways of refining the kind

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:13.319 align:middle line:84%
of information reception that
can happen through telepathy.

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:16.650 align:middle line:84%
We can see this in a lot
of the modern science work

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:17.880 align:middle line:90%
around remote viewing.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:21.180 align:middle line:84%
That you can remote
view random things,

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:24.240 align:middle line:84%
but if you very clearly
intentionally put

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.550 align:middle line:84%
your consciousness in
a certain location,

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:29.460 align:middle line:84%
even a certain GPS
coordinate, you

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:33.070 align:middle line:84%
can get exact data
about that location.

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:39.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, refine that a little bit
and consider an intergalactic,

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:42.570 align:middle line:84%
an interstellar network,
essentially where you

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.090 align:middle line:84%
have species on ships
all over the place,

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:47.130 align:middle line:84%
jumping to different
star systems.

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, on Earth,
we have airports,

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:51.870 align:middle line:90%
and we have control towers.

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And those control
towers have operators

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:56.310 align:middle line:84%
with a bunch of radar,
who are basically

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:57.930 align:middle line:84%
coordinating which
planes are going

00:17:57.930 --> 00:17:59.290 align:middle line:90%
to come in, in which order.

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:02.520 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going to travel
to someone's local star system,

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.460 align:middle line:84%
you're going to want to check
in with the local arrival

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:08.460 align:middle line:84%
authority that is
controlling the space

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.200 align:middle line:90%
around that planetary system.

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.830 align:middle line:84%
So likely, they have a hub
somewhere on the planet.

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:16.680 align:middle line:84%
In the Sirian system, they
do this in the polar regions,

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.200 align:middle line:84%
because it's the area that's
the darkest, because they

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.370 align:middle line:90%
have two suns.

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:23.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's a little bit
easier to filter the light

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:25.860 align:middle line:90%
and to also see in the stars.

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, they're
coordinating arrivals

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:31.980 align:middle line:84%
to that location
through telepathy.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:37.210 align:middle line:84%
So you, as a starship pilot, are
going to ping that star system.

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And there are certain
ways that they can also

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:44.190 align:middle line:84%
dial very specific numbers, the
same way we would on a phone,

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:48.580 align:middle line:84%
but they use frequency sets
to dial in communication.

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:51.540 align:middle line:84%
So they're trying to
find a specific frequency

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:54.390 align:middle line:84%
band that's accessible
that can lock

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:56.580 align:middle line:90%
in the telepathic connection.

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And then, essentially,
you're good to go.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:00.960 align:middle line:90%
There's open space.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.330 align:middle line:84%
This region here,
they send the impulse

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:06.060 align:middle line:84%
of exactly what it looks
like from that location.

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.550 align:middle line:84%
Then the person piloting
the ship, essentially,

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:11.520 align:middle line:84%
is visualizing that location,
transmits that to the ship,

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:12.850 align:middle line:90%
augments it, jumps.

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>> So help me understand this.

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:17.280 align:middle line:84%
Josh, piloting, wouldn't
be communicating

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.990 align:middle line:90%
with a piece of hardware.

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:22.770 align:middle line:84%
It would all be done with
entanglement of the mind.

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:25.260 align:middle line:84%
The frequency is
allowing the reception.

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.630 align:middle line:84%
He would know when
it is coming in,

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:31.200 align:middle line:84%
and then his answer back would
be at a certain frequency,

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.930 align:middle line:84%
communicating back,
all in real time.

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:37.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Not that hardware is
removed from the equation,

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:40.410 align:middle line:84%
but that the hardware is
essentially biofeedback

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:44.090 align:middle line:84%
mechanisms amplifying the
natural capacity of the human

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:44.890 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:47.550 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about it,
we're already doing that.

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:50.880 align:middle line:84%
Like, we have the
ability to be telepathic.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:55.530 align:middle line:84%
But in order to confirm that
that person just thought

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:56.880 align:middle line:90%
about you, what do we do?

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.330 align:middle line:90%
We call them on the phone.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:19:59.700 align:middle line:90%
We look at them on video.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:00.760 align:middle line:90%
We talk to them.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And so our device is augmenting
us with the capacities

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.910 align:middle line:90%
we know right now to do that.

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:10.650 align:middle line:84%
But then consider the next
level of that tech, where

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:12.990 align:middle line:84%
it's actually
providing biofeedback

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:16.290 align:middle line:84%
to you of what your
own body is capable of.

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:20.170 align:middle line:84%
This is the most advanced
machine imaginable.

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And so just giving feedback to
our own vehicle of the power

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:27.850 align:middle line:84%
that we have provides
us with a mechanism

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:29.620 align:middle line:90%
for that kind of communication.

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And you would absolutely be
able to holographically display

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:35.770 align:middle line:84%
someone who is remote
viewing into your ship.

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:39.760 align:middle line:84%
You'd absolutely be able to,
essentially, project yourself

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.040 align:middle line:90%
as a hologram for somebody else.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:46.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can imagine the kind
of translocational presencing

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:48.970 align:middle line:90%
that goes way beyond Zoom.

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:51.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Do we do that and
not even know it?

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:52.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, absolutely.

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:55.060 align:middle line:90%
>> If we're out with a group--

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:57.010 align:middle line:84%
I keep using Josh
as a reference,

00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:58.990 align:middle line:90%
but he's a magnet, right?

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:05.050 align:middle line:84%
And so again, we're out, and
we want to see something cool,

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:07.180 align:middle line:90%
maybe something arrive here.

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:09.550 align:middle line:90%
And we're projecting that.

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:15.250 align:middle line:84%
Is that like a beam or
an antenna to an ETC

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:20.380 align:middle line:84%
out there going, hey, Josh
and Jimmy are saying hello.

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:21.340 align:middle line:90%
Do they see us?

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:22.270 align:middle line:90%
Do they feel us?

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And do they-- are we calling
them in that way and not even--

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.730 align:middle line:90%
we're not aware of it?

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:30.220 align:middle line:84%
>> In my Guardian
Alliance Training School,

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:33.640 align:middle line:84%
one of the Jedi practices
that we do during retreats,

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:38.290 align:middle line:84%
especially, is we have a circle
of people surround a person,

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:40.540 align:middle line:90%
and that person is blindfolded.

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And the circle people
switch off, essentially,

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:48.730 align:middle line:84%
focusing on that person and
pointing little fire fingers

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:49.930 align:middle line:90%
at that person.

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And the person blindfolded
has to sense in the field

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:59.680 align:middle line:84%
can they feel that angular
vector coming at them

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:02.110 align:middle line:84%
and turn their attention
in that direction?

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is a sort
of trick to unlocking

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:08.380 align:middle line:84%
the deeper sensory perceptions
involved in higher level

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:10.090 align:middle line:90%
martial arts.

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:16.510 align:middle line:84%
But now, extend that idea to the
directional focus and intention

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:19.000 align:middle line:84%
that we all radiate
all the time,

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.780 align:middle line:84%
and imagine you're on a ship
able to look at the Earth.

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And you're able to
see when there's

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:28.870 align:middle line:84%
an intentional beam
going out trying

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:31.390 align:middle line:84%
to connect to a
certain star system

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:35.410 align:middle line:84%
or trying to connect
out to some life that's

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:37.040 align:middle line:90%
outside the atmosphere.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And there is such an
intense desire and focus

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.740 align:middle line:84%
that it literally is like
a vector ray coming off

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:48.970 align:middle line:84%
the planet that's able to be
perceived by these advanced

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:51.220 align:middle line:84%
instruments inside
of these ships.

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, more than
just those vector rays,

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:57.940 align:middle line:84%
they can actually see
harmonic field sets

00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:01.240 align:middle line:84%
with different color
coding, illustrating

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.870 align:middle line:84%
the level of consciousness,
tension, emotionality, et

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:08.200 align:middle line:84%
cetera in a whole vast
area around a city.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.150 align:middle line:84%
So they can tell
if there's places

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:14.740 align:middle line:84%
in the city way out of coherence
and others way in coherence.

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it something that we would
call, maybe, like a beacon.

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:19.840 align:middle line:90%
Is that the right way to say it?

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:20.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And so and they could
gauge, through colors,

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:27.110 align:middle line:90%
what's cool and what's not.

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to
sound fundamental here,

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.610 align:middle line:84%
but that sounds like
that's what's going on.

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:34.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, right now, we have
a project called the Global

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:36.340 align:middle line:90%
Coherence Initiative.

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And the Global
Coherence Initiative

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.450 align:middle line:84%
has instrumentation
around the planet,

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:45.580 align:middle line:84%
and it can actually pick up
what the electromagnetic field

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:48.850 align:middle line:84%
levels are in different
cities around the planet.

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And what we find is when there
are major events occurring

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:57.970 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, oftentimes,
there is this massive increase

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:02.320 align:middle line:84%
of synchronization that
goes on between the states

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.970 align:middle line:84%
of all these instruments
around the planet.

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And so that's our sort of
big, brute force measurement

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:12.200 align:middle line:84%
to get to this kind
of information.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.770 align:middle line:84%
But they're 1,000
years ahead of us

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:19.720 align:middle line:84%
in terms of highly-defined,
individualized studies

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:20.920 align:middle line:90%
of coherence.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:25.660 align:middle line:84%
Is you and your household in
a state of coherence or not?

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's not to say you're good
or bad if you're in coherence

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:29.680 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:33.850 align:middle line:84%
But someone's who's in a
high state of coherence,

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:38.980 align:middle line:84%
low level of fear, anxiety, et
cetera, high levels of love,

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:43.690 align:middle line:84%
connection, feeling,
openness, now

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:46.090 align:middle line:84%
that looks like
someone who might be

00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:48.220 align:middle line:90%
willing to have a conversation.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh have you ever
called in a ship?

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.380 align:middle line:10%
>> No but this conversation's
giving a lot of credence

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:55.588 align:middle line:10%
to the idea of these groups
of people coming together

00:24:55.588 --> 00:24:58.300 align:middle line:10%
and using meditative
states to reach out.

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.580 align:middle line:84%
I always believed in it,
but after this, there's

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:02.560 align:middle line:84%
a lot more evidence
to back that up.

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:08.590 align:middle line:84%
>> What would you
do because he, Adam,

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:13.600 align:middle line:84%
has not only called in
things and interacted,

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:19.030 align:middle line:84%
but it appears that it's
pretty quick and that it's not

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:23.180 align:middle line:84%
something that is imagined
when this goes down.

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:25.510 align:middle line:84%
But if you-- you
haven't done it yet.

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:30.160 align:middle line:84%
But I'm asking you, if you
went out with Adam and I,

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:35.020 align:middle line:84%
and you called in a ship and
something appeared above you,

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:36.652 align:middle line:90%
how does that change your world?

00:25:36.652 --> 00:25:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>> First, I would
try not to panic,

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:41.272 align:middle line:84%
even though I want that
experience to happen.

00:25:41.272 --> 00:25:43.480 align:middle line:84%
It would change my worldview,
because immediately, it

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.980 align:middle line:84%
would give evidence that there
is more life out there than I

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:47.920 align:middle line:84%
realize and that the
science of consciousness

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.870 align:middle line:84%
and how we all connect makes
us closer than we realize.

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:52.900 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's what
happens with you.

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:58.330 align:middle line:84%
You always have somebody in the
group that is like, eh, right?

00:25:58.330 --> 00:25:59.560 align:middle line:90%
And then it happens.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:05.080 align:middle line:10%
>> There's usually a threshold
to overcome in the resistance

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:06.550 align:middle line:10%
factor first.

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:10.060 align:middle line:10%
One of the things that I learned
from having conversations

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:14.020 align:middle line:10%
with different star beings,
starting back in 2005,

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:19.030 align:middle line:10%
is that when someone is in
a high state of resistance

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:23.950 align:middle line:10%
and they're not willing
to believe what they see,

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:26.380 align:middle line:10%
they can write off anything.

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:29.050 align:middle line:84%
I've had ships come in and
literally turn 90 degree

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:33.580 align:middle line:84%
and do a check mark, and
they're obsessed for a moment

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:35.230 align:middle line:90%
with the phenomenology of it.

00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:36.640 align:middle line:90%
Like, oh, my God.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.274 align:middle line:90%
Like, what was that?

00:26:39.274 --> 00:26:41.450 align:middle line:90%
Was that a ship, you know?

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And then, they're like, is
it going to happen again?

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:47.360 align:middle line:90%
And then they start doubting.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:49.290 align:middle line:90%
Did I really just see that?

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:51.320 align:middle line:84%
Did I really just
have that experience?

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.880 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend in
Sedona, who I've

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.260 align:middle line:90%
worked with for many years.

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:57.500 align:middle line:84%
He got me into the White House
and the UN, back in the day,

00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:58.490 align:middle line:90%
as a speaker.

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:04.160 align:middle line:84%
He wanted me to assess how many
of the youth in those events

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:07.250 align:middle line:84%
were interested in these
topics and new energy systems.

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And that actually got me
to get a bunch of funding

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.180 align:middle line:90%
for Nassim and his research.

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And he was like,
I've never seen them.

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:17.030 align:middle line:90%
I've never seen a ship.

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:19.100 align:middle line:90%
Can we do that right now?

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:20.540 align:middle line:84%
We're out in the
desert in Sedona.

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:21.380 align:middle line:90%
We went on a walk.

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:22.230 align:middle line:84%
We're out in the
middle of nowhere.

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:24.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, let's do it right now.

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:26.060 align:middle line:90%
And so I open up.

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:27.740 align:middle line:90%
I start feeling into the stars.

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:30.920 align:middle line:84%
I show him a little
star-linking practice.

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:33.140 align:middle line:84%
Get him really opened
up, and I'm like,

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:35.060 align:middle line:90%
just be patient and be still.

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:37.580 align:middle line:84%
We're sitting there for
a couple of minutes.

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:41.900 align:middle line:84%
He clicks over, and he
describes this to me afterwards.

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:45.260 align:middle line:84%
He was like anticipating,
anticipating, doubting,

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:47.330 align:middle line:90%
doubting, afraid.

00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:48.590 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to happen.

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:50.510 align:middle line:90%
He's already disappointed.

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:52.310 align:middle line:90%
And then he lets go.

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:53.600 align:middle line:90%
And he's like, you know what?

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:57.920 align:middle line:84%
I felt this feeling
like, you know, whatever.

00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.480 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's not real.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:00.830 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it doesn't matter.

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:04.910 align:middle line:84%
Why am I so focused and
affixed on this happening?

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:09.100 align:middle line:84%
Right then, right
when he let go, boom.

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:10.540 align:middle line:90%
Ship shows up.

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And then another ship and
another ship and another ship.

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:15.700 align:middle line:90%
And they show up.

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:18.370 align:middle line:84%
They pulse across the
sky, pulsing together.

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:19.270 align:middle line:90%
Disappearing.

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:21.760 align:middle line:84%
Coming in, kind of
like a little chain.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And he's blown open so
much, he just starts crying.

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:28.790 align:middle line:90%
And his heart is open.

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:30.860 align:middle line:90%
He's like, my God, Adam.

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:32.150 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:34.580 align:middle line:90%
It's real.

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't even
know how to deal

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:39.560 align:middle line:90%
with it, how to process it.

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And he shared with me this
moment of this releasing.

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:47.060 align:middle line:84%
But even after
that experience, he

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:49.920 align:middle line:84%
still came back to
me in an email, like,

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.560 align:middle line:90%
did that really happen?

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:55.430 align:middle line:84%
Because he hadn't opened
up enough of the neural

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:59.900 align:middle line:84%
pathways to actually accept
this possible new reality.

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:01.880 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it takes--

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:06.140 align:middle line:84%
a shift to a new state of belief
and a new state of openness

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:07.640 align:middle line:90%
and a new state of being.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And that shift is an
initiation process.

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:13.880 align:middle line:84%
This is why it doesn't
just happen to everybody.

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:16.940 align:middle line:84%
We have to be willing
to go deeper, explore

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:19.310 align:middle line:84%
more of ourselves,
find out who we are

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:22.100 align:middle line:90%
and why do we need to know?

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:25.440 align:middle line:84%
>> There are so many different
civilizations out there?

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
number is nearly infinite.

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:29.150 align:middle line:90%
It has to be.

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:31.400 align:middle line:84%
The universe itself
is infinite, and we

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.370 align:middle line:84%
know that in our own
Milky Way, right now,

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:37.910 align:middle line:84%
science is telling us we have
80 billion Earth-like planets

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:39.740 align:middle line:84%
in the Goldilocks
zone, right here

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:41.490 align:middle line:90%
in our galactic neighborhood.

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:44.540 align:middle line:84%
That would suggest that we
have a lot of different things

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.250 align:middle line:90%
checking out planet Earth.

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:49.280 align:middle line:90%
But how do they get here?

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:50.900 align:middle line:90%
Are we looking for--

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:53.660 align:middle line:84%
when you say a ship
appears above you,

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:57.290 align:middle line:84%
is this a nuts-and-bolts
situation?

00:29:57.290 --> 00:29:59.180 align:middle line:90%
Is it interdimensional?

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:01.010 align:middle line:90%
Are they folding space?

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:04.100 align:middle line:90%
Are we not seeing them get here?

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:07.280 align:middle line:84%
Do we not make that
observation of their arrival,

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:09.470 align:middle line:84%
and then boom, they're
just appearing above us?

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:10.710 align:middle line:90%
How does this happen?

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:15.020 align:middle line:84%
>> The factor in science
that it's one of the big

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:21.050 align:middle line:84%
limitations, and this was a
fault that even Stephen Hawking

00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:22.040 align:middle line:90%
fell into.

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:25.970 align:middle line:84%
He said, extraterrestrials
can't come to Earth,

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:30.380 align:middle line:84%
because they would have
to expend all of this fuel

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:32.330 align:middle line:84%
and travel through
all of this space.

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually,
they'd finally get here,

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:36.740 align:middle line:90%
and they'd be out of resources.

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And then they'd
have to come down

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.120 align:middle line:84%
and mine our planet to
get their resources back

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.670 align:middle line:84%
to be able to get back
home, and generations

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:45.350 align:middle line:90%
would die along the way.

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, look, that's
a major fallacy, because that

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:54.860 align:middle line:84%
assumes the same level of
technology that we have, right?

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:58.398 align:middle line:84%
That's assuming that you
only have horses and buggies.

00:30:58.398 --> 00:30:59.690 align:middle line:90%
There's no such thing as a car.

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:02.220 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the only way that
we can look at it, right?

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:04.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I mean, we
get stuck in that lens.

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:08.210 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as
you consider maybe

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:11.690 align:middle line:84%
a ship has a way to create
a gravitational envelope

00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:15.350 align:middle line:84%
around it and essentially,
transposition itself

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:17.900 align:middle line:84%
to a new spot--
quantum teleportation

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.360 align:middle line:90%
but at scale for a ship.

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.910 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, boom, they
can be here like that.

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:26.100 align:middle line:84%
Second, they're not using
light to communicate.

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:29.360 align:middle line:84%
So if we're sending out
beams of radio waves trying

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:32.540 align:middle line:84%
to talk to the Pleiades,
they're 400 light years away.

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:34.880 align:middle line:84%
It's not getting
there for 400 years.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.610 align:middle line:84%
They're using quantum
communication.

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:40.520 align:middle line:84%
They're using telepathic
communication.

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:42.120 align:middle line:90%
It's instantaneous.

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.390 align:middle line:84%
It's in a totally
different zone,

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:47.760 align:middle line:84%
and it's not using
light as the mechanism.

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:51.740 align:middle line:84%
So the things we're trying
to sense as communication

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:55.790 align:middle line:84%
methods, even SETI's obsession
with let's find a laser beam

00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:57.410 align:middle line:90%
coming from another planet.

00:31:57.410 --> 00:31:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, yeah but
what's your point?

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:03.410 align:middle line:84%
Because they're not using
those laser beams to talk.

00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:05.190 align:middle line:90%
That's way too slow.

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:07.220 align:middle line:90%
And so the ships are here.

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:08.780 align:middle line:90%
The ships have been here.

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:10.850 align:middle line:84%
They've been visiting
this planet for thousands

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:12.330 align:middle line:90%
and thousands of years.

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:15.200 align:middle line:84%
All the stories of the gods
and goddesses, back in the day,

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:18.470 align:middle line:84%
coming down, making demigod
babies occasionally,

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:22.175 align:middle line:84%
superhero abilities,
fantastic tools

00:32:22.175 --> 00:32:23.300 align:middle line:90%
that could regenerate food.
