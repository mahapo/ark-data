00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.480 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm radio and television
host Jimmy Church.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And I am here to uncover
the truth about some

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.690 align:middle line:90%
of life's biggest mysteries.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.190 align:middle line:84%
If this is revealed,
everything has to be rewritten.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.990 align:middle line:10%
My guest today is Richard
Doty, a former officer

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.350 align:middle line:10%
of the Air Force Office
of Special Investigations,

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.310 align:middle line:10%
renowned for his involvement in
classified government programs

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.700 align:middle line:10%
and investigations related
to national security

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.970 align:middle line:10%
and extraterrestrial-related
activities.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.470 align:middle line:84%
>> That's creature containment
facility northwest of S2

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.310 align:middle line:90%
complex.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Creature
containment facility.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, we had live ETs there.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>> As always, MUFON
field investigator Josh--

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh, can you
pull up the map?

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.300 align:middle line:84%
>> --joins us to
help set the scene.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Join us as we dive deep to
get to the bottom of some

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.990 align:middle line:84%
of the most intriguing
questions of our time.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.520 align:middle line:84%
>> We have a person that
will testify in Congress.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.690 align:middle line:90%
He works in DIA.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And he will testify that he has
filing cabinets behind his desk

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:24.945 align:middle line:84%
that contain UFO data that's
still highly classified.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome to "Into the Vortex."

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm Jimmy Church, and today's
another special episode.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.167 align:middle line:90%
Richard Doty, welcome.

00:01:42.167 --> 00:01:43.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Jimmy.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.020 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.200 align:middle line:90%
>> It's good to see you.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And we've got a
lot to talk about.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.500 align:middle line:90%
Things are jumping today.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And, certainly,
the last five years

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.990 align:middle line:84%
for ET and the UFO question
have spun out of control.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.590 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever anticipate
things getting

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.240 align:middle line:84%
to where they are
today, where we

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.150 align:middle line:84%
have an open discussion,
Washington, DC, various working

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.150 align:middle line:84%
groups that we're going
to be talking about now,

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.030 align:middle line:84%
things that are in the open,
whistleblowers, Congress,

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.430 align:middle line:84%
the Senate, your interaction
with all of that,

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.390 align:middle line:90%
and the media?

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.700 align:middle line:84%
Did you think that we would
arrive at this moment?

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.680 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no, not at all.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.140 align:middle line:84%
When I first started talking
after my NDA expired in 2002,

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:32.320 align:middle line:84%
my efforts were to present
some type of a disclosure plan.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.210 align:middle line:84%
I got involved with the advanced
working group, people I used

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.490 align:middle line:90%
to work with in intelligence.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.520 align:middle line:90%
And we had a plan.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.020 align:middle line:90%
But that was in 2002.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:49.500 align:middle line:84%
We struggled to get the
attention of the mainstream

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.620 align:middle line:90%
media from that point until now.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.990 align:middle line:84%
But like you said,
five years ago,

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.910 align:middle line:84%
things opened up drastically
within the disclosure realm.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And now I believe, eventually,
it's going to happen.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, for the interest
of transparency and also

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:14.070 align:middle line:84%
disclosure, I feel he's
still with the company.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.300 align:middle line:90%
I think you're still employed.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And so are you still
in direct contact

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.730 align:middle line:84%
with various entities,
three-letter agencies,

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.380 align:middle line:90%
the Pentagon, the military?

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.580 align:middle line:90%
>> I interface with them.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.320 align:middle line:84%
I interface with
people that are still

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.170 align:middle line:84%
active within the
three-letter agencies.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm not directly
involved with any

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.870 align:middle line:90%
of the three-letter agencies.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.410 align:middle line:90%
I do interface with them.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what is
this interaction that

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.120 align:middle line:90%
you're referring to?

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in 2022, I was asked
to come to Washington, DC,

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.390 align:middle line:84%
and speak with the Department
of Defense Inspector

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.440 align:middle line:90%
General's office.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Last year.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>> I went up there
for five days.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.440 align:middle line:90%
I sat in a secure environment.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And they asked me questions
about what I used to do.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, these people
that are asking me

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.640 align:middle line:84%
were not around back when I
was working in intelligence

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.500 align:middle line:90%
in the '70s and '80s.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.580 align:middle line:90%
But they had my reports.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.000 align:middle line:84%
They would show me a report
that's heavily redacted

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.490 align:middle line:84%
and asked me to talk
about this report.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:19.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Your own report.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.740 align:middle line:84%
>> My own report with my
name on it with a file number

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.170 align:middle line:90%
pertaining to a--

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.930 align:middle line:84%
well, back then
UFO investigation

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.700 align:middle line:84%
or some other investigation
involving ETs.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.860 align:middle line:84%
I would look at this
report, and I'd say, well--

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.445 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember.

00:04:37.445 --> 00:04:38.320 align:middle line:90%
This is 40 years ago.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.910 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember exactly what.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:40.870 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's redacted.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.120 align:middle line:84%
So the IG doesn't have
access to unredacted reports?

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.170 align:middle line:84%
When I asked them for a cleared
report so I could read it,

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.760 align:middle line:84%
they said, we can't
get one from OSI.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.600 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, why can't you?

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.480 align:middle line:84%
You're the Department of Defense
Inspector General's office.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.430 align:middle line:90%
He says, you tell me why.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.040 align:middle line:84%
They won't give
us a cleared copy.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.870 align:middle line:84%
So I would have
to look through it

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.320 align:middle line:84%
and try to remember what
I did or what I said.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.570 align:middle line:84%
And they showed me
three different reports.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And all pertain to
something that happened

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.520 align:middle line:90%
in New Mexico or Nevada.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, they brought in another
agent who had worked with me.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.770 align:middle line:84%
He helped out because
he was involved

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.680 align:middle line:90%
in some of these operations.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.460 align:middle line:90%
>> What were these--

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.190 align:middle line:84%
I want to get to the working
group and the competition

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.530 align:middle line:84%
that's going on right
now with disclosure.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And all of this has
something to do with that

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.780 align:middle line:84%
because, apparently,
the IG is looking

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.730 align:middle line:84%
at ET and UFO-related
reports written by you,

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:44.410 align:middle line:84%
not reports about missile
testing or aircraft testing

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.120 align:middle line:90%
or radar signatures.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.318 align:middle line:84%
These are reports specifically
about ET and craft and--

00:05:51.318 --> 00:05:52.360 align:middle line:90%
well, let's just say it--

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.110 align:middle line:90%
UFOs and flying saucers.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, exactly.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.040 align:middle line:84%
One of the cases
that I investigated

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.140 align:middle line:90%
was a crashed craft.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.660 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't identify it
exactly-- what type of craft

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.460 align:middle line:90%
it was.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.400 align:middle line:84%
We first thought it might have
been an experimental craft that

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.530 align:middle line:84%
crashed maybe in Nevada
in the late '60s or '70s.

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:18.080 align:middle line:84%
But it took them so long to
get the craft open and find

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.990 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials on
board, then realized

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.150 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't a terrestrial craft.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.010 align:middle line:90%
It came from another planet.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.870 align:middle line:84%
It was an
extraterrestrial craft.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.590 align:middle line:84%
I was on the periphery of
that as a counterintelligence

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.080 align:middle line:84%
officer, protecting
that operation,

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.460 align:middle line:90%
protecting the recovery.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.300 align:middle line:84%
We did get bodies
out, four bodies.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.790 align:middle line:90%
Grusch refers to this.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.940 align:middle line:90%
It is the hands-on case.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Myself, and they brought
up 16 other people

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.940 align:middle line:84%
that were involved in this
operation, not all OSI agents.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.670 align:middle line:84%
There were other
people, Air Force people

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.860 align:middle line:84%
involved with the Air Force
Scientific Research center

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.780 align:middle line:84%
at Los Alamos and DIA
personnel, the Air Force Weapons

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Laboratory at Kirtland
Air Force Base.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.090 align:middle line:84%
These people were all
brought up to Washington back

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.270 align:middle line:84%
in those days in 2022
when I was up there.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And they were interviewing
them, too, not together.

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:13.780 align:middle line:90%
We were all separate.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And they were trying to
get to the bottom of this

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:18.982 align:middle line:84%
and trying to find out,
what did they find?

00:07:18.982 --> 00:07:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And where did they
take the bodies?

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Do we know?

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:22.750 align:middle line:90%
Was it a crash?

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:26.440 align:middle line:90%
Was it shot down, and when?

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.000 align:middle line:84%
>> It'd been out
there for a while.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And this was in southwestern
Nevada, west of Pahrump,

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.310 align:middle line:84%
probably over 100
miles from Las Vegas.

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I've got a shot of you
on your first day on the job

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.450 align:middle line:84%
as an agent for the Air
Force Office of Special

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:44.470 align:middle line:90%
Investigations.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And as we pop this up, now
you're slim and trim and young.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:54.250 align:middle line:84%
Was this an orientation
of things that subjects

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.520 align:middle line:90%
were talked about?

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Were UFOs and ET
and the alien agenda

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.340 align:middle line:90%
discussed on your first day?

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:05.180 align:middle line:90%
>> No, this is in 1977.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.520 align:middle line:84%
This is actually my
first day on the job.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.970 align:middle line:84%
These two other people in the
picture, I worked with them.

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.160 align:middle line:84%
This is the
counterintelligence office.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.300 align:middle line:84%
So three of us were assigned to
counterintelligence operations.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.430 align:middle line:84%
At that point, at that time, I
didn't know anything about UFOs

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:24.080 align:middle line:84%
or how or why the Air Force
was investigating UFOs.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:28.400 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't briefed into the
program until two years later.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Very interesting.

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's all a part of
the journey, isn't it,

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.650 align:middle line:84%
and why we are sitting here
today, and it started there.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:39.380 align:middle line:84%
You have presented
us with some images

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.929 align:middle line:84%
of some reverse
engineering facilities.

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:44.870 align:middle line:10%
And before we bring
these up, David Grusch

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:50.330 align:middle line:10%
mentions all of this
under oath with Congress.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.030 align:middle line:10%
And he says, I've
got the locations.

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:56.720 align:middle line:10%
I've got the addresses, and I
can present all of this to you.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.910 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you where
the pilots are.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And we learned a
new word, biologics,

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:08.280 align:middle line:84%
and a very, very intense
testimony that went down.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:12.440 align:middle line:84%
But the question that Congress
or the Senate or anybody

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.620 align:middle line:84%
would have listening to those,
including myself, listening

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:18.380 align:middle line:84%
to something like this is,
where are these facilities?

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.870 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at this
first image here.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:26.840 align:middle line:84%
This is the reverse
engineering facility for craft,

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:30.470 align:middle line:84%
not of this Earth and
planet, at Area 51.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.210 align:middle line:90%
Pull this up for us, Josh.

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:34.230 align:middle line:90%
What are we looking at here?

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.460 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the above ground
facility where research

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:41.870 align:middle line:84%
and development takes place
on extraterrestrial biologics

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:45.500 align:middle line:84%
and extraterrestrial
devices and crafts.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And now as been
mentioned before,

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:52.010 align:middle line:90%
we didn't just recover a craft.

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:56.370 align:middle line:84%
We recovered devices
within the craft,

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:58.140 align:middle line:90%
and that we've taken out.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.390 align:middle line:84%
And we try to
figure out what they

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:04.680 align:middle line:84%
are used for, for instance,
an energy device or maybe

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.190 align:middle line:84%
a weapon system or maybe a
battery, some type of battery,

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.450 align:middle line:84%
or some type of
propulsion system.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And so they're taken out
into a remote location,

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:17.130 align:middle line:84%
such as this place, and
they're experimented with.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.740 align:middle line:84%
They're looked into because
we don't know what they are.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And we have to be careful
that we don't harm ourselves

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:28.000 align:middle line:84%
in trying to delve
into these things.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.500 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they put
them in these facilities

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.330 align:middle line:90%
in very, very remote areas.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is within the
Nellis Test and Training

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:40.650 align:middle line:84%
Range, southern Nellis
Test and Training site,

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:44.190 align:middle line:90%
which is south of Groom Lake.

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:45.915 align:middle line:90%
It's in that area.

00:10:45.915 --> 00:10:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And all these facilities
are remotely built.

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:52.560 align:middle line:84%
So they're away from
private property

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.550 align:middle line:84%
and the public just
in case something

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:58.330 align:middle line:84%
happens because, again, we're
taking these devices out,

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.790 align:middle line:84%
and we're trying to
understand what they are.

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:02.123 align:middle line:90%
And it could be a weapon system.

00:11:02.123 --> 00:11:03.165 align:middle line:90%
>> It could be dangerous.

00:11:03.165 --> 00:11:04.340 align:middle line:90%
>> It could be dangerous.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:11.350 align:middle line:84%
>> So Area 51, originally funded
and built for and by the CIA,

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:16.000 align:middle line:84%
but is it now primarily an
Air Force research facility?

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.870 align:middle line:84%
Or is it still an agency
research facility?

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:25.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in 1973, the Central
Intelligence Agency turned Area

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:28.660 align:middle line:84%
51 over to the United
States Air Force.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.060 align:middle line:90%
But that's just ownership.

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:34.030 align:middle line:90%
That's just janitorial reasons.

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:37.720 align:middle line:84%
CIA stayed out there, and they
had a research and development

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.070 align:middle line:90%
unit out there.

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:42.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure, although I don't
know for sure but I'm sure,

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:46.160 align:middle line:84%
that they're still there today
amongst other three-letter

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:46.960 align:middle line:90%
agencies--

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:51.580 align:middle line:84%
Defense Intelligence Agency,
the National Security Agency,

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.710 align:middle line:84%
probably even NRO, National
Reconnaissance Office.

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:58.530 align:middle line:84%
They're all out there
along with contractors.

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:03.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, the competition
between these agencies,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.590 align:middle line:90%
are they cooperating?

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:08.610 align:middle line:84%
Or are they used to running
things their own way

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:09.600 align:middle line:90%
and not giving up?

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.730 align:middle line:84%
How do we know
that they are being

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.790 align:middle line:84%
open with this information,
and that they're still

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:17.400 align:middle line:90%
withholding the good stuff?

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.630 align:middle line:90%
>> We don't.

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:20.100 align:middle line:90%
They don't cooperate.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:26.790 align:middle line:84%
The DIA, the CIA, the
United States Space Force,

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:30.420 align:middle line:84%
a new agency, a new
military branch,

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:32.070 align:middle line:90%
they're not cooperating.

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:36.270 align:middle line:84%
The United States Space
Force, one of the spokesmen

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:39.340 align:middle line:84%
that came out in Colorado
Springs and says,

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:41.190 align:middle line:84%
you know what, we're
not cooperating

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:44.310 align:middle line:84%
with the congressional
investigations on this

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:48.390 align:middle line:84%
because we can't disclose
classified information,

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:52.800 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of what they
have and other agencies

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.000 align:middle line:90%
are still classified.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, are they always
going to instantly fall under

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:01.660 align:middle line:90%
national security, right?

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And once you put that
tag on it, everybody

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:07.810 align:middle line:84%
gets nervous and backs off
because they don't want to mess

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:09.680 align:middle line:90%
with national security.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to be a catch-all
with all of these agencies

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.615 align:middle line:84%
and comments from
different witnesses

00:13:16.615 --> 00:13:18.730 align:middle line:84%
that they can't talk
about it in the interests

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:20.380 align:middle line:90%
of national security.

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.810 align:middle line:84%
How are we going to get
anywhere if we always

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:24.020 align:middle line:90%
have this in front of us?

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:27.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's a good question
because that's exactly what

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.870 align:middle line:90%
they hide behind.

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:33.250 align:middle line:84%
When asked a question about the
subject, they're going to say,

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:35.320 align:middle line:84%
we can't release
sources or methods.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, having worked
in the intelligence

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:41.290 align:middle line:84%
for a number of years, I know
what sources and methods are.

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:45.250 align:middle line:84%
And you can put
almost any information

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:48.850 align:middle line:84%
gathered into that category,
which would keep it away

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:50.170 align:middle line:90%
from the public.

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:53.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, recently, under the
National Defense Authorization

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:58.240 align:middle line:84%
Act, which is pending,
Senator Schumer

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:03.010 align:middle line:84%
wrote a bill that would try
to clarify some of that.

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:07.690 align:middle line:84%
But there's still-- if it's
under a Special Access Program,

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:10.750 align:middle line:90%
or SAP, it's not releasable.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:16.300 align:middle line:84%
The bill that was presented
for the NDAA by Chuck Schumer,

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure that the
president will sign that.

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:23.950 align:middle line:84%
But remember, these reports have
a category saying unclassified.

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And whenever you see something
unclassified in a document

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.290 align:middle line:84%
that the government
releases, that

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:31.960 align:middle line:84%
means there's a classified
report someplace,

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:37.810 align:middle line:84%
just like AARO just released
a report recently about 800

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.460 align:middle line:90%
reports filtered through them.

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, those 800 reports
are the unclassified.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:47.230 align:middle line:84%
The classified ones,
which we understand,

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:49.870 align:middle line:84%
although I don't
know for a fact,

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:53.330 align:middle line:84%
can be considered top
secret because were reported

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:57.680 align:middle line:84%
by a source or a method,
such as a satellite that's

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.090 align:middle line:90%
a classified satellite.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:04.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, NASA, as people
think, is a private--

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:04.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Civilian.

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Civilian agency.

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:08.210 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly the
word, civilian agency.

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:14.420 align:middle line:84%
But do you realize that NASA
has over 600 military people

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:16.730 align:middle line:90%
working there?

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:20.540 align:middle line:84%
They have five different
controlled environment

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:23.090 align:middle line:84%
facilities, meaning
they're Special Access

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:25.520 align:middle line:84%
Facilities, or SCIFs,
that they house

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.590 align:middle line:90%
classified information in.

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:28.910 align:middle line:90%
They're a civilian agency.

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:30.920 align:middle line:84%
What are they doing with
classified information?

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, they have
satellites out there.

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:35.885 align:middle line:84%
And they're collecting
things and pictures

00:15:35.885 --> 00:15:38.780 align:middle line:84%
that they can't
release to the public.

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:41.930 align:middle line:84%
But what they're doing
now, as they admit,

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:44.930 align:middle line:84%
is if they get something
that they don't understand,

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:47.960 align:middle line:84%
they're immediately
filtering that to the NRO.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.060 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to get
anything from the NRO

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.370 align:middle line:84%
because that's a military
agency, the National

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:53.610 align:middle line:90%
Reconnaissance Office.

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:58.080 align:middle line:84%
>> The problem that we have with
the NRO is that it's the one

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.280 align:middle line:90%
agency we know the least about.

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.660 align:middle line:84%
It's the most secretive,
and it's also the largest.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.490 align:middle line:90%
It has the most employees.

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:09.030 align:middle line:84%
It's the most intense
intelligence gathering

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:13.350 align:middle line:84%
apparatus that we have,
runs in virtual secrecy.

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And they are in control of
everything that they do.

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:18.240 align:middle line:90%
>> That's absolutely right.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.240 align:middle line:84%
And they have 32 classified
operating locations

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.370 align:middle line:84%
around the world
that we don't know

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:26.520 align:middle line:84%
where they are, although we
can guess that some of them

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:30.540 align:middle line:84%
are probably in Australia and
one in New Zealand and one

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:34.560 align:middle line:84%
on a remote island
in the South Atlantic

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:37.860 align:middle line:84%
and one on a remote island
in the South Indian Ocean.

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:40.485 align:middle line:84%
But they're not
going to tell us.

00:16:40.485 --> 00:16:42.840 align:middle line:84%
If you google this and
try to research it,

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:47.070 align:middle line:84%
and many people have
tried, you come up blank.

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:49.770 align:middle line:84%
You just submit a
FOIA request to NRO.

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:51.930 align:middle line:84%
They don't give
you anything back.

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:54.750 align:middle line:90%
And you have to respond--

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:57.570 align:middle line:84%
in accordance with Title 5
United States Code Freedom

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:01.830 align:middle line:84%
of Information Act, they give
each agency a time period.

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:06.089 align:middle line:84%
NRO violates that time period
on every single FOIA request.

00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So when it comes
to whistleblowers,

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:13.740 align:middle line:84%
which is certainly part of
the actions in the NDAA,

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:17.040 align:middle line:84%
which has become law, is
that they are protected.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.109 align:middle line:84%
And more whistleblowers
are coming forward.

00:17:19.109 --> 00:17:22.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm meeting them and speaking
with them, and so are you.

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:28.950 align:middle line:84%
But you have provided an image
of a craft that was apparently

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:35.070 align:middle line:84%
shot down by an F-22 pilot,
who has now stepped forward,

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:37.470 align:middle line:84%
the pilot that shot
this craft down.

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:40.380 align:middle line:84%
Do you expect him to testify
either with the Senate

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:41.950 align:middle line:90%
or with the House?

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:45.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we work more
closely with the Senate.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.370 align:middle line:84%
He's a whistleblower within
the Department of Defense.

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:48.970 align:middle line:84%
He's been cleared
as a whistleblower.

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:49.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Vetted.

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:51.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Vetted.

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:54.055 align:middle line:90%
He is a legitimate person.

00:17:54.055 --> 00:17:55.680 align:middle line:84%
Our group has
interviewed him, but he's

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.020 align:middle line:84%
very careful about
what he can say.

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, he's not going to
disclose classified information

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:05.010 align:middle line:84%
to anyone, because there's
certain things that he did

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:08.580 align:middle line:84%
or saw, certain
techniques that he used,

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.250 align:middle line:84%
his aircraft and
his wingman aircraft

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:13.110 align:middle line:90%
used that he can't talk about.

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:14.370 align:middle line:90%
And we understand that.

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:17.340 align:middle line:84%
We don't want any
methods or sources.

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.710 align:middle line:84%
All we want is
for him to testify

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:22.410 align:middle line:84%
that he was in that
cockpit, and he

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:25.320 align:middle line:84%
pulled the trigger on
that Sidewinder missile

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:29.040 align:middle line:84%
that shot down an object that
he didn't know what it was.

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:33.420 align:middle line:84%
But he was given permission by
the command authority when--

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:36.543 align:middle line:84%
and the command authority
is the White House.

00:18:36.543 --> 00:18:38.710 align:middle line:84%
It goes through the Pentagon
and to the White House.

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:40.500 align:middle line:84%
So the President of
the United States

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.600 align:middle line:84%
said, yeah, go ahead
and shoot it down,

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.510 align:middle line:90%
and he did, and it crashed.

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And he can testify
to that part of it.

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:51.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, this is the image here.

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.510 align:middle line:84%
Take us through what
we are looking at.

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:56.820 align:middle line:84%
>> This is an image
on the ground,

00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:00.330 align:middle line:84%
one from the air and one on the
ground, of what was shot down.

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:03.210 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what that is.

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:06.840 align:middle line:84%
The second whistleblower that we
want to bring out to the public

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.160 align:middle line:90%
is a civilian.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.640 align:middle line:84%
He works for the oil company
up there, the drilling teams.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:16.020 align:middle line:84%
He was a member of the search
and rescue on a helicopter.

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.270 align:middle line:84%
He's never been in
the military, nothing

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:19.530 align:middle line:90%
to do with the military.

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:23.670 align:middle line:84%
But his aircraft he
was in landed out there

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:27.300 align:middle line:84%
because they thought it
was a civilian airliner

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:30.840 align:middle line:84%
or some other civilian craft,
a terrestrial craft that

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.550 align:middle line:90%
had crashed.

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:34.530 align:middle line:90%
He was the first one out there.

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:38.550 align:middle line:84%
He was on the ground, and
he took some pictures.

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to say
he took this picture.

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:42.030 align:middle line:90%
But he took some pictures.

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:48.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Is he freer to discuss
because of not being a military

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.460 align:middle line:84%
officer, freer to
talk about this?

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:54.010 align:middle line:84%
He's not under the constraints
of an NDA, or a National

00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:56.260 align:middle line:84%
Security Clearance, or
anything like that, right?

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:57.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:58.760 align:middle line:90%
He's free to testify.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:02.710 align:middle line:84%
He's free to come on this show
and talk about what he did.

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:05.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, he can't tell
you what that is.

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And he can't tell you
what he was told it was.

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:14.660 align:middle line:84%
But he was told what it was,
but he can't talk about that.

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.460 align:middle line:84%
That's the only thing
he can't talk about.

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:18.220 align:middle line:84%
But he can talk about
everything he did.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:19.180 align:middle line:90%
He got in a helicopter.

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:20.770 align:middle line:90%
He flew out there.

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:24.040 align:middle line:84%
It was a private helicopter,
owned by oil company up there.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And he landed, and he got
out with another person.

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:30.850 align:middle line:84%
But he was the only one that
actually approached the craft.

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:36.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, OK, so the top image,
was that taken from the F-22?

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I can't say where
each one was taken.

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:43.180 align:middle line:84%
But both of them are
images of the craft

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:44.890 align:middle line:90%
that the F-22 shot down.

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so you're confident
those are the same craft?

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:47.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:49.062 align:middle line:90%
>> They do have the same shape.

00:20:49.062 --> 00:20:50.903 align:middle line:84%
Josh, what do you make
of that bottom image?

00:20:50.903 --> 00:20:52.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, a couple of things.

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:54.800 align:middle line:84%
One, this reminds me of
the Tic Tac UFO from the--

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:55.735 align:middle line:90%
>> The top image?

00:20:55.735 --> 00:20:57.860 align:middle line:84%
>> The bottom one looks a
little "Star Wars" to me.

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:00.832 align:middle line:84%
But I'm noticing a lot
of rivets and holes

00:21:00.832 --> 00:21:01.790 align:middle line:90%
in it, which suggests--

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:03.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Feels terrestrial.

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:03.895 align:middle line:90%
>> It feels man-made.

00:21:03.895 --> 00:21:04.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it does.

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:05.660 align:middle line:90%
It does to me too.

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>> The top one has less
detail, but you can't tell.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, the front--

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:13.580 align:middle line:84%
well, I don't know the
front from the back.

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:17.960 align:middle line:84%
But the round portions of
both images feel the same.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, yeah, is guy
threatened in any way,

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:21.950 align:middle line:90%
could not say anything?

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:23.090 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a great question.

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>> No, but here's the question
I would ask is if this was

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:31.400 align:middle line:84%
a terrestrial craft, why can't
the government say here it is

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.900 align:middle line:90%
and explain what it is?

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we had that problem
with the surveillance balloons

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:39.260 align:middle line:84%
when we were trigger-happy
shooting missiles over North

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:40.970 align:middle line:90%
America, too, as well.

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:43.920 align:middle line:84%
We still don't know what
we were shooting down.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.100 align:middle line:84%
But that's a very
interesting point.

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:50.490 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the working
group that you've put together.

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:53.450 align:middle line:84%
You said that you're working
with Rubio in the Senate

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:54.470 align:middle line:90%
Intelligence Committee.

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:56.390 align:middle line:90%
What's that interaction about?

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we're trying
to get disclosure.

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying to
facilitate people

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:03.520 align:middle line:90%
to bring up to be interviewed.

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And we don't work actually
directly every day

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.670 align:middle line:90%
with Senator Rubio.

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:09.200 align:middle line:90%
We work with staffers.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:15.713 align:middle line:84%
And the staffers will interview
people that we bring to them.

00:22:15.713 --> 00:22:17.630 align:middle line:84%
Some of the staffers
have security clearances,

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:19.020 align:middle line:90%
and some of them don't.

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:21.188 align:middle line:84%
So they have to be careful
the questions they ask

00:22:21.188 --> 00:22:22.730 align:middle line:84%
and the people that
we bring to them.

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:24.260 align:middle line:84%
But there's other
groups that are

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:28.430 align:middle line:84%
doing the same thing that
we do, Lue Elizondo's group.

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:30.690 align:middle line:84%
We don't interface
that much with them.

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:32.880 align:middle line:84%
There's also a
group of scientists.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't know a whole
lot about them,

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:35.930 align:middle line:90%
but these are all scientists.

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:43.010 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are MIT, Stanford
scientists or professors that

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:44.980 align:middle line:90%
are involved in this subject.

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:47.660 align:middle line:90%


00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Here's the
million-dollar question.

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:55.570 align:middle line:84%
Does the Air Force
still investigate UFOs?

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:59.110 align:middle line:84%
Do they have their
own office dealing

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:02.290 align:middle line:84%
with this independent
of everything else that

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:03.370 align:middle line:90%
is going on?

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:05.725 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, they do.

00:23:05.725 --> 00:23:08.110 align:middle line:84%
The same agency I used to
work for, the Air Force

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:12.610 align:middle line:84%
Office of Special Investigations
counterintelligence branch,

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:14.920 align:middle line:90%
they do still investigate.

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:19.270 align:middle line:84%
If it involves Air Force
resources, Air Force property,

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:23.440 align:middle line:84%
or Air Force personnel, or
happens on an Air Force base

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.420 align:middle line:84%
or near Air Force base,
they will investigate it.

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:28.240 align:middle line:90%
So they still do it absolutely.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:32.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, after Project Blue
Book was shut down 1969--

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.060 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're going back
a few decades here.

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:38.380 align:middle line:84%
But after that
point, I think that--

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.430 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think
that I'm wrong.

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:44.110 align:middle line:84%
I think that the Air
Force got very comfortable

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:48.620 align:middle line:84%
in keeping their mouth shut
and not saying anything.

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And if anybody
brought anything up,

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.810 align:middle line:90%
they didn't have to respond.

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:54.473 align:middle line:90%
Blue Book is closed down.

00:23:54.473 --> 00:23:55.640 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing to see here.

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.430 align:middle line:90%
This is our official position.

00:23:57.430 --> 00:24:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And they operated like
that until this very day.

00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:06.280 align:middle line:84%
When Chris Mellon wrote
his op-ed two years ago,

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:09.530 align:middle line:84%
criticizing the way things
were moving forward,

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:11.900 align:middle line:84%
one of the points
that he brought up--

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:14.630 align:middle line:84%
and it should be
discussed today--

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:19.730 align:middle line:84%
was that there was
a secure chat room

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:23.180 align:middle line:84%
at the Pentagon for
everybody to gather

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:27.740 align:middle line:84%
from the different branches
and talk about UAP issues.

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And the Air Force was
involved with that.

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And when certain officials
inside of the Air Force

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:37.220 align:middle line:84%
found out that the Air
Force personnel were

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:42.170 align:middle line:84%
part of this chat, literally,
a chat room discussing UAPs,

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:45.020 align:middle line:84%
they were told to
back off and not

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:49.955 align:middle line:84%
to say anything or participate
in this chat room anymore.

00:24:49.955 --> 00:24:53.010 align:middle line:84%
When Chris presented
this to the world,

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:56.300 align:middle line:84%
I would have thought that there
would have been an uproar,

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:59.600 align:middle line:84%
and that there should have been
some journalism applied to this

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.760 align:middle line:90%
and questions asked.

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.860 align:middle line:84%
If there's nothing
to see here, then why

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:06.380 align:middle line:84%
are you pulling your
own personnel out

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:08.900 align:middle line:84%
of a secure chat
room at the Pentagon

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:10.910 align:middle line:90%
that's discussing UAPs?

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:13.880 align:middle line:84%
That indicates to me that
the Air Force just wants

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.650 align:middle line:90%
to keep control of the subject.

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:16.520 align:middle line:90%
Am I wrong?

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.770 align:middle line:90%
>> No, you're absolutely right.

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:21.800 align:middle line:84%
In 1969, when the
Cottenham report came out,

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.260 align:middle line:84%
Air Force had a way
to get out of it,

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:25.700 align:middle line:90%
to close Project Blue Book.

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And the Air Force
wants to get out of it.

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, only through the public
eye because, obviously,

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:39.380 align:middle line:84%
in 1977, '78, '79
through 1988, I

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:40.880 align:middle line:84%
was a member of the
Air Force Office

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.700 align:middle line:84%
of Special Investigation,
and I investigated UFOs.

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:48.530 align:middle line:84%
So the Air Force still was me
and 122 other special agents.

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened
in 1969 Air Force says,

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:54.170 align:middle line:90%
OK, we're out of it.

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:57.380 align:middle line:84%
We can give you the public
information on that.

00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:59.370 align:middle line:84%
We're not investigating
it anymore.

00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, there was so much
information gathered

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.120 align:middle line:84%
that the Air Force had, they
didn't know what to do with it.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.430 align:middle line:90%
Well, DIA, which was fairly new.

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:09.750 align:middle line:90%
DIA was created in 1961.

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:13.070 align:middle line:84%
So 1969, the DIA didn't
really have a whole lot.

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:15.440 align:middle line:84%
They had military
stuff they were doing.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.080 align:middle line:84%
DIA raised their hand and
said, we'll take your stuff.

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.170 align:middle line:90%
We'll take it.

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:25.070 align:middle line:84%
So the central depository for
all UFO information after 1969

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:26.720 align:middle line:90%
didn't go to the Air Force.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.460 align:middle line:90%
They went to the DIA.

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you
for a fact, when

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:34.400 align:middle line:84%
I was briefed into the subject
in 1979, one of the things

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.560 align:middle line:84%
that I probably would
get in trouble for,

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:39.830 align:middle line:84%
but the reporting
system for anything

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:45.950 align:middle line:84%
pertaining to UFOs, ETs, or
we had other nomenclature,

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:48.110 align:middle line:90%
went to DIA.

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:51.770 align:middle line:84%
It didn't go to Air Force Office
of Special Investigations.

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:54.350 align:middle line:84%
We had a separate
reporting channel

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:58.580 align:middle line:84%
directly to DIA, not
to the Air Force Office

00:26:58.580 --> 00:26:59.900 align:middle line:90%
of Special Investigation.

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:02.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, our supervisors
in headquarters

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:05.810 align:middle line:84%
would get a copy of
whatever we presented,

00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:07.910 align:middle line:90%
the reports that we presented.

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:12.200 align:middle line:84%
But everything was
filed over in DIA.

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
central depository is at,

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:17.870 align:middle line:84%
Bolling Air Force base,
at least during my time.

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:19.590 align:middle line:90%
Now, is it still there?

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:21.140 align:middle line:84%
I can guarantee you
it's still there

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:25.790 align:middle line:84%
because we have a person that
will testify in Congress.

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:27.890 align:middle line:90%
He works in DIA.

00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:33.980 align:middle line:84%
And he will testify that he has
filing cabinets behind his desk

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:38.900 align:middle line:84%
that contain UFO data that
is still highly classified.

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:44.660 align:middle line:10%
>> David Grusch got up in
front of Congress under oath

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:48.080 align:middle line:10%
and said, we've
got alien bodies.

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:53.030 align:middle line:10%
Now we're talking about
bodies, bodies on ice.

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:54.590 align:middle line:90%
Maybe some are alive.

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:59.060 align:middle line:84%
We've got an image here
of exactly that, what

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:04.670 align:middle line:84%
David Grusch was talking about,
which is called the creature

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:07.022 align:middle line:90%
containment facility.

00:28:07.022 --> 00:28:08.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, if that doesn't
freak you out,

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.320 align:middle line:84%
just the title of
it, and at Area 51.

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.850 align:middle line:90%
Let's pull this up, Josh.

00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:16.310 align:middle line:84%
Tell me, Mr. Doty, what
are we looking at here?

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:19.230 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a picture
of the former--

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:21.730 align:middle line:84%
I can say former because I don't
know if they're still there

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:23.170 align:middle line:90%
but at least during my time.

00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:27.760 align:middle line:84%
That's a creature containment
facility northwest of S2

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:28.600 align:middle line:90%
complex.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Creature
containment facility.

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:33.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, creature
containment facility,

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:39.040 align:middle line:84%
which is northwest of Papoose
Lake, 15 miles northwest.

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:42.670 align:middle line:84%
You can google this, and you
can see this exact image.

00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know if
there's ET still there.

00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:52.630 align:middle line:84%
But I know at my time
at Area 51 and the two

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:56.890 align:middle line:84%
times I was there in '84 and
'85, we had live ETs there.

00:28:56.890 --> 00:28:58.798 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you ever
visit this facility?

00:28:58.798 --> 00:29:00.340 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I was never
briefed into this.

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:01.923 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have a
clearance to go there.

00:29:01.923 --> 00:29:05.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, when you
say we had live ETs,

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:08.290 align:middle line:84%
was this the chatter
in the cafeteria?

00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:11.780 align:middle line:84%
Or did you hear about this
in a more official sense?

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:16.190 align:middle line:84%
>> In building 432, which is
the OSI office at Area 51,

00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:19.640 align:middle line:84%
there were five agents, the
supervisor and four agents.

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:23.530 align:middle line:84%
We each had the need
to know, so to speak.

00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:26.700 align:middle line:90%
We had our own operations.

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And if we needed help, we
could give limited briefings

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:33.560 align:middle line:84%
to another agent so they
could help us on an operation.

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:37.800 align:middle line:84%
At one point in 1984, one of
the agents came to me and said,

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.540 align:middle line:90%
hey, listen, I need your help.

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:41.960 align:middle line:84%
We need to go out and
investigate something,

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.820 align:middle line:90%
but I need another agent.

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:45.380 align:middle line:90%
I said, fine.

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:46.700 align:middle line:90%
What are we going into?

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:51.140 align:middle line:10%
And he told me a
visitor that was

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:54.530 align:middle line:10%
housed in a creature containment
facility had escaped.

00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:56.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Was it from this facility?

00:29:56.210 --> 00:30:01.760 align:middle line:10%
And is this one of the
facilities that David Grusch is

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:04.460 align:middle line:10%
going to reveal to
Congress in the SCIF

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:07.550 align:middle line:10%
when he says he's got
addresses and locations?

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:09.200 align:middle line:90%
Is this one of them?

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:10.460 align:middle line:90%
>> I would guess it was.

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:14.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't know for a fact
what he's going to disclose.

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:16.630 align:middle line:84%
But I would say that
this was one of them.

00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:20.470 align:middle line:84%
There were others, but
this was one of them.

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:24.850 align:middle line:10%
The bodies were actually
transported from--

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:28.780 align:middle line:10%
that we recovered over
the years from Wright-Patt

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:31.150 align:middle line:10%
to the Armed Forces
Institute of Pathology,

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:33.070 align:middle line:10%
which doesn't exist anymore.

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:35.800 align:middle line:10%
And that's one of the
places that Dr. Kit Green

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.720 align:middle line:10%
had talked about.

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:40.400 align:middle line:84%
They have a secret facility
underground facility,

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.670 align:middle line:84%
or they did because it
doesn't exist anymore

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:44.080 align:middle line:90%
in Washington, DC.

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:47.260 align:middle line:84%
So if you google the Armed
Forces Institute of Pathology,

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:49.000 align:middle line:90%
there was a big facility.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.650 align:middle line:10%
And they did a
lot of experiments

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:53.710 align:middle line:10%
on a number of
things, on autopsies,

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:56.410 align:middle line:10%
on servicemen that
died mysteriously.

00:30:56.410 --> 00:31:00.040 align:middle line:10%
You're going to find out that
there was this facility there.

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:02.420 align:middle line:10%
But this is alive.

00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:04.300 align:middle line:10%
This is where the
live ones were kept.

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:08.760 align:middle line:10%
Now, I'm not going to go into
great details of what we did.

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.830 align:middle line:90%
We didn't find the creatures.

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:14.110 align:middle line:90%
The military police did.

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:16.310 align:middle line:84%
How he escaped, I don't
know anything about that.

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:19.540 align:middle line:84%
I was just told a
limited briefing.

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:21.700 align:middle line:84%
So then I knew that's
where they were kept.

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:25.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Rick, one
last question is,

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:27.760 align:middle line:90%
what's your take on disclosure?

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.380 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's a broad question.

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:32.380 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of
anticipation of things going

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:34.010 align:middle line:90%
down in the next few months.

00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:35.830 align:middle line:90%
But what's your take on it?

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And how do you think it's
going to happen and when?

00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:39.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Everything's
been pushed back.

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:41.800 align:middle line:84%
There's crisis within
the Senate and the House

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.260 align:middle line:90%
that's pushed everything back.

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:47.380 align:middle line:84%
I think we were scheduled
to have a Senate hearing

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:48.970 align:middle line:90%
because the House had hearings.

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:51.340 align:middle line:84%
The Senate was supposed
to have hearings.

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:55.210 align:middle line:84%
That didn't go through because
of other pressing issues

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:56.080 align:middle line:90%
within the Senate.

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:59.410 align:middle line:84%
Senator Schumer, the Majority
Leader in the Senate,

00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:02.440 align:middle line:84%
tried to help,
tried to facilitate

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.900 align:middle line:84%
some type of disclosure
program for the Senate.

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:06.010 align:middle line:90%
That didn't happen.

00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:11.620 align:middle line:84%
So there's a consensus among
the different working groups

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:14.090 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to
do our own disclosure.

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And we hope to have that
set up sometime in December.

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:21.080 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of factors
working against us.

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.210 align:middle line:84%
The government is
working against us.

00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:26.010 align:middle line:84%
The intelligence community
is working against us.

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And so if we can
facilitate it and have one,

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:33.210 align:middle line:84%
we're going to bring in
whistleblowers that we know of,

00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:35.120 align:middle line:84%
and that's been
vetted by the DOD.

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
have them testify.

00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:39.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh, here's
your opportunity.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.680 align:middle line:84%
You've got a secret agent
in front of you that

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:45.140 align:middle line:90%
is dealing with working groups.

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:48.330 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be
something going on.

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:49.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, what is
the deal with that?

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:52.190 align:middle line:84%
So this seems to be
multiple groups that

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:53.927 align:middle line:90%
are working for disclosure.

00:32:53.927 --> 00:32:55.010 align:middle line:90%
Are they working together?

00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:56.510 align:middle line:84%
Are you battling
these other groups?

00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:58.350 align:middle line:90%
Or is there synergy there?

00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:01.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there is somewhat of a
competition between the working

00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:02.270 align:middle line:90%
groups.

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:07.760 align:middle line:84%
We certainly want to bring
forth our own whistleblowers,

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:11.660 align:middle line:84%
the one we've helped
bring to Washington, DC.

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And we want our agenda
top billing, so to speak.

00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And there's other groups,
such as Lue Elizondo--

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:24.110 align:middle line:90%
and I respect him 1,000%--

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:25.940 align:middle line:90%
that wants another agenda.

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:29.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't know exactly what the
other group's agendas are.

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are actually
against disclosures.

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
competition that we

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.250 align:middle line:84%
have amongst the
different working groups.

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:40.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Vicious.

00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:40.920 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't like that.

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:41.720 align:middle line:90%
I don't like that.

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:42.920 align:middle line:90%
That's trouble.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Intense.

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:46.820 align:middle line:84%
For "Into the Vortex,"
I'm Jimmy Church,

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:49.090 align:middle line:90%
and we'll see you next time.

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:53.000 align:middle line:90%
