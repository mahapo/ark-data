00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Radio and Television
Host, Jimmy Church.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And I am here to uncover
the truth about some

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.700 align:middle line:90%
of life's biggest mysteries.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.540 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is revealed,
everything has to be rewritten.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.230 align:middle line:10%
>> My guest today
is Grant Cameron,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.040 align:middle line:10%
a distinguished UFO Researcher
and prolific Author renowned

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.953 align:middle line:10%
for his extensive contributions
to the field of ufology.

00:00:32.953 --> 00:00:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Everybody describes
it the same way--

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.940 align:middle line:90%
you make contact with a craft.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.140 align:middle line:90%
The craft is alive.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And you become one
with the craft.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.320 align:middle line:84%
You and the craft
are the same thing

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.670 align:middle line:90%
as soon as you touch the craft.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.360 align:middle line:84%
>> As always, MUFON
Field Investigator, Josh.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh, can you
pull up the map?

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Joins us to
help set the scene.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.210 align:middle line:84%
Join us as we dive deep to
get to the bottom of some

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.390 align:middle line:84%
of the most intriguing
questions of our time.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.940 align:middle line:84%
>> The fact that he's come
out now and basically,

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.692 align:middle line:90%
on the record stated--

00:01:01.692 --> 00:01:03.150 align:middle line:84%
cleared by the
Defense Department--

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.019 align:middle line:90%
that we've got a craft.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.352 align:middle line:90%
And we've been inside the craft.

00:01:05.352 --> 00:01:06.540 align:middle line:90%
It's just unraveling.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:18.730 align:middle line:90%


00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome to Into the Vortex.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm your Host, Jimmy
Church and along with Josh.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.260 align:middle line:84%
Today, our guest
is Grant Cameron,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.730 align:middle line:90%
all the way from Canada.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.150 align:middle line:84%
Josh, I've been anticipating
this conversation.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.950 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready?

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm ready, me too.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.300 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a wealth of knowledge.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And Grant, not
only international,

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.530 align:middle line:84%
national researcher
of The Year Awards.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.210 align:middle line:84%
But for me, it's always been
your knowledge of US presidents

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.550 align:middle line:90%
and their connections with ET.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And your research Grant, over
the years, it has shifted.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.360 align:middle line:84%
You go where your
interest is pulling you.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.420 align:middle line:84%
You've danced into music, and
ETs, of course, US presidents.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And today, abductions, and
your own personal sightings,

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.890 align:middle line:84%
and what is going on up
with the US-Canadian border,

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.150 align:middle line:84%
and military installations--
and just insane amount

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.120 align:middle line:90%
of information.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.490 align:middle line:84%
But today, you've gone more
into a consciousness connection

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:28.460 align:middle line:84%
side of things, and the control
of craft with consciousness,

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.760 align:middle line:84%
and, of course, the new
book, and sky pilots.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.880 align:middle line:90%
So let's start there.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.090 align:middle line:90%
What is a sky pilot?

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.610 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, well, to
give you background,

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.480 align:middle line:84%
I was contacted in 2013 by a
woman who claimed to have flown

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.280 align:middle line:90%
the craft.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.687 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, you're insane.

00:02:44.687 --> 00:02:46.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I just couldn't
believe that she was

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.812 align:middle line:90%
saying that she was in her 70s.

00:02:47.812 --> 00:02:50.178 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, like Saudi
Arabian women can't drive

00:02:50.178 --> 00:02:51.470 align:middle line:90%
a car without a man in the car.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.150 align:middle line:84%
Like, they let
you fly the craft?

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And what had happened
is, in 2012, I

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.720 align:middle line:84%
had a download
experience watching

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.045 align:middle line:84%
Colin Andrews give a
lecture in which he

00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:00.170 align:middle line:90%
talked about consciousness.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.295 align:middle line:90%
And it suddenly came to me.

00:03:01.295 --> 00:03:04.190 align:middle line:84%
I had this insight that
said, in 1975, he wanted

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.520 align:middle line:90%
to know, what's this all about?

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.380 align:middle line:90%
It's about consciousness.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And it came with
absolute certainty.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.600 align:middle line:90%
And I knew.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.870 align:middle line:84%
So when this woman said
she had flown the craft

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.653 align:middle line:84%
and used consciousness
to do it, then I

00:03:14.653 --> 00:03:16.820 align:middle line:84%
realized why they'd set me
up to talk to this woman.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And then these people
started to appear.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.337 align:middle line:84%
So it was something
that just happened.

00:03:20.337 --> 00:03:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And most of my stuff
happens that way.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.200 align:middle line:84%
Where something happens and
then all the material shows up.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.320 align:middle line:90%
So I end up with over 36 people.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.848 align:middle line:84%
And later, I've got
Whitley Strieber

00:03:28.848 --> 00:03:31.140 align:middle line:84%
and other people that confirmed
all this kind of stuff.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.870 align:middle line:84%
But basically, the 36
people who came to me

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.910 align:middle line:84%
and told me the same story--
yeah, I've flown the craft.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd say, hang
on-- like Chris Bussell,

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.000 align:middle line:90%
hey, how do you fly a craft?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.823 align:middle line:90%
And say, we do with your mind.

00:03:39.823 --> 00:03:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And nobody ever said
anything different.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:42.698 align:middle line:90%
They all said the same thing.

00:03:42.698 --> 00:03:45.350 align:middle line:84%
So they would talk about the
fact that you're in the craft.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.850 align:middle line:90%
The craft is alive.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.815 align:middle line:84%
It's like artificial
intelligence or control

00:03:48.815 --> 00:03:49.730 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.650 align:middle line:90%
The craft has a mind.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:52.580 align:middle line:90%
It's alive.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.250 align:middle line:84%
You put your hand on
a panel or on a ball.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.257 align:middle line:84%
Or in the end of a chair, you
become one with the craft.

00:03:58.257 --> 00:04:00.590 align:middle line:84%
Once you touch the craft, you
become one with the craft.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And whatever you think
is what the craft does.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And what they will actually
say to you is, they'll say,

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.890 align:middle line:90%
Jimmy, go within yourself.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.360 align:middle line:90%
Imagine it within yourself.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you can
imagine where you want to go,

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.200 align:middle line:90%
push the button, this is--

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Was there something unique
about her and her ability

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.680 align:middle line:84%
to understand consciousness
that allowed her to do this

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.570 align:middle line:90%
and to be selected?

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, she was a contactee.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.360 align:middle line:90%
And you run into these people.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.593 align:middle line:84%
Like, when she was telling
me I was three years old.

00:04:28.593 --> 00:04:29.510 align:middle line:90%
And I was in a diaper.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.440 align:middle line:90%
And the UFOs were there.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in the
middle of a field.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.348 align:middle line:84%
And she claimed that she
remote viewed for the US

00:04:34.348 --> 00:04:35.640 align:middle line:90%
government and stuff like that.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
yeah, OK, whatever.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:37.340 align:middle line:90%
She's telling these stories.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And you hear all these
stories all the time.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.160 align:middle line:84%
But it is when she
came to the thought,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.060 align:middle line:90%
she was flying the craft.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.810 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, what?

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.227 align:middle line:84%
Because I'd never
heard it before.

00:04:43.227 --> 00:04:45.200 align:middle line:84%
I'd been in it
for like 35 years.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.650 align:middle line:84%
I'd never heard a
story like that.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.140 align:middle line:90%
And I thought she was insane.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.920 align:middle line:84%
So she was just a woman
who claimed a lot of stuff.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.840 align:middle line:84%
Where she had a lot
of contact, a lot

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.130 align:middle line:84%
of ability, psychic abilities,
and stuff like that.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.590 align:middle line:90%
And that's all I knew her as.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.160 align:middle line:84%
But when she added this
element, it opened up

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.370 align:middle line:84%
this whole new field of
this idea that now, I think,

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.380 align:middle line:84%
the US government has
basically confirmed.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you suggesting that you
don't have to have some psychic

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.740 align:middle line:84%
ability, that anybody
could do this like myself?

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think, it would come
down to the experiences that

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.407 align:middle line:90%
have been on board the ship.

00:05:18.407 --> 00:05:20.060 align:middle line:90%
So you may have to be psychic.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.890 align:middle line:10%
I mean, there seems to
be a certain-- like when

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.490 align:middle line:10%
they ask Roger Leir, who did
the alien implants in Los

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.282 align:middle line:10%
Angeles, what's common
between all people who

00:05:30.282 --> 00:05:31.610 align:middle line:10%
have had removed the implants?

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.107 align:middle line:84%
He said, they're all
right-brained, creative people.

00:05:34.107 --> 00:05:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And there's tons of
them in Hollywood.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's his idea of there's
a certain type of personality

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.702 align:middle line:84%
that is able to be psychic,
that's able to do this.

00:05:41.702 --> 00:05:43.910 align:middle line:84%
So I think, you'd have to
have sort of the abilities.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:44.780 align:middle line:90%
You're in the field.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.280 align:middle line:90%
You're already an experiencer.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And those are the people that
have the ability to do it,

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.760 align:middle line:84%
same as channeling or anything
else you want to talk about.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:59.010 align:middle line:84%
>> So you have a very crazy
ability of connecting the dots.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how many
interviews you and I

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.870 align:middle line:84%
have done over the years,
but it's been a lot.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing that I look
at you for is the ability to see

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.280 align:middle line:84%
3D through this to separate
what is real and what isn't.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.390 align:middle line:90%
You've got that ability.

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're connecting
the dots with something

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.740 align:middle line:84%
that is an intangible,
like consciousness.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And now, you've got other
people that are approaching you.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.110 align:middle line:90%
In 2013, she reaches out to you.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.620 align:middle line:84%
You've had this
download in 2012.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, you find yourself
really connecting the dots.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:37.350 align:middle line:84%
What were the consistencies
with the 30 or so people that

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.140 align:middle line:90%
came forward and back to her?

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.380 align:middle line:90%
What were you seeing connecting?

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:48.090 align:middle line:10%
>> You've got this statement
from Jim Lacatski has come

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.730 align:middle line:10%
forward and says that
they have a craft.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:55.080 align:middle line:10%
This has been approved by the
Defense Department to review.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.250 align:middle line:10%
They've got a craft.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:57.810 align:middle line:10%
They've been inside the craft.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.700 align:middle line:90%
And it has no engine.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:03.630 align:middle line:90%
It has no intakes, exhaust.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.395 align:middle line:90%
It basically is a craft.

00:07:07.395 --> 00:07:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And they don't
know how it flies.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's the consciousness
thing that sort

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.530 align:middle line:84%
implies that there may
not be an engine, that it

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.730 align:middle line:90%
may be an entire consciousness.

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:16.980 align:middle line:90%
>> So there is no power plant.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.400 align:middle line:90%
There's no fuel tanks.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.440 align:middle line:84%
There's no control surfaces,
airfoils, aerodynamic-- nothing

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.360 align:middle line:90%
at all, except?

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Except, this is
the thing it keys.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.750 align:middle line:84%
If you look back at the
Wilson leak document--

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.280 align:middle line:84%
you and I talked about
the Wilson leak document

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.050 align:middle line:84%
that I was in the chain of
command as this thing came out.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:36.650 align:middle line:84%
At the end of it, they
talk about this thing

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:38.330 align:middle line:90%
where the guy gets the briefing.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:39.240 align:middle line:90%
He gets the briefing.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.600 align:middle line:90%
And he goes back to the admiral.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.340 align:middle line:10%
And he says, we've got a craft.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.115 align:middle line:90%
And we think it'll fly.

00:07:45.115 --> 00:07:47.490 align:middle line:84%
At that time point, I knew
about the consciousness thing.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I know what
they're talking about.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.020 align:middle line:84%
There's always been a rumor
that they've got a craft.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.040 align:middle line:90%
And it's completely intact.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.100 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing wrong with it.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.350 align:middle line:90%
But they can't turn it on.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:55.430 align:middle line:90%
It's like the core story.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:58.533 align:middle line:84%
How Puthoff-- Jacques Vallée
and Puthoff get together

00:07:58.533 --> 00:07:59.450 align:middle line:90%
at Denny's restaurant.

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:01.617 align:middle line:84%
What do we know, for sure,
about the UFO phenomenon?

00:08:01.617 --> 00:08:03.830 align:middle line:84%
Number one, being
interacted by something.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:05.627 align:middle line:90%
Number two, we've got hardware.

00:08:05.627 --> 00:08:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And number three, we
can't back engineer it.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:08.700 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they're missing.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:09.860 align:middle line:90%
So they say, we've got a craft.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:10.730 align:middle line:90%
And we think it'll fly.

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:13.105 align:middle line:84%
But they can't fly it, because
you need the consciousness

00:08:13.105 --> 00:08:14.278 align:middle line:90%
interface, you need someone.

00:08:14.278 --> 00:08:16.070 align:middle line:84%
It's like the thumbprint
on your cell phone

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:18.470 align:middle line:84%
or whatever that you need
to be able to have somebody

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:19.607 align:middle line:90%
that turns the craft on.

00:08:19.607 --> 00:08:20.690 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have an engine.

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:24.060 align:middle line:84%
So it's this thing that they're
basically coming up with.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And now, Lacatski has
basically confirmed that there

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:28.950 align:middle line:90%
is a psychic phenomena.

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And you got to remember, this
is going through an approval

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.100 align:middle line:84%
through this DOPSR
approval method.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.500 align:middle line:84%
That this has been approved
by the Department of Defense.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.789 align:middle line:84%
So that he can actually
state this in public.

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:40.890 align:middle line:90%
>> What's the statement?

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:43.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'll read it so that I
don't paraphrase the statement.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.660 align:middle line:84%
He says-- and this
is from a book

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.480 align:middle line:84%
that they've just released
called "Initial Revelations."

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:53.160 align:middle line:84%
"Everything works as if UAP
were a product of technology

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:57.850 align:middle line:84%
that integrates physical
and psychic phenomena."

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:00.000 align:middle line:84%
So they're putting
this consciousness

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.860 align:middle line:90%
and the physical craft together.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's an
official statement.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I'm
an expert at taking

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.470 align:middle line:84%
highly classified
material and bringing it

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.040 align:middle line:90%
down to lower levels.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.640 align:middle line:84%
So basically, the
government now has basically

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.280 align:middle line:84%
confirmed this concept that
there is a physical component.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.590 align:middle line:84%
In the UFO field, we've
always sort of known that.

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:17.695 align:middle line:90%
2012, I had to download.

00:09:17.695 --> 00:09:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And now, people are starting
to talk about consciousness.

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:22.980 align:middle line:84%
People are making these
references to consciousness.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.400 align:middle line:84%
But now, I think the
government, on the record,

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.830 align:middle line:84%
admitted that there is this
consciousness connection.

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:29.790 align:middle line:90%
There's no engine.

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And all the people
told me the same thing.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.365 align:middle line:84%
Or they would tell me that
the craft is the thing that

00:09:37.365 --> 00:09:38.490 align:middle line:90%
makes the whole thing work.

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:40.260 align:middle line:90%
It's actually controlled.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.060 align:middle line:90%
It's biological.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And you get people who
will even describe.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Then one guy, I remember, I
asked him specifically-- he

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:50.850 align:middle line:84%
said that was his job,
was to fly the craft.

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:53.972 align:middle line:84%
And then, they said to him,
Ron, where would you like to go?

00:09:53.972 --> 00:09:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'd like to see
the Milky Way from a distance.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And he said, OK,
it's within you.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:58.980 align:middle line:90%
Go within yourself.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.330 align:middle line:90%
Imagine it within yourself.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:01.560 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you're
ready, we'll go.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.143 align:middle line:84%
And he said, it was
about one second--

00:10:03.143 --> 00:10:05.650 align:middle line:84%
he said this intense
G-Force for one second.

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:06.960 align:middle line:90%
He looked out at the window.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And there was the Milky
Way, off in a distance.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.470 align:middle line:90%
And this is like one second.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's the whole
key as if that's

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.850 align:middle line:84%
how they fly these
things-- it's 36 people.

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:17.700 align:middle line:84%
It's not one person or two
people, it's 36 people.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.070 align:middle line:84%
It's a powerful
amount of evidence

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:23.500 align:middle line:84%
that indicates that's
maybe how it works.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, sure.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And we've got some pretty
serious corroborating evidence.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.610 align:middle line:84%
We've got David Grush and
his testimony, of course,

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:34.770 align:middle line:90%
with the Congress.

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.930 align:middle line:84%
We've got the Wilson
Davis document.

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And now, these 36 witnesses
of-- sky pilots, if you will,

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:46.500 align:middle line:84%
coming forward, all speaking
about the very same things.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.660 align:middle line:84%
Is this enough to
push this forward?

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at
these 36 witnesses,

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:57.840 align:middle line:84%
sky pilots if you will, what
is it that they represent?

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Do they represent a
military wing of sky pilots

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:05.370 align:middle line:84%
that we are recruiting
to fly these crafts?

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:09.330 align:middle line:84%
Do we have a secret part of the
military that is doing this?

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.610 align:middle line:84%
>> There was only one
military guy who is out of LA,

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:16.000 align:middle line:84%
out of the Orange County Group,
a guy who was a retired US Air

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:16.800 align:middle line:90%
Force Colonel.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.800 align:middle line:84%
Other than that, there
was no military people.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.150 align:middle line:90%
Most of them were women.

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:23.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Why do you think that is?

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, women
are right brained.

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:30.060 align:middle line:84%
They're less into ego and
technology and this sort

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:33.150 align:middle line:84%
of thing where once you
can shut down the ego,

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:36.390 align:middle line:84%
you go into the right
brain into the universe.

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:37.420 align:middle line:90%
And you can tap in.

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:39.420 align:middle line:84%
So you can do it through
all contact modality.

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.820 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I think
most of it is women.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:42.990 align:middle line:90%
But I don't think--

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:45.390 align:middle line:84%
the way these things
come to me is--

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.570 align:middle line:84%
I think, the way I look at it
is that these people sort of

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:49.772 align:middle line:90%
showed up for me.

00:11:49.772 --> 00:11:52.230 align:middle line:84%
You'd be talking to someone,
like talking to Chris Bledsoe,

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:53.905 align:middle line:84%
and then talking
about client craft.

00:11:53.905 --> 00:11:54.780 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I flew the craft.

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:55.860 align:middle line:90%
And I said, you flew the craft?

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:57.240 align:middle line:90%
Hang on, don't tell me anything.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And then I get them
on a Skype call.

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.823 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, start at the
beginning, go to the end.

00:12:00.823 --> 00:12:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And they would all describe
these very bizarre things

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:05.710 align:middle line:84%
that shift over into other
paranormal phenomena.

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:08.670 align:middle line:84%
For example, a lot of them
would say, I was on the craft.

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:10.740 align:middle line:90%
I could see in 360 degrees.

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.450 align:middle line:84%
As soon as they said
360 degrees, I said,

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:15.828 align:middle line:84%
hey, that's
out-of-body experience.

00:12:15.828 --> 00:12:17.370 align:middle line:84%
People who had
out-of-body experience

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:18.930 align:middle line:90%
say they can see in 360 degrees.

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:21.547 align:middle line:84%
Or they would say the craft
is 30 feet on the outside.

00:12:21.547 --> 00:12:23.880 align:middle line:84%
They went inside, it was the
size of a football stadium.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.785 align:middle line:84%
And then you see
the crossover there,

00:12:25.785 --> 00:12:27.910 align:middle line:84%
where I have this Ron
Johnson guy who saw the Milky

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:29.050 align:middle line:90%
Way from a distance.

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.690 align:middle line:84%
His being was named LB, takes
him into the spirit world.

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:32.873 align:middle line:90%
He's with his mother.

00:12:32.873 --> 00:12:33.790 align:middle line:90%
And he's a Mormon guy.

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:34.748 align:middle line:90%
So he sees this temple.

00:12:34.748 --> 00:12:36.332 align:middle line:84%
And his mother says,
when you die Ron,

00:12:36.332 --> 00:12:38.140 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get a
room in this temple.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:39.667 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I go
inside the temple.

00:12:39.667 --> 00:12:42.250 align:middle line:84%
He said, it's 100 times the size
inside the temple as outside.

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:44.785 align:middle line:84%
And I said, hey, that's
what the UFO people say.

00:12:44.785 --> 00:12:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's where all
these things cross over.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.850 align:middle line:84%
You start seeing
all these crossovers

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:50.200 align:middle line:90%
of these different phenomena.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.740 align:middle line:84%
That it may all be the same
thing just being taught

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.240 align:middle line:90%
to us in different manner.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:59.200 align:middle line:84%
So I think, these people were,
in many ways, given to me.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:03.020 align:middle line:84%
>> So it would make
a lot of sense,

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:07.870 align:middle line:84%
the 360 degree viewpoint, if
you're consciously connected

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:08.920 align:middle line:90%
to the craft.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:13.070 align:middle line:84%
Then you don't have to have
eyes on the back of your head.

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:18.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is right where time
and space doesn't take place

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.080 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, you would be in
a 360 degree, all encompassing,

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:26.870 align:middle line:90%
that would include up and down.

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:28.625 align:middle line:84%
It would be a
sphere type of view.

00:13:28.625 --> 00:13:30.500 align:middle line:84%
>> But still, to me, it
never made any sense.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:30.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Why?

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Like I never heard that
until I heard it by out of body

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.318 align:middle line:84%
experience because it
still doesn't make sense.

00:13:34.318 --> 00:13:36.690 align:middle line:84%
Like how can you see in 360
degrees at the same time?

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
thing that amazed me,

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:41.060 align:middle line:84%
was the parallels to
other paranormal phenomena

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:45.128 align:middle line:84%
where they would describe things
that didn't make any sense,

00:13:45.128 --> 00:13:46.670 align:middle line:84%
that you wouldn't
make this up if you

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:47.920 align:middle line:90%
were going to make up a story.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And it helped put off
this talk about the craft

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:51.270 align:middle line:90%
being bigger on the inside.

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's the key, is if these
people are telling the truth,

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:54.937 align:middle line:84%
and the craft is
bigger on the inside,

00:13:54.937 --> 00:13:56.520 align:middle line:84%
we haven't got a
clue what's going on.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.562 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's no way
we've got this technology.

00:13:58.562 --> 00:14:01.400 align:middle line:90%
>> The craft itself--

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:06.020 align:middle line:84%
the 36 pilots that
have been talking

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:09.860 align:middle line:84%
about this and the lady
that approached you in 2013,

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:11.660 align:middle line:84%
how are they
describing the craft?

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:16.520 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, the interior,
are multiple seats?

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.950 align:middle line:84%
The exterior, are they
describing the same craft?

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:20.760 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:21.560 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.395 align:middle line:84%
I think almost all of
them are different.

00:14:23.395 --> 00:14:24.770 align:middle line:84%
Almost all of them
are different.

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:27.570 align:middle line:90%
They'll get things where--

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:31.985 align:middle line:84%
for example, the retired
US Air Force colonel

00:14:31.985 --> 00:14:33.110 align:middle line:90%
says I'm just on the craft.

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:34.130 align:middle line:90%
Suddenly, I'm on the craft.

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And they would describe
another weird thing.

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:36.800 align:middle line:90%
He said, there's these--

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.743 align:middle line:84%
there's either beings or
humans or aliens behind me.

00:14:39.743 --> 00:14:41.660 align:middle line:84%
He said I don't know
what it is, and they just

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:44.180 align:middle line:84%
say to-- they say to me,
OK, go ahead and do it.

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I don't
know what to do.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And then this voice from behind
him says, you know what to do.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.600 align:middle line:90%
Just do it.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And he sees this panel,
and he puts his hands

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.393 align:middle line:90%
on this panel board.

00:14:52.393 --> 00:14:54.102 align:middle line:84%
And then he's sitting
there, and he said,

00:14:54.102 --> 00:14:55.340 align:middle line:90%
it's like I'm flying an F-16.

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:56.937 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, I
take one hand off,

00:14:56.937 --> 00:14:59.270 align:middle line:84%
and I'm waiting for it to
stall, and I got my other hand

00:14:59.270 --> 00:14:59.660 align:middle line:90%
on the panel.

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And then I take this hand
off just a little bit,

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:02.610 align:middle line:84%
so I can put it back
down if it stalls.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.040 align:middle line:84%
And he says, suddenly,
I'm flying the craft.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.998 align:middle line:84%
And that's another thing
people would describe.

00:15:05.998 --> 00:15:07.812 align:middle line:84%
They would say there
were people behind me.

00:15:07.812 --> 00:15:09.020 align:middle line:90%
There was somebody behind me.

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.430 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't allowed to look.

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:12.470 align:middle line:10%
And then Jim Semivan
comes forward,

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:14.310 align:middle line:10%
and his is similar experience.

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:15.110 align:middle line:10%
He said, I'm there.

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:17.825 align:middle line:10%
And they asked him when the
beings were in your room,

00:15:17.825 --> 00:15:18.950 align:middle line:10%
did you have any telepathy?

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:20.450 align:middle line:10%
And he said yeah, that
was the weirdest thing.

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:22.100 align:middle line:10%
He said, when I
was standing there,

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.050 align:middle line:10%
he said, there was
this entity behind me.

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And it had this guardian
type thing going on about it.

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:27.695 align:middle line:90%
And I went, guardian thing?

00:15:27.695 --> 00:15:28.612 align:middle line:90%
That's Michael Newton.

00:15:28.612 --> 00:15:30.170 align:middle line:84%
There's a guardian
angel behind him.

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:31.400 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's not even an alien.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And so then they started asking
people-- they asked Whitley,

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.450 align:middle line:84%
hey, Whitley, did
you ever have--

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:37.820 align:middle line:84%
be on the craft where
you're on the craft

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:39.950 align:middle line:84%
and you heard a voice
behind you talking to you?

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:41.597 align:middle line:90%
And he said, all the time.

00:15:41.597 --> 00:15:43.430 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I was going
to steal the craft.

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:44.690 align:middle line:90%
He was at the panel board.

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:46.220 align:middle line:84%
He was going to put his
hands on the panel board,

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.740 align:middle line:84%
and he says, I said-- he
said to himself in his mind,

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.790 align:middle line:84%
he says, I think I'd
like to steal this thing.

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And he said I could hear
somebody laughing behind him

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:54.590 align:middle line:90%
telepathically.

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And I started to realize--
but unfortunately, I

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.202 align:middle line:84%
couldn't go back to the people
because once the story is out,

00:15:59.202 --> 00:16:01.670 align:middle line:84%
you can't go back because
the story is contaminated.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:03.320 align:middle line:84%
But I'd like to go--
have it gone back

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:06.410 align:middle line:84%
and asked the question before,
did you have people behind me?

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:07.797 align:middle line:90%
Could you see in 360 degrees?

00:16:07.797 --> 00:16:09.380 align:middle line:84%
As I was going along,
I started seeing

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.450 align:middle line:84%
more and more of these things
that-- oh, I heard that before.

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:12.930 align:middle line:90%
Somebody else talked about that.

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:14.960 align:middle line:84%
But as for the
craft, no, they're

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:16.120 align:middle line:90%
all different the beings.

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.120 align:middle line:90%
They were all different.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And there's another thing
that Lacatski pointed out

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:23.150 align:middle line:84%
in this official statement
that he's now putting out,

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:27.260 align:middle line:84%
was the fact that when they
looked at the OSAB database,

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.327 align:middle line:84%
he said it was like
driving down the freeway,

00:16:29.327 --> 00:16:30.785 align:middle line:84%
and every single
car was different.

00:16:30.785 --> 00:16:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me ask you
this, with DOPSA,

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:38.900 align:middle line:84%
which we're hearing more and
more about DOPSA approvals

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:43.100 align:middle line:84%
and reviews lately, DOPSA wasn't
something that we heard about

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:44.640 align:middle line:90%
10 years ago.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:49.190 align:middle line:84%
It seems like the
form of disclosure

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:53.540 align:middle line:84%
is happening with a
DOPSA arrangement.

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:58.010 align:middle line:84%
With that, do you
think that it's

00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:00.290 align:middle line:90%
being disguised as fiction?

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:01.850 align:middle line:90%
You can go ahead and say this.

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:03.570 align:middle line:90%
You can't state it as fact.

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:05.450 align:middle line:84%
If you write it as
science fiction,

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:08.960 align:middle line:84%
you can go ahead and do whatever
you would like with this.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.650 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think there are
so many DOPSA approvals now?

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:14.422 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I say it's
always been going on.

00:17:14.422 --> 00:17:16.130 align:middle line:84%
I've written two books
on the disclosure.

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And I've always said,
there's a gradual disclosure.

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:19.430 align:middle line:84%
People said, no, no,
no, this is all--

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:20.599 align:middle line:90%
it's all hoax hoax.

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:22.369 align:middle line:90%
And this is the real one.

00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:24.420 align:middle line:84%
Disney was given
stuff in the 1950s.

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:26.880 align:middle line:84%
He was asked to do an entry
for the US government.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And so he would have had
approval to get that.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:32.210 align:middle line:84%
Then you had Bob Emenegger gets
the Holloman Air Force Base

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:32.390 align:middle line:90%
film.

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:33.200 align:middle line:90%
And he had it in his hands.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.200 align:middle line:90%
I knew him very well.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.320 align:middle line:84%
They've still got it in private
hands, the Holloman Air--

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.070 align:middle line:84%
not the Holloman, but
they've got the film

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:40.010 align:middle line:84%
where the UFO is
launched from Vandenberg,

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:41.670 align:middle line:90%
and the UFO shoots it down.

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:43.640 align:middle line:84%
They've got that
film in a vault,

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.840 align:middle line:84%
and it's not in
government hands anymore.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.540 align:middle line:90%
And then you have Bill Moore.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.760 align:middle line:84%
Bill Moore, I knew Bill
Moore very well from LA.

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.050 align:middle line:90%
And he had 24 people.

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And Bill Moore had
big ego problem.

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:55.730 align:middle line:84%
He had all sorts of stuff, but
Bill Moore was a smart guy.

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And he had 24
people, and I believe

00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:57.890 align:middle line:90%
they were talking to him.

00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And they came, we're
here to help you.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:00.800 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
give you material.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:01.850 align:middle line:84%
Something's going
to be information.

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:03.140 align:middle line:84%
Something's going to
be disinformation.

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:04.040 align:middle line:90%
You've got to sort it out.

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And Bill Moore said,
yeah, I'm smart enough.

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:06.480 align:middle line:90%
I can figure that out.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.690 align:middle line:84%
So you've seen it over, and
then they come to Tom DeLonge.

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:10.610 align:middle line:84%
So people say, well, Tom
DeLonge figured this out.

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:12.080 align:middle line:84%
Tom DeLonge didn't
figure out anything.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:12.997 align:middle line:90%
The guy phoned him up.

00:18:12.997 --> 00:18:15.560 align:middle line:84%
He said, hey, we're having a
meeting here at Lockheed Skunk

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:16.610 align:middle line:90%
Works in the parking lot.

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to
come and introduce

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:19.370 align:middle line:90%
the president of the company?

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:21.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, yeah, if I can get
five minutes with them.

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And then he goes
and they take him

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.140 align:middle line:84%
inside the skiff,
the Lockheed skiff.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And then they say he's talking
to him, and he makes his pitch,

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.740 align:middle line:84%
and then they say,
introduce him to them.

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:31.020 align:middle line:90%
And he flies to Washington.

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.560 align:middle line:84%
He meets these two
guys in this room

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.260 align:middle line:84%
where they say stuff
like this does not

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.130 align:middle line:90%
happen at the White House.

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:36.630 align:middle line:84%
It does not happen
on Capitol Hill.

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:38.318 align:middle line:84%
It happens when a
couple of men like us

00:18:38.318 --> 00:18:40.110 align:middle line:84%
decide to move the
football down the field.

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:41.430 align:middle line:90%
They send it to NASA.

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:42.810 align:middle line:90%
NASA sends them to Ames.

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:45.120 align:middle line:84%
Then he gets-- he
meets the general.

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.810 align:middle line:84%
So those people are
all set up for them.

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:49.450 align:middle line:84%
So the government, they're doing
this gradual disclosure thing,

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:50.700 align:middle line:90%
but it all has to be approved.

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:51.930 align:middle line:90%
Same as Jim Semivan.

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:53.040 align:middle line:90%
Jim Semivan was the--

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.130 align:middle line:84%
I maintain was the guy behind
the New York Times release.

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:59.220 align:middle line:84%
I was told in 2016, he
was called the Big Man.

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:02.037 align:middle line:84%
Big Man said, a bunch of
people are going to go public.

00:19:02.037 --> 00:19:03.870 align:middle line:84%
They're going to say
UFOs exist, and they're

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:05.070 align:middle line:90%
going to force disclosure.

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And now, Jim Semivan
has gone on the record

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:09.180 align:middle line:84%
to say I went to all the
three letter agencies.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And I said to them we're
going to drop this thing.

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:12.840 align:middle line:90%
You guys can't do it.

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:13.860 align:middle line:90%
You've had your chance.

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.780 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to give
classified material.

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.072 align:middle line:90%
We're going to drop this thing.

00:19:17.072 --> 00:19:19.610 align:middle line:84%
Next thing you know, Leslie
Caine is flying to Washington,

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:22.390 align:middle line:84%
Hal Puthoff's is in the room,
Kit Green's in the room,

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:24.390 align:middle line:84%
Jim Semivan's in the room,
and there's Alexander

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:25.680 align:middle line:90%
with his back to the wall.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And the whole story of the A-TIP
thing in the New York Times

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:30.983 align:middle line:90%
story, that's when it came.

00:19:30.983 --> 00:19:32.400 align:middle line:84%
I knew this before
they were going

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.483 align:middle line:84%
to do it, that they were
going to drop this story,

00:19:34.483 --> 00:19:36.525 align:middle line:84%
and they were going to do
it with Hillary Clinton

00:19:36.525 --> 00:19:37.590 align:middle line:90%
and Podesta.

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And then Hillary lost,
and then I immediately

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:43.590 align:middle line:84%
phoned Chris Bledsoe who was
informing me of all this stuff.

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:44.923 align:middle line:90%
I said, so what's happening now?

00:19:44.923 --> 00:19:46.058 align:middle line:90%
He said, it's still a go.

00:19:46.058 --> 00:19:47.100 align:middle line:90%
It's still a green light.

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.240 align:middle line:90%
It's even bigger than before.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.448 align:middle line:90%
They're still going to do it.

00:19:49.448 --> 00:19:52.537 align:middle line:84%
So I knew before that they
were going to do this.

00:19:52.537 --> 00:19:54.120 align:middle line:84%
So I've always
maintained that there's

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.050 align:middle line:90%
this gradual disclosure.

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:57.467 align:middle line:84%
So now, they're doing it, but
they all say the same thing.

00:19:57.467 --> 00:19:58.680 align:middle line:90%
It has to be approved.

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.660 align:middle line:84%
If you remember Chase
Brandon back in 2002-

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:01.460 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Chase Brandon wrote the
book Cryptos Conundrum,

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:07.350 align:middle line:84%
which was supposedly the
story of how the CIA handled

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:08.430 align:middle line:90%
the Roswell crash.

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And he said it was reviewed
eight times by the CIA.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.960 align:middle line:84%
They reviewed the whole
thing, and they approved

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.190 align:middle line:90%
every word that went in there.

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:15.070 align:middle line:90%
And he said, if you want--

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:16.650 align:middle line:84%
>> They took stuff
out too as well.

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:17.858 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, they took stuff out.

00:20:17.858 --> 00:20:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And so he said, if you want
a good read, read the book.

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:23.850 align:middle line:84%
If you want to learn something,
read between the lines.

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
Lacatski has now said.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.467 align:middle line:84%
Kit Green says, read
between the lines.

00:20:28.467 --> 00:20:31.050 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of stuff in the
skid mark at the Pentagon book

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:32.100 align:middle line:90%
that nobody ever brought up.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.690 align:middle line:84%
They dropped it in the book,
and nobody ever picked up on it.

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:37.350 align:middle line:84%
He said-- Kit Green said
read between the lines.

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:41.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Jim Semivan is
very unique in that--

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:44.197 align:middle line:84%
I believe he's still
currently employed by the CIA.

00:20:44.197 --> 00:20:45.030 align:middle line:90%
I don't think he's--

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:45.240 align:middle line:90%
I don't think he's--

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.115 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, he said nobody's
ever looked at CIA.

00:20:47.115 --> 00:20:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and-- but to that
end, he's also an experiencer.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And so does he have
the motivation?

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.110 align:middle line:84%
Because of his direct
connection with the ET

00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:00.960 align:middle line:84%
and his belief in the
phenomenon and being

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:05.730 align:middle line:84%
able to force the
CIA into disclosure

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:08.460 align:middle line:84%
and then put together
this huge media project,

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.200 align:middle line:84%
because he is at
the center of all

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.560 align:middle line:84%
of this, the Central
Intelligence Agency

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:14.925 align:middle line:90%
but also an experiencer.

00:21:14.925 --> 00:21:16.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well,
that's what I say,

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:19.930 align:middle line:84%
is you look at it the other way,
is the intelligence doing this

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:20.730 align:middle line:90%
on purpose?

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:22.930 align:middle line:84%
Did they-- because people
will complain, oh, people

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:23.730 align:middle line:90%
are being abducted.

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:24.530 align:middle line:90%
This is terrible.

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And even Jim Semivan
says, I'm still upset.

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.140 align:middle line:84%
He said, after all
these years, I'm

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:29.250 align:middle line:90%
upset what they did to my wife.

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:30.708 align:middle line:84%
They didn't ask
approval and stuff.

00:21:30.708 --> 00:21:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And then he makes this
very unique statement.

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:35.130 align:middle line:84%
He says, they just
play around with you.

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:36.180 align:middle line:90%
They just drag you along.

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:37.680 align:middle line:84%
They tease you,
but they never take

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.847 align:middle line:90%
you home to meet the family.

00:21:38.847 --> 00:21:40.320 align:middle line:90%
And that's how it works.

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.990 align:middle line:84%
The phenomenon never shows
you what's actually going on.

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:44.820 align:middle line:84%
They're just moving you from
one door to the next door

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:46.450 align:middle line:84%
to the next door and
then moving along.

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And so for people who say,
oh, abduction is terrible,

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:51.990 align:middle line:84%
I say just remember one
thing if Jim Semivan had not

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:54.730 align:middle line:84%
had the experience,
abduction or not abduction

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:56.400 align:middle line:84%
with the beings in
his room, you never

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.650 align:middle line:90%
would have got the disclosure.

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:00.240 align:middle line:84%
It was Jim Semivan that did it
because he had the experience.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.550 align:middle line:90%
So Ramirez, the same thing.

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:03.780 align:middle line:90%
He's got an experiencer.

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:06.630 align:middle line:10%
You start seeing all
these sort of people.

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:08.070 align:middle line:90%
Nolan's an experiencer.

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:11.160 align:middle line:84%
Eric Davis had a sighting
the day he got his PhD.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.060 align:middle line:90%
He had the sighting.

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:13.410 align:middle line:90%
He's with the key guy.

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And you start looking,
and you start realizing

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:16.900 align:middle line:90%
they're probably all in fact--

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:18.720 align:middle line:84%
when they did the
remote viewing stuff,

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:21.588 align:middle line:84%
they brought in Jacques
Vallée to the remote viewing

00:22:21.588 --> 00:22:23.380 align:middle line:84%
in the 1970s to look
at all of these people

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.080 align:middle line:84%
because they all seem
to have UFO experiences.

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.740 align:middle line:84%
And you start realizing
it may be back,

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:28.510 align:middle line:84%
that this stuff is
being given to us,

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:30.095 align:middle line:90%
dropped piece by piece by piece.

00:22:30.095 --> 00:22:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And we think we're
putting it together,

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.678 align:middle line:84%
and we're actually being
led down a path, which

00:22:33.678 --> 00:22:36.010 align:middle line:84%
is my experience, my own
personal experience of 17

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:37.885 align:middle line:84%
books, is that I'm
being led down a path.

00:22:37.885 --> 00:22:39.760 align:middle line:84%
They give me this, and
then I think about it.

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, I get stuff,
people coming to me,

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:43.400 align:middle line:90%
and material coming to me.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think that to
me is how it works.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.350 align:middle line:84%
It's not these random
phenomena that we just

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:50.088 align:middle line:84%
happen to run across stuff,
that the phenomena is dropping

00:22:50.088 --> 00:22:51.505 align:middle line:84%
this stuff to
certain people and--

00:22:51.505 --> 00:22:53.800 align:middle line:84%
>> The synchronicities are
right there in front of us.

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:54.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:54.600 --> 00:23:00.020 align:middle line:84%
>> The 36 sky pilots, I'm
going to circle back to this,

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:01.550 align:middle line:90%
they live somewhere.

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:05.300 align:middle line:84%
They piloted these
craft somewhere.

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:11.010 align:middle line:84%
Was the location-- were
there similar locations?

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:12.390 align:middle line:90%
They were different.

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:14.420 align:middle line:84%
Some people would say at the
other side of the galaxy.

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:15.220 align:middle line:90%
John Ramirez--

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I mean where were the
craft when they went to go

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:18.350 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:20.183 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they all land
just up on the craft.

00:23:20.183 --> 00:23:23.360 align:middle line:84%
It's not like the
craft lands, and they

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.500 align:middle line:90%
get on the-- and maybe one.

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:25.640 align:middle line:84%
Chris Bledsoe had
that experience

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.960 align:middle line:90%
where he went on to the craft.

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.377 align:middle line:84%
But most of them, they just
suddenly they're on the craft,

00:23:29.377 --> 00:23:30.620 align:middle line:90%
or two women were tenting.

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And then they said, suddenly,
there's three women tenting.

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, two of them
are taken out of the tent,

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:35.360 align:middle line:90%
and they're up in this craft.

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:36.890 align:middle line:84%
These two women were
flying the craft.

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And the third woman
when they went back,

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.130 align:middle line:84%
they were furious, like
why didn't you wake us up?

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And they said we didn't have
any choice in this thing.

00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:42.410 align:middle line:90%
We were just taken up.

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:44.300 align:middle line:84%
So nobody ever recalls
going into the craft.

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:45.230 align:middle line:84%
They're just suddenly
in the craft.

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And most of these people did,
especially the guy the colonel

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:48.260 align:middle line:90%
guy.

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:49.860 align:middle line:84%
He just said, suddenly,
I'm on this craft.

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And there's somebody
behind me, and I don't

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.250 align:middle line:90%
know what's going on here.

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And there's no abduction
event, or he didn't even

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:56.480 align:middle line:90%
see any beings.

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.972 align:middle line:84%
He just had a voice
behind him that

00:23:57.972 --> 00:23:59.180 align:middle line:90%
was talking about this stuff.

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And John Ramirez
didn't have a craft.

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:02.193 align:middle line:90%
He goes to this ice planet.

00:24:02.193 --> 00:24:03.735 align:middle line:84%
And he said there's
not even a craft.

00:24:03.735 --> 00:24:06.240 align:middle line:90%
>> One last thing--

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:08.210 align:middle line:90%
fantastic conversation.

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:11.430 align:middle line:90%
I learn so much from you.

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:15.330 align:middle line:84%
You described placing
your hands down.

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:19.770 align:middle line:84%
Is that just establishing
the connection?

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:22.688 align:middle line:84%
Can you fly the craft
with your hands off?

00:24:22.688 --> 00:24:23.730 align:middle line:90%
You're just establishing-

00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:24.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, you make--

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:26.880 align:middle line:84%
>> An internet connection,
so to speak, right?

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:31.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Your modem is connected.

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And then after
that, you can just

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.590 align:middle line:90%
sit back and pilot the craft.

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:35.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Everyone describes
the same way.

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:37.123 align:middle line:90%
You make contact with the craft.

00:24:37.123 --> 00:24:39.990 align:middle line:84%
The craft is alive, and you
become one with the craft.

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:41.490 align:middle line:84%
You and the craft
are the same thing

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:42.660 align:middle line:90%
as soon as you touch the craft.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you
start getting people--

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:45.838 align:middle line:84%
like Chris Bledsoe
and a number of people

00:24:45.838 --> 00:24:47.010 align:middle line:90%
will say I know it's here.

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:49.830 align:middle line:84%
I had this one event,
a mission RAMA event

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:52.980 align:middle line:84%
with nine people inside
a portal levitated

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:55.430 align:middle line:84%
into the air with hundreds
or thousands of beings

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:56.230 align:middle line:90%
around them.

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:57.340 align:middle line:90%
And it was the same thing.

00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:58.860 align:middle line:84%
The one person
goes, they're here.

00:24:58.860 --> 00:24:59.160 align:middle line:90%
They're here.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And Chris Bledsoe would do
the same thing, they're here.

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.640 align:middle line:84%
When John Alexander had the
experience, they're here.

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.320 align:middle line:84%
John says, well, how do
you know they're here?

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.567 align:middle line:84%
I just know they're here,
because once you become one

00:25:06.567 --> 00:25:08.400 align:middle line:84%
with the craft, you
vibrated with the craft.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And when the vibration is
there, it's like they're here.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:10.890 align:middle line:90%
They're here.

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:12.310 align:middle line:84%
You can't see them,
and then boom,

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:14.170 align:middle line:90%
the UFO appears and takes off.

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:16.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you went to go
look for this portal at--

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:19.620 align:middle line:84%
>> I've got-- what I say is
when I look at the anti-gravity

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:21.073 align:middle line:90%
stuff, it never goes anywhere.

00:25:21.073 --> 00:25:23.490 align:middle line:84%
It always goes nowhere, but
every time it goes to portals,

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:26.070 align:middle line:84%
there's always something
at the other end.

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:27.900 align:middle line:84%
I think if they
have any technology,

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:29.490 align:middle line:84%
they understand the
portal technology,

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:31.050 align:middle line:84%
that this is what
this is based upon.

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:32.925 align:middle line:84%
That's how they're moving
in and out of here.

00:25:32.925 --> 00:25:35.850 align:middle line:84%
This is what the whole
thing has to be about.

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:39.340 align:middle line:84%
It has to be this consciousness
phenomena, which you see even

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:40.140 align:middle line:90%
in science.

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:43.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you go back 20
years, you could not even

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:45.360 align:middle line:90%
talk about science and academia.

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.160 align:middle line:90%
There's no way.

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:49.320 align:middle line:84%
They would not allow you to do
a PhD on consciousness stuff.

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's all the big
rage, and you're talking

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:53.940 align:middle line:90%
about simulated universe.

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Even John Wheeler, the guy that
invented the term black hole,

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:00.480 align:middle line:84%
wormholes theory, said
I would not be surprised

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.070 align:middle line:84%
if the entire
universe turned out

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:05.100 align:middle line:84%
to be a figment of the
imagination and this whole idea

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:08.010 align:middle line:84%
that this all may be
simulated reality,

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:10.050 align:middle line:90%
that it's like a 3D hologram.

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And the phenomena is taking
us through these steps.

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:14.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's shattering
your naive reality.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.540 align:middle line:90%
You say everything's solid.

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:16.020 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not.

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And they show you something,
and you go, oh, that's wow.

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And then you get
down the rabbit hole.

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
learning more and more--

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:23.130 align:middle line:90%
the world isn't flat.

00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:24.630 align:middle line:84%
The sun doesn't go
around the Earth.

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:26.220 align:middle line:90%
It's not solid.

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And physical things
aren't totally physical,

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:31.500 align:middle line:84%
and that there are
psychic phenomena events.

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:32.070 align:middle line:90%
That's what they're doing.

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:33.820 align:middle line:84%
They're gradually
moving us down the road.

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:35.423 align:middle line:90%
And it's all about learning.

00:26:35.423 --> 00:26:36.840 align:middle line:84%
It's not about
getting to the end.

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:37.930 align:middle line:84%
Everybody wants
to get to the end.

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:40.110 align:middle line:84%
Give me the thing tomorrow,
because for most people

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:42.000 align:middle line:84%
in ufology, it's all
about experience.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.640 align:middle line:84%
It's like Santa Claus
and candy floss.

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.140 align:middle line:84%
Just give us--
we've got two cars.

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:47.890 align:middle line:84%
We've got a house, all
that kind of stuff.

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:49.890 align:middle line:90%
And for them, it's learning.

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:52.230 align:middle line:84%
They're taking us down a
road, and they're gradually

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:53.820 align:middle line:90%
dropping these events.

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:55.620 align:middle line:90%
And it gets more complex.

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And they just do
different things.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:00.090 align:middle line:84%
So they do ground traces, which
haven't happened for 25 years.

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And then they suddenly
started doing crop circles.

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes from
crafts with windows

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:05.850 align:middle line:90%
to crafts with no windows.

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:06.660 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's orbs.

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like they're
turning the page about,

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.623 align:middle line:84%
oh, let's do something
different here.

00:27:09.623 --> 00:27:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And people are just chasing this
phenomena, but as we go along,

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:13.788 align:middle line:84%
more and more people
are going down

00:27:13.788 --> 00:27:16.770 align:middle line:84%
the rabbit hole, high-level
people who are experiencers.

00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:18.450 align:middle line:90%
And they're coming forward.

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:20.610 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the one
thing about this, Josh.

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:24.570 align:middle line:84%
It's the government
insiders and experiencers

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:25.680 align:middle line:90%
all rolled into one.

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's something
that's blowing my mind today.

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.190 align:middle line:84%
Like why is it-- why are so
many of these government people

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:31.357 align:middle line:84%
experiencers, and how is
that related to disclosure?

00:27:31.357 --> 00:27:32.560 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, what I would say--

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.350 align:middle line:10%
the way I look at
the world, and this

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:37.380 align:middle line:10%
is my own personal
view, is that if you

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:39.480 align:middle line:10%
look at Sherri Wilde who said--

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:42.488 align:middle line:10%
she wrote the book called The
Forgotten Promise, that if you

00:27:42.488 --> 00:27:45.030 align:middle line:10%
talk to experiencer and you say,
hey, have you got a mission?

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:46.488 align:middle line:10%
Do you believe
you're on a mission?

00:27:46.488 --> 00:27:47.677 align:middle line:90%
They go, yeah.

00:27:47.677 --> 00:27:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And they'll tell you what it
is for an hour or two hours

00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:51.672 align:middle line:84%
or whatever or
they'll say, yeah,

00:27:51.672 --> 00:27:53.130 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not really
sure what it is.

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's the whole thing,
is this really random,

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:57.750 align:middle line:84%
that people are just randomly
getting picked or people

00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:59.430 align:middle line:84%
agreeing to this,
that people are--

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:02.662 align:middle line:84%
so I would say that
the people are coming,

00:28:02.662 --> 00:28:04.370 align:middle line:84%
they are volunteering
for different jobs.

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:07.045 align:middle line:84%
And now, you're starting to see
these very high-level people.

00:28:07.045 --> 00:28:08.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
a random experience.

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:10.740 align:middle line:84%
I think these people
have agreed to this.

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way
it's unraveling.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's
anything random.

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And they need these
high-level people maybe

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:20.700 align:middle line:84%
because we appreciate high-level
people, and people will listen.

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:24.720 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if you and I say it,
they go, yeah, who cares?

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.280 align:middle line:84%
That's why you experiencers
don't really get any attention.

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:28.770 align:middle line:84%
It's because they say
it's somebody's story.

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:29.830 align:middle line:90%
Who cares about the story?

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:middle line:90%
What does the government say?

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And when is the government
going to disclose?

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:33.692 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- you
start seeing that now.

00:28:33.692 --> 00:28:35.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that's
a random experience.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.930 align:middle line:90%
I think that's part of the plan.

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:38.340 align:middle line:90%
>> The phenomenon is real.

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:40.725 align:middle line:84%
We just don't have the
words to describe it.

00:28:40.725 --> 00:28:41.850 align:middle line:90%
It's not in our vocabulary.

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And I had the experience
with Barbra Streisand's stepson,

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:46.380 align:middle line:90%
Chris Peters.

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:47.755 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
you ever met him.

00:28:47.755 --> 00:28:50.098 align:middle line:84%
But Chris Peters said-- he
is a full-blown experiencer.

00:28:50.098 --> 00:28:51.640 align:middle line:84%
He said when they
talked to him, they

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:54.160 align:middle line:84%
said when we come into your
world, we go into your head,

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.570 align:middle line:90%
and we see what's in your head.

00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we use to
build a lesson for you.

00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.390 align:middle line:90%
We have no other choice.

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:00.473 align:middle line:90%
That's what they told him.

00:29:00.473 --> 00:29:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And that makes sense, is that
if you're-- so if you're in a

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:05.195 align:middle line:84%
Middle East culture, you're
going to see different.

00:29:05.195 --> 00:29:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Or when George Knapp
went to Russia,

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:09.070 align:middle line:84%
and he looked at the
Russian psychic people

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:10.240 align:middle line:84%
were talking to
aliens, and he said

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.800 align:middle line:84%
the aliens were totally
different than the aliens we're

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.090 align:middle line:90%
talking to.

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:15.110 align:middle line:84%
So we got to realize
we're part of the thing.

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:17.290 align:middle line:84%
If it's all one thing
and if it's all a verb,

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:19.720 align:middle line:84%
it's all alive, we're all
connected to the same thing.

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:21.040 align:middle line:90%
We just believe we're separate.

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And this sort of thing, the
new concept is all connected

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:25.690 align:middle line:90%
and that they will--

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:27.080 align:middle line:90%
you're part of the experience.

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.840 align:middle line:84%
So if you see a
certain type of alien,

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:31.090 align:middle line:84%
you may be seeing certain
things or crafts--

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:34.720 align:middle line:84%
even my own experience
with crafts in 1975 was--

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.490 align:middle line:84%
on two occasions,
the craft changed.

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:38.482 align:middle line:84%
It was one object when
it was on the horizon.

00:29:38.482 --> 00:29:40.690 align:middle line:84%
As it came closer, it turned
into a different object,

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:42.280 align:middle line:84%
that they can morph
into whatever they want.

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.090 align:middle line:90%
They can appear--

00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:44.802 align:middle line:90%
Or we are seeing it differently.

00:29:44.802 --> 00:29:46.010 align:middle line:90%
We're part of the experience.

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:47.593 align:middle line:84%
We always want to
believe that there's

00:29:47.593 --> 00:29:48.770 align:middle line:90%
them doing something to us.

00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And I think what we're
starting to realize now is

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.360 align:middle line:90%
we are part of-- it's a verb.

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:56.050 align:middle line:84%
We're part of this whole
thing that's all alive.

00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:58.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Grant, thank you so much.

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:01.570 align:middle line:84%
Great conversation,
but it makes me

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:08.560 align:middle line:84%
wonder what ET would see when
they go into Josh's brain.

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:11.470 align:middle line:84%
For Into The Vortex and
Josh, I'm Jimmy Church.

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:12.940 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Grant Cameron.

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:15.450 align:middle line:90%
We'll see you next time.

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:19.000 align:middle line:90%
