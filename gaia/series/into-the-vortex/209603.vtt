>> I'm radio and television
host, Jimmy Church,

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.079 align:middle line:84%
and I'm here to uncover
the truth about some

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.120 align:middle line:90%
of life's biggest mysteries.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.690 align:middle line:84%
If this is revealed,
everything has to be rewritten.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.590 align:middle line:84%
My guest today is Timothy Hogan,
Grand Master of the Knights

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Templar, and an expert on the
esoteric history of humankind.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>> It was probably broadcasting
this energy all around

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.080 align:middle line:90%
the planet.

>> Technical assistant, Josh--

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.260 align:middle line:90%
Josh, can you pull up the map?

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.500 align:middle line:10%
>> --also joins us to
help set the scenes.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.580 align:middle line:84%
Join us as we deep dive to
get to the bottom of some

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.240 align:middle line:84%
of the most intriguing
questions of our time.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Have you seen the
Ark of the Covenant?

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.960 align:middle line:90%

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.270 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "Into the Vortex."

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Jimmy Church.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And today, we're
going to jump into one

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.030 align:middle line:84%
of the most
controversial subjects

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.730 align:middle line:84%
for this community, which
is the Knights Templar.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And our guest today is
Timothy Hogan, Grandmaster

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.970 align:middle line:90%
of the Knights Templar.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And being able to go
directly to the source

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.010 align:middle line:84%
for this information,
it's not only

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.290 align:middle line:84%
important for the community,
but it's very important to me.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.163 align:middle line:84%
And I'm pretty
excited about this.

00:01:31.163 --> 00:01:32.580 align:middle line:84%
Josh, you ready
to get this going?

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I'm excited.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm fascinated with
the Knights Templar,

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.750 align:middle line:84%
and I'm excited to
continue my education.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.125 align:middle line:84%
You're the right
man for the job.

00:01:38.125 --> 00:01:39.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome Timothy.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And we need to really
just jump straight

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.800 align:middle line:84%
into this, and the
most important question

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.460 align:middle line:84%
to start this off is what is
the true origins of the Knights

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.260 align:middle line:90%
Templar?

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, most historians will
say the Knights Templar were

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.030 align:middle line:90%
founded in 1118.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.350 align:middle line:10%
Actually, the order was
started as early as 1096,

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.230 align:middle line:10%
and it took a while before
they got involved in Jerusalem.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.510 align:middle line:10%
And they were doing stuff
prior to the Roman Catholic

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.410 align:middle line:10%
patronage, which
existed for a while

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.470 align:middle line:10%
until it was removed in 1307.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we have the historical
side that we're all taught

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.350 align:middle line:84%
and the dogma that has been
established since then that

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.160 align:middle line:84%
they were there to escort
the Crusades and to defend

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.500 align:middle line:84%
the Crusades and have a military
presence there in Jerusalem.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.880 align:middle line:84%
But then we have
the other story,

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.030 align:middle line:90%
which is they were digging.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.990 align:middle line:90%
They were searching.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.555 align:middle line:84%
They were looking for
artifacts and texts

00:02:46.555 --> 00:02:51.550 align:middle line:84%
and some things may have been
spirited out of Jerusalem.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.774 align:middle line:84%
How can we address that from
a historical perspective?

00:02:55.774 --> 00:02:57.430 align:middle line:90%
Were they searching for things?

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.720 align:middle line:84%
>> They were definitely
searching for things.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, but
there was a belief,

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.530 align:middle line:84%
a definite belief, that there
was a primordial tradition that

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.230 align:middle line:84%
had existed prior to a deluge,
which we would refer to it,

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.580 align:middle line:90%
Atlantis.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And that when it
collapsed, there

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.260 align:middle line:84%
were pockets that had spread
out to different parts

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.060 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.220 align:middle line:84%
So they were trying to seek
out these different pockets

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.830 align:middle line:84%
to obtain what these
pockets were preserving

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.645 align:middle line:84%
and then also to dig in areas
that they absolutely knew

00:03:37.645 --> 00:03:39.132 align:middle line:90%
there were things to be found.

00:03:39.132 --> 00:03:40.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me stop you
right there, if I may.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.330 align:middle line:90%
>> You used the A word.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.950 align:middle line:90%
You just said "Atlantis."

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And most haven't connected
the Templars with Atlantis.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And when you say
something like that, what

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.350 align:middle line:90%
are you actually trying to say?

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.400 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, they started
out looking at the Torah

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.760 align:middle line:84%
and the Old Testament
and the stories of Noah.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, here's
this story of there

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.540 align:middle line:84%
was this cataclysm
that occurred,

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.640 align:middle line:84%
where there was
this massive flood.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And they had connections with
groups in the Middle East,

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.270 align:middle line:84%
particularly groups
like the Druze

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.950 align:middle line:84%
and the Sabians and others, who
were preserving and translating

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.650 align:middle line:84%
texts that alluded to these
earlier civilizations,

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.290 align:middle line:90%
including Greek and Roman texts.

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.530 align:middle line:84%
So they had exposure
to the works of Plato

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.060 align:middle line:84%
and others, which talked
about this pre-civilization.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.850 align:middle line:84%
So they wanted to
find out, OK, where's

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.180 align:middle line:84%
the technology from
this pre-civilization?

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Where is the philosophy
from this pre-civilization?

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.932 align:middle line:84%
What was their
religious beliefs?

00:04:47.932 --> 00:04:50.110 align:middle line:90%
What has been preserved from it?

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.690 align:middle line:84%
So that they could bring
it back into Europe

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.880 align:middle line:84%
and get Europe out
of the Dark Ages.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.345 align:middle line:84%
>> Did they understand
what they were discovering?

00:04:58.345 --> 00:05:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And how did they
translate that knowledge

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.000 align:middle line:84%
into something that not
only that could be applied

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.520 align:middle line:84%
to their mission and
what they were doing

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.570 align:middle line:84%
but how do you understand
a high-technology culture

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.110 align:middle line:90%
from Atlantis to their period?

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.400 align:middle line:10%
>> There were allusions to
technology within the Bible

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.910 align:middle line:10%
itself, and that's what
they were primarily looking

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:21.710 align:middle line:10%
at, at the time.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.460 align:middle line:84%
There weren't a whole
lot of books around,

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.870 align:middle line:84%
and so there were allusions,
particularly within the Torah,

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.150 align:middle line:84%
talking about the Ark
of the Covenant, which

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.320 align:middle line:84%
was this device that could
do all these crazy things.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And if people touched it, they
would be electrocuted to death,

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.720 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And they were working with
people like Rashi of Troyes,

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:50.290 align:middle line:84%
in France, who was a good friend
of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux,

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.920 align:middle line:84%
who wrote the rule
for the Templars.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:06:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And they were passing on a
knowledge and a history of hey,

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.310 align:middle line:84%
there are these
artifacts, and they

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.560 align:middle line:90%
are buried at certain areas.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
you can find them.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:09.460 align:middle line:90%
So go down and get them.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.300 align:middle line:90%
>> What did they find?

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So in their
archaeological digging,

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.060 align:middle line:90%
they found a number of things.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.380 align:middle line:84%
They did find a series
of boxes, or arks,

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.690 align:middle line:84%
which had also been incorporated
on the Egyptian temple walls.

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.490 align:middle line:90%
They discovered substances of--

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.170 align:middle line:84%
strange, mysterious substances
is how they described it,

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.780 align:middle line:90%
which we would call manna.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:38.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Manna from heaven?

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Like manna from heaven, yeah.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.240 align:middle line:84%
But it was a substance
that they learned that they

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.830 align:middle line:90%
could manufacture alchemically.

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.770 align:middle line:84%
So they discovered these
lost arts and sciences.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:57.670 align:middle line:84%
They also discovered tombs
of a number of holy people,

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.980 align:middle line:84%
that they discovered
their bones.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:04.015 align:middle line:84%
And they collected them
and brought them back.

00:07:04.015 --> 00:07:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And some of this
was a real problem,

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:10.060 align:middle line:84%
because it was contrary
to the narrative

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.970 align:middle line:84%
that the church was
perpetuating at the time.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:16.870 align:middle line:84%
But it was completely in
line with their own beliefs.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.620 align:middle line:84%
They tended to be more of
a Gnostic persuasion, which

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:25.630 align:middle line:84%
was they believed that anybody,
through their own efforts,

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:29.210 align:middle line:84%
could attain a direct
knowledge of the divine.

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.960 align:middle line:84%
They didn't need
a priest to do it.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Let me jump in right there.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:39.310 align:middle line:84%
Josh, pull up the
cartouche, because people

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:40.495 align:middle line:90%
ask about evidence.

00:07:40.495 --> 00:07:43.570 align:middle line:84%
You know, OK, these are
extraordinary claims,

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:45.880 align:middle line:90%
but how can you back this up?

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to look
at-- this is from Egypt.

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And I call this a
cartouche, but this

00:07:53.320 --> 00:08:00.310 align:middle line:84%
appears to be a cartouche
with an ark represented there.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:01.600 align:middle line:90%
Is this what I'm looking at?

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.517 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's right.

00:08:02.517 --> 00:08:06.410 align:middle line:84%
It's an ark box, and it's
levitating off the ground,

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:07.750 align:middle line:90%
it should be pointed out.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.910 align:middle line:10%
And that cartouche-thing
that you're talking about

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:11.210 align:middle line:10%
is actually a field.

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:13.120 align:middle line:10%
It's like an
electric field that's

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.660 align:middle line:10%
around it that's attached to a--

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:20.830 align:middle line:10%
it's like a rope that
the pharaoh on the left

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:23.570 align:middle line:10%
is holding it to control it.

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:26.140 align:middle line:84%
This is an example of
one of these boxes,

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:29.355 align:middle line:84%
and you can find them
all over the place.

00:08:29.355 --> 00:08:33.370 align:middle line:10%
This particular one was at Edfu,
where there's the Edfu building

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:35.559 align:middle line:10%
texts that also talk about--

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:39.767 align:middle line:10%
>> Probably the most historic,
important text on planet Earth,

00:08:39.767 --> 00:08:40.600 align:middle line:10%
right there in Edfu.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.100 align:middle line:90%
>> For sure.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:48.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Here, the reason why I bring
up the cartouche symbology is

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.600 align:middle line:10%
the Egyptians, when they
represented something inside

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:58.420 align:middle line:10%
of this shape, the cartouche
shape, it suggests nobility.

00:08:58.420 --> 00:08:59.980 align:middle line:90%
It's related to the pharaoh.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.690 align:middle line:90%
It's extremely important.

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:08.776 align:middle line:84%
And so to have something
like an ark represented here,

00:09:08.776 --> 00:09:10.540 align:middle line:90%
it's huge to them.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:14.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, it is my understanding,
it is my belief and certainly

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:17.980 align:middle line:10%
the belief of others, that
what they were talking--

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:22.330 align:middle line:10%
they discovered these boxes
were basically like capacitors.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:25.870 align:middle line:84%
They could build up large
amounts of electricity

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:28.060 align:middle line:90%
that would discharge.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:31.000 align:middle line:10%
And if you didn't
handle them properly,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.440 align:middle line:10%
they could shock you to death.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think this is the
Ark, the Ark of the Covenant?

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, according to
our Templar tradition,

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:40.840 align:middle line:84%
there were actually
multiple arks.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.980 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, Josh.

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:43.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>> This next image that Josh
has, I think, is extraordinary,

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:50.530 align:middle line:84%
because this, I think,
represents exactly what

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:51.850 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about.

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:55.600 align:middle line:84%
Because here it looks
like we've got four.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, this is at Dendera.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:00.220 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there's four
arks there, and you

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:03.460 align:middle line:84%
can see they're issuing
forth the electricity out

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:05.660 align:middle line:90%
of the tops of them.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:08.110 align:middle line:84%
There were multiple
arks, I think,

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:11.140 align:middle line:84%
that were being
used around Egypt.

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:15.910 align:middle line:10%
Certainly, one of them
ended up becoming the Ark

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:18.700 align:middle line:10%
within the Hebrew tradition.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:23.290 align:middle line:10%
Some have even speculated
that maybe the reason why

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:26.230 align:middle line:10%
the pharaoh was
even chasing Moses

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:29.800 align:middle line:10%
was because he had stolen one
of these arks out of Egypt.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's what he was
really trying to get.

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:35.866 align:middle line:90%


00:10:35.866 --> 00:10:38.830 align:middle line:84%
But we find them on the temple
walls all over the place.

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And usually, associated
with this ark,

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:46.330 align:middle line:84%
you also find these depictions
of these conical white cakes

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:51.550 align:middle line:84%
or these mounds of what
would be manna, described

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:53.440 align:middle line:90%
as manna in the Bible.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.920 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm going to
swing back to that.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:02.870 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that these
arks, or one of them,

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:07.580 align:middle line:84%
made it out of Egypt and
Jerusalem and back into Europe

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.440 align:middle line:90%
by the Knights Templar.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, according
to our records,

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:16.610 align:middle line:84%
we actually recovered six
arks that we brought back

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:21.500 align:middle line:84%
into Europe, via
through Portugal, well,

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.510 align:middle line:90%
through Lebanon.

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:27.080 align:middle line:84%
There's a site called
the Tomb of Hiram,

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.210 align:middle line:90%
which you can find in Lebanon.

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually
not a tomb at all.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.610 align:middle line:84%
It was just a vault, where
these things were held.

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.590 align:middle line:84%
It was there for
a while before it

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:42.050 align:middle line:84%
would move to Portugal, and
then from there, up to Scotland.

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And then from Scotland,
they were brought over here

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:45.890 align:middle line:90%
to the New World.

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:46.922 align:middle line:90%
>> To the United States.

00:11:46.922 --> 00:11:48.005 align:middle line:90%
So there's a possibility--

00:11:48.005 --> 00:11:50.510 align:middle line:84%
>> What was to become
the United States, yeah.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh if we found an Ark of
the Covenant here in the United

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:58.040 align:middle line:90%
States, what would you say?

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>> My mind would be blown,
and I wouldn't be able to stop

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.700 align:middle line:84%
talking about it
for a long time.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.560 align:middle line:84%
The fact there's four arks
is the first time I've ever

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:04.070 align:middle line:90%
heard that.

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:05.862 align:middle line:84%
And the fact they could
be around the world

00:12:05.862 --> 00:12:07.880 align:middle line:84%
is super compelling
and fascinating to me.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>> This would truly
rewrite history

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, for sure.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I want your reaction
to this, too, as well.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:18.500 align:middle line:90%
Here, you brought up manna.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:22.670 align:middle line:90%
So here is a manna jar.

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And now, when we see
something like this,

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.910 align:middle line:84%
again, I always go
back to the evidence

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:33.020 align:middle line:84%
and the science that supports
some of these discussions.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.280 align:middle line:90%
And what is going on here?

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.120 align:middle line:84%
>> What we have here, at the
bottom of this jar is this

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.410 align:middle line:90%
white powder that's manna.

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:44.390 align:middle line:90%
It's the traditional manna.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:47.180 align:middle line:90%
You can see it kind of--

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:53.900 align:middle line:84%
when it forms, it forms like
this conical shape, this mound,

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:55.790 align:middle line:90%
at the bottom of the jar.

00:12:55.790 --> 00:13:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And this substance, beyond
being something that's healing,

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:02.330 align:middle line:90%
it's also super conductive.

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:05.240 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine,
if you consider

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:09.110 align:middle line:84%
the stories of the Ark,
the Ark was actually

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:11.420 align:middle line:90%
created to hold the manna.

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And then Solomon's Temple
was created to hold the Ark.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.620 align:middle line:84%
So the entire purpose
for Solomon's Temple

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:21.470 align:middle line:90%
was to hold this manna.

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:23.000 align:middle line:90%
The manna went in the Ark.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.950 align:middle line:90%
The Ark went in the temple.

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And this manna, being a super
conductive substance, when

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:32.000 align:middle line:84%
it was put inside
the Ark, and the Ark

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.280 align:middle line:90%
was basically like a capacitor.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.300 align:middle line:90%
>> An energy source.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:38.690 align:middle line:84%
>> An energy source-- it just
issued a tremendous amount

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:39.835 align:middle line:90%
of electricity.

00:13:39.835 --> 00:13:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
reason why nobody

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:42.980 align:middle line:90%
could touch it without dying.

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.602 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is a
manufacturing process,

00:13:45.602 --> 00:13:46.810 align:middle line:90%
and this is how this is done.

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:48.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, and this is it, yeah.

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so again, it's back to
the evidence into deep history,

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:57.870 align:middle line:84%
and when we mention the
manufacturing of this,

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:02.090 align:middle line:84%
of the manna in the jar, there's
a cone shape at the bottom,

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:04.010 align:middle line:90%
but I think it's represented--

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:08.100 align:middle line:84%
Josh, if you could,
pull up this image here.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.410 align:middle line:84%
Is that what we're
seeing here, Tim?

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, that's exactly
what you're seeing.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.240 align:middle line:10%
So as you see, the figure
who represents Osiris

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.660 align:middle line:10%
is holding this
cone-shaped bread,

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:22.350 align:middle line:10%
and he's handing it to the
guy that has the heaven

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:24.570 align:middle line:10%
plumes of Aman on his head.

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:27.220 align:middle line:10%
And he's offering it to him.

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
it's that cone shape

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:33.150 align:middle line:84%
is because that's how it
forms when you go to make it.

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:36.015 align:middle line:84%
>> And there's a lot of
excitement in that image too,

00:14:36.015 --> 00:14:36.815 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:14:36.815 --> 00:14:37.800 align:middle line:90%
>> He's very excited.

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:38.625 align:middle line:90%


00:14:38.625 --> 00:14:41.324 align:middle line:90%
>> What is inside of the Ark?

00:14:41.324 --> 00:14:44.610 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned that possibly
the manna manufacturing

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:47.250 align:middle line:84%
process is happening
there, but it's

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:49.500 align:middle line:84%
like the biggest
mystery in history.

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.090 align:middle line:90%
What is inside of the Ark?

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:55.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, traditionally,
they said that the tablets,

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:58.920 align:middle line:84%
what we would now know is the
tablets of the Commandments,

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:03.510 align:middle line:84%
were put inside the ark, as
well as a pot of manna is how

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:05.340 align:middle line:90%
it's described.

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:09.090 align:middle line:84%
It should be pointed out
that Moses had both the Ten

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:12.600 align:middle line:84%
Commandments and then he also
had these tablets of testimony.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And according to
alchemical traditions,

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:19.290 align:middle line:84%
this Tablet of Testimony was
actually this Emerald Tablet.

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:22.920 align:middle line:84%
But these things were
put inside of the ark.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:27.090 align:middle line:84%
From a power
standpoint, that manna

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:29.730 align:middle line:84%
is really a
superconductive substance.

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:32.040 align:middle line:84%
So when you put a super
conductive substance

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:35.040 align:middle line:84%
inside a capacitor,
like the ark,

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:39.090 align:middle line:84%
it just causes it to produce an
immense amount of electricity

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:41.310 align:middle line:90%
that it just broadcasts out.

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:44.340 align:middle line:84%
>> I've got a couple of other
images here that, to me,

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:46.680 align:middle line:90%
represent a vessel.

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:48.210 align:middle line:90%
I see a vessel here.

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:53.775 align:middle line:84%
And we just looked at a manna
jar, and I see the connection.

00:15:53.775 --> 00:15:55.050 align:middle line:90%
Is that what's happening?

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:56.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, so what we have here--

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:59.310 align:middle line:90%
so this is at Amien's Cathedral.

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:01.290 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
that the Templars did

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:03.090 align:middle line:84%
when they came back
to Europe is they

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:07.620 align:middle line:84%
were responsible for building
the first cathedrals of France.

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And inside these cathedrals,
they put all kinds of imagery.

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:14.370 align:middle line:84%
Most people think of
just biblical scenes,

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:18.690 align:middle line:84%
but they also depicted
alchemical processes

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:21.090 align:middle line:90%
for manufacturing this manna.

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:23.370 align:middle line:90%
And this is one example of that.

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:27.030 align:middle line:84%
You see the figure holding
what's called an athanor oven.

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:29.070 align:middle line:84%
It's an alchemical
oven, and they're

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:32.400 align:middle line:84%
pulling a salamander
out of the bottom of it.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And what they're
really depicting

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:37.890 align:middle line:84%
is in the language, the
alchemical language,

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:39.480 align:middle line:90%
a salamander--

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:44.490 align:middle line:84%
they didn't actually believe
that lizards lived in ovens,

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:48.150 align:middle line:84%
but they knew that you could
break down the word salamander

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:51.510 align:middle line:84%
into the words
"sal" and "mandra,"

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:54.270 align:middle line:84%
which meant--
"sal" meant "salt,"

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:56.460 align:middle line:90%
And "mandra" meant "stable."

00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:01.680 align:middle line:84%
So what they were saying is you
could extract the stable salts

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.710 align:middle line:84%
out of the oven after
you've calcinated down

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:06.944 align:middle line:90%
all the other materials.

00:17:06.944 --> 00:17:08.819 align:middle line:84%
And so this is what
they're trying to depict.

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>> In this next image, where,
apparently we're seeing

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:17.190 align:middle line:84%
the exact same thing, and if
somebody's walking past this

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:20.410 align:middle line:84%
cathedral and they see this,
they would not make these

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:21.210 align:middle line:90%
connections.

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:23.220 align:middle line:84%
But the symbolism is
right there, correct?

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:25.329 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, yeah, and
this is another one.

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:28.200 align:middle line:90%
This is at Amboise.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:32.340 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, they're depicting
the exact same thing.

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And these secret salts,
these stable salts

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.970 align:middle line:84%
that they are extracting
out is the manna.

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:42.630 align:middle line:84%
This is the manna that
they have to calcinate down

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:44.717 align:middle line:90%
to the vegetable matter.

00:17:44.717 --> 00:17:46.800 align:middle line:84%
In fact, for that matter,
this is the whole reason

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:51.000 align:middle line:84%
why Moses witnessed
God as a burning bush,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.540 align:middle line:84%
because you have to
calcinate down the material,

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.940 align:middle line:84%
and then you can extract
the manna out of it.

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And this is what's
being depicted.

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>> So if I'm understanding
correctly, so let's back up.

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:06.590 align:middle line:84%
We have this representation
now in Europe

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:11.120 align:middle line:84%
that was brought to Europe,
the alchemical traditions,

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:14.930 align:middle line:84%
from Jerusalem by the
Knights Templar, who

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:17.780 align:middle line:90%
discovered this in Jerusalem.

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is evidence
of these alchemical

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:25.830 align:middle line:84%
and high-tech traditions
that go back to Atlantis.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:26.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:30.110 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and that they were
also being preserved in Egypt

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:33.015 align:middle line:90%
after the collapse of Atlantis.

00:18:33.015 --> 00:18:37.190 align:middle line:84%
The story is Egypt was one of
the centers of preservation.

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, OK, so you
brought up Edfu.

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:43.430 align:middle line:84%
So in the Edfu text
and that history

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:49.880 align:middle line:84%
certainly points back to the
origins coming from Atlantis.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:54.530 align:middle line:84%
The same catastrophe is
represented there in Edfu.

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And that is a direct
Atlantean connection,

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.750 align:middle line:84%
which again, goes
back to Jerusalem

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:03.530 align:middle line:84%
to the Knights Templar,
back to Europe and possibly

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:04.550 align:middle line:90%
to the United States.

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:05.720 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly right.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.210 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's
exactly how it goes.

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:12.156 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there stuff here
in the United States?

00:19:12.156 --> 00:19:14.160 align:middle line:90%
>> There is.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.560 align:middle line:84%
There are vaults here,
in the United States,

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:22.680 align:middle line:84%
that had been brought over as
early as the 1200s, is when--

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.820 align:middle line:84%
the Templars, they would leave
their port in La Rochelle,

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:30.030 align:middle line:90%
in France, and in Portugal.

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:34.170 align:middle line:84%
And they would bring the stuff
over here to the New Land.

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:43.980 align:middle line:84%
They had the entire North
America mapped by the 1350s.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.980 align:middle line:84%
But they had been coming
over here since the 1200s.

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:48.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Why North America?

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:50.400 align:middle line:84%
To keep things
safe, I would think?

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, they were trying
to create a new Jerusalem.

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:57.120 align:middle line:84%
They recognized that
Europe was completely

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.910 align:middle line:90%
controlled and dominated by--

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:03.210 align:middle line:84%
between the Roman church
and the monarchies.

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:05.190 align:middle line:84%
They were controlling
everything,

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:06.780 align:middle line:90%
and people had no freedoms.

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:09.300 align:middle line:84%
No freedom of thought,
no freedom of religion,

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:11.970 align:middle line:84%
no freedom of assembly,
all the things

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:16.290 align:middle line:84%
that we take for granted
now, as Americans.

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:18.430 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have those things.

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:19.770 align:middle line:90%
So they came to the New World.

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:23.280 align:middle line:84%
They established connections
with the natives here,

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:27.240 align:middle line:84%
and they brought
these artifacts over.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And then they set
up a new system

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.020 align:middle line:84%
so that these things
could be preserved.

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Will this
eventually be revealed?

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:38.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And the reason why
I ask that is history,

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:45.030 align:middle line:84%
the way that it exists today,
nobody wants to change that.

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And the reveal of the Knights
Templar understanding,

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:55.140 align:middle line:84%
occupying, mapping,
and spiriting artifacts

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.900 align:middle line:84%
and important relics
into the United States

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:01.770 align:middle line:84%
and stashing them in these
vaults, if this is revealed,

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:03.810 align:middle line:90%
everything has to be rewritten.

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:05.130 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true, yeah.

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:10.260 align:middle line:84%
But it's the history, I
mean, there were things,

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:14.430 align:middle line:84%
and especially, I know you've
talked with Scott Wolter

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:15.270 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:17.460 align:middle line:10%
But his work with the
Kensington Runestone.

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:21.370 align:middle line:10%
That Runestone was a land
claim for North America

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:22.170 align:middle line:10%
that was created.

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And it was placed right in
the center of North America

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:28.620 align:middle line:84%
because they had already
mapped the entire continent.

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And the connection with
the natives that were here,

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.530 align:middle line:84%
there are still
certain tribes that

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:39.540 align:middle line:84%
continue to preserve and
protect these vaults, here

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:40.860 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>> You're the Grandmaster
of the Knights Templar.

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a pretty
important position.

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:52.290 align:middle line:84%
>> The traditions today,
inside of the Knights Templar,

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:56.460 align:middle line:84%
are they the same
traditions from the 1300s?

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:57.340 align:middle line:90%
>> They are.

00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:01.330 align:middle line:84%
We don't pay any allegiance
to the Roman church anymore.

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:04.650 align:middle line:84%
We started out independent
of the Roman church.

00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:09.750 align:middle line:84%
We had a brief period
of time of patronage

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:11.730 align:middle line:90%
with the Roman church.

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:15.120 align:middle line:84%
And then the Roman church,
along with the King of France,

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:19.590 align:middle line:84%
suppressed the
Templar order in 1307.

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:21.900 align:middle line:90%
And that didn't go too well.

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:25.440 align:middle line:84%
For seven years, there was
a lot of torture and burning

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.280 align:middle line:90%
at the stakes.

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Friday the 13th.

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:28.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Friday the 13th--

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:30.390 align:middle line:90%
that was the origin of that.

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:33.510 align:middle line:84%
At the core of
what we are, we've

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:37.080 align:middle line:84%
always been dedicated to
preserving this tradition.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And we've had to adapt to
the cultures and the habits

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:45.810 align:middle line:84%
of the different
countries that we've lived

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:49.650 align:middle line:84%
and the religious philosophies
of the different countries

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:53.640 align:middle line:90%
that we have done work in.

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:57.180 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, yeah,
it's the same work.

00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, we're also
committed to this idea

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:06.210 align:middle line:84%
that everybody has a spark
of the divine in them.

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:07.080 align:middle line:90%
Everybody.

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And through their
own efforts, they

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:12.720 align:middle line:84%
can attain a direct
knowledge of the divine.

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And they don't need
a priest to do it.

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>> These vaults that
you referred to earlier,

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:19.230 align:middle line:90%
do you know where they are?

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:23.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Would you tell me now?

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:25.440 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't tell you right now.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>> The importance of that,
because when somebody hears

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:32.760 align:middle line:84%
that, they go, OK, well,
this would change things.

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:36.870 align:middle line:84%
Why not speak about this now,
and let's take a film crew in

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:38.358 align:middle line:90%
and see what's going on?

00:23:38.358 --> 00:23:39.900 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we're
building up to that.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:43.650 align:middle line:84%
We had to make people aware
of some of the origins of some

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:44.940 align:middle line:90%
of this stuff first.

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
biggest challenges

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:49.260 align:middle line:84%
we're going to face
once we do reveal

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:53.670 align:middle line:84%
it is, you're going to have a
number of different countries

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:56.375 align:middle line:84%
that are going to try to claim
these things for themselves.

00:23:56.375 --> 00:23:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And we've got to
get to the point

00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:middle line:90%
where we're past all that.

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:03.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these relics,
these treasures

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:06.270 align:middle line:90%
are a gift to all humanity.

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:08.310 align:middle line:90%
They belong to all of humanity.

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:11.790 align:middle line:84%
They don't belong to any one
particular power structure.

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:13.290 align:middle line:84%
Even though we're
protecting them,

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:15.270 align:middle line:84%
we didn't even feel
like they belong to us.

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:17.830 align:middle line:84%
We're just kind of preserving
them for the future.

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:19.170 align:middle line:90%
>> So you could tell Josh.

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:20.430 align:middle line:90%
He won't tell me.

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:22.440 align:middle line:90%
And he can keep the secrets.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.840 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing--

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:30.810 align:middle line:84%
are these relics that would not
only change history but change

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:34.510 align:middle line:84%
the way that the Bible
has been represented to us

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:37.530 align:middle line:84%
and Jesus and God
and Mary and Joseph.

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:40.110 align:middle line:84%
Is this something that
could potentially just

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:40.930 align:middle line:90%
tip things over?

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:41.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Completely.

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:42.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I think it will.

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:46.980 align:middle line:84%
A lot of things will have to
be rewritten or understood

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:48.330 align:middle line:90%
in a new light.

00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:53.500 align:middle line:84%
It's not that what the
Bible says is wrong, per se.

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:56.070 align:middle line:84%
It's just that how it's
being interpreted now

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:59.350 align:middle line:84%
is different than
how it actually is.

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And so it's going
to force people

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:04.720 align:middle line:84%
to have to look at these things
a little bit differently.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's a real threat to
certain church power structures

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:11.190 align:middle line:90%
at the time, currently.

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:13.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's back up, if we can.

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Did the Knights
Templar, at that time,

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:20.160 align:middle line:84%
understand in
1300, in Jerusalem,

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.200 align:middle line:84%
when you're discovering
these things,

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.750 align:middle line:84%
you know possibly that
they are important?

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:26.370 align:middle line:84%
You may not know
what they represent,

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:29.610 align:middle line:84%
certainly when it comes to
the alchemical traditions.

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:33.390 align:middle line:84%
But do you think that
they understood enough

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:37.540 align:middle line:84%
that it had to be kept
secret and that later,

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:39.420 align:middle line:84%
another generation
would understand

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:40.840 align:middle line:90%
the importance of this.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.190 align:middle line:90%
>> I think so.

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:45.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as evidence
of the fact that when

00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:48.180 align:middle line:84%
the order was suppressed,
it was pretty brutal.

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And there was a reason
for that, and it

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:55.290 align:middle line:84%
was because the church and
the monarchy at the time,

00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:59.010 align:middle line:84%
they both had a vested interest
in keeping things the way

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:00.060 align:middle line:90%
they were.

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:04.000 align:middle line:90%
And all of this threatened that.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And it still does
to a certain degree.

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:10.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're talking
about technologies,

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:14.070 align:middle line:84%
first of all, that are
pre-cataclysm technologies that

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:15.120 align:middle line:90%
have been preserved.

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, that, you have to have
people accepting that OK, there

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:22.020 align:middle line:84%
may have been a previous
advanced civilization

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:23.537 align:middle line:90%
to begin with.

00:26:23.537 --> 00:26:24.620 align:middle line:90%
So that's the first thing.

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:26.162 align:middle line:84%
The second thing
you're talking about

00:26:26.162 --> 00:26:29.850 align:middle line:84%
is personal salvation
through your own efforts

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:34.050 align:middle line:84%
that has nothing to do with
a power structure getting you

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:35.070 align:middle line:90%
into heaven.

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:37.640 align:middle line:84%
So that's a change of
thoughts for people.

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.450 align:middle line:84%
You know, another
thing, too, that

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:42.390 align:middle line:84%
was right along with
this is Templars

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:47.700 align:middle line:84%
have always sought to preserve
the rights of individuals

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:52.090 align:middle line:84%
to have the freedom to
explore these things.

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:55.500 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of the
earliest medieval texts

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:59.880 align:middle line:84%
was a book called "Parzival,"
by Wolfram von Eschenbach, which

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:02.310 align:middle line:84%
is one of the first
Grail stories,

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:04.230 align:middle line:90%
and it was written in the 1200s.

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:06.780 align:middle line:84%
In it, it says the
Templars are in charge

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.310 align:middle line:90%
of guarding the Grail.

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And it also says, when the
Grail appears in the text,

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:15.240 align:middle line:84%
it says, if any
Templar should become

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:18.300 align:middle line:84%
a ruler of a foreign
people, let him

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:22.680 align:middle line:84%
ensure that they are given
their God-given rights.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is the
first time in history

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:26.700 align:middle line:84%
it's ever suggested
that people have

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:30.480 align:middle line:84%
God-given rights
because prior to this,

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:32.550 align:middle line:84%
people thought your rights
came from the church

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:34.350 align:middle line:90%
or from the King.

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is saying,
no, your church

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:40.290 align:middle line:84%
comes from a divinity
that transcends all that.

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
we still stand for.

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you're a power structure
trying to control people,

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:48.940 align:middle line:90%
that's a problem.

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:49.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Can we--

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Before you move on,
quickly, I just have to--

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:55.260 align:middle line:84%
I need an example of a
pre-cataclysmic technology.

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:56.760 align:middle line:90%
That was a fascinating line.

00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:00.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, so well, these
arks were pre-cataclysmic

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:01.080 align:middle line:10%
technologies.

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:04.650 align:middle line:10%
I mean, ultimately, I
think their purpose is

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:11.085 align:middle line:10%
to broadcast electricity, much
like the works of Nikola Tesla,

00:28:11.085 --> 00:28:16.800 align:middle line:10%
when he created his Wardynclyffe
Tower to broadcast electricity

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.180 align:middle line:10%
around the planet.

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:19.950 align:middle line:90%
This is what these arks do.

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:22.680 align:middle line:84%
They broadcast
electromagnetic lines of force

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:26.587 align:middle line:84%
around the planet to
these sacred areas.

00:28:26.587 --> 00:28:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's a problem,
too, if you're

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:34.290 align:middle line:84%
trying to put a meter on having
people pay for electricity.

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:37.860 align:middle line:84%
>> When we talk about the Ark
and what may be inside of it,

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:39.780 align:middle line:84%
it's the dimensions
of the Ark too,

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:41.370 align:middle line:90%
that I'm very curious about.

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think there is some pretty
successful research into it

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:50.760 align:middle line:84%
may fit exactly into
the box-- some call

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:54.360 align:middle line:84%
it a sarcophagus-- the box
inside of the King's Chamber

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:55.650 align:middle line:90%
inside of the Great Pyramid.

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:56.550 align:middle line:90%
Coincidence?

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:59.940 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that is
absolutely 100% right on.

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:04.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Great Pyramid itself
generates static electricity.

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:09.750 align:middle line:84%
If you were to stand on top of
the Great Pyramid with a glass

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:12.270 align:middle line:84%
bottle with a wet rag
on it and hold it up,

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:17.310 align:middle line:84%
sparks would start
shooting off of the bottle

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:21.630 align:middle line:84%
just from the natural
conductivity of how

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:24.240 align:middle line:84%
the electricity builds
up from the desert.

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:28.590 align:middle line:84%
So if you then stuck an
ark in the center of it,

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:32.730 align:middle line:84%
in that King's Chamber, with
a super conductive substance

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:37.110 align:middle line:84%
in it, it's just going to
broadcast a tremendous amount

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:38.890 align:middle line:90%
of electricity within the area.

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's exactly
what they were doing.

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:47.370 align:middle line:84%
>> With all of this energy, the
depictions of what is created

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:49.800 align:middle line:84%
with the Ark of the Covenant--
you have to wear body armor

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:50.600 align:middle line:90%
to carry it.

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.380 align:middle line:90%
You can't look at it directly.

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:55.260 align:middle line:84%
Your life is going
to change if you do.

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:57.690 align:middle line:84%
With the concentration
of this kind

00:29:57.690 --> 00:30:01.682 align:middle line:84%
of energy inside of
the Great Pyramid,

00:30:01.682 --> 00:30:03.390 align:middle line:84%
it could have done a
multitude of things.

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:06.390 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just one
specific thing, was it?

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:09.150 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I think it was used
for a lot of different things,

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:12.960 align:middle line:84%
but it was definitely
broadcasting electricity out.

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think this
electricity was being

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:18.370 align:middle line:84%
harnessed at the different
temples in the region.

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:20.310 align:middle line:10%
In fact, if you look at
most of these temples,

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:25.740 align:middle line:10%
they have stones with what
are known as butterfly clips

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:27.750 align:middle line:10%
around the periphery of them.

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And these butterfly
clips, we know,

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:32.740 align:middle line:90%
they used to have metal in them.

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And so they were just
basically like receivers

00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:38.760 align:middle line:90%
for this electricity.

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:42.120 align:middle line:84%
So you could just kind of plug
your things, whatever you had,

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:44.440 align:middle line:90%
into these things to run it.

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is one of the
secrets of the ancient world

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:54.000 align:middle line:84%
that it probably got established
originally by the Atlanteans.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.380 align:middle line:84%
At least, that's what
history suggests, or myth,

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:00.510 align:middle line:90%
you could say.

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And then as things declined,
it just kind of fell apart.

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And then people started
stealing the butterfly clips

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:09.330 align:middle line:90%
for the metal or whatever.

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And staying on this,
because the bronze, the copper,

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:19.650 align:middle line:84%
whatever metal they were using
to bind these stones together

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:24.400 align:middle line:84%
certainly suggested a large
megalithic circuit board,

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.510 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:28.410 align:middle line:84%
But if you have
multiple arks clearly

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:31.200 align:middle line:84%
represented by the
Egyptians, were

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:35.490 align:middle line:84%
these power sources for these
different temple complexes

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:38.520 align:middle line:84%
and possibly other
pyramids throughout Egypt?

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:39.480 align:middle line:90%
>> I think so.

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And if we also consider
that the Great Pyramid

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:48.510 align:middle line:84%
itself is in the exact center
of the land masses of the world,

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:51.300 align:middle line:84%
it was probably
broadcasting this energy

00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:56.230 align:middle line:84%
all around the planet, which is
a distinct, real possibility.

00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:58.290 align:middle line:84%
So when these
boxes were removed,

00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:01.890 align:middle line:84%
it's like it shut off the power
for the entire planet, which

00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:07.950 align:middle line:84%
is a real problem if you're
using that for your power

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:09.510 align:middle line:90%
base, your control.

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:11.400 align:middle line:90%
>> All of that is great.

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.440 align:middle line:84%
Have you seen the
Ark of the Covenant?

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.705 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah I've seen
one of the arks.

00:32:15.705 --> 00:32:17.580 align:middle line:84%
We, currently,
within the Templars,

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:21.210 align:middle line:84%
we have six arks
in our possession.

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:26.820 align:middle line:84%
We are aware of potentially
four other ones.

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:30.960 align:middle line:84%
That's 10 total, but
we're still trying

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.970 align:middle line:90%
to get to them at this time.

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you tell us
where you saw that ark?

00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I saw it here
in the United States.

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:40.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Really.

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:42.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Did you wear body armor?

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:45.847 align:middle line:84%
>> No, because it
wasn't activated.

00:32:45.847 --> 00:32:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Were you worried
about that though?

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:51.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, so part of what came
with the Ark was these rods.

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:55.770 align:middle line:10%
It's actually referred to
as Aaron's rod in the Bible.

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:58.680 align:middle line:84%
But what these are
is grounding rods.

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:01.740 align:middle line:84%
You can take the rod,
stick it in the ground,

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:04.470 align:middle line:84%
and drop it against
the ark, and it'll

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:06.510 align:middle line:84%
ground all the electricity
into the ground

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:07.605 align:middle line:90%
so you can handle it.

00:33:07.605 --> 00:33:09.690 align:middle line:84%
>> We need to
circle back, though.

00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:12.030 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned the Holy Grail.

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:16.875 align:middle line:84%
And the way that
"Parzival" represented it,

00:33:16.875 --> 00:33:19.860 align:middle line:84%
I think that it was more
of an open book, where

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:23.340 align:middle line:84%
we can interpret what
the Grail actually was.

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Did the Grail make it
to the United States?

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:27.630 align:middle line:84%
Did it make it over
to the Americas?

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:29.680 align:middle line:90%
And what is the Grail?

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:30.480 align:middle line:90%
>> It did.

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:33.160 align:middle line:84%
The Grail has been
represented as many things.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:36.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's been
popular in recent years

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:39.660 align:middle line:84%
to associate it with
some sort of bloodline

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:41.805 align:middle line:90%
from Jesus and Mary Magdalene.

00:33:41.805 --> 00:33:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And while that
may be true, there

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:48.640 align:middle line:84%
were other depictions
of the Grail, as well.

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was described
as a stone that

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:54.360 align:middle line:84%
can burn the Phoenix
to ashes after which it

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:55.410 align:middle line:90%
comes back renewed.

00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:58.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, this was an
alchemical metaphor.

00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.040 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>> It was also described
as an emerald that fell out

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:06.360 align:middle line:84%
of the crown of Lucifer
after this war in heaven,

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:09.570 align:middle line:84%
and it was brought to Earth
by these neutral angels.

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:13.740 align:middle line:90%
Well, this emerald was really--

00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:16.590 align:middle line:84%
it was a metaphor
for what was known

00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:21.330 align:middle line:84%
as the Emerald Tablet,
which is a tablet

00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:23.489 align:middle line:90%
of alchemical instruction.

00:34:23.489 --> 00:34:28.185 align:middle line:84%
And even beyond that,
what it really is,

00:34:28.185 --> 00:34:31.920 align:middle line:84%
is it's a substance that
looks like an emerald.

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:34.301 align:middle line:90%
It's not even really an emerald.

00:34:34.301 --> 00:34:36.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a-- if you want
to get down to it--

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:40.860 align:middle line:84%
it's a copper acetate that is
crystallized copper that ends

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:42.780 align:middle line:90%
up looking like an emerald.

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:47.489 align:middle line:84%
And you can extract from
this these monoatomic manna

00:34:47.489 --> 00:34:52.820 align:middle line:84%
atoms that are
extracted alchemically.

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:56.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, back to Josh's
question earlier,

00:34:56.690 --> 00:35:01.070 align:middle line:84%
where this technology
is older than we think.

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And the alchemical
traditions go back,

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:07.760 align:middle line:84%
if we go back to the A
word, right, Atlantis,

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.860 align:middle line:84%
we're pushing this back
10,000, 20,000, 30,000 years.

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:11.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, let me give
you an example of how

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:17.480 align:middle line:84%
it has shown up in other
ancient civilizations--

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:18.720 align:middle line:90%
the same technology.

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:21.390 align:middle line:90%


00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:24.750 align:middle line:84%
So we refer to it as
"manna," because that's

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:29.370 align:middle line:84%
what we encounter in the
Torah, or the Old Testament.

00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:30.660 align:middle line:90%
It's referred to as manna.

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:34.650 align:middle line:84%
But we find the same word
and the same substance

00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:37.440 align:middle line:84%
being described in other
ancient civilizations.

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:42.360 align:middle line:84%
For example, in ancient Sumer,
the name of the alchemical

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:47.470 align:middle line:84%
science was known as
Graal, G-R-A-A-L. Graal.

00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:48.270 align:middle line:90%
Graal.

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:49.440 align:middle line:90%
Grail.

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:52.680 align:middle line:84%
So that was literally the name
of the alchemical science,

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:58.040 align:middle line:84%
and they used it to create
something known as shimana.

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And shimana was used to
help with the flying craft

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:06.620 align:middle line:90%
of the gods, the Anunnaki.

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:10.340 align:middle line:84%
We find the same word
in the Vedic texts

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:13.340 align:middle line:90%
as being called vimana.

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:16.340 align:middle line:84%
So we have manna,
shimana, vimana.

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And the vimanas were also
flying crafts of the gods

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:23.930 align:middle line:90%
from pre-cataclysmic times.

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:27.260 align:middle line:84%
In the Polynesian
cultures, we find

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:30.290 align:middle line:90%
it being referred to as manna.

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:31.460 align:middle line:90%
Same thing, though.

00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:35.330 align:middle line:84%
It's this force of nature
that they're able to extract.

00:36:35.330 --> 00:36:40.280 align:middle line:84%
Within the Gnostic traditions,
like in the Albigensians

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:44.780 align:middle line:84%
of Southern France, of which the
Templars largely came out of,

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:50.790 align:middle line:84%
they used to practice a ceremony
known as the Manisola Ceremony.

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And it was like a communion
rite with this substance

00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:56.510 align:middle line:90%
that they referred to as mani.

00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:58.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, this mani
is the same thing

00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:01.790 align:middle line:84%
as the manna, which
is the same thing

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:04.100 align:middle line:90%
as the shimana and the vimana.

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And we also find it in a
number of other places.

00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:12.230 align:middle line:84%
So it's all these
ancient traditions

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:16.220 align:middle line:84%
were preserving the same
thing, the same science

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:22.220 align:middle line:84%
from ancient times, and it
tied in directly to these arks.

00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the things
that the Knights Templar

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:27.260 align:middle line:90%
got hold of.

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:32.420 align:middle line:84%
>> How, ultimately, Tim,
would this change history?

00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And if it did and it should,
for those out there that

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.635 align:middle line:84%
don't want this history changed,
what kind of fight would--

00:37:42.635 --> 00:37:46.490 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be some
oppression from the other side.

00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:48.650 align:middle line:90%
How do you move this forward?

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:52.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Again, fundamental to
this belief structure is that

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:56.700 align:middle line:84%
everybody has this source
of the divine within them.

00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:02.450 align:middle line:84%
So there's no one group
that are the only chosen

00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:04.730 align:middle line:84%
ones at the exclusion
of everybody else.

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:06.590 align:middle line:90%
We're all in this together.

00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:08.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Can the world handle it?

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:09.330 align:middle line:90%
>> I think so.

00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:11.345 align:middle line:84%
I think we're
getting to the point

00:38:11.345 --> 00:38:13.610 align:middle line:90%
with our modern technologies.

00:38:13.610 --> 00:38:18.140 align:middle line:84%
With our internet and
our global community,

00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:22.010 align:middle line:84%
we now are associating
with each other more,

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:25.490 align:middle line:90%
recognizing our commonalities.

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:30.320 align:middle line:84%
We have to work together now
as a world to solve problems

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:36.010 align:middle line:84%
and to do things that are
for the best for the planet

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.890 align:middle line:84%
and for ourselves and
for the other inhabitants

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:40.920 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, I think we have
a destiny beyond this planet

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:45.960 align:middle line:90%
that we're getting to.

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think all of
this ancient technology

00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:52.030 align:middle line:84%
that we're sitting on and
these ancient philosophies

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:56.280 align:middle line:84%
are all geared towards
helping us go that direction.

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:58.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Does this
conversation today--

00:38:58.530 --> 00:38:59.880 align:middle line:90%
do I earn a pin?

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:02.435 align:middle line:84%
>> I will definitely give
you a pin after we're done.

00:39:02.435 --> 00:39:03.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:06.750 align:middle line:84%
I look forward to everything
that is about to be revealed.

00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:09.975 align:middle line:84%
And these are exciting times,
and I think we're ready for it.

00:39:09.975 --> 00:39:11.100 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready for it, Josh?

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:11.900 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm ready.

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:13.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready.

00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:14.673 align:middle line:90%
>> This is "Into the Vortex."

00:39:14.673 --> 00:39:15.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Jimmy Church.

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:17.130 align:middle line:90%
Timothy Hogan.

00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:21.950 align:middle line:84%
Incredible conversation today,
and we'll catch you next time.

00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:26.000 align:middle line:90%
