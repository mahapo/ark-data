00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm radio and television
host Jimmy Church,

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.290 align:middle line:84%
and I am here to uncover
the truth about some

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.680 align:middle line:90%
of life's biggest mysteries.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.210 align:middle line:84%
If this is revealed,
everything has to be rewritten.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.910 align:middle line:84%
My guest today is Chris Bledsoe
recognized by America's three

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.780 align:middle line:84%
letter agencies and acknowledged
by the Vatican, making him

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.170 align:middle line:84%
a pivotal player in the
global conversation on UFOs

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.810 align:middle line:90%
and extraterrestrial phenomena.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.450 align:middle line:84%
>> I saw what I thought
was the setting sun.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.810 align:middle line:84%
I walk a few more steps
up closer to the gate,

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.300 align:middle line:84%
and now I'm looking at
two of these things.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And there wasn't
nothing from this world.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>> As always, MUFON
Field Investigator Josh--

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.555 align:middle line:90%
Josh, can you pull up the map?

00:00:52.555 --> 00:00:53.355 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:00:53.355 --> 00:00:55.620 align:middle line:84%
>> --joins us to
help set the scene.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.970 align:middle line:84%
Join us as we dive deep to
get to the bottom of some

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.850 align:middle line:84%
of the most intriguing
questions of our time.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Now seeing these
things is one thing,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.180 align:middle line:84%
but when it sees
you and you know it,

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.370 align:middle line:90%
that's a different story.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.140 align:middle line:90%
And he couldn't talk.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.560 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't scream.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.550 align:middle line:90%
He was paralyzed.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:25.040 align:middle line:90%


00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome to "Into the Vortex."

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:27.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jimmy Church.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And today, my guest
is Chris Bledsoe.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.000 align:middle line:84%
And this is a conversation
I've been looking forward

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.390 align:middle line:84%
to for a very long
time, including you Josh

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.840 align:middle line:84%
where we have with
Chris's case, we've

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.740 align:middle line:84%
got a little bit of everything
that is involved in his life.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.060 align:middle line:90%
We have craft.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.470 align:middle line:90%
We have his family.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.300 align:middle line:90%
We have government agencies.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.400 align:middle line:90%
We have a religious spin.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.690 align:middle line:90%
We have entities.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.530 align:middle line:84%
We have Greys and of
course, his co-workers.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.340 align:middle line:84%
There's orbs are
everywhere calling him.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.180 align:middle line:90%
Everything is in this case.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.290 align:middle line:84%
What do you think is
actually going on?

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Ooh, that's a tough question.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.070 align:middle line:84%
I would say that
Chris's case is one

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.470 align:middle line:84%
of the most profound stories
I've ever personally heard

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.580 align:middle line:90%
in the field of Ufology.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just super happy
that you're here today.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:13.730 align:middle line:90%
And thank you for being here.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'm happy to
get into it today.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.100 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
really interesting.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.517 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh is going to have some
questions before we're done.

00:02:18.517 --> 00:02:19.910 align:middle line:90%
Chris, welcome.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.275 align:middle line:84%
It's good to finally
sit down with you.

00:02:24.275 --> 00:02:29.760 align:middle line:84%
This case has always impacted
me because of the family aspect.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.050 align:middle line:90%
You've got your children.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.810 align:middle line:84%
You've got different
homes and family homes

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.660 align:middle line:84%
and family homes that
are next door to you

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.460 align:middle line:84%
and all of this interruption
into all of this.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.570 align:middle line:84%
How has that
impacted-- before we

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.490 align:middle line:84%
get to the foundation
of everything,

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.920 align:middle line:90%
how has it impacted your family?

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, to begin with,
it was awful and negative

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.750 align:middle line:84%
because of fear factor
not knowing this that

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.460 align:middle line:90%
we're in unknown territory.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And so to have this
appearing inside the house

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.170 align:middle line:90%
and it is kind of frightful.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.680 align:middle line:84%
But they're all
embracing it now,

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.110 align:middle line:84%
my wife included
and all my kids.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And they see it as
a positive thing.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to bring up a
picture of your family.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And I bring this up
because I'm a dad.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.720 align:middle line:90%
And I have a family.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.630 align:middle line:90%
And I totally get that.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.030 align:middle line:90%
And here we have--

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.940 align:middle line:84%
take us through
everybody in this image.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, starting on the left
our left, that's Chris Junior.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.100 align:middle line:90%
He's my oldest boy.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.360 align:middle line:90%
He's 33 now.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And he was with me in '07 when
this major thing on the river

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.690 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.330 align:middle line:90%
And the next one is Ryan.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.940 align:middle line:90%
He is my youngest boy.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.340 align:middle line:90%
He's just turned 30.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.360 align:middle line:90%
>> I follow his podcast.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, he has a
podcast Bledsoe said so.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.500 align:middle line:84%
Then of course, my wife and
our little puppy Biscuit.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And then my daughter
Emily, she's the baby.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.780 align:middle line:84%
She's 26 right
now soon to be 27.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And then my middle son on
the far right is Jeremy.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.770 align:middle line:10%
He's 31 or 2.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.920 align:middle line:10%
And he's a data scientist
at East Carolina University.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.360 align:middle line:84%
So all have come through
a long journey with this,

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.600 align:middle line:84%
and it's all turned into a
blessing for them all now.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.050 align:middle line:90%
>> They're all amazing.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.250 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
beginning and especially Chris

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Junior, because that
night-- take us through it--

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.540 align:middle line:84%
you're out with
some, let's just say,

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.230 align:middle line:90%
co-workers and Chris Junior.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And you head out to go and
relax on the river there,

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.600 align:middle line:84%
and Chris Junior while you were
off having your own experience,

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.750 align:middle line:84%
Chris comes face to
face with an entity.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And that must have
been life changing.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.250 align:middle line:84%
So take us through
that night and how

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:08.320 align:middle line:84%
you felt when your own son now
is part of this experience.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.950 align:middle line:84%
>> He was in shock when I
found him, basically in shock.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.730 align:middle line:90%
So it was January the 8 of '07.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.570 align:middle line:84%
I had invited, well,
actually three co-workers.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.240 align:middle line:84%
And they called me that day
and said, "Can we go celebrate.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.760 align:middle line:84%
We're glad we're done,
and it was all worth."

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.620 align:middle line:84%
So I said, "Yeah,
I'll take you fishing

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.500 align:middle line:90%
if that's what you want to do."

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.240 align:middle line:90%
My wife was not at home.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.470 align:middle line:84%
She was away with the
other three children.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.260 align:middle line:84%
So it was just
Chris Junior and I.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.370 align:middle line:90%
So we agreed.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And 2:30 in the
day, they got there.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And we took off to
the river, which

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.090 align:middle line:84%
was only five minutes from
where I live, maybe six minutes.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And so at that time, I was at
the lowest point in my life

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.280 align:middle line:84%
suffering from Crohn's disease
and from losing my business.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.930 align:middle line:84%
So long story short,
I walked away.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.830 align:middle line:84%
I said, "I'll see
you guys after dark.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to walk
up to the field

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.230 align:middle line:84%
to see if any wildlife
comes out not telling them

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.490 align:middle line:90%
where I was thinking--

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Wildlife?

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.157 align:middle line:84%
There's an interesting
comment because--

00:06:05.157 --> 00:06:06.448 align:middle line:90%
>> That's one way of saying it.

00:06:06.448 --> 00:06:07.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah exactly.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:08.910 align:middle line:90%
So you head up to the field.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>> And I get really close
to the top of the hill.

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.090 align:middle line:84%
You can't see the fields
yet because all I can see

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.370 align:middle line:84%
is a gate up about
100 feet up the road.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And when I got near
that gate, I saw what

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.290 align:middle line:90%
I thought was the setting sun.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.790 align:middle line:84%
I walk a few more steps
up closer to the gate,

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.490 align:middle line:84%
and my peripheral
vision got wider.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm looking at
two of these things.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.400 align:middle line:84%
So I knew right
away this was not--

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Two setting suns
doesn't add up.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:38.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And I analyzed everything
because I'm a commercial-rated

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:41.570 align:middle line:90%
pilot.

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.790 align:middle line:90%
And I grew up around Fort Bragg.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.370 align:middle line:84%
So I know about everything
that flies around there,

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.420 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't nothing
from this world.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And so I sit there, well,
actually hid from it.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.610 align:middle line:90%
I was afraid.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.160 align:middle line:84%
I got down on my knees and
crawled over in the bushes.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And I could use the
hill to pop up and look.

00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:59.870 align:middle line:90%
And I'm in the weeds.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.560 align:middle line:84%
So I think I'm hiding or
that's what I thought, and it

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.090 align:middle line:90%
was great looking at it.

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.030 align:middle line:84%
Seeing these things is one
thing, but when it sees you

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.370 align:middle line:84%
and you know it, that's
a different story.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And a third one above me
appeared and shot down

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.360 align:middle line:90%
beside the other two.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.520 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I
remember is walking up

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.500 align:middle line:90%
to the fire the last 50 feet.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.330 align:middle line:84%
And when I walked
up, it startled them.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.307 align:middle line:84%
They were unnerved
a bit anyhow and--

00:07:22.307 --> 00:07:23.390 align:middle line:90%
>> What time was this now?

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.060 align:middle line:84%
>> This is probably it
was four hours later.

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.365 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, four hours later,
they're looking for you.

00:07:29.365 --> 00:07:31.410 align:middle line:90%
You don't know what's going on.

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.450 align:middle line:84%
You don't know about
the missing time.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:37.740 align:middle line:84%
But probably even more
extraordinary than that

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:38.540 align:middle line:90%
is your son.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And so, of course,
you're a father,

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:43.170 align:middle line:84%
and that's the
first thing you ask.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I asked immediately.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:47.040 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even stop
walking towards him.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, "Where
is Christopher?"

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:52.950 align:middle line:84%
They said, "Well, he's
been lost for two hours.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:54.150 align:middle line:90%
We can't find him.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:55.380 align:middle line:90%
We couldn't find you.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And they had gone
on a big search.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:59.520 align:middle line:90%
So I left immediately.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.010 align:middle line:84%
I just ran right on by him to
the back of that cul-de-sac

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:04.260 align:middle line:84%
because that's where they
said he'd gone in the woods.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And how old was Chris
Junior at this time?

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:07.860 align:middle line:90%
>> He was 17.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:08.740 align:middle line:90%
>> 17 years old.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:09.540 align:middle line:90%
He's a kid.

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:10.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, a kid.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.160 align:middle line:90%
>> He's a kid.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.260 align:middle line:90%
And you don't know anything.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:14.700 align:middle line:90%
And you're shouting out for him.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:15.640 align:middle line:90%
What happens next?

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So I run up to the
edge of the woods,

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:20.580 align:middle line:84%
and I'm parting the
bushes to get in there.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:21.780 align:middle line:90%
And he scares me.

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.360 align:middle line:84%
He comes up from
under the bushes.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And what he had done was
he could see all the way

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:30.180 align:middle line:84%
across the cul-de-sac
and down that road that

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.110 align:middle line:90%
parallels the river.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.929 align:middle line:84%
So he had a quarter
mile view of that road.

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And he saw two red
balls of light orbs

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:37.919 align:middle line:90%
come across the path.

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:41.400 align:middle line:84%
So they went into the
woods on the river side,

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.350 align:middle line:84%
and he ran up to the
guys to tell them

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:46.110 align:middle line:84%
he just saw some flashlights
or some weird lights

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:47.370 align:middle line:90%
go in the woods.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And he left there and went
back to that same spot.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:53.490 align:middle line:84%
They came back out in the
road, these two balls of light,

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:56.160 align:middle line:84%
started down that long
quarter mile to him.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.175 align:middle line:84%
And when they got within--
and that caused him to hide.

00:08:59.175 --> 00:09:00.690 align:middle line:84%
They were getting
closer and closer.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:04.170 align:middle line:84%
So he laid down on his
stomach and backed himself up

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:05.640 align:middle line:90%
under this thick of shrubs.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, they
got within 20 feet of him,

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.000 align:middle line:84%
and he could see there were
two little beings there

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.690 align:middle line:84%
about 3 feet tall and
had red glowing eyes.

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:17.430 align:middle line:90%
And one would look at him.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:19.980 align:middle line:84%
There was always one
looking at him always.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:21.660 align:middle line:90%
And he couldn't talk.

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:22.800 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't scream.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.880 align:middle line:90%
He was paralyzed.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.520 align:middle line:84%
He laid there for
who knows how long.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:30.750 align:middle line:84%
>> And he of course, he isn't
aware of your experience up

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:32.840 align:middle line:90%
at the gate on the hill.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And you're listening
to him now repeat

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.210 align:middle line:90%
what he is going through.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:41.450 align:middle line:84%
At that point before we
move on, as a father,

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:45.230 align:middle line:84%
do you scare your son and go
I went through the same thing

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:48.830 align:middle line:84%
where you push him over
the edge, oh, this is real?

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:51.202 align:middle line:90%
Or do you do you comfort him?

00:09:51.202 --> 00:09:52.910 align:middle line:84%
What do you do as a
father at that point?

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:57.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I was really concerned
because he was definitely--

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.630 align:middle line:84%
he was unlike anything
I'd ever seen.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.170 align:middle line:90%
He was terrified.

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:02.520 align:middle line:90%
He was in shock.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.695 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Why
did you leave me dad?

00:10:04.695 --> 00:10:05.570 align:middle line:90%
Why did you leave me?

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:06.903 align:middle line:90%
I said, "I didn't leave his son.

00:10:06.903 --> 00:10:08.270 align:middle line:90%
I just walked up to the field.

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:09.593 align:middle line:90%
I was only gone 20 minutes."

00:10:09.593 --> 00:10:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "No, you've
been gone all night."

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:13.843 align:middle line:84%
And these creatures-- that's
when he started telling me,

00:10:13.843 --> 00:10:15.560 align:middle line:84%
these creatures
come and scared me.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And so I grabbed him and
walked him back to the fire.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And he's talking this and see
the guys at the fire hearing it

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:23.660 align:middle line:90%
as we're getting closer.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.240 align:middle line:84%
And they know I told
them I saw lights up

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.680 align:middle line:90%
at the top of the hill.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.730 align:middle line:84%
So the overall
temperature of this thing

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:36.630 align:middle line:84%
was like everybody was very
quiet listening to Christopher.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.780 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, one of the guys
shouts, and we all look up.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And there were eight or nine
looked like stars as bright

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:45.540 align:middle line:84%
as Venus which we
know are orbs now.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And they just went out away
and they come together.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And they look like somebody
designed their movement.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And then three of them come
down and landed in front of us

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:55.980 align:middle line:90%
across the river.

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>> This is like "Close
Encounters of the Third Kind"

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:00.030 align:middle line:90%
but playing out for real?

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:00.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:06.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you have, again, any
indication of what was about

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.620 align:middle line:84%
to happen with the
rest of your life.

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'm speaking specifically
different government agencies,

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:17.040 align:middle line:84%
the CIA, and who start
knocking at your door.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.750 align:middle line:90%
There's an interest in this.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:21.030 align:middle line:90%
They know something is going on.

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And they know something
is going on with you,

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:26.610 align:middle line:84%
but they're also dealing with
the phenomena on their own.

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:28.755 align:middle line:90%
They start showing up.

00:11:28.755 --> 00:11:30.200 align:middle line:90%
How do you take that?

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.440 align:middle line:90%
And what was your reaction?

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let me tell you
when they first showed up,

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:37.290 align:middle line:90%
we had been investigated.

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And I had gone through a
couple of UFO conferences

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:42.860 align:middle line:90%
and got to meet everybody.

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And they started
coming to my house.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.650 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to see the place--
the UFO community does.

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:50.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, they pretty
well and scared us

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.790 align:middle line:84%
to death with the fact
that the men in black's

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:54.590 align:middle line:90%
going to get you.

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And remember Will Smith
was on TV at that time.

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:59.480 align:middle line:84%
So we were scared
of the government

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:03.030 align:middle line:84%
that they were going to put us
away or kill us or something.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And so and I get a call one day,
and it's my youngest boy Ryan.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:09.350 align:middle line:90%
He calls me.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:10.700 align:middle line:90%
He and Emily are at home.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:12.860 align:middle line:84%
Ryan picks up the phone
and says, "Dad, there's

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.540 align:middle line:84%
this guy from NASA here
wants to talk to you."

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.230 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Tell him I'll
be home in an hour."

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And we ended up becoming
best friends for 11 years.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.350 align:middle line:84%
But I was terrified
to begin with.

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:28.430 align:middle line:84%
But it was those people
along with CIA friends that

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:34.912 align:middle line:84%
came to my children and spoke
to them and to my family

00:12:34.912 --> 00:12:36.620 align:middle line:84%
and told them, you
need to listen to him.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.010 align:middle line:90%
He's telling you the truth.

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:40.920 align:middle line:84%
So they brought peace
back to my family.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.640 align:middle line:84%
It was the government
folks that did that.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.740 align:middle line:90%
>> You call them orbs.

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And I've always found
that interesting.

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And so many have seen what they
think is or could be anything.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:53.267 align:middle line:90%
It could be a ship.

00:12:53.267 --> 00:12:54.100 align:middle line:90%
It could be a craft.

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:55.330 align:middle line:90%
It could be translucent.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:56.570 align:middle line:90%
It could be interdimensional.

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:58.640 align:middle line:90%
It could be all of the above.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.700 align:middle line:84%
It could be a glowing
metallic situation.

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:02.960 align:middle line:90%
We just don't know.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.590 align:middle line:84%
But overall, we
use the word orbs.

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:08.510 align:middle line:90%
Why do you choose that word?

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I did that in '07
when I first reported this

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.320 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.410 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't say I saw a
flying saucer because I

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:17.330 align:middle line:90%
didn't or any machine.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:21.050 align:middle line:84%
It was a ball of light
that looked mechanical

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:24.170 align:middle line:84%
looking the way it was acting,
but it was just pure light.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:27.980 align:middle line:84%
So I thought about
that, and I just

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:32.850 align:middle line:84%
used the term orb, which
is how I reported it back.

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:34.980 align:middle line:90%
>> I have an image here.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:37.920 align:middle line:90%
Josh, I hope you don't mind.

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.860 align:middle line:84%
This is an image of
Chris Junior standing

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:44.280 align:middle line:84%
in front of what appears to
be, I'm just going to say,

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.420 align:middle line:90%
a landing site.

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that actually is two
years after it burnt the grass.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.760 align:middle line:90%
So nothing would grow there.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.480 align:middle line:84%
But it left-- when
it first happened

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:58.620 align:middle line:84%
the grass was beautiful
and green that spring.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:00.710 align:middle line:84%
When it came back, it had
a perfect little donut

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:01.510 align:middle line:90%
in the middle.

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:03.300 align:middle line:84%
But if you see those
paths behind him,

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:04.650 align:middle line:90%
you see those streaks?

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:08.070 align:middle line:84%
There's two other orbs that
we didn't shoot in that photo.

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:10.080 align:middle line:84%
There are over to the
right where they landed.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.690 align:middle line:84%
And what we figured is
they come out of the sky,

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:14.580 align:middle line:84%
and they just kind of
moved along the ground

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:17.430 align:middle line:84%
until they sat down
three circles in my yard.

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you seen physical
craft besides the orbs?

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:21.900 align:middle line:90%
>> I have, yeah.

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:25.000 align:middle line:84%
I have pictures of
and video of daytime.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:25.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:26.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Chris, speaking
to that, Josh,

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:33.170 align:middle line:84%
Chris sent me some
videos many years ago.

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:36.240 align:middle line:90%
And it was after an interview.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me,
"You just wait."

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:39.920 align:middle line:90%
So you sent me these videos.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking
through the videos,

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.510 align:middle line:84%
and I hear the voice
of somebody that

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:47.960 align:middle line:84%
is a personal friend of mine
who is a friend of yours that

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.120 align:middle line:90%
is during one of these events.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.770 align:middle line:90%
We don't need to get into that.

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:56.810 align:middle line:84%
But when I see the orb,
the craft come down

00:14:56.810 --> 00:15:01.830 align:middle line:84%
and I'm listening to my friend's
voice describe what's going on,

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:03.630 align:middle line:84%
I just wrapped
the show with you.

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:07.080 align:middle line:84%
I picked up the phone and
called this individual

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:07.880 align:middle line:90%
and said, "what?"

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:12.830 align:middle line:10%
"Jimmy, it came down from
the sky in front of me."

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is somebody
that I trust.

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:18.440 align:middle line:84%
This kind of thing
seems to happen on

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.390 align:middle line:90%
is it a conscious connection?

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And second part to this
question, a lot of things

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:25.370 align:middle line:90%
are outdoors.

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:27.440 align:middle line:84%
Do they ever appear
in your home?

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.240 align:middle line:90%
>> All the time, yeah.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And believe it or
not, it's so common.

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:35.950 align:middle line:84%
My wife recently it's
been about a month ago,

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:38.460 align:middle line:84%
I walked out about 9
o'clock to check the sky

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:39.630 align:middle line:90%
and see if it was cloudy.

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And I was going to go
out and sit a while.

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:44.490 align:middle line:84%
My wife said, "Well, when
you got up to go outside,

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:47.070 align:middle line:84%
this green orb appeared
right over your chair" right

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:47.970 align:middle line:90%
where I was sitting.

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:49.800 align:middle line:90%
And it's about this big around.

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And it was making
this sizzling noise.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.200 align:middle line:84%
She described it as an
electrical sizzling,

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.660 align:middle line:84%
which I have them on
video making that noise.

00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:58.570 align:middle line:90%
You can hear them.

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:00.150 align:middle line:90%
And it just popped.

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:03.060 align:middle line:84%
When it popped, it filled
the light with green.

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:06.210 align:middle line:84%
The whole room turned
green for a brief second,

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:07.380 align:middle line:90%
and then it vanished.

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:11.640 align:middle line:84%
But we see them go by the front
door, go through the bedroom,

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.660 align:middle line:90%
then they're up here.

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:15.420 align:middle line:84%
But it's not all that
often, but they do.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:17.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Can we do it now?

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, we can ask.

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:19.470 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:20.640 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's see.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.990 align:middle line:90%
We shoot live.

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:23.970 align:middle line:84%
That would be pretty
interesting to--

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:27.960 align:middle line:90%
well, and your experiences--

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.920 align:middle line:84%
and the book is
incredible, "UFO of God."

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And I've read it
so many times now.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:39.950 align:middle line:10%
But there's another spin on
this where some experiencers,

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:44.090 align:middle line:10%
not all but some experiencers
it's a negative thing.

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And they're not-- this is
not a funny ha-ha situation

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:50.060 align:middle line:90%
that they go through.

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:54.800 align:middle line:84%
Yours has been an overall
positive experience,

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.690 align:middle line:90%
is that fair to say?

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:58.250 align:middle line:90%
>> 100%, yeah.

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>> And how would your experience
transform the way that

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:05.480 align:middle line:90%
the public views this.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And do you feel that the
agencies, and you can pick one.

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:11.359 align:middle line:84%
You've been involved
with all of them.

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:13.369 align:middle line:90%
Do they have a different spin?

00:17:13.369 --> 00:17:16.730 align:middle line:84%
Are they trying to present
this differently than the way

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:17.915 align:middle line:90%
that you feel?

00:17:17.915 --> 00:17:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say there's some
out there that would like to.

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:24.770 align:middle line:84%
But for what I'm
experiencing, I just

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:30.410 align:middle line:84%
had a senior executive CS19
at my house from the DIA.

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And they got to see it the whole
family and right in her face.

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.430 align:middle line:84%
When she first came there
she was talking about,

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:39.450 align:middle line:90%
you must be creating this.

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, "No, these are
intelligent entities that

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:44.600 align:middle line:90%
can hear your thoughts."

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon it
started reacting to her,

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:49.140 align:middle line:90%
and it would flash on and off.

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.650 align:middle line:90%
And so they don't know, Jimmy.

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:53.870 align:middle line:84%
For the most part,
this government

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:56.210 align:middle line:90%
knows its conscience based.

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And it can do whatever it
wants to do at any moment,

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:04.920 align:middle line:84%
appear as it wants to, and
it's always a mile ahead of us.

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.565 align:middle line:84%
So, how do you put a
label to this thing?

00:18:07.565 --> 00:18:09.020 align:middle line:90%
We really don't know.

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:12.470 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not afraid of it.

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:14.168 align:middle line:84%
I have suffered with
Crohn's disease.

00:18:14.168 --> 00:18:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
I didn't get to.

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:18.230 align:middle line:84%
But that night on the river
when I got Chris Junior

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:22.400 align:middle line:84%
home the next day,
I was no longer sick

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.080 align:middle line:90%
like I had been for 17 years.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And so that automatically made
me see it as a positive thing.

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Chris, I'm obsessed with
the transformational aspect

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:33.910 align:middle line:90%
of the phenomenon.

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And in your story, you went
from negative to positive.

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.860 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of experiencers
don't get there.

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:41.112 align:middle line:84%
My question for you
is, that negative shock

00:18:41.112 --> 00:18:42.570 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning
of the experience,

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:46.200 align:middle line:84%
is that necessary to break
open to expand to transform?

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.200 align:middle line:84%
Or are you just or most people
just not interpreting it

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.870 align:middle line:84%
correctly in the beginning
until they get over the fear?

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:53.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's the fear.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.950 align:middle line:90%
It's the fear is so fearful.

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:59.160 align:middle line:84%
Even today, if an orb appears
right here next to me,

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.860 align:middle line:84%
I get this fright that
happens all of a sudden.

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.420 align:middle line:90%
It's human nature.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:06.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't care how hard
you try, it can still

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:08.940 align:middle line:84%
when you're looking at
something coming at you,

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.190 align:middle line:84%
it can bring chills
down your spine.

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And I've been added so long that
I know there's no danger there.

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:21.510 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people don't get
past that fear, that shock,

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:26.490 align:middle line:84%
and then the feeling of being
their privacy being taken

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:27.550 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:31.830 align:middle line:84%
So that's what the
CIA talks about

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:34.800 align:middle line:84%
that they can come right in
and do what they want with you

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:36.630 align:middle line:90%
and you have no say.

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:42.930 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of a hard thing
for these people to swallow.

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:45.210 align:middle line:84%
But it's all been
a positive thing.

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And for my children,
it's all positive now.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:51.330 align:middle line:84%
They can walk outside
and ask it to come,

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:53.880 align:middle line:90%
and it comes just like I do.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Can I ask you about
that pin on your lapel?

00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:57.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:00.640 align:middle line:84%
>> I've never seen
a pin like that.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.310 align:middle line:90%
It looks mysterious.

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:04.140 align:middle line:90%
It looks a little bit nutty.

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:05.010 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:06.390 align:middle line:90%
What are we looking at?

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:11.050 align:middle line:84%
>> That pin has been questioned
a lot by a lot of people

00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:11.850 align:middle line:90%
wanting to see it.

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And I never would share
it because I was asked

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.100 align:middle line:90%
not to when it was given to me.

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:21.180 align:middle line:84%
But it came in an envelope
with a dinner napkin

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:22.740 align:middle line:90%
from Camp David.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Camp David?

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Camp David Maryland.

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.430 align:middle line:90%
>> The presidential retreat?

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:27.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:29.340 align:middle line:10%
It's a NASA pin.

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:30.630 align:middle line:10%
It's 24-karat gold.

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:32.240 align:middle line:10%
It was given to me.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:38.780 align:middle line:10%
And in their circles from
what I was told that if you're

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:42.290 align:middle line:10%
known to have interacted
with the phenomenon

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:46.180 align:middle line:10%
off planet beings,
you get one of these.

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:46.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:48.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.870 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:50.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm still waiting for
mine to come in the mail.

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:52.138 align:middle line:90%
I don't know about you, Josh.

00:20:52.138 --> 00:20:55.190 align:middle line:84%
But what that says
to me Camp David

00:20:55.190 --> 00:21:00.680 align:middle line:84%
that means the White House,
that means the president.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And if NASA was involved,
that means NASA.

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Correct me if I'm wrong,
I'm just connecting the dots

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:11.360 align:middle line:84%
here that somebody at
NASA, probably the director

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:15.650 align:middle line:84%
or the administrator is at
Camp David discussing you

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:17.150 align:middle line:90%
with the president.

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And then they turn
around and send you

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:21.590 align:middle line:90%
that pin from Camp David.

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:23.360 align:middle line:84%
Do I have this
picture painted wrong?

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.440 align:middle line:90%
>> You're exactly right.

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:27.215 align:middle line:90%
>> Camp David presidents?

00:21:27.215 --> 00:21:28.340 align:middle line:90%
Don't you want to know who?

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, what President was in
office us when you receive that

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:31.840 align:middle line:90%
amazing--

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:32.870 align:middle line:90%
>> It was Barack Obama.

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:33.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, really?

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:33.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:34.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:37.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure it was so.

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.680 align:middle line:90%
>> What does the CIA know?

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:44.540 align:middle line:84%
What is it that they
want to project?

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:48.860 align:middle line:84%
What is the message that
they want the public to feel

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:50.360 align:middle line:90%
about the phenomenon?

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:53.190 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a lot of mixed
emotion there as well.

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:56.420 align:middle line:84%
But I'm friends with
the top all the way up.

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And the guy that wrote
the foreword of my book

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:03.140 align:middle line:84%
was the Director of Operations
Clandestine Director.

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:04.850 align:middle line:90%
He's 007 this guy.

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And just recently,
I was at his house

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:11.090 align:middle line:90%
in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:15.560 align:middle line:84%
We were a couple of blocks from
Joe Biden's house just across.

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And we were there for a
cookout and a lot of people

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:22.070 align:middle line:84%
from Washington there and
from the Justice Department

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:23.030 align:middle line:90%
and everywhere.

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:26.030 align:middle line:84%
But we filmed a lot of
orbs flying right over,

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:28.530 align:middle line:84%
come right off the beach,
come right over our house.

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:29.780 align:middle line:90%
And it was pretty interesting.

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:33.890 align:middle line:90%
But they're open minded.

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:35.930 align:middle line:84%
I think they want
an air caution.

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:40.640 align:middle line:84%
The government's first
thought is national security.

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.660 align:middle line:84%
They come at it with
that standpoint,

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:45.540 align:middle line:84%
how is it going to-- how
can we protect these people?

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:47.460 align:middle line:90%
How can we protect this country?

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And so it's understandable
to have that

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:53.180 align:middle line:84%
until we know what
we're dealing with,

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:55.740 align:middle line:84%
you probably shouldn't
mess with it.

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:57.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's take things
in another direction

00:22:57.530 --> 00:22:59.330 align:middle line:84%
because there's
another part to this.

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:00.680 align:middle line:90%
We have the science.

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:02.090 align:middle line:90%
We have NASA.

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:03.500 align:middle line:90%
We have the studies.

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.540 align:middle line:84%
We have everything
that you have done

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:07.850 align:middle line:84%
and the documentation and
the imaging and the videos.

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:09.120 align:middle line:90%
We have all of that.

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.710 align:middle line:90%
But then we have the lady.

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And we've got a sudden very
serious and very direct--

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:18.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to use the word--

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:19.520 align:middle line:90%
religious.

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.130 align:middle line:84%
We've got a religious
side to this.

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Your book is called
"UFO of God."

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:24.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:28.324 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, what do we do with this?

00:23:28.324 --> 00:23:30.440 align:middle line:90%
Is this a religious thing?

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And is this now a
universal thing?

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're interacting
with this beautiful figure

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:41.870 align:middle line:84%
and she's speaking
to you, and it's

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:47.450 align:middle line:84%
that this must be going on every
planet in every star system

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:48.920 align:middle line:90%
across the universe.

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:52.560 align:middle line:84%
It's not just Chris Bledsoe
on planet Earth, right?

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:58.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'd have to say about
that, if anything in my whole

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:04.040 align:middle line:84%
16 and 1/2, 17 years of
this interaction with any

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:11.210 align:middle line:84%
of the agencies, they're more
interested in her than an orb.

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:16.470 align:middle line:84%
By and far a whole lot more
it's gotten a lot of attention.

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:22.700 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I was requested to
put in writing what she told me

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:24.770 align:middle line:84%
when I first met
her to the Pentagon

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:26.150 align:middle line:90%
for some Air Force generals.

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:27.110 align:middle line:90%
And I did that.

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:29.480 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not a religious person.

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:30.530 align:middle line:90%
I used to be.

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:32.170 align:middle line:84%
I was born and
raised in the church.

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:33.170 align:middle line:90%
I married a Pentecostal.

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:34.160 align:middle line:90%
>> You're in the Bible belt?

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:34.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.730 align:middle line:90%
And so it changed me.

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:40.640 align:middle line:84%
Everything about this
changed me to a more loving,

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.130 align:middle line:90%
spiritual, a better father.

00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:45.150 align:middle line:90%
I don't harm animals anymore.

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:46.880 align:middle line:90%
I used to be a hunter.

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:50.150 align:middle line:84%
I cry if I think about
hurting one literally.

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:52.550 align:middle line:84%
This whole experience
made me cry for 10 years.

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:55.930 align:middle line:84%
I've been just can't--
and when I think about it,

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:57.320 align:middle line:90%
it's what it does to me.

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:59.270 align:middle line:90%
>> I keep saying the lady.

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:02.420 align:middle line:84%
For those that don't know
what we're talking about,

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:03.470 align:middle line:90%
who is the lady?

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Based on the way
she interacts with me,

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:12.160 align:middle line:84%
she's some sort of
spirit and in divine way.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:15.360 align:middle line:84%
There's a scripture in
the Bible Daniel 10.

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:18.780 align:middle line:84%
It gives the exact
same description

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:21.360 align:middle line:90%
that I wrote to move on--

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.300 align:middle line:84%
body is glowing
gleaming like glass,

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:30.510 align:middle line:84%
red eyes like torches of
fire glowing brilliantly

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:32.190 align:middle line:90%
same thing I drew.

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:36.750 align:middle line:84%
So they called it
an angel, which

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:39.610 align:middle line:90%
is a messenger from up there.

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:40.410 align:middle line:90%
But what is that?

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:41.550 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what that is.

00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Angel was a word
that they had back then.

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:46.230 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have
another word for it.

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:49.180 align:middle line:90%
Today, we would say anything.

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:51.570 align:middle line:84%
We certainly would
probably refer

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:57.150 align:middle line:84%
to ET or aliens or some
extraterrestrial species that

00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:58.230 align:middle line:90%
is off planet.

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:00.480 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think
that those words were

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.570 align:middle line:90%
being used 2,500 years ago.

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:06.240 align:middle line:84%
>> These are the things that
I know and I've studied with

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:10.890 align:middle line:84%
people like Dr. Diana Pasulka
and others that know that

00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:16.050 align:middle line:84%
it's all biblical that it's
what they were writing about.

00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:18.180 align:middle line:84%
But what was it they
were writing about?

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:20.500 align:middle line:84%
They just interpreted
it that way.

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:23.940 align:middle line:84%
So that's where, I
think, this conversation

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:27.220 align:middle line:84%
has to go to figure
out what it is.

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:29.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Here's the thing,
you take the Bible,

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:37.020 align:middle line:84%
exchange a few words, insert
alien, insert grace, craft,

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:40.260 align:middle line:84%
flying saucer, and you've got
the best science fiction movie

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:41.400 align:middle line:90%
ever.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.350 align:middle line:90%
It's right there in front of us.

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:45.300 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever had
your DNA tested?

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:46.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:49.950 align:middle line:84%
I've had no results on it other
than I know where I'm from

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:52.510 align:middle line:90%
and my ancestry and so on.

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:54.780 align:middle line:84%
That's been a big
thing with NASA

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.150 align:middle line:84%
was the first ones that asked
me, you need to find out--

00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:57.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Why?

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.210 align:middle line:90%
>> --where--

00:26:58.210 --> 00:26:59.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Why would they want to know?

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Because they believe it's
inherited or it comes through

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:06.700 align:middle line:84%
our bloodline
somehow, I don't know.

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:09.660 align:middle line:84%
>> But see, this is
information that they know.

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:14.200 align:middle line:84%
When you hear comments about
the health effects from UAPs,

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.630 align:middle line:84%
and they're talking about
these very specific things,

00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:19.300 align:middle line:84%
they're talking and
asking these questions

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.490 align:middle line:90%
because they have the data.

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:23.360 align:middle line:84%
They know what
they're looking for.

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And if they're
looking at your DNA,

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:27.110 align:middle line:90%
they're doing it for a reason.

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:30.250 align:middle line:84%
>> They're looking more at
my brain trying to figure out

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:35.380 align:middle line:84%
my brain and why it
does what it does.

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:41.060 align:middle line:84%
They have it on camera as
orbs are appearing next to me.

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:44.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm in a calm state, 40 feet
away an orb flies right by us

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:47.057 align:middle line:84%
while other scientists
are monitoring my brain.

00:27:47.057 --> 00:27:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
first time in history

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:49.720 align:middle line:90%
this has ever been done.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:52.430 align:middle line:10%
John Alexander reminded
me of that this week.

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:55.840 align:middle line:10%
But what they said
was a Buddhist

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:59.440 align:middle line:10%
monk could study
for 40 years to get

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:02.080 align:middle line:10%
to this ultimate
state of enlightenment

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:06.170 align:middle line:10%
or I guess is the words are
correct, but I'm able to do it,

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:09.520 align:middle line:10%
they say, just at a
snap of my fingers.

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Instantaneously?

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:11.340 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:13.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Have you ever asked why you?

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>> A thousand times,
and I have no clue.

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.200 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:20.790 align:middle line:84%
I just accept the fact that
that's what's happening.

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:26.850 align:middle line:84%
>> We've all heard in our
community about elements

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:30.810 align:middle line:84%
of the Department of Defense and
inside of the Pentagon that are

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:35.040 align:middle line:84%
very aware of ET and
contact and the phenomenon.

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And they do have a
religious take on this.

00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:41.910 align:middle line:84%
Now these are officials
inside of the Pentagon.

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:45.900 align:middle line:84%
Is that why they have
this interest in the lady?

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that and no, because
the story of Fatima according

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:55.200 align:middle line:84%
to what I've learned,
there's a difference.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:29:00.870 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'm working with
a lot of academics on this.

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:05.040 align:middle line:84%
There were 40,000 people
that saw Fatima, 40,000.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
that they reported,

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.660 align:middle line:84%
which I wasn't aware
of is the setting sun

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:10.800 align:middle line:90%
come out of the sky.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:13.540 align:middle line:90%
>> And it dried them all out.

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:15.400 align:middle line:84%
They were wet from
a thunderstorm.

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.778 align:middle line:90%
Then appears a disk--

00:29:17.778 --> 00:29:18.820 align:middle line:90%
>> In front of everybody.

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:21.940 align:middle line:84%
>> A disk with lights on
it going around the rim.

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And orbs come out of
the sky along with it.

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:27.130 align:middle line:84%
We're all around
orbs and this disk.

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And out comes this little
lady about yay tall.

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And the church called it
the miracle of the sun,

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:38.170 align:middle line:84%
and they claimed
it the Virgin Mary.

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:40.390 align:middle line:90%
Well, we don't know that.

00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:41.750 align:middle line:90%
We don't know who she is.

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:44.140 align:middle line:84%
In fact, some of my
friends in the government

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:46.660 align:middle line:84%
think she's always
been here and been here

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:49.990 align:middle line:84%
a lot longer than the Virgin
Mary would have been here.

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:55.760 align:middle line:84%
She's been reported in every
country for as far back as 3/4

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:56.862 align:middle line:90%
of a million years.

00:29:56.862 --> 00:29:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>> The same lady, though, the
same lady has been reported--

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, exactly my point.

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:01.840 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Josh.

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.180 align:middle line:84%
This is the thing,
the similarities

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:08.410 align:middle line:84%
between your case in Fatima
and Josh's reaction right now

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:13.050 align:middle line:84%
in mind, we all see and
understand what's going on.

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:18.120 align:middle line:84%
But when we look back at
Fatima, a historical case well

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:23.040 align:middle line:84%
documented, but we know that
these three children were

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:26.580 align:middle line:84%
told things that were taken
not only very serious,

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:28.860 align:middle line:90%
but the Vatican is involved.

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:33.930 align:middle line:84%
They want word for word what
was repeated and so forth.

00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:38.850 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel like you've
been told the future?

00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:42.840 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel that you are
now in a position that--

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:46.690 align:middle line:84%
where you're dealing with a lot
of, I'm going to say, pressure?

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:47.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And I've always stayed away
from trying to tell the future.

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:54.600 align:middle line:90%
I've been told a lot of things.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.790 align:middle line:84%
I've shared very
little of it because I

00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:59.880 align:middle line:84%
don't want to sound like
some prophet or anything.

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:03.330 align:middle line:84%
I just want to share the reality
of what's happening here.

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And to answer your question
about my book "UFO of God,"

00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:11.590 align:middle line:84%
the reason I named it that
for one, it's controversial.

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:14.500 align:middle line:84%
For two, you can't read
a book by the cover.

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And for three, it's time that I
believe that the churches need

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:20.950 align:middle line:90%
to start talking about this.

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And we pretty much believe
that the same thing

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:27.790 align:middle line:84%
they were seeing 2,000
years ago is the same thing

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:28.990 align:middle line:90%
we're seeing today.

00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:29.980 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:32.140 align:middle line:84%
They called them
angels in the Bible.

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:33.520 align:middle line:90%
We call them orbs.

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:36.640 align:middle line:84%
We call them the phenomenon
because we really don't know.

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:41.110 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's probably
all in the same pot together.

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:45.790 align:middle line:84%
>> But the conscious connection
is one that we're all

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:47.060 align:middle line:90%
interested in.

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And if consciousness
exists outside of the body,

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:53.620 align:middle line:84%
that means it is
truly universal.

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And ET would understand
that, ET being

00:31:56.650 --> 00:32:01.390 align:middle line:84%
an intelligence-advanced species
beyond us if they are arriving

00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:05.510 align:middle line:84%
at this planet, they know how
to deal with consciousness.

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And so by reaching
out and asking,

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.030 align:middle line:84%
isn't that a clear
indication that we

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:13.980 align:middle line:84%
need to start looking
at consciousness

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:15.930 align:middle line:90%
and how we can communicate?

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:16.800 align:middle line:90%
>> 100%.

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:19.800 align:middle line:84%
That's where the government's
going with it wholeheartedly,

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.540 align:middle line:90%
talking about consciousness.

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:24.510 align:middle line:84%
To give you one little
quick example of something

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:27.660 align:middle line:84%
that I don't make a whole
lot of talk about it

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:32.820 align:middle line:84%
but I've been doing this
since 2016, just recently

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:36.960 align:middle line:84%
in July, the 28th of July,
we conducted an experiment

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:40.420 align:middle line:84%
with a group of folks in
Spain there in Granada, Spain

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:41.220 align:middle line:90%
up on a mountain.

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:42.720 align:middle line:90%
There were 200 people there.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:43.830 align:middle line:90%
They organized it.

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And they called-- they got
the newspaper and the radio

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:47.880 align:middle line:90%
involved.

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:52.050 align:middle line:84%
We had planned for me to try to
get it to appear there, which

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:53.950 align:middle line:90%
I've been successful at doing.

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:55.410 align:middle line:90%
I don't like to say I.

00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:57.090 align:middle line:90%
All I can do is ask.

00:32:57.090 --> 00:32:59.070 align:middle line:90%
It surprises me when it comes.

00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:01.170 align:middle line:90%
But you can see.

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:02.110 align:middle line:90%
You can hear.

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:04.020 align:middle line:90%
We recorded it all on audio.

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:05.640 align:middle line:90%
You can hear all these people.

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.810 align:middle line:90%
I asked them to be quiet.

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:09.060 align:middle line:90%
They were all talking at once.

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:10.518 align:middle line:84%
You had a big crowd
and I said, now

00:33:10.518 --> 00:33:14.470 align:middle line:84%
let's all think about one thing
together about the phenomena,

00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:15.820 align:middle line:90%
think about the lady.

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:18.010 align:middle line:84%
Most of those people
were Catholics anyhow.

00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:22.210 align:middle line:84%
So they're very familiar
with their lady.

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And so I got them
all thinking that.

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And immediately I said,
"I'm going to send you

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:28.960 align:middle line:90%
the vibes right now."

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And instantly, you
should hear the reaction

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:33.910 align:middle line:84%
because the orbs just
started coming right down

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:35.750 align:middle line:84%
through the valleys
right by them.

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:40.570 align:middle line:84%
So, how is that happening
2,000 miles away or however far

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:42.100 align:middle line:90%
to Spain?

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And we've done
this over and over.

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely incredible.

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:50.030 align:middle line:90%
Again, Chris, thank you so much.

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:51.740 align:middle line:90%
I just can't thank you enough.

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:52.870 align:middle line:90%
>> I appreciate you.

00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:54.520 align:middle line:90%
>> This is "Into the Vortex."

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jimmy Church.

00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:57.460 align:middle line:90%
We'll see you next time.

00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:00.810 align:middle line:90%
