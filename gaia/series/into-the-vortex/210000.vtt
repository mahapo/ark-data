I'm your host, Jimmy Church.

is here, geological explorer,

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.390 align:middle line:84%
researcher into sacred

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.140 align:middle line:84%
I've had a lot of
conversations with Randall,

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.530 align:middle line:84%
and I like to affectionately
refer to him, Josh,

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.900 align:middle line:90%
as the beard of knowledge.

Randall, I'm a big
fan of your work.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.450 align:middle line:84%
I think I've listened to you
talk for like 10 to 20 hours.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.530 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I already
know you, and this

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.770 align:middle line:90%
is going to be awesome.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:48.428 align:middle line:90%

>> Well, thanks for
having me, Jimmy.

>> And here's the thing,
the suppression of knowledge

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:00.380 align:middle line:84%
and what we are taught today,
you do the exact opposite

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.620 align:middle line:84%
of that, where you are
trying to expand out,

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.040 align:middle line:84%
get outside of the box, and
try to figure out the hidden

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.610 align:middle line:84%
history that we are not
taught, and I want to thank you

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:11.610 align:middle line:90%
for that.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.030 align:middle line:84%
But before we get
started, how many

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.900 align:middle line:84%
ancient civilizations that
had a technical base to them

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.480 align:middle line:90%
existed before 3,000 BC?

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you're asking the
fundamental question right

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.800 align:middle line:84%
there, and I think it's
a wide open question.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.390 align:middle line:84%
Here's the thing I
like to point out--

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.840 align:middle line:84%
we're finding modern
human skeletons

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.080 align:middle line:84%
that are now robustly dated
to 180 to 200,000 years old.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.770 align:middle line:84%
So you're looking at thousands
of generations of humans

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.510 align:middle line:90%
before recorded history.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And I also like to point out
that if you consider just,

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.420 align:middle line:84%
say, since in the last three
centuries how far we have

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.070 align:middle line:84%
evolved as a technological
industrial civilization,

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.220 align:middle line:84%
and then you try to imagine
how three centuries could

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.200 align:middle line:84%
be lost within the thousands
of years that go back.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm trying
to say is that I

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.040 align:middle line:84%
don't come to the table with
any definitive information,

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.530 align:middle line:84%
only a lot of
circumstantial evidence

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.650 align:middle line:84%
that there was a whole lot more
going on in prehistory than has

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.270 align:middle line:84%
been recognized by mainstream
academia and mainstream

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.070 align:middle line:90%
science.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.660 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of where
I'm coming from.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.050 align:middle line:84%
I also point out when the
standard model of history

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.220 align:middle line:84%
is put forward that one of the
refrains that you hear over

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.067 align:middle line:84%
and over again is the paucity
of artifacts and evidence

00:03:32.067 --> 00:03:33.900 align:middle line:84%
that you can pick up
and hold in your hands.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.620 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, here was
somebody creating pottery

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.340 align:middle line:84%
10,000 years ago,
20,000 years ago, 30,000

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.690 align:middle line:90%
or whatever the case may be.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And it came to my
realization, oh, probably

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.220 align:middle line:84%
at least a quarter
century ago was

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.100 align:middle line:84%
that in the
continuum of history,

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.340 align:middle line:84%
if we go back beyond
what we think of history,

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.100 align:middle line:84%
deep into prehistory,
the deep history

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.770 align:middle line:84%
of the human species
on Earth, what we find

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.300 align:middle line:84%
is that there have been
successive events that

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.740 align:middle line:84%
would completely remodel
the surface of this planet.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Cover up?

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Cover up, destroy, bury.

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And some of what we're
going to talk about today

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.079 align:middle line:84%
is looking at one of the
most recent events that

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.910 align:middle line:90%
affected the entire continent.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And what most people
are not aware of who

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.870 align:middle line:84%
think about these things is
the magnitude and intensity

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.770 align:middle line:84%
of some of these events,
these massive upheavals that

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.340 align:middle line:90%
have affected this planet.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm trying
to bring to the table.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.470 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
be leading a tour,

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.290 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to take 50
people up into the Great Flood

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.490 align:middle line:90%
lands of the Pacific Northwest.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a group of
features up there called

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:47.700 align:middle line:90%
the Channeled Scablands.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.660 align:middle line:10%
One of the magnificent features
of the Channeled Scablands

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.330 align:middle line:10%
is called Grand Coulee,
from which Grand Coulee

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.610 align:middle line:10%
Dam gets its name, the largest
concrete structure in North

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:57.410 align:middle line:10%
America.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, Grand Coulee is a 52 mile
long gash in the basalt bedrock

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.840 align:middle line:90%
that's nearly 1,000 feet deep.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.930 align:middle line:84%
It's from one to
five miles wide,

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.030 align:middle line:84%
and we generally think
of something like that

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.630 align:middle line:84%
as taking millions of years
or at least perhaps hundreds

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:12.740 align:middle line:90%
of thousands of years.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.930 align:middle line:84%
In this case, we're
talking about an event that

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.000 align:middle line:84%
may have taken a
couple of weeks,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.890 align:middle line:84%
with flows on the
order of 300 to 400

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.690 align:middle line:90%
million cubic feet per second.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.240 align:middle line:90%
Now, to give you some--

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.920 align:middle line:84%
>> How many miles
an hour is that?

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.030 align:middle line:90%
Hold on a minute.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.070 align:middle line:84%
>> You're looking at
in that situation,

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.570 align:middle line:84%
you're probably looking
at 50 miles an hour,

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.250 align:middle line:84%
which is much faster than
any river on Earth today.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.010 align:middle line:10%
Now, to give you some kind
of context for understanding

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.240 align:middle line:10%
that, if you took the flow that
just created that one flood

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.240 align:middle line:10%
channel, if you took
the flow, the combined

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.020 align:middle line:10%
flow of every single river on
Earth from every continent--

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.050 align:middle line:10%
all the big ones, all the little
ones, all the ones in between,

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.020 align:middle line:10%
added them all
together, you're still

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.040 align:middle line:10%
not even 10% of the flow that
created Grand Coulee, and that

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.360 align:middle line:10%
was just one flow of
dozens of gigantic flows

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.900 align:middle line:10%
that were part of
this transition out

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.870 align:middle line:10%
of the former world
age, which geologists

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.680 align:middle line:10%
would call the late Pleistocene,
into the modern age,

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.400 align:middle line:10%
the modern geological epoch,
which is called the Holocene.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And it is within the roughly
11,600 years of the Holocene

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.140 align:middle line:84%
that basically
modern history began.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.790 align:middle line:84%
We look back 8,000
to 10,000 years ago

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.790 align:middle line:84%
and we see the
domestication of animals.

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:30.680 align:middle line:84%
We see the dispersion
of languages.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.220 align:middle line:84%
We see the first
urban complexes.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.950 align:middle line:84%
Multiple things that we
think of as being the genesis

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.750 align:middle line:90%
of modern civilization.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.350 align:middle line:84%
I contend that we should
look at that as perhaps

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:48.080 align:middle line:90%
a rebooting of civilization.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.415 align:middle line:84%
>> That has happened
multiple times in the past.

00:06:50.415 --> 00:06:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes it could have happened
multiple times in the past.

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:55.050 align:middle line:84%
Because within the last
quarter million years,

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.080 align:middle line:84%
there have been a
succession of glacial ages

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.470 align:middle line:84%
that have come and gone, that
the onset of the glacial age,

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.400 align:middle line:84%
the termination of a glacial age
can be profoundly catastrophic.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let's establish
something here.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.710 align:middle line:84%
The repeated dogma, and I
always use the word dogma

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.510 align:middle line:84%
because you repeat
something often enough,

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:16.420 align:middle line:90%
it becomes a truth.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.460 align:middle line:90%
>> 3,000 BC is it.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.590 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing before.

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Don't talk to us about
anything before 3,000 BC.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.250 align:middle line:84%
We have ancient Sumer,
we have ancient Egypt,

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:32.540 align:middle line:84%
and the dawn of civilization
was right there at 3,000 BC.

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.870 align:middle line:84%
If something else pops
up, give us a call,

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.270 align:middle line:90%
but right now it's 3,000 BC.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:44.630 align:middle line:84%
This number this, 10,500 BC
number, 11,500 years ago,

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.090 align:middle line:84%
12,000 years ago
from present day

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:51.140 align:middle line:84%
is now present in just
about every continent

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:54.290 align:middle line:84%
and every civilization
right now on Earth.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:57.710 align:middle line:10%
Which brings me to Gobekli Tepe.

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:03.650 align:middle line:84%
Gobekli Tepe is 7,000 years
before this 3,000 BC number,

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:07.820 align:middle line:84%
and it is evidence of an
ancient advanced civilization,

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.690 align:middle line:84%
and that clearly says things
aren't what they seem,

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:15.170 align:middle line:84%
and it goes back to
this 10,500 BC number

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:16.950 align:middle line:90%
that you just referred to here.

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:17.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Is Gobekli Tepe just
that, evidence of an advanced

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:23.600 align:middle line:90%
civilization?

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it certainly is more
advanced than the conventional

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:30.620 align:middle line:84%
models, the dogmas would
recognize and admit.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:31.580 align:middle line:90%
But there it is.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:32.809 align:middle line:90%
You can't dispute it.

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And it shows a tremendous
level of social organization

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:42.020 align:middle line:84%
that would be in my mind
beyond the capabilities

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.330 align:middle line:84%
of a nomadic hunter/gatherer
tribe or even subsistence

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:46.130 align:middle line:90%
farmers.

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:49.430 align:middle line:84%
It's like so many of the ancient
artifacts or great structures.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:53.150 align:middle line:84%
You have to ask, why
would subsistence farmers

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:57.830 align:middle line:84%
or nomadic hunter/gatherers find
the time or even the motivation

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:00.410 align:middle line:84%
to create these tremendous
structures that we find

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:01.910 align:middle line:90%
all over the ancient world?

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:05.330 align:middle line:84%
I contend that the youngest
dating of Gobekli Tepe--

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:06.920 align:middle line:84%
and it could be much
older than this.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.280 align:middle line:90%
It's about 11,500 years--

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Coincides exactly with the
end of the so-called Younger

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:17.660 align:middle line:84%
Dryas 3,500-year episode that
essentially brought the great

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:19.430 align:middle line:90%
Ice Age to an end.

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And the Younger
Dryas began around

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:27.320 align:middle line:84%
12,900 years ago with a
possible cosmic impact,

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.600 align:middle line:90%
a possible solar event.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.800 align:middle line:90%
I think it could have involved--

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.780 align:middle line:84%
I think there's actually not
just one single catastrophe

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:37.100 align:middle line:90%
but a succession.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.860 align:middle line:84%
I think we're actually looking
at the end of the last Ice Age.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:45.600 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at a cluster
of catastrophic events

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.070 align:middle line:84%
that could have
involved the sun.

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:49.590 align:middle line:84%
One of the interesting
things is that we've now have

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:54.120 align:middle line:84%
been observing the sun since
the '90s with satellite

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.700 align:middle line:84%
surveys of the sun
and discovering

00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:00.930 align:middle line:84%
that it's a lot more variable
than was previously recognized.

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:03.150 align:middle line:84%
Generally, the
model of the sun was

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.520 align:middle line:84%
based upon this idea
of the solar constant,

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.680 align:middle line:84%
and it may not be
nearly as constant

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.760 align:middle line:84%
as the early
assumptions recognized.

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And so the thing that
to me is interesting

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:18.390 align:middle line:84%
is that there is a family of
comets called the Great Sun

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:20.610 align:middle line:84%
Grazers, and others
that usually when

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:23.190 align:middle line:84%
a comet comes into the
inner solar system,

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:25.170 align:middle line:90%
it goes through a life cycle.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:26.670 align:middle line:84%
It comes from deep
space, where it's

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:28.140 align:middle line:90%
almost like in hyper sleep.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.640 align:middle line:90%
It's in deep freeze.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.680 align:middle line:84%
As it comes in to the
inner solar system,

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:35.250 align:middle line:84%
it begins coming into the
realm of the giant planets

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.890 align:middle line:84%
and then towards the
sun, it becomes active,

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:39.210 align:middle line:90%
and it begins to outgassing.

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And then it's like it wakes
up from its hibernation

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.070 align:middle line:84%
and begins to go through
this whole cycle.

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:46.560 align:middle line:84%
Eventually what it does
is it will disintegrate.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.270 align:middle line:84%
A comet nucleus is a
very friable object,

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.430 align:middle line:84%
and it will easily
get ripped apart.

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:57.570 align:middle line:10%
We saw this in 1994 with
the Shoemaker-Levy 9,

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:01.740 align:middle line:10%
which was discovered
in March of '93--

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:05.460 align:middle line:10%
March of '93, and it had just
made a close grazing passage

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:08.490 align:middle line:10%
of Jupiter, and Jupiter's
intense gravity field

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:13.050 align:middle line:10%
ripped one comet nucleus
into 21 separate nuclei.

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:16.410 align:middle line:84%
That chain of pearls as it was
called, passed around the sun.

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And then as it
made its next pass

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.620 align:middle line:84%
around the Jovian or Jupiter
orbit, it slammed into Jupiter.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Impacted one after another.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.530 align:middle line:90%
>> One after another, right.

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:28.300 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now if it
had missed Jupiter

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.540 align:middle line:84%
but had made another
close grazing pass,

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.600 align:middle line:84%
those 21 probably would
have further disintegrated.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.540 align:middle line:84%
What it would have ultimately
led to is a meteor stream.

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And so all the
great meteor streams

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.830 align:middle line:84%
that we recognize, from the
draconids to the Leonids

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:44.040 align:middle line:84%
to the Taurids to the
Geminids and so forth all

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.630 align:middle line:90%
had progenitor comets.

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's an idea that is
gaining momentum that somewhere

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:51.600 align:middle line:84%
between 20,000 and
30,000 years ago,

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.550 align:middle line:84%
probably associated
with the onset of what's

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:56.490 align:middle line:84%
called the late glacial
maximum, the planet

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:59.880 align:middle line:84%
was plunged into
this brutal cold.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:04.350 align:middle line:84%
It may have been triggered
by a large, huge progenitor

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:06.360 align:middle line:84%
comet coming into the
inner solar system.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.540 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about one that
might be 60 to 100 miles

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.170 align:middle line:90%
in diameter or greater.

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:13.500 align:middle line:84%
This comet nucleus
then began to undergo

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.810 align:middle line:84%
a hierarchy of
disintegration, littering

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:18.450 align:middle line:84%
the inner solar
system with debris.

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:22.860 align:middle line:84%
Earth may have encountered the
debris, macroscale stuff that

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:25.410 align:middle line:84%
could have been
kilometers in diameter

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:28.680 align:middle line:84%
or even microscale stuff that
had been like the dust that's

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:29.970 align:middle line:90%
generated from this.

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Each of these kinds
of things could

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.760 align:middle line:90%
have had different effects.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.670 align:middle line:84%
An impact of a macroscale
object like, say,

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:37.890 align:middle line:84%
something that's half
a kilometer in diameter

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:41.070 align:middle line:84%
into a continental
landmass would

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:42.900 align:middle line:90%
have one suite of effects.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:45.240 align:middle line:84%
Into the ocean would have
another suite of effects.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And so if you have
an impact into the land,

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:50.820 align:middle line:84%
it's going to inject
huge amounts of dust

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:53.190 align:middle line:84%
into the atmosphere,
cause tremendous fires.

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:54.930 align:middle line:84%
The soot, the
dust, everything is

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:57.660 align:middle line:84%
going to increase the
opacity of the atmosphere,

00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:00.540 align:middle line:84%
cause solar radiation to
be reflected back out.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:01.740 align:middle line:90%
Cannot penetrate.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.660 align:middle line:84%
This would cause a
very abrupt cooling,

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:07.440 align:middle line:84%
which has been referred
to as a cosmic winter.

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.480 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, an
impact into an ocean

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.480 align:middle line:84%
is going to loft tremendous
amounts of water vapor

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.360 align:middle line:84%
into the atmosphere, which is
the most potent greenhouse gas.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.880 align:middle line:84%
This could cause a
runaway greenhouse effect

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.350 align:middle line:84%
until that water
vapor dissipated out

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:21.150 align:middle line:90%
of the atmosphere.

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:23.813 align:middle line:84%
And in the process
of that water vapor

00:13:23.813 --> 00:13:25.230 align:middle line:84%
dissipating out
of the atmosphere,

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:27.690 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
ungodly rainstorms.

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.390 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have these
ungodly fluvial events that

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:33.010 align:middle line:84%
could spread around large
regions of the planet.

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:34.842 align:middle line:84%
And I think in some
of the photographs

00:13:34.842 --> 00:13:37.050 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to be
including in this discussion,

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:40.080 align:middle line:84%
I've shown a sample of areas
from all around the North

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.062 align:middle line:84%
American continent where
the evidence overwhelmingly

00:13:43.062 --> 00:13:44.520 align:middle line:84%
supports the notion
that there have

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.710 align:middle line:90%
been these gigantic floods.

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:51.570 align:middle line:84%
>> But doesn't that coincide
with all of the flood myths--

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:52.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:56.130 align:middle line:84%
>> With every culture here
on this planet going back

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:58.500 align:middle line:90%
to 10,500 BC.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:02.340 align:middle line:84%
This story repeats over
and over again, doesn't it?

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:05.130 align:middle line:90%
>> All over the world.

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at the
research of Marine geologists,

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:12.300 align:middle line:84%
oceanographers who studied
the rise of sea level

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.940 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the Ice Age--
because during the Ice Age,

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.720 align:middle line:84%
you had more than double the
amount of ice now mantling

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:19.950 align:middle line:90%
the surface of the world.

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:24.940 align:middle line:84%
More than double Greenland
and Antarctica together.

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And so you had somewhere around
six million cubic miles of ice

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:31.500 align:middle line:84%
piled up on the
continents, North America

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:35.740 align:middle line:84%
primarily but also
Northwestern Europe.

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And because of this, all
of this is water lofted out

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:43.480 align:middle line:84%
of the ocean, frozen into
ice, stored on the continents

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.700 align:middle line:90%
for 10,000 15,000 years.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.250 align:middle line:84%
Then when the melt down
came, all of that water

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:51.460 align:middle line:84%
goes back into the ocean,
and it created a differential

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:54.340 align:middle line:84%
of about 400 feet
between the level

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:57.170 align:middle line:84%
that it's at now and
the lowest sea level.

00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:01.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we look at that
beginning of recorded history,

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:05.920 align:middle line:84%
that 3,000 BC, in
the aftermath of

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.460 align:middle line:84%
these tremendous catastrophes
that terminated the great Ice

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:11.590 align:middle line:84%
Age, one of the things
that we know that happened

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:14.260 align:middle line:84%
was that half of the
great megafaunal species

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.420 align:middle line:84%
of the planet were
just wiped out.

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:19.000 align:middle line:84%
The woolly mammoths,
the sabertoothed cats,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.320 align:middle line:90%
the giant ground sloths--

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Overnight.

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:23.780 align:middle line:84%
>> In a geological
sense, overnight.

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:28.300 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it may have been
several waves of extinction,

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.880 align:middle line:84%
but the point is that
the extinction was not

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.460 align:middle line:84%
a gradual Darwinian
type of process.

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:35.660 align:middle line:90%
It was a catastrophic process.

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:40.000 align:middle line:84%
What that means is that in order
to affect an equivalent species

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.100 align:middle line:84%
level extinction
event, you would

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.860 align:middle line:84%
have to destroy
every animal on Earth

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.640 align:middle line:90%
over 100 pounds in body weight.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, an event of that
severity and magnitude,

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:52.930 align:middle line:84%
you think it's going to leave
the human species unaffected?

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:54.190 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:57.520 align:middle line:84%
How they've gotten around that,
of course, is by conjuring up

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:02.200 align:middle line:84%
this fantastical notion that
Paleo Indian hunters hunted,

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.990 align:middle line:84%
well, the mammoths
because of a few examples

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:08.440 align:middle line:84%
like it in New Mexico
at Blackwater Draw,

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:12.040 align:middle line:84%
there was a skeleton of
a woolly mammoth found.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Embedded in the mammoth's rib
cage was a Clovis spear point.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:16.180 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.805 align:middle line:84%
>> Now you extrapolate
from there, oh,

00:16:17.805 --> 00:16:19.180 align:middle line:84%
the Clovis were
hunting mammoths,

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:20.380 align:middle line:90%
which they probably were.

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:26.680 align:middle line:84%
But it's a far cry from assuming
that maybe a population of 10

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.670 align:middle line:84%
million people-- and this is
pretty much the academically

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:32.550 align:middle line:84%
accepted number for
the late Ice Age--

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:36.360 align:middle line:84%
could exterminate
10 million mammoths.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.957 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you look at
10 million people,

00:16:37.957 --> 00:16:39.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how many of
those are hunters?

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.790 align:middle line:84%
You're looking at elderly,
you're looking at children,

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:43.120 align:middle line:90%
you're looking at the women.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.370 align:middle line:90%
How many of those are hunters?

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:46.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, how could you
possibly even affect that?

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And then what happened
to the mastodons?

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:52.050 align:middle line:84%
What happened to the
giant ground sloths?

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:55.800 align:middle line:84%
What happened to the huge Irish
elk with antlers spans up to 10

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:56.640 align:middle line:90%
and 12 feet?

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the list could
go on and on and on.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And when we find their
remains, their remains

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:05.970 align:middle line:84%
are found in peat bogs,
gravel pits, and so on where--

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:07.230 align:middle line:90%
or permafrost.

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:09.720 align:middle line:84%
Now a gravel pit, how does
a gravel pit get there?

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:13.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, a gravel pit is a result
of this tremendously violent,

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:15.660 align:middle line:90%
highly energetic, fluvial event.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.210 align:middle line:84%
Flowing water will
strip bedrock.

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:19.380 align:middle line:90%
It'll bust it up.

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And the end result, when
that stuff is carried along

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:25.589 align:middle line:90%
is it creates a gravel deposit.

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:28.319 align:middle line:84%
And so we find bones
in gravel deposits.

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:31.260 align:middle line:84%
The remains of these over
and over and over again

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:32.610 align:middle line:90%
found in gravel deposits.

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:35.130 align:middle line:84%
Peat bogs, where if you
have a low lying area,

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:36.450 align:middle line:90%
the water is swept in.

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:39.450 align:middle line:84%
It's loaded with organic
material and sediment,

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:43.627 align:middle line:84%
and it settles in, and it forms
peat after a period of time.

00:17:43.627 --> 00:17:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And in that peat,
you find the remains

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:46.690 align:middle line:90%
of these extinct animals.

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:49.027 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm getting
at here is an event

00:17:49.027 --> 00:17:50.610 align:middle line:84%
of that severity is
not going to leave

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:52.680 align:middle line:90%
the human species unaffected.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think that when you
have an event like we're

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:58.830 align:middle line:84%
talking about here, I've kind
of come to the conclusion

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:01.800 align:middle line:84%
that you had two
classes of survivors.

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.990 align:middle line:10%
There's a genetic
bottleneck suggesting

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:06.450 align:middle line:10%
that the human
population was reduced

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:10.200 align:middle line:10%
to numbers that could have been
vulnerable to mass extinction

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.330 align:middle line:10%
of our own species.

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:15.120 align:middle line:10%
The model I think
that's emerging

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.910 align:middle line:10%
is that you had in the
aftermath of these events,

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:23.020 align:middle line:10%
bands of scattered survivors who
are isolated from one another.

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And when you begin to appreciate
the magnitude of these events,

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:28.680 align:middle line:84%
one of the things
you understand is

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:32.130 align:middle line:84%
that if you had a group
that survived by, say,

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:35.520 align:middle line:84%
by the luck of the
draw, in the aftermath,

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.350 align:middle line:84%
they would have no
way of communicating

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:38.760 align:middle line:90%
with anyone else in the world.

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.170 align:middle line:90%
They would be isolated.

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:43.530 align:middle line:84%
They would have no
understanding or comprehension

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:47.520 align:middle line:84%
that the whole world
hadn't been destroyed.

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.530 align:middle line:84%
Certain people were
given forewarning

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:52.710 align:middle line:84%
of this impending disaster
by somebody who knew.

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:56.880 align:middle line:84%
And I go back to the
Shoemaker-Levy 9 event.

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, we were able to
predict a year in advance

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:03.450 align:middle line:84%
that these comets, these
nuclei were going to plunge--

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:04.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Impact into Jupiter.

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, yes, now imagine
that we discover a comet

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:12.240 align:middle line:84%
that's on an elliptical orbit,
and we fast forward its orbit,

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.830 align:middle line:90%
and we run the orbital elements.

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And we discover, you
know what, in 30 years,

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.980 align:middle line:84%
this comet is crossing
the Earth's orbit

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:21.530 align:middle line:84%
at the exact moment
Earth is there.

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:24.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have 20
years or whatever

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:25.610 align:middle line:90%
to prepare for that event.

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:26.490 align:middle line:90%
What do we do?

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:28.340 align:middle line:10%
Do we try to avert
the catastrophe?

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:29.590 align:middle line:10%
Do we try to ride it out?

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:30.390 align:middle line:10%
What do we do?

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:32.720 align:middle line:10%
Do we inform the
populace at large

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.660 align:middle line:10%
that this is about to
happen, or do the people that

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:39.650 align:middle line:10%
have this knowledge, do
they selectively go around

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:44.510 align:middle line:10%
and inform people that if you
do this or that, you'll survive?

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:47.030 align:middle line:84%
The other cosmic
event that I think

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:49.310 align:middle line:84%
is sort of a cosmic
teaching lesson

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:51.680 align:middle line:90%
was the Tunguska Event of 1908.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:52.520 align:middle line:10%
>> In Russia.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.350 align:middle line:10%
>> In Russia, in Siberia.

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:57.050 align:middle line:10%
June 30, early in
the morning of 1908.

00:19:57.050 --> 00:20:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And what we saw there
was Comet Encke probably

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:04.850 align:middle line:84%
spawned a whole family
of meteor streams,

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:07.550 align:middle line:84%
asteroidal bodies,
and cometary bodies

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:09.260 align:middle line:90%
of which Tunguska was one.

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:12.230 align:middle line:84%
Because for one thing, Earth
crosses the Taurid meteor

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:13.470 align:middle line:90%
stream twice each year.

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:14.270 align:middle line:90%
>> It does.

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:17.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Once about Halloween and the
other late June, early July.

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:20.870 align:middle line:10%
So you had the timing
was appropriate for it

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:22.940 align:middle line:10%
to be a member of
the Taurid stream.

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:26.360 align:middle line:10%
And also, its radiant
point in space--

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.270 align:middle line:10%
the point at which it appeared
to emanate from space--

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:31.640 align:middle line:10%
also almost perfectly
bullseyed on

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:34.100 align:middle line:10%
where a Taurid object
would be coming from.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:38.120 align:middle line:84%
So that object did not
strike the Earth like, say,

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:42.290 align:middle line:84%
the famous meteor crater
in Arizona, the big bowl,

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:44.000 align:middle line:90%
kilometer-wide, 600 feet deep.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.810 align:middle line:84%
That was the result of an actual
impact of an iron asteroid

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:50.150 align:middle line:90%
into the ground.

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:51.410 align:middle line:90%
Tunguska was different.

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:54.050 align:middle line:84%
It exploded about five
miles in the atmosphere.

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:55.720 align:middle line:84%
>> It was an
atmospheric explosion.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.178 align:middle line:84%
>> It was an
atmospheric explosion.

00:20:57.178 --> 00:20:57.978 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:57.978 --> 00:21:00.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Now, one of the things that
it did was the pressure wave,

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:05.810 align:middle line:10%
the blast wave moving outwards
flattened over 800 square miles

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:09.650 align:middle line:10%
of old growth taiga forest,
which is roughly the area

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:12.950 align:middle line:10%
of most urban cities in America.

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:16.370 align:middle line:84%
Washington DC, if you took
the perimeter highway,

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:19.070 align:middle line:84%
that would be pretty much the
area within that perimeter

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:20.540 align:middle line:90%
highway.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.290 align:middle line:90%
It exploded in the air.

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:27.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, when the US bombed
Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.210 align:middle line:90%
they set those bombs.

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:31.790 align:middle line:84%
You think of in the tradition
of the conventional sense,

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:34.310 align:middle line:84%
a bomb falls, it hits
the ground, explodes.

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:36.780 align:middle line:84%
They were set to explode
in the atmosphere.

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:39.080 align:middle line:84%
The reason, a greater
radius of destruction.

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:43.550 align:middle line:84%
Because now the ground is not
absorbing a lot of that energy.

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:49.130 align:middle line:84%
It's free to spread out and
destroy buildings in cities

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:50.390 align:middle line:90%
and all of that kind of stuff.

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:55.460 align:middle line:84%
It is estimated that the
force of that Tunguska blast

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:58.220 align:middle line:84%
was around 15,
maybe 20 megatons,

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:01.160 align:middle line:84%
which is in the class
of the largest hydrogen

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.710 align:middle line:84%
bonds ever tested
by the United States

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:05.450 align:middle line:90%
back in the '50s and '60s.

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:08.322 align:middle line:10%
Now, when you go back
to the Cold War and you

00:22:08.322 --> 00:22:10.280 align:middle line:10%
think about this-- and
I'm getting to the point

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.780 align:middle line:10%
here-- when you
think about this,

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:16.370 align:middle line:10%
what did what were the
strategies by the two sides

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:19.970 align:middle line:10%
during the Cold War to be able
to ride out a nuclear war?

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:23.427 align:middle line:10%
Well, you created super hardened
command and control centers.

00:22:23.427 --> 00:22:24.260 align:middle line:10%
And where were they?

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:25.520 align:middle line:10%
They were underground.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:26.840 align:middle line:90%
They built missile silos.

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:27.290 align:middle line:90%
Where were they?

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:28.207 align:middle line:90%
They were underground.

00:22:28.207 --> 00:22:31.610 align:middle line:84%
They were buried because by
being buried underground,

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:34.380 align:middle line:84%
they're going to be able to
ride out the blast effects.

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:35.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Survive.

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:36.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Survive.

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:38.360 align:middle line:84%
It always occurred
to me that could that

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:42.570 align:middle line:84%
have been part of the motive
for burying Gobekli Tepe.

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:46.040 align:middle line:84%
>> But that would suggest that
these cultures had an advanced

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.370 align:middle line:90%
knowledge of astronomy.

00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:48.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:50.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And they are able to
peer into the heavens.

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:51.200 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.910 align:middle line:84%
See, it would
follow that if they

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:55.940 align:middle line:84%
had a knowledge of astronomy
that they would also

00:22:55.940 --> 00:23:00.000 align:middle line:84%
be able to have knowledge
of navigational skills.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's take it
to the next level.

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:06.450 align:middle line:84%
Was there a transoceanic
culture before there were boats?

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:07.250 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:08.900 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
that would suggest.

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:12.660 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I mean, that's what
Plato's accounts say and others

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:13.460 align:middle line:10%
would suggest.

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:18.500 align:middle line:10%
I mean, Plato very explicitly
describes a maritime culture

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.710 align:middle line:10%
that you may think of as the
Phoenicians or the Minoans.

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:23.660 align:middle line:84%
But anyways, one of
the interesting things

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.215 align:middle line:84%
that really intrigued me
there was by sailing West

00:23:26.215 --> 00:23:27.590 align:middle line:84%
from the Pillars
of Hercules, you

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:31.610 align:middle line:84%
came to a couple of islands, and
then you sailed beyond those.

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And we now know
it's been proven,

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.630 align:middle line:84%
the Spartel Bank
hypothesis has proven

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:38.090 align:middle line:84%
that there are sunken
islands immediately

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:41.180 align:middle line:84%
to the West of the
Pillars of Hercules.

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:45.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, if we take all of
your research and just lump it

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:48.387 align:middle line:84%
together, this is what
I find interesting.

00:23:48.387 --> 00:23:50.220 align:middle line:84%
Let me throw this over
to Josh for a second.

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.740 align:middle line:90%
Let me ask you a question, Josh.

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:54.320 align:middle line:84%
The age of the Earth is four
and a half billion years.

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:59.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Life on Earth, three billion,
two and a half billion years.

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:01.560 align:middle line:90%
That's a pretty long time.

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And if we are scrubbing
the planet for 5 to 10

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:08.630 align:middle line:84%
million years at a
time, we're erasing

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:12.080 align:middle line:84%
any evidence of an
advanced civilization

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.520 align:middle line:90%
over and over again.

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:17.750 align:middle line:84%
Would it surprise you that
in any slice of that time

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:20.210 align:middle line:84%
span of three
billion years that we

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:22.940 align:middle line:84%
could have had civilizations
rise and go away

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:24.777 align:middle line:84%
and we would never
know it, right?

00:24:24.777 --> 00:24:27.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Not at all, especially
after conversations like this.

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:28.940 align:middle line:90%
It seems maybe that's the rule.

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:30.095 align:middle line:90%
It's obvious.

00:24:30.095 --> 00:24:31.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that the case?

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:33.680 align:middle line:84%
If we look at your
research that we're just

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.927 align:middle line:84%
scrubbing the evidence
over and over again.

00:24:35.927 --> 00:24:37.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Let me put it this way.

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:40.460 align:middle line:84%
If events on the scale,
magnitude, and severity

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:44.480 align:middle line:84%
of those Younger Dryas
events happened now

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:47.420 align:middle line:84%
and you had archeologists
10,000 years from now,

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:49.233 align:middle line:84%
they would be hard
pressed to find evidence

00:24:49.233 --> 00:24:50.150 align:middle line:90%
that we had been here.

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:51.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Except for the Great Pyramid.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:52.580 align:middle line:90%
It would still be there.

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:53.434 align:middle line:90%
>> Probably.

00:24:53.434 --> 00:24:54.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Probably.

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:55.970 align:middle line:90%
But that that's the case, right?

00:24:55.970 --> 00:25:00.800 align:middle line:10%
If we went 50,000 years in the--
if we had some event happen

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:04.490 align:middle line:10%
here, and ET arrives
in 50,000 years

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:09.860 align:middle line:10%
to check out this beautiful blue
planet, what would they find?

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:11.480 align:middle line:10%
Nothing, right?

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:12.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Not much.

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:16.490 align:middle line:10%
I mean, what's going to exist
in an event like that to me

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:19.100 align:middle line:10%
is megalithic stone work,
which brings us back

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:24.190 align:middle line:10%
to Gobekli Tepe, which brings us
back to the Sphinx, limestone,

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:24.990 align:middle line:10%
bedrock.

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:26.390 align:middle line:10%
It's not a freestanding statue.

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:29.090 align:middle line:10%
It's actually carved
out of virgin bedrock,

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:31.610 align:middle line:10%
so it's part of the bedrock.

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we see all
around it the evidence

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:36.080 align:middle line:90%
of tremendous water flows.

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And there's evidence
that the Nile River,

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:41.390 align:middle line:84%
even scientifically
verified evidence

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:44.030 align:middle line:84%
that the Nile River
has experienced

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:46.640 align:middle line:84%
these extraordinary
floods up to depths

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.370 align:middle line:84%
of greater than 120 feet
above the modern flood

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:52.160 align:middle line:84%
plain, which would completely
submerge most of the Giza

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.210 align:middle line:90%
Plateau.

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:55.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let me ask
you a question, Josh.

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:57.290 align:middle line:90%
Why suppress this knowledge?

00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:00.200 align:middle line:84%
If that is the case,
why suppress it?

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.600 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it something that
we should all share?

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:03.620 align:middle line:90%
Why do you think--

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know why
they're suppressing it,

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.670 align:middle line:84%
but this is an
illuminating conversation,

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:09.890 align:middle line:84%
but it does fill me with
a little bit of fear.

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:12.710 align:middle line:84%
Like how do we predict the
next extinction level event?

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:13.710 align:middle line:90%
What do we look out for?

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:15.502 align:middle line:84%
I mean, should I make
friends with everyone

00:26:15.502 --> 00:26:17.030 align:middle line:90%
I know who works in a bunker?

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:19.160 align:middle line:90%
Like what's next, Randall?

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, first of all--

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you have a bunker?

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:25.410 align:middle line:90%
>> No, but it's not a bad idea.

00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:26.370 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not a bad idea.

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:27.170 align:middle line:90%
However--

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:27.970 align:middle line:90%
>> However.

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:31.100 align:middle line:84%
>> However, I would like
to think optimistically.

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:32.840 align:middle line:84%
Something's going to
happen that's going

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:36.530 align:middle line:84%
to trigger an awakening
that our planet is

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:38.720 align:middle line:90%
part of a cosmic ecosystem.

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.430 align:middle line:84%
It's part of a
cosmic environment.

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And regularly through the
history of this planet,

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:45.200 align:middle line:84%
there have been interactions
between our terrestrial realm

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.140 align:middle line:90%
and the cosmic realm.

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:48.920 align:middle line:90%
>> That's important right there.

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:53.930 align:middle line:84%
This is why I'm excited about
the James Webb Telescope,

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:56.340 align:middle line:84%
the Artemis mission
back to the moon.

00:26:56.340 --> 00:27:00.410 align:middle line:84%
It's been proposed that
the moon could be a place

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:03.750 align:middle line:84%
to try to establish
some ark, if you will,

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:07.160 align:middle line:84%
that we could preserve
the knowledge and wisdom

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.140 align:middle line:84%
and science of our own
times if there was--

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:10.140 align:middle line:90%
>> A little DNA.

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:10.940 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:11.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:12.438 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right, right.

00:27:12.438 --> 00:27:16.790 align:middle line:84%
>> On the other hand, if we
were faced with an event that we

00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:20.045 align:middle line:90%
knew based upon the time frame--

00:27:20.045 --> 00:27:22.670 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned earlier, if we knew
there was an event coming in 30

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:24.930 align:middle line:90%
years, well, we've got options.

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:27.230 align:middle line:84%
One option would
be is that if we've

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:30.410 align:middle line:84%
got a large asteroid that
we see is on a collision

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:34.790 align:middle line:84%
course with Earth and we have
30 years or 40 or 50 years

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:36.550 align:middle line:90%
of lead time, well we can--

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Divert it.

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:39.440 align:middle line:84%
>> We can divert it.
yes, we can divert it.

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:42.260 align:middle line:84%
Let's say we discover
we've only got a few years,

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:45.620 align:middle line:84%
and we realize our
possibilities of diverting

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:49.140 align:middle line:90%
it are not necessarily optimum.

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:50.940 align:middle line:90%
So what do we do?

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:53.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, then we have to
create places of refuge

00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:55.870 align:middle line:90%
to try to ride it out.

00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:58.300 align:middle line:10%
Where would be one
obvious place that we

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:01.360 align:middle line:10%
might try to survive
an event that

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:06.070 align:middle line:10%
could affect large areas
of the entire globe?

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:10.030 align:middle line:10%
Well, I think it's right
out there in front of us.

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I think it's the
bunker in your backyard.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And here's the thing, right now,
NASA's got the DART mission,

00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:22.690 align:middle line:84%
and that DART mission is
to deflect an asteroid,

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:26.620 align:middle line:84%
and that's going down
over the next year.

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And now, the asteroid
that they are

00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:33.950 align:middle line:84%
going to be testing,
if you will,

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:36.850 align:middle line:84%
is not in a collision course
to Earth, but it's a big one.

00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And so if they can just
a fraction of a degree,

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:45.160 align:middle line:84%
right-- if something is on a
collision course with Earth

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.800 align:middle line:84%
with the distance
of space in between,

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.663 align:middle line:84%
it only takes a
fraction of a degree.

00:28:49.663 --> 00:28:51.205 align:middle line:84%
It's just a little
bit of diversion--

00:28:51.205 --> 00:28:52.450 align:middle line:90%
>> A nudge.

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:56.125 align:middle line:84%
>> A nudge and we can save
the planet, so there you go.

00:28:56.125 --> 00:28:57.250 align:middle line:90%
Randall, thank you so much.

00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Can I just say, if
people want to learn more,

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:04.210 align:middle line:84%
I've got a whole lot of
stuff on RandallCarlson.com.

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's growing, and
some really cool stuff

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:10.690 align:middle line:84%
is in the pipeline I want
people to become aware of.

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Randall, you are
the beard of knowledge.

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.290 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
being with us today
