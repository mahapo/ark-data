00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.500 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm radio and television
host, Jimmy Church,

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.350 align:middle line:84%
and I am here to uncover
the truth about some

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.700 align:middle line:90%
of life's biggest mysteries.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.360 align:middle line:84%
If this is revealed,
everything has to be rewritten.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.540 align:middle line:84%
My guest today is Matthew James
Bailey, a globally recognized

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.600 align:middle line:84%
authority in innovation,
artificial intelligence,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.090 align:middle line:84%
and the internet
of things, who has

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.770 align:middle line:84%
collaborated with dignitaries,
ministers, and prime ministers.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that the human
species is about to awaken

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.850 align:middle line:84%
into something
that is remarkable.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that every
aspect of the universe

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.640 align:middle line:90%
is being invited into this.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>> As always, MUFON
field investigator Josh--

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.840 align:middle line:90%
Josh, can you pull up the map?

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>> --joins us to
help set the scene.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.150 align:middle line:84%
Join us as we dive deep to
get to the bottom of some

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.370 align:middle line:84%
of the most intriguing
questions of our time.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Why wouldn't life be more
interesting than just what we

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.050 align:middle line:90%
see?

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.625 align:middle line:90%
We know it's beyond that.

00:01:08.625 --> 00:01:21.590 align:middle line:90%


00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.060 align:middle line:10%
>> This is "Into the Vortex."

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm Jimmy Church, and my guest
today is Matthew James Bailey.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.420 align:middle line:84%
And he's known for
pioneering advances

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.420 align:middle line:84%
into the ethical use of
artificial intelligence.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.010 align:middle line:84%
That's not what
we're necessarily

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.420 align:middle line:90%
going to talk about today.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.050 align:middle line:84%
I want to go into consciousness
and human development.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Me, too.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.650 align:middle line:84%
>> But with that, Josh, have
you ever thought about you,

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.500 align:middle line:84%
what makes you, you, and
could it be connected to ones

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.600 align:middle line:84%
and zeros, and could artificial
intelligence have an effect

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.430 align:middle line:90%
on your consciousness?

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.222 align:middle line:84%
>> I haven't had that
thought specifically,

00:01:57.222 --> 00:01:58.638 align:middle line:84%
but I know what
you're getting at.

00:01:58.638 --> 00:02:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And yes, I pondered
about my own existence

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.250 align:middle line:84%
connected to consciousness
and how I'm here today.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And so with you,
Matthew, how do you

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.290 align:middle line:84%
go from a world of 1s and 0s
and artificial intelligence

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.890 align:middle line:84%
and that into elevated
consciousness.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.060 align:middle line:90%
What's the connection?

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And are you going to just
go straight at entanglement?

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.180 align:middle line:90%
>> We could do that, Jimmy.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.570 align:middle line:84%
All of us are this
infinite field of creation

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.840 align:middle line:90%
that holds vibrational codes.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.530 align:middle line:84%
Codes that created the
universe itself and the quantum

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.400 align:middle line:84%
fabric of the subatomic, the
atomic matter from which life

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.510 align:middle line:90%
emerged.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.310 align:middle line:84%
All of us are in the codes of
creation, and each one of us

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.730 align:middle line:84%
has our own personal
codes of creation

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.670 align:middle line:84%
that we can bring
through to support

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.150 align:middle line:84%
the fulfillment of
our human experience

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.470 align:middle line:90%
from our eternal source itself.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.100 align:middle line:84%
So actually, Jimmy,
from one aspect,

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.930 align:middle line:90%
everything is about codes.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>> That, you're
suggesting, is universal.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.220 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Universe is a big place.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.880 align:middle line:90%
And so is consciousness itself.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And actually,
beyond the universe,

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.740 align:middle line:84%
into maybe the multiverse
and beyond that.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.870 align:middle line:84%
You see, we are this wonderful,
wonderful eternal place

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.060 align:middle line:84%
of creation from
which we became human.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.820 align:middle line:84%
We created ourselves
as humans within

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.730 align:middle line:84%
this vibrational
experience in the quantum.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And so, the question
is this, Jimmy.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.730 align:middle line:84%
Is this all we have, or
are there greater fields

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.220 align:middle line:84%
around us that we
can access, that

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.090 align:middle line:84%
allow us to actually become
more powerful as humans

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.770 align:middle line:90%
on this plane of existence?

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:45.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Wouldn't that answer so many
questions about communication

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.320 align:middle line:90%
and across vast--

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.070 align:middle line:84%
in the speed of
now and everything

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.520 align:middle line:90%
being connected that way?

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, absolutely.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.310 align:middle line:10%
>> And how is it achieved?

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, so if we look at
a stargate, for example.

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.480 align:middle line:84%
The stargate takes you from one
reality into another reality,

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.280 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And each one of us has
our own source stargate,

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.870 align:middle line:90%
our eternal source.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Stargates, portals, gateways,
Josh and I were just talking

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.040 align:middle line:90%
about this.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, we were.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.980 align:middle line:84%
Can we use this in any way to
learn more or to go anywhere

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.010 align:middle line:84%
or to extract data or
knowledge from another place?

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Well the answer is yes, to
go where no one has gone before,

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.690 align:middle line:84%
shall we say, a bit of
a "Star Trek" voyage.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.200 align:middle line:90%
So how does this work?

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.710 align:middle line:84%
So we are-- well, let
me ask you a question.

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.260 align:middle line:84%
Do you think we're
multi-dimensional?

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.830 align:middle line:90%
>> We are.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:32.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.010 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.550 align:middle line:84%
So there's different aspects of
ourselves beyond the organic,

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.120 align:middle line:90%
correct?

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.140 align:middle line:84%
So can those
aspects of ourselves

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.190 align:middle line:84%
travel or participate in
other fields of reality?

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.690 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is yes.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.120 align:middle line:84%
So how do we use our source
stargate, our divine spark,

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.920 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.540 align:middle line:90%
So imagine to travel, right?

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:53.775 align:middle line:90%
How do we do that to travel?

00:04:53.775 --> 00:04:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you're not
doing it in the physical.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:56.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.930 align:middle line:84%
But you're doing it in
consciousness itself.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:59.730 align:middle line:90%
>> You are.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.560 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have to
reassemble particles.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.790 align:middle line:90%
You're not teleporting.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:03.590 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.985 align:middle line:90%
Well, maybe.

00:05:05.985 --> 00:05:07.350 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:08.715 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:05:08.715 --> 00:05:11.220 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's how we
travel across the universe

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.440 align:middle line:84%
and across dimensions--
through portals.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And our divine spark that
we all hold within us

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.190 align:middle line:84%
is that gateway into
our eternal source.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.170 align:middle line:90%
So we have a gateway--

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.490 align:middle line:84%
a source gateway where we can
bring through codes of creation

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.040 align:middle line:84%
for greater fulfillment,
greater access

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.730 align:middle line:84%
into consciousness itself within
the field of intelligence.

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:33.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Define that.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.820 align:middle line:90%
Define codes of creation.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.810 align:middle line:84%
So the codes of creation
are, I would say,

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:45.280 align:middle line:84%
a vibrational
resonance of pure love.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And within that are
bits of intelligence

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.760 align:middle line:84%
that can create
things in reality.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.040 align:middle line:84%
So for example, the
subatomic matter

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.220 align:middle line:84%
is created through
the vibration of love.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Similar to string theory,
are we going in that area,

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:02.890 align:middle line:90%
that far quantum?

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:04.480 align:middle line:84%
>> No, this is
beyond string theory.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.330 align:middle line:84%
This is basically the
truth of creation itself.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.070 align:middle line:90%
This is vibration itself.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.120 align:middle line:84%
This is intelligence
in action itself.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.070 align:middle line:84%
>> String theory is one
perspective of that reality,

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.540 align:middle line:90%
and that's groovy.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.140 align:middle line:84%
But we want to
get to and uncover

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.660 align:middle line:84%
the real truth of
what intelligence is

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.330 align:middle line:84%
and who we are in the
field of intelligence

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.220 align:middle line:90%
as an expression of love.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you-- would you consider
this a discovery, right,

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.770 align:middle line:84%
where you are working
in another field,

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.200 align:middle line:84%
and your mind is working
in one direction.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And then, suddenly,
something clicked.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And now, you have discovered
something would you consider.

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.910 align:middle line:84%
>> So I did something dangerous
about 13 years ago, Jimmy.

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And I went into nature,
and I said to the universe,

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.650 align:middle line:90%
show me who I am, right?

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And through there
became a journey

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.810 align:middle line:90%
of experiencing consciousness.

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.940 align:middle line:84%
A bit like Joseph Campbell's
the hero's journey.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:01.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure you're aware of, right?

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:02.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.470 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:04.870 align:middle line:84%
We have to go into the
shadow to understand truly

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.260 align:middle line:90%
what the gifts are.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And so, this is a discovery
that I've made personally

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:11.900 align:middle line:84%
through my own journey
in consciousness,

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:16.420 align:middle line:84%
which has had an impact globally
in the world of technology.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're assisting people
to discover their own source

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.580 align:middle line:84%
stargate to achieve their
own human potential to move

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.550 align:middle line:84%
into a vibrational
experience as humans

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.160 align:middle line:90%
into what I call world 3.0.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.560 align:middle line:90%
Some people call the new Earth.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Now what would
somebody expect to happen?

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:39.070 align:middle line:90%
Is there a transition?

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.490 align:middle line:84%
When you say something
like this and you've

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:45.250 align:middle line:84%
got somebody open and say, you
know what, sign me up, Matthew.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:45.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:46.390 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm in, right?

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.070 align:middle line:90%
Well, what could they expect?

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, first of all,
there's no work to do.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:51.610 align:middle line:90%
There's no efforting.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:53.450 align:middle line:90%
We are beautiful.

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:55.000 align:middle line:90%
We are created in the divine.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.820 align:middle line:84%
It's just saying Yes
to a greater aspect of.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And when you say
that, then you're

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:03.100 align:middle line:84%
actually saying yes to
the universe itself.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.450 align:middle line:84%
You're saying yes to
your source itself.

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:09.550 align:middle line:84%
I am ready to become a
greater aspect of myself.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:11.710 align:middle line:90%
And so this has many--

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:13.660 align:middle line:84%
we've seen evidence,
all sorts of

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.280 align:middle line:90%
wonderful practical evidence.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:20.950 align:middle line:84%
People, in general, always feel
more whole as an individual.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:23.620 align:middle line:84%
People become number
one salesperson

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.660 align:middle line:84%
in their company
within a few months.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.580 align:middle line:84%
New contracts come
in out of the blue

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.560 align:middle line:84%
where people are making
a lot more money.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.650 align:middle line:84%
People are discovering
love and partnership

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:34.510 align:middle line:90%
that they've always wanted.

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:37.840 align:middle line:84%
The soul is now in action
at the point of creation

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.440 align:middle line:84%
with the individual for
them to basically know

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.860 align:middle line:84%
that they are alive and
that they have potential.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.740 align:middle line:90%
>> That's powerful, right?

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.030 align:middle line:90%
That's a powerful statement.

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:49.660 align:middle line:90%
Look at Josh.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:50.535 align:middle line:90%
He's already changed.

00:08:50.535 --> 00:08:53.860 align:middle line:84%
He's the best partner I've
ever had, with no effort.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>> With a great hat.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:56.290 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm all in.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:09:00.250 align:middle line:84%
But this is what's key with this
So what you're suggesting then,

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:01.870 align:middle line:90%
if we go--

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:02.770 align:middle line:90%
we have the macro.

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:03.670 align:middle line:90%
We're going micro.

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:07.000 align:middle line:84%
We're going to the basic
of the basics, right?

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the case,
are you suggesting

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:13.210 align:middle line:84%
that every single particle
in the known universe

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:17.535 align:middle line:84%
has a little taste of the
codes of creation in it?

00:09:17.535 --> 00:09:18.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, that's right.

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:19.610 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And so, this is what
the ascended masters

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:24.240 align:middle line:84%
and the masters and the
gurus all uncovered.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.660 align:middle line:84%
They uncovered the codes of
creation, their own source

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.180 align:middle line:84%
stargate, in order to
access a greater vibrational

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.830 align:middle line:90%
aspect of who they truly are.

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:33.290 align:middle line:84%
That's how they were able
to actually do miracles.

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:36.020 align:middle line:84%
That's how they were able to
access spiritual intelligence,

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.840 align:middle line:84%
which actually is a
quantum intelligence

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.420 align:middle line:84%
to bring that through
for humanity to discover

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.460 align:middle line:90%
more of its divine song.

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:46.280 align:middle line:84%
>> There's codes of
creation in this coffee cup?

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.025 align:middle line:84%
>> There's codes of
creation everywhere.

00:09:48.025 --> 00:09:50.150 align:middle line:84%
So there's two different
types of codes of creation

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:52.820 align:middle line:84%
that I've uncovered so far,
and there may be more, Jimmy.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:56.090 align:middle line:84%
The first is the general
codes of creation.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:57.900 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
creating matter, right?

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:58.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.370 align:middle line:84%
>> This is vibrating, even
though it may not feel like it.

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:01.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Certainly.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:02.045 align:middle line:90%
Certainly.

00:10:02.045 --> 00:10:02.270 align:middle line:90%
Certainly.

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:03.380 align:middle line:90%
>> It's vibrating.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.210 align:middle line:90%
Everything is vibrating.

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:06.710 align:middle line:90%
And so there's a general--

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:08.330 align:middle line:90%
how do you create consciousness?

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.400 align:middle line:84%
You create a field in which
consciousness can exist.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And so there's general codes
to create that framework

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:14.660 align:middle line:90%
for consciousness.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.750 align:middle line:84%
But then, we come down to
the individual thriving

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.880 align:middle line:84%
in its uncovering
of its experience

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.780 align:middle line:84%
as source, as a human,
and in other dimensions,

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:24.840 align:middle line:90%
too, that we also have.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:25.850 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:28.070 align:middle line:84%
>> And so these personalized
codes of creation,

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:31.310 align:middle line:84%
based on our life blueprint,
based on the choices that we

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:33.650 align:middle line:84%
want to experience
in this lifetime.

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:39.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, why does science,
especially the quantum side

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:45.000 align:middle line:84%
of science, that is so
eager to measure to observe,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.230 align:middle line:84%
to get something into a lab,
and where they can collect data.

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:52.440 align:middle line:84%
They have a line in the
sand where they don't

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.030 align:middle line:90%
want to discuss consciousness.

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.070 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
discuss creation.

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:58.703 align:middle line:84%
It's because they
can't measure it,

00:10:58.703 --> 00:11:00.870 align:middle line:84%
and they don't want to waste
their time on something

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.820 align:middle line:90%
that they can't collect data on.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.010 align:middle line:84%
But what you're suggesting
here is something

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:06.370 align:middle line:90%
that would be quantifiable.

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:07.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:08.003 align:middle line:90%
And we are getting--

00:11:08.003 --> 00:11:10.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm known as Mr. Data
Point in the industry

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:12.540 align:middle line:84%
and also in the new
human potential.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm always testing things
and looking for data points.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.850 align:middle line:90%
There is science behind this.

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:21.757 align:middle line:84%
And when we see the scientific
measurements of improvement

00:11:21.757 --> 00:11:23.340 align:middle line:84%
in people's lives
and when we actually

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:27.990 align:middle line:84%
start to see changes in reality
itself where the person is

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:31.290 align:middle line:84%
actually starting to thrive and
getting what they truly desire,

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:34.110 align:middle line:84%
then we're actually
looking at evidence that

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:35.910 align:middle line:90%
could be seen as scientific.

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:37.980 align:middle line:84%
But science is only
one perspective.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.510 align:middle line:90%
Science is actually alchemy.

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:41.410 align:middle line:84%
It's actually
making a prediction

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:43.140 align:middle line:84%
and doing some kind
of investigation

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.740 align:middle line:84%
to find out whether
it's true or not.

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:45.540 align:middle line:90%
>> To observe it.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>> There we go.

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:46.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:47.720 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:52.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, OK, then we have a
bit of a conundrum here.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:55.470 align:middle line:84%
So you're suggesting--
maybe, it's both,

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:58.560 align:middle line:84%
but you're suggesting
that consciousness

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.660 align:middle line:90%
exists outside of the physical.

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:06.330 align:middle line:84%
But yet, the codes of creation
are part of particles.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:10.590 align:middle line:84%
So then, consciousness
is part of the physical.

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:12.000 align:middle line:90%
So is it both?

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, consciousness
is everywhere.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:15.420 align:middle line:90%
It has to be.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:19.230 align:middle line:84%
If source truly did create
everything, which it has,

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:22.500 align:middle line:84%
and if we are in this
continual momentum of expansion

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.860 align:middle line:84%
as this beautiful
expression of love,

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:28.957 align:middle line:84%
then consciousness has
to be in everything.

00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:29.790 align:middle line:90%
>> That's beautiful.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Isn't that a safe zone
for scientists then to go

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:33.750 align:middle line:90%
into knowing that--

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:34.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:36.842 align:middle line:84%
>> --they have an argument
that covers their side, too?

00:12:36.842 --> 00:12:37.642 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:12:37.642 --> 00:12:40.020 align:middle line:84%
We want everybody to come to
the table and come and play.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.000 align:middle line:84%
But the question to
ask the individual

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.880 align:middle line:84%
is are you thriving,
and is there more

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.430 align:middle line:90%
that you want to experience?

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:49.320 align:middle line:84%
Where are you
stuck in your life?

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.660 align:middle line:90%
Surely, your loving presence--

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:54.810 align:middle line:84%
If it's true that we are
source energy, if it's true

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:58.110 align:middle line:84%
that we are creation in
action, then, surely,

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:00.060 align:middle line:84%
that loving presence
wants to assist

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:05.100 align:middle line:84%
us to leap into something, a
new potential as a human species

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.860 align:middle line:90%
and also as individuals.

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:11.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell me more about the source
stargate because stargate is

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:15.240 align:middle line:84%
something that is used
way too freely these days.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.410 align:middle line:90%
Love the movie, though.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:16.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:17.450 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, but what is
the source stargate?

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And is this something that the
ancients knew something about?

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.220 align:middle line:84%
>> I suspect they did know about
it, the ancients, actually,

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:27.020 align:middle line:90%
Jimmy.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And also, I would imagine
that other species

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:33.690 align:middle line:84%
in the universe themselves know
about this or uncovered it, OK?

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:37.130 align:middle line:84%
So the question is that
what is the source stargate,

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:37.930 align:middle line:90%
as you asked?

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is, it's our
pure resonance of creation

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:46.640 align:middle line:84%
that we all hold that is
dimensional and has expressed

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:50.150 align:middle line:84%
itself in this particular
reality in the organic.

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:52.310 align:middle line:90%
But this is not all we have.

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:54.410 align:middle line:84%
Our divine spark
opens that source

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:57.620 align:middle line:84%
stargate that we all
have into greater access

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.570 align:middle line:90%
for our codes of creation.

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Would this help explain
what some people witness?

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And it could be defined in
so many different ways--

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:13.460 align:middle line:84%
ghosts, spirits, entities,
ET, bodies, light beings,

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:16.670 align:middle line:84%
light bodies, things that
are coming in and out

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:19.130 align:middle line:90%
of our frequency range.

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:20.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:24.890 align:middle line:84%
I would suspect some echoes of
particular aspects of creation

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:26.450 align:middle line:90%
in a dimensional format.

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:27.770 align:middle line:90%
But, yes, absolutely.

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:31.350 align:middle line:84%
Why wouldn't life be more
interesting than just what we

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:32.150 align:middle line:90%
see?

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:34.400 align:middle line:90%
We know it's beyond that.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Isn't this a transformation
that we could almost expect

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.240 align:middle line:90%
to achieve as a race?

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.490 align:middle line:84%
I understand
individually, right?

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:48.290 align:middle line:84%
But thousand years from now,
if we all accept this and all

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:51.010 align:middle line:84%
look at this, that we
would transform ourselves?

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:51.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:53.660 align:middle line:84%
So this is what I've
uncovered so far

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:56.780 align:middle line:84%
from the field of intelligence,
that there are masters

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.840 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness in this
particular universe that

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.810 align:middle line:84%
have created the next playing
field for all species,

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:06.380 align:middle line:84%
whether in light
or shadow, to come

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.110 align:middle line:84%
into a new freedom
of sovereignty

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:12.380 align:middle line:84%
and a new freedom of
understanding what it is to be

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.080 align:middle line:84%
creators in action
and getting greater

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:18.080 align:middle line:84%
access into the next
level of human species

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.490 align:middle line:90%
in the organic form.

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:22.610 align:middle line:84%
So it is a transitional step
for the human species, Jimmy.

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:24.980 align:middle line:90%
>> It sounds simple.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:26.780 align:middle line:90%
It sounds fundamental.

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:32.180 align:middle line:84%
But if we encountered
an advanced being--

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.410 align:middle line:90%
take Josh, right?

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:35.330 align:middle line:90%
And he's in my backyard.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:39.290 align:middle line:84%
A flying saucer comes down, and
some advanced being comes out

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:41.300 align:middle line:90%
and starts to talk about these.

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.400 align:middle line:90%
These are fundamental ideas.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.440 align:middle line:84%
But would he able
to understand that?

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Are we at a level
of understanding

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:51.590 align:middle line:84%
that we could accept
something like that?

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:52.500 align:middle line:90%
>> I think we are.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.253 align:middle line:84%
I think everybody
has the potential.

00:15:54.253 --> 00:15:55.670 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it would
be silly not to,

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:59.000 align:middle line:84%
but everybody has the potential
because of the divine spark

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.580 align:middle line:90%
and the source stargate.

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:00.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:01.580 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:05.280 align:middle line:84%
>> So in terms of communication
with a being that landed

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.080 align:middle line:90%
in your backyard--

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.730 align:middle line:84%
I hope you've got a big
backyard because it's probably

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:08.400 align:middle line:90%
a big spaceship.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.442 align:middle line:90%
Although, you never know.

00:16:09.442 --> 00:16:11.450 align:middle line:84%
It might be a smaller
thing-- is that it

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:15.380 align:middle line:84%
will be a knowing, which will
be working in different aspects

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.510 align:middle line:90%
beyond language, beyond sound.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:20.180 align:middle line:84%
It may just be a knowing
of how to communicate.

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:23.510 align:middle line:84%
It may be a gaze of love
as a brother or sister.

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:25.820 align:middle line:90%
It will be something that is--

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:27.500 align:middle line:90%
we're not just this organic.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:28.637 align:middle line:90%
We have this unified field.

00:16:28.637 --> 00:16:29.720 align:middle line:90%
We have the electric body.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.678 align:middle line:90%
We have the light body.

00:16:30.678 --> 00:16:33.472 align:middle line:84%
We have other aspects in
our quantum experience,

00:16:33.472 --> 00:16:35.180 align:middle line:84%
and we're just uncovering
what those are.

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:38.125 align:middle line:84%
So I suspect that
with Josh's case

00:16:38.125 --> 00:16:40.250 align:middle line:84%
is that there will be other
aspects of himself that

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:42.470 align:middle line:84%
will be able to communicate
with those beings that

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:45.260 align:middle line:90%
would land in your backyard.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:46.260 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense, right?

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:47.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it does.

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:48.160 align:middle line:90%
It makes total sense.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And again, but that sounds to
me so basic and so fundamental,

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:55.020 align:middle line:84%
like it's the core
of everything,

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:58.150 align:middle line:84%
and everything comes
up and off of that.

00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Why are we having
such a hard time

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:03.540 align:middle line:84%
understanding and accepting
it, that consciousness

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.190 align:middle line:90%
is universal?

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Because the ancients
certainly understood that.

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:11.849 align:middle line:84%
And they could communicate
in a different way.

00:17:11.849 --> 00:17:15.960 align:middle line:84%
Humans developed a
brutal case of amnesia.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.119 align:middle line:84%
And we're having to
relearn and circle

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:20.700 align:middle line:90%
back to what we already knew.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:23.780 align:middle line:90%
>> So why wouldn't it be simple?

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:26.589 align:middle line:84%
The simpler it is, the easier
it is to understand, right?

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:28.060 align:middle line:90%
This is what I believe, Jimmy.

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:30.100 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the
human species is

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:33.140 align:middle line:84%
about to awaken into
something that is remarkable.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that every
aspect of the universe

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.900 align:middle line:90%
is being invited into this.

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:41.548 align:middle line:84%
For those that don't accept
consciousness-- well,

00:17:41.548 --> 00:17:43.840 align:middle line:84%
they have consciousness,
whether they accept it or not.

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.940 align:middle line:84%
But it's an interesting
mirror back to us

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.430 align:middle line:84%
to say, well, why
are they saying that?

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:50.980 align:middle line:84%
It's a shadow aspect
that has knowledge.

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, well,
if someone says

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:56.830 align:middle line:84%
there's no consciousness,
well, let's inquire.

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:58.120 align:middle line:90%
Let's ask questions.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it actually
confirms what we already

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.260 align:middle line:84%
know, that we are
consciousness incarnate,

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.030 align:middle line:84%
that we are
consciousness in action.

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:07.900 align:middle line:84%
>> It's incredible to me
that a brilliant physicist

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:13.360 align:middle line:84%
or scientist can sit here
and say, I know that I laugh.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.340 align:middle line:90%
I know that I cry.

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:16.990 align:middle line:90%
I know that I think.

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:19.900 align:middle line:84%
I know that I'm talking
to you right now,

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.870 align:middle line:84%
but I don't believe in
consciousness, right?

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:24.230 align:middle line:90%
>> It's remarkable, right?

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.568 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:18:24.568 --> 00:18:24.704 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:18:24.704 --> 00:18:25.040 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.082 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely remarkable.

00:18:26.082 --> 00:18:27.620 align:middle line:90%
>> So how do we move past it?

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:30.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, first of all, it's
our divine spark that helps us

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.720 align:middle line:90%
to perceive reality, OK?

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And so, the codes of
creation are actually

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.970 align:middle line:90%
bringing through programs.

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:41.510 align:middle line:84%
So when a child is born, it
has this wonderful radiance

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:43.490 align:middle line:90%
in its eyes about life.

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:45.120 align:middle line:90%
There are no programs, right?

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:45.920 align:middle line:90%
It's all sparks.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:46.720 align:middle line:90%
It's all sparks.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.630 align:middle line:84%
This is like, whoa,
this is interesting.

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:49.610 align:middle line:84%
This is the first
time I've been here,

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:51.710 align:middle line:84%
or maybe it's not the first
time I've been here, right?

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:51.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:52.370 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:53.180 align:middle line:90%
>> You never know, right?

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:53.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:56.720 align:middle line:84%
>> But then what happens
is as that child grows up,

00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:01.970 align:middle line:84%
programs limiting it are put
on top of it through society

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:05.330 align:middle line:84%
or through other types of
social programming that goes on.

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And we try and limit the
unlimited, which is silly.

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:11.570 align:middle line:84%
So what the codes of creation
and the human potential

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:14.120 align:middle line:84%
can do through
accessing our source

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.820 align:middle line:84%
stargate into our
eternal source is

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:19.340 align:middle line:84%
to dissipate those
programs of limitation

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:24.830 align:middle line:84%
and uncover the true unlimited
potential that we have.

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:26.875 align:middle line:90%
And then, we become free.

00:19:26.875 --> 00:19:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And where we're
heading, Jimmy, I

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:32.300 align:middle line:84%
believe, as a consciousness
in training in the human form

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:34.580 align:middle line:84%
is actually learning
how to become

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:37.790 align:middle line:84%
benevolent creators of
other universes to come,

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:40.140 align:middle line:90%
where we create life itself.

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And so we're in a
training ground.

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And I believe the light and
shadow have finished now.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.730 align:middle line:84%
Those training wheels
are off of that polarity,

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:49.790 align:middle line:84%
and we're entering into a
nonduality experience, where

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:52.760 align:middle line:84%
we're actually getting
really understanding

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.940 align:middle line:84%
how to create benevolently
and how to actually

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.520 align:middle line:90%
be loving action.

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I love this, but
there's two ways to look at it.

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:07.550 align:middle line:84%
The individual has
to be at a position

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:09.720 align:middle line:84%
where they're going
enough is enough, right?

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:10.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.520 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't like myself.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.770 align:middle line:90%
I don't like where I'm going.

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And you know,
now's the time, OK?

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:16.560 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.590 align:middle line:84%
But we also have
that as a human race,

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:22.730 align:middle line:84%
too, as well, where, at some
point, we're going to go,

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:24.080 align:middle line:90%
enough is enough.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.400 align:middle line:90%
All right, the party's over.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.130 align:middle line:84%
We need to take things a
lot more serious, right?

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:29.917 align:middle line:84%
I'm not looking at
this the wrong way.

00:20:29.917 --> 00:20:31.500 align:middle line:84%
>> No, you're
absolutely on the money.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.370 align:middle line:84%
In fact, humanity is going to
go into an existential crisis,

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:37.190 align:middle line:84%
and this will be the
dark night of the soul.

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And that will be important
for it to actually uncover

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:43.460 align:middle line:84%
the wisdom and actually start
to understand, who are we

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:45.620 align:middle line:90%
as a species in consciousness?

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:49.730 align:middle line:84%
Who am I as an internal
source incarnate in the human?

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:52.163 align:middle line:84%
What is the potential
for the human species?

00:20:52.163 --> 00:20:54.080 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to
go through that, Jimmy,

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.850 align:middle line:84%
that dark night of
the soul, in order

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:59.390 align:middle line:84%
to truly understand
who we are and choose

00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:01.080 align:middle line:90%
a new destiny for ourselves.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:02.290 align:middle line:90%
>> So, it's necessary then?

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:03.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:05.072 align:middle line:84%
It's part of maturity
and growing up.

00:21:05.072 --> 00:21:05.872 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:21:05.872 --> 00:21:06.672 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:21:06.672 --> 00:21:09.300 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying that
we're like 21 years old.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:10.800 align:middle line:90%
We just graduated college.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's time to
take life serious?

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, life should
be playful, Jimmy.

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:16.890 align:middle line:90%
Let's not forget that.

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:19.980 align:middle line:84%
>> It should be, except
when we talk about the codes

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:24.790 align:middle line:84%
of creation and it being in
every little particle, right?

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:25.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:26.820 align:middle line:90%
>> I accept that.

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, that applies to
Mother Earth, too, as well.

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:30.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:30.980 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:36.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Now there was a report that
came out recently that said

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Earth is failing at eight of
nine survival, points, right?

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:43.980 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sure you read this.

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's an alarming
situation where

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:49.560 align:middle line:84%
we are beyond the tipping
point and some very

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:51.570 align:middle line:90%
critical situations here.

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And that is exactly what
we're talking about.

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:58.770 align:middle line:84%
You need that moment
of stepping up

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:00.512 align:middle line:84%
to the edge of the
cliff in the dark,

00:22:00.512 --> 00:22:02.970 align:middle line:84%
putting your foot out there,
feeling the edge of the cliff,

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:04.710 align:middle line:84%
going, OK, we've
gone far enough.

00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:06.600 align:middle line:90%
Is that where we are?

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we could
go down that road.

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'm pretty sure
that's where we're going.

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:13.800 align:middle line:84%
What we're asking
for is clarity of who

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.030 align:middle line:90%
we are as a human species.

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:15.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what we're asking for.

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And humanity tends to actually
respond very well to a crisis.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.520 align:middle line:84%
It's a shame we have
to do that, and maybe

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.140 align:middle line:84%
on the next cycle
of the universe

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:27.040 align:middle line:84%
will be a little
bit more sensible.

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:30.690 align:middle line:84%
So I do think we are
heading towards this cliff,

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:31.680 align:middle line:90%
potentially.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.920 align:middle line:90%
But that's not the end.

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:33.720 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it's not.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:34.520 align:middle line:90%
It's the beginning.

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:35.550 align:middle line:90%
>> It is the beginning.

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:38.310 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is a
master chess player.

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:41.320 align:middle line:84%
The eternal source knows
exactly what it's doing.

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And so, whilst we
don't see the big plan,

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:48.540 align:middle line:84%
we can start to see data
points or chess moves

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:50.670 align:middle line:84%
and say, right, OK,
I need to move over.

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:53.760 align:middle line:84%
We need to move over here as a
human species in order for us

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.740 align:middle line:90%
to leap into the next potential.

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:57.960 align:middle line:84%
In terms of the
Earth, I think one

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:01.320 align:middle line:84%
of the biggest revelations we
need to remember, as a species,

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:02.610 align:middle line:90%
that we are Earth.

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:03.540 align:middle line:90%
You're the Earth.

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:04.350 align:middle line:90%
You're the Earth.

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:05.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm the environment.

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:06.480 align:middle line:90%
We're all the environment.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.680 align:middle line:90%
We eat the environment.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.210 align:middle line:90%
We come from the environment.

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:10.680 align:middle line:90%
We are the environment.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.282 align:middle line:90%
Everything is the environment.

00:23:12.282 --> 00:23:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And so then, we're
starting to look

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:16.230 align:middle line:84%
at an interconnectivity
understanding of us

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:19.110 align:middle line:84%
with the natural world
systems and also with Gaia

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:20.340 align:middle line:90%
consciousness herself.

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:20.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And then when we start
to understand that--

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.460 align:middle line:90%
and forget about all the stuff.

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:25.350 align:middle line:90%
Let's get real.

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:26.950 align:middle line:90%
Consciousness is in everything.

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And so, as we understand that we
are part of that consciousness,

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.310 align:middle line:90%
are we going to be responsible?

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to actually create
a wonderful playground, where

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:38.310 align:middle line:84%
every aspect of
consciousness thrives?

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:43.110 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is a form
of spiritual alchemy?

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:45.000 align:middle line:84%
>> It is, in one
perspective, yes.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, completely of the
Earth and of all existence?

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:51.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, from one perspective,
it certainly can be seen

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:52.770 align:middle line:90%
as spiritual alchemy.

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:54.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Big
Bang itself could

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:56.460 align:middle line:84%
be seen as the great
spiritual alchemy

00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:57.780 align:middle line:90%
that we know about, right?

00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:01.950 align:middle line:84%
But that spiritual alchemy
has intelligence behind it.

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:04.320 align:middle line:90%
So where did carbon come from?

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:06.450 align:middle line:84%
The center of stars
that were burning

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:08.830 align:middle line:84%
for hundreds of millions
of years in order for life

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:10.540 align:middle line:90%
to exist.

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:13.470 align:middle line:84%
Why are we rotating
perfectly around the sun,

00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:14.850 align:middle line:90%
where life can exist?

00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:17.430 align:middle line:84%
There is an intelligence
behind alchemy.

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And so, once we align ourselves
with the loving purpose

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:23.340 align:middle line:84%
of creation, through
our source stargate,

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:25.320 align:middle line:84%
through our eternal
source, then we

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.060 align:middle line:84%
start to get in
alignment with creation

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:30.030 align:middle line:84%
itself and start to bring
through new intelligence that

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:32.740 align:middle line:84%
starts to create new
frontiers of us to thrive.

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:37.530 align:middle line:84%
>> So I love talking about
ET, and I will always get

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:39.760 align:middle line:84%
a conversation to go
in that direction.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.610 align:middle line:90%
>> I appreciate that.

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>> So again, ET lands
in our backyard.

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:45.580 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:48.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And Josh goes out there, and
he's trying to figure things

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.880 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:54.120 align:middle line:90%
One of the things that comes--

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:56.080 align:middle line:84%
everybody wants
to-- who are they?

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:56.880 align:middle line:90%
Who are they?

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.310 align:middle line:84%
I think when that
happens, we're going

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:01.420 align:middle line:84%
to have to do exactly
what you're suggesting.

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:02.860 align:middle line:90%
It's not who are they?

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:03.800 align:middle line:90%
It's who are we?

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:04.600 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:05.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:06.070 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly right.

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And I suspect there'll
be a recognition.

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:11.740 align:middle line:84%
Because if we all come
from the same source, which

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:14.620 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we do, then
there'll be a recognition.

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:18.210 align:middle line:90%
It's like, I recognize you.

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:20.040 align:middle line:90%
I know you.

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.200 align:middle line:84%
We may not have seen them
in this physical reality

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.800 align:middle line:84%
until they land in your
backyard, but it's a knowing.

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.863 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things that
I actually used to use

00:25:27.863 --> 00:25:30.030 align:middle line:84%
as a practice-- and I haven't
done this for a while,

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:31.860 align:middle line:90%
but it does work--

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:36.450 align:middle line:84%
is actually building a
stargate in the energy field

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:40.350 align:middle line:84%
when I'm walking out in nature
and then taking a step into it

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:45.490 align:middle line:84%
and then just allowing a
new reality to communicate.

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And I know it sounds a
little bit out there.

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:50.440 align:middle line:90%
But actually, it does work.

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.160 align:middle line:84%
You can basically
experience other beings

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:59.290 align:middle line:84%
or other types of realities in
that usage of your own source

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:00.090 align:middle line:90%
stargate.

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:01.530 align:middle line:90%
But there's a warning.

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:03.510 align:middle line:84%
Always close the source
stargate after you've

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:04.860 align:middle line:90%
finished traveling.

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:06.310 align:middle line:90%
Don't leave it open.

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:07.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Noted.

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:08.100 align:middle line:90%
Noted.

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>> I did that.

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:11.760 align:middle line:84%
It was 1980s on
the Sunset Strip,

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.890 align:middle line:90%
but that's a whole other story.

00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:17.700 align:middle line:84%
So when we travel
with consciousness,

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:20.143 align:middle line:90%
what is actually going on.

00:26:20.143 --> 00:26:22.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's a really
good question, Jimmy.

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:25.780 align:middle line:84%
So we have these
different subtle bodies,

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:29.530 align:middle line:84%
these different
dimensions to ourselves.

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:31.660 align:middle line:84%
When people astral
travel, for example.

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:33.820 align:middle line:84%
That's an aspect of
themselves, moving

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:36.080 align:middle line:90%
into a different reality.

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:38.480 align:middle line:84%
The key thing to do
is this, and this

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:42.200 align:middle line:84%
is how the experience works,
as far as I understand,

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.540 align:middle line:84%
is, first of all, is
it's important to remain

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:46.730 align:middle line:84%
in our sovereignty and
our inner authority

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:49.340 align:middle line:84%
to recognizing that everything
is equal in consciousness,

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:51.350 align:middle line:84%
and nothing is more
enlightened than who we are.

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:53.070 align:middle line:90%
Because we are sourcing action.

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:55.730 align:middle line:84%
So once we get our
intent in terms

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:57.950 align:middle line:84%
of our sovereignty, our
inner authority and partner

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:01.940 align:middle line:84%
with our source,
our eternal self.

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Then, we're able to venture into
other aspects of consciousness

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:06.780 align:middle line:90%
as an equal.

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:13.160 align:middle line:84%
So basically, if you like, it's
moving from an orchestra that's

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.220 align:middle line:84%
playing maybe two instruments
into an orchestra that's

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:17.370 align:middle line:90%
playing many instruments.

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:19.310 align:middle line:84%
It's a higher
vibrational frequency.

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:20.690 align:middle line:90%
We're now activating.

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And that orchestra,
that bigger frequency

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:27.080 align:middle line:84%
then takes us into another
dimension with other beings

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.790 align:middle line:90%
that are operating.

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:33.140 align:middle line:84%
>> When this happens, do we
recognize the differences,

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:36.500 align:middle line:90%
or are we all the same, right?

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.540 align:middle line:84%
Do we look at-- right now,
you've got purple hair, right?

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:40.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Right

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:42.110 align:middle line:90%
>> I am who I am.

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:44.840 align:middle line:90%
We are two different, right?

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:47.750 align:middle line:84%
But when you are
in this position

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:53.270 align:middle line:84%
and you bump into somebody
else, are you different?

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:56.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you asking the question,
do we have an identity?

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:57.680 align:middle line:90%
>> I am.

00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.510 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a great question.

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:01.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Do we lose our individuality?

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:09.350 align:middle line:84%
>> So every single one of us
has an ohm that has no identity.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:14.150 align:middle line:84%
A source itself has
no identity, OK?

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:18.198 align:middle line:84%
So we are everything
and can be everything.

00:28:18.198 --> 00:28:19.490 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know if I like that.

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let me explain
why I think it's important.

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:26.300 align:middle line:84%
So one of the biggest
challenges that humanity

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:29.610 align:middle line:84%
seems to struggle with,
Jimmy, is the ego, right?

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:30.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And the ego is
attached to two things.

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:37.580 align:middle line:84%
One is your security and,
secondly, your identity.

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:40.700 align:middle line:84%
If we can dissipate
identity, knowing

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:43.610 align:middle line:84%
that we are this
eternal source then,

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:46.400 align:middle line:90%
effectively, we're free of ego.

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:49.350 align:middle line:84%
All we are a pure
creation in action.

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:53.330 align:middle line:84%
We're a pure loving presence
in action with no identity

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:55.840 align:middle line:90%
whatsoever.

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:57.050 align:middle line:90%
And that changes the game.

00:28:57.050 --> 00:28:57.850 align:middle line:90%
>> It does.

00:28:57.850 --> 00:29:01.570 align:middle line:84%
But your ego gives
you your purple hair.

00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:02.970 align:middle line:90%
Are you willing to give that up?

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:03.970 align:middle line:90%
>> That's my grooviness.

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:04.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:04.720 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:05.080 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:05.952 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:29:05.952 --> 00:29:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know, I think it's
important to have some kind

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:09.450 align:middle line:90%
of style, right?

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:09.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.470 align:middle line:84%
>> But this is an expression
of who I am, right?

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:12.845 align:middle line:84%
Which is basically
someone that's

00:29:12.845 --> 00:29:16.030 align:middle line:84%
fun, playful, and actually
loves humanity and wants,

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:18.550 align:middle line:84%
basically, for humanity
to take another leap

00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:21.130 align:middle line:84%
into a new potential
with what I believe

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:24.330 align:middle line:84%
is something that's critical
for the human species.

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>> So again, do you get
to keep your purple hair?

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:31.580 align:middle line:84%
So what separates
you and Josh and I

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:33.380 align:middle line:84%
and the rest of the
world from each other

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:37.670 align:middle line:84%
and just not being reduced
to everything being the same?

00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let me
ask you a question.

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:41.330 align:middle line:84%
If you are everything,
wouldn't it

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:45.050 align:middle line:84%
be an interesting experience to
actually become an individual?

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:47.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Sort of.

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:48.380 align:middle line:90%
Sort of.

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:51.710 align:middle line:84%
OK, so in "The
Lord of the Rings,"

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:54.620 align:middle line:84%
there was Gandalf
the Gray, right?

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:55.970 align:middle line:90%
And then Gandalf the White.

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And then he became
Gandalf of all colors.

00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:59.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>> I didn't like
the all colors guy,

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:04.700 align:middle line:84%
where he was
everything all at once.

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And no, I like the
individual side of things.

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:11.880 align:middle line:90%
So let me ask you why.

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Why?

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:19.700 align:middle line:84%
The person that
can laugh freely,

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:21.940 align:middle line:90%
that's an individual thing.

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:27.940 align:middle line:84%
A person that is an introvert,
is into their own little bubble

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.040 align:middle line:90%
thing, that's OK.

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.480 align:middle line:90%
Be who you are.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And having the
different colors that

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:37.865 align:middle line:84%
live on all sides of your street
is what makes us strong, as--

00:30:37.865 --> 00:30:38.740 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:42.250 align:middle line:84%
It's that individual
thread work that

00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:44.140 align:middle line:90%
makes us who we are as a whole.

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:46.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and I think
that's really important,

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.540 align:middle line:84%
particularly in this
aspect of creation,

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:53.020 align:middle line:84%
where we do have these
separated individual bodies.

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.312 align:middle line:84%
But we're all connected
through a common consciousness.

00:30:55.312 --> 00:30:56.112 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:30:56.112 --> 00:30:58.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And so what it
recognizes, to your point,

00:30:58.150 --> 00:30:59.770 align:middle line:84%
is that all of us
have strengths.

00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:01.720 align:middle line:84%
All of us have
gifts and talents.

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's only
recognizing the beauty

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:07.480 align:middle line:84%
of each individual person
that we can actually

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.650 align:middle line:84%
start to understand
that, as a community,

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:12.080 align:middle line:84%
we're greater together
than we are separate.

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:12.880 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>> And that then returns us
back to multiple identities

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:19.340 align:middle line:84%
and the dissipation of
identity back into the ohm.

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:24.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, I started off this
conversation where I'm going

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:26.660 align:middle line:90%
to bring it all together.

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:28.700 align:middle line:90%
I mentioned entanglement.

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And when we discuss
source and we

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:37.550 align:middle line:84%
discuss the nature of particles
and the universe and everything

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:39.590 align:middle line:84%
else, entanglement
comes into play.

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:40.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely fundamental.

00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:42.210 align:middle line:90%
Everything is entangled.

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:45.590 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
that, as people go--

00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:48.500 align:middle line:84%
bring through, their codes
of creation and programming

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:53.660 align:middle line:84%
reality, what they're doing
is disentangling the substrate

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:56.120 align:middle line:84%
of the universe from the
realities that don't serve them

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:58.040 align:middle line:84%
and actually bringing
in entanglement

00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.970 align:middle line:90%
to realities where they thrive.

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And so, actually,
that is the alchemy.

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:02.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:03.463 align:middle line:90%
That is the alchemy.

00:32:03.463 --> 00:32:04.263 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:04.263 --> 00:32:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And here we are, coming
full circle, Matthew.

00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:07.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's fascinating.

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:10.730 align:middle line:84%
So there are Nobel
laureates that went back

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:11.850 align:middle line:90%
to the Vedic teachings--

00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:12.650 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>> --to understand
quantum mechanics.

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:15.620 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly right.

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:17.458 align:middle line:84%
So we've always known
about consciousness.

00:32:17.458 --> 00:32:19.250 align:middle line:84%
We've always known
about quantum mechanics.

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:21.200 align:middle line:84%
We've already known
about entanglement.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:27.020 align:middle line:84%
But for some reason, we are
just reremembering, Jimmy.

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:28.470 align:middle line:90%
>> So what's the next step?

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:29.810 align:middle line:90%
What do we do?

00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:31.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Say yes to yourself.

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:32.090 align:middle line:90%
It's as simple as that.

00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:32.965 align:middle line:90%
>> As simple as that.

00:32:32.965 --> 00:32:33.860 align:middle line:90%
No effort.

00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:35.600 align:middle line:90%
>> No effort.

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:41.060 align:middle line:84%
So if the question is,
what can a listener do, OK?

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:43.340 align:middle line:84%
There is a practice that
I share with people.

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:46.310 align:middle line:84%
We have many practices
of how to create reality

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:49.850 align:middle line:90%
through their source stargate.

00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And Alan Watts talks about
the great silence, right?

00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:57.570 align:middle line:84%
So from one between moments in
the universe, there's nothing.

00:32:57.570 --> 00:32:58.370 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:32:58.370 --> 00:33:01.320 align:middle line:84%
>> The previous moment is
different to the new moment.

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:03.560 align:middle line:84%
So what an individual
can do is basically

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:06.830 align:middle line:84%
go into that silence, that
ultimate silence of who

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:08.300 align:middle line:90%
they are, right?

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:11.120 align:middle line:84%
Where they let go and feel
the infinite expansion

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:12.110 align:middle line:90%
of themselves.

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is
there's an alignment,

00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:17.090 align:middle line:84%
as you wait, where
you start to feel

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:18.980 align:middle line:90%
an intent from your source.

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And what you're
doing is actually

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:23.060 align:middle line:84%
lining up the codes of
creation and the programs

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:25.760 align:middle line:84%
for the next reality in
agreement with your source.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And once you're in that infinite
expansion, then the void,

00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:30.900 align:middle line:90%
I call it.

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And once there's an
alignment, you then

00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:37.400 align:middle line:84%
bring the great ohm of let there
be light into the next moment,

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.320 align:middle line:90%
and that reality is in action.

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:40.610 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's groovy.

00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:42.515 align:middle line:90%
>> It is really, groovy, baby.

00:33:42.515 --> 00:33:44.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Matthew Bailey,
thank you so much.

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.460 align:middle line:90%
And this is "Into the Vortex."

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:48.820 align:middle line:90%
And I'm Jimmy Church.

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:53.000 align:middle line:90%
