>> I'm radio and television
host Jimmy Church,

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.390 align:middle line:84%
and I am here to uncover
the truth about some

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.750 align:middle line:90%
of life's biggest mysteries.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.280 align:middle line:84%
If this is revealed,
everything has to be rewritten.

groundbreaking work

describe these beings?

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.940 align:middle line:84%
>> They're
controlling something,

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.920 align:middle line:90%
and they're doing their task.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.560 align:middle line:84%

Josh, can you pull up the map?

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.480 align:middle line:90%

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.290 align:middle line:84%
of the most intriguing
questions of our time.

>> You described stuff that
I have never heard you talk

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.970 align:middle line:84%
about, and the voice that
came through you was not like

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.840 align:middle line:90%
your voice.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.865 align:middle line:84%
It was really mind-blowing
to me, actually.

I'm Jimmy Church.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.590 align:middle line:84%
Along with Josh, today our
guest is Sarah Breskman Cosme.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.480 align:middle line:90%
She's a regression therapist.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.600 align:middle line:84%
Today is a very, very,
very special episode

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.610 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of different
reasons, and I'm

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.560 align:middle line:90%
going to start with this.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.400 align:middle line:90%
Josh?

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, sir?

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.273 align:middle line:90%
>> Have you ever been regressed?

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:48.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I have.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.685 align:middle line:90%
>> You have?

00:01:48.685 --> 00:01:49.485 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:01:49.485 --> 00:01:50.830 align:middle line:90%
And it was fascinating.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think it worked,
and I do believe in it.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.600 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, as most of the world
knows, for the past 10 years,

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.990 align:middle line:84%
I have said that I would
not do a regression.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.750 align:middle line:84%
>> And I had my
own reasons for it.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.330 align:middle line:84%
So in the interest of
transparency, in this episode,

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.030 align:middle line:84%
what we are going to go
through and everybody

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.360 align:middle line:84%
needs to understand
is I was regressed.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And I went into the regression
without any preconceived--

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.970 align:middle line:90%
any ideas or anything else.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.330 align:middle line:90%
We were just going to do it.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.240 align:middle line:84%
I was going to go
through the experience

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.620 align:middle line:84%
and then bring Sarah on and
discuss what we went through.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.450 align:middle line:84%
I have not seen any of
the regression session

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.830 align:middle line:90%
that we just completed.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.850 align:middle line:84%
I haven't seen any of it,
neither has our guest, Sarah,

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.650 align:middle line:90%
and neither has Josh.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.250 align:middle line:84%
So you are going to
see our reactions

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.550 align:middle line:84%
to the statements
and the things that I

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.430 align:middle line:90%
revealed during this session.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.690 align:middle line:90%
And I will say this.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.420 align:middle line:90%
For me, it was very interesting.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.470 align:middle line:84%
The stuff that I spoke
about I remember,

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.930 align:middle line:84%
and I remember it more when
I'm reminded of the things

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:07.730 align:middle line:90%
that I said.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.640 align:middle line:84%
But at the time,
interestingly enough,

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.850 align:middle line:90%
I heard what I was saying.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.280 align:middle line:10%
And it was things that I
have never said before,

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.920 align:middle line:10%
and I have done
thousands of shows.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.770 align:middle line:84%
It was very interesting
to go through all of that.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:23.940 align:middle line:90%
Sarah, welcome.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:24.810 align:middle line:90%
What did you think?

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.980 align:middle line:90%
Was it what you expected?

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I thought it was better
than what I expected.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you described
stuff that I have never

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.620 align:middle line:90%
heard you talk about.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And the voice that came
through you was not your voice.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.345 align:middle line:84%
It was really mind-blowing
to me, actually.

00:03:42.345 --> 00:03:45.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, what was your goal?

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Again, in the interest of
transparency, I knew nothing.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.460 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
I was going to find

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.530 align:middle line:84%
or what I was going
to speak about.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.010 align:middle line:90%
But what was your goal?

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.030 align:middle line:84%
Did you have something
in mind going into this?

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I feel like
since, in a sense,

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.210 align:middle line:84%
you're really pioneering
this disclosure,

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.510 align:middle line:84%
I felt like you must be tied
into this disclosure movement

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.310 align:middle line:90%
in some way.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And I really wanted to find
out what that was, honestly.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.694 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I could tell that you
were ready for the question.

00:04:18.694 --> 00:04:19.494 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm sure.

00:04:19.494 --> 00:04:20.290 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure.

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.450 align:middle line:90%
OK, you ready?

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.600 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm ready.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.650 align:middle line:84%
>> We're going to
roll these clips?

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:24.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's do this.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.920 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so this first clip,
I'm going to have Sarah do

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.140 align:middle line:90%
the setup on this.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.430 align:middle line:90%
It's called The Contact Story.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:36.610 align:middle line:90%
>> That's our notes for this.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know exactly what,
but what's going on here?

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:44.650 align:middle line:90%
Set us up for this.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so you were describing
how you were with a group

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.120 align:middle line:90%
of people.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, you saw a
flash of light, like a light.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.380 align:middle line:84%
I think you described
it as orange.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.380 align:middle line:84%
>> And then the next thing you
knew, you were on this ship.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And you even said
in your session,

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.410 align:middle line:84%
I've never remembered
this till now.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.240 align:middle line:84%
So then you were on
the ship, and you

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.630 align:middle line:84%
started to describe these
beings and things like that.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:16.890 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so the light that you--
or that I was speaking about--

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.680 align:middle line:84%
I was with Billy Carson,
Elizabeth Hoekstra, their son

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.470 align:middle line:84%
Gabe, and a group of people
around this mountain,

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:23.730 align:middle line:90%
on this hilltop.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And this light approached
us and went over our heads

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.840 align:middle line:84%
and then just went
up into the stars.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.820 align:middle line:90%
That's my memory.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And everybody was there,
and that's what happened.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And then we have apparently
this contact story

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.160 align:middle line:84%
that happened during
this incident, which

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.175 align:middle line:90%
I have no memory of at all.

00:05:43.175 --> 00:05:44.050 align:middle line:90%
Right, let's roll it.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.390 align:middle line:90%
Let's--

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.470 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's see what we have here.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>> How would you
describe these beings?

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.800 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, I remember now.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes, there's a torso.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.000 align:middle line:90%
There's arms.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.138 align:middle line:90%
I don't see fingers.

00:06:04.138 --> 00:06:05.430 align:middle line:90%
I don't see anything like that.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.410 align:middle line:90%
It's dark, and they're fuzzy.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.210 align:middle line:90%
They're out of focus.

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.930 align:middle line:84%
They're sitting in groups of
three, three, three, and three,

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:20.980 align:middle line:84%
sitting, looking down like
they're controlling something.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing
their task, almost

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.490 align:middle line:84%
like an office,
the deck of a ship.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.860 align:middle line:90%
But there's no windows.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you freeze that scene
so you can explore inside that

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:37.020 align:middle line:90%
place?

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.270 align:middle line:90%
Can you look around?

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:44.600 align:middle line:84%
>> The walls-- but
I can't see them,

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:50.170 align:middle line:90%
but they feel curvy but fuzzy.

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.270 align:middle line:84%
Everything's a
little out of focus.

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:55.870 align:middle line:84%
They're speaking to
some United States

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.520 align:middle line:90%
military that's on the ground.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.970 align:middle line:90%
That's what it feels like to me.

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.840 align:middle line:90%
And I'm watching his mouth move.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking to myself,
he's speaking English.

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:14.440 align:middle line:84%
I was there just
for five seconds.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Stop.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.550 align:middle line:90%
Can you stop right there?

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:18.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.890 align:middle line:84%
>> What-- OK, so now I'm
seeing this for the first time.

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:26.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm a little freaked out about
it because now I remember.

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.900 align:middle line:84%
OK, there's a couple of points,
and I want your reaction

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.480 align:middle line:90%
to this.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
I'm saying here.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:40.070 align:middle line:84%
So this is suddenly-- and it's
flowing out of me in real time.

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:42.650 align:middle line:90%
What I do remember now--

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:48.610 align:middle line:84%
I had problems here
describing the curved wall.

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:51.250 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a curved wall.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.000 align:middle line:90%
It was a dome.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:53.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And here I'm trying to
get that description out.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm saying, curved walls.

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:01.370 align:middle line:90%
That's incorrect.

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:04.480 align:middle line:84%
It was a dome, but
there were no windows.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And the other part
about this and I'm

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:10.120 align:middle line:84%
hearing myself
struggle with trying

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.220 align:middle line:90%
to describe what I'm seeing.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:17.260 align:middle line:84%
Everything was--
because it was dark,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.410 align:middle line:90%
the room itself wasn't fuzzy.

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:22.540 align:middle line:90%
But the beings were.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.310 align:middle line:90%
The entities were.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:25.630 align:middle line:90%
And I could see them.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:29.320 align:middle line:90%
There was 10, 11.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:30.820 align:middle line:84%
I just said three,
three, and three.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.445 align:middle line:84%
There were three,
three, and three that

00:08:32.445 --> 00:08:35.140 align:middle line:90%
were sitting facing the wall.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And they were hunched
over, and I could

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.159 align:middle line:90%
see their faces were lit up.

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:41.260 align:middle line:84%
But there was no
detail on the face.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.929 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that I
could see was a mouth,

00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:46.630 align:middle line:90%
and they were speaking English.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:51.000 align:middle line:90%
And there was no telepathy or--

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.140 align:middle line:90%
we always hear about this.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:58.230 align:middle line:84%
The communication was through
the-- it was not that.

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:01.290 align:middle line:84%
But I'm having difficulty
describing this.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:05.970 align:middle line:90%
I also said here, five seconds.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:07.630 align:middle line:90%
Five seconds on the ship, right?

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:08.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Not a long time.

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>> But that's exactly
how it happened.

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:14.070 align:middle line:90%
I stepped on.

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:15.480 align:middle line:90%
I appeared.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.570 align:middle line:84%
I looked from my
left to my right.

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:20.040 align:middle line:90%
I scan the room.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.260 align:middle line:90%
I see these two guys talking.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:23.650 align:middle line:90%
They said hello to me.

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:25.080 align:middle line:90%
I saw his mouth move.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:29.670 align:middle line:84%
It spoke English, normal,
sounded normal to me.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.550 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't negative
or offensive or--

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:35.290 align:middle line:84%
it was comforting, I guess,
is the best way to put it.

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:37.410 align:middle line:90%
But there was another--

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:40.770 align:middle line:84%
what I'm mentioning
here, I say, military.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:45.280 align:middle line:84%
So I guess it must have
felt military to me.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:50.320 align:middle line:84%
I hear him speaking
to somebody, and there

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.350 align:middle line:84%
must be a speaker or something
because that's coming back.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And they're talking like
a pilot to a control tower

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:00.190 align:middle line:90%
at an airport.

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:01.540 align:middle line:90%
What's up?

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:03.460 align:middle line:84%
OK, flight number,
whatever, we're here.

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:04.480 align:middle line:90%
OK, great to see you.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:04.960 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:05.350 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:06.150 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:09.130 align:middle line:90%
It was like this back and forth.

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:11.390 align:middle line:90%
And I see his mouth moving.

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow,
he's speaking English.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.950 align:middle line:90%
>> He?

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:15.750 align:middle line:90%
You're saying, he.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you hear this, out of
focus, like, I'm saying fuzzy.

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:25.700 align:middle line:90%
I don't mean fuzzy like fur.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.360 align:middle line:90%
I mean like out of focus fuzzy.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:33.140 align:middle line:84%
It's funny that I said
fuzzy because that's--

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:35.030 align:middle line:90%
I don't want people to--

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:36.560 align:middle line:90%
I saw something out of focus.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Is this common, where you
don't get features or fingers?

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.190 align:middle line:90%
It's just like a shape?

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:45.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, this is very common.

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:49.430 align:middle line:84%
It was like a perfect example
of other people's contact

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:50.330 align:middle line:90%
memories.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:53.510 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you described
everything that they described,

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:57.270 align:middle line:84%
like the light and the five
seconds that you were gone,

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:58.070 align:middle line:90%
you think.

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Basically, when you see a light
when you're first contacted,

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.790 align:middle line:84%
what is happening actually
is it's a frequency tool

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:06.690 align:middle line:90%
to pop you out of your body.

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And so in that way, you
can be gone for a while.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And it will feel like
only five seconds.

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:16.160 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it will only
be five seconds on Earth.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And then, because you
described them as fuzzy

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:22.350 align:middle line:84%
and you couldn't
put them into focus,

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:25.380 align:middle line:84%
that's very common with
dimensional bleedthrough.

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:29.070 align:middle line:84%
So you're at a different
vibrational frequency

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:30.300 align:middle line:90%
than these beings.

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, you
can't really see them clearly.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And then you describe them as
being in threes and working.

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:41.310 align:middle line:84%
That's very consistent
with a specific type

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:42.690 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrials.

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:46.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in my opinion, it
sounded like the Greys,

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:50.670 align:middle line:84%
except the Greys don't usually
move their mouths too much.

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:54.660 align:middle line:84%
But they do speak whatever
language they have to.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.870 align:middle line:84%
But then you said they
were talking to military,

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:01.170 align:middle line:84%
and the Greys do communicate
with the military.

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:04.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't know if it's
common knowledge or not,

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:06.480 align:middle line:84%
but the Greys do claim,
through my clients,

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.390 align:middle line:84%
that they are the ones
responsible for giving us

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:14.400 align:middle line:84%
fiber optics and touch
technology on your cell phone

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.980 align:middle line:84%
and face recognition,
that they are

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.820 align:middle line:90%
directly responsible for that.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.230 align:middle line:84%
So they do communicate a
lot with our government.

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:23.620 align:middle line:90%
>> That's really interesting.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And there's another
component to this.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:31.170 align:middle line:84%
Listening to me say
the five second,

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:34.590 align:middle line:84%
when I just mentioned
the entire incident

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:39.010 align:middle line:84%
that I think that I'm
talking about here

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:40.760 align:middle line:90%
lasted about 1 minute.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And as this ship came across,
it was low and then curved.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:50.020 align:middle line:84%
For those five seconds,
would somebody else around me

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:54.400 align:middle line:84%
have noticed that I blanked
out for five seconds?

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably not
at all, because--

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.945 align:middle line:84%
>> Or did I blank out,
or was I still talking--

00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:00.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:02.320 align:middle line:90%
But isn't that interesting?

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.770 align:middle line:84%
Because the sighting
itself was very short.

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And when I say 5 seconds,
it lines up and makes sense.

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:13.840 align:middle line:90%
But what were they seeing?

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.210 align:middle line:90%
And the other part--

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:21.880 align:middle line:84%
Josh, I say that they
said hello to me.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:26.580 align:middle line:84%
I think they said, welcome,
hello, or hello, welcome.

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:27.560 align:middle line:90%
So they see me.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.250 align:middle line:90%
>> They see me.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:33.710 align:middle line:90%
What does that suggest?

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:36.535 align:middle line:90%
I didn't leave the hilltop.

00:13:36.535 --> 00:13:37.910 align:middle line:84%
Everybody would
have said, Jimmy,

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:39.690 align:middle line:84%
you disappeared in
front of our eyes.

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:40.580 align:middle line:90%
They didn't say that.

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:42.770 align:middle line:90%
But yet, I was acknowledged.

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:47.220 align:middle line:84%
My presence was acknowledged
in this room that, by the way,

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:48.140 align:middle line:90%
had no windows in it.

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:51.890 align:middle line:84%
So I couldn't see out and
see what was going on.

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:55.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, most likely, you
weren't in your body when you

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:58.830 align:middle line:84%
were on the ship, even though
it very much feels like that.

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they
shine that light on you,

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:05.180 align:middle line:84%
because that's actually a tool
to pop you out of your body,

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.570 align:middle line:84%
using this frequency
tool that they use.

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:11.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Very, very, very interesting.

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And the other nine beings that
were there never looked up,

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.370 align:middle line:90%
didn't acknowledge me.

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:18.800 align:middle line:90%
And that was it, by the way.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:25.040 align:middle line:84%
I also remember
them saying goodbye.

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.950 align:middle line:84%
But when they said
goodbye, it was--

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:30.170 align:middle line:90%
I was back on the hilltop.

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:30.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:32.387 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, like you
heard it in your--

00:14:32.387 --> 00:14:34.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And there was a few other
things that came out later,

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.910 align:middle line:90%
and we'll talk about that.

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:44.860 align:middle line:84%
This next clip is Why
Jimmy Needs to Know.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:48.640 align:middle line:84%
All right, I don't know what's
going on here with this.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.410 align:middle line:90%
Set this up for us a little bit.

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:53.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I believe this is the
part where your higher self

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:58.000 align:middle line:84%
tells you that you have a
very specific purpose in all

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000 align:middle line:90%
of this.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.020 align:middle line:84%
So this is where we
find out what that is.

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Am I talking in
the third person here?

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:04.480 align:middle line:90%
Well, we don't know.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's find out.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.730 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, let's find out.

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:08.938 align:middle line:84%
>> Can I speak directly with
Jimmy's higher self now,

00:15:08.938 --> 00:15:09.738 align:middle line:90%
please?

00:15:09.738 --> 00:15:11.170 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Why did you show
him this memory?

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.090 align:middle line:84%
What did you want
him to understand?

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:19.650 align:middle line:90%


00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:29.000 align:middle line:84%
>> That things really do happen
that you're not aware of.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.460 align:middle line:90%
You can't be afraid to--

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:34.280 align:middle line:90%
to find out.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>> What really happened when
he went into this dark room?

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:42.840 align:middle line:90%
>> He was scared.

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.910 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want to do it,
didn't want to find out.

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:47.170 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:51.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you want him to understand
anything else about his contact

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:56.080 align:middle line:84%
experience with those
particular beings?

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.220 align:middle line:90%
>> He's here.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.530 align:middle line:90%
He has a purpose.

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:05.760 align:middle line:84%
He understands that purpose
and his responsibility.

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:06.920 align:middle line:90%
He understands that.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.490 align:middle line:90%


00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:10.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Man, you were really under.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:11.280 align:middle line:90%
Woo!

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.080 align:middle line:90%
Wow!

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.370 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, I don't
remember any of that.

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:16.660 align:middle line:84%
I do now, now that
I've seen that.

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:17.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>> What was happening
at that time was--

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:24.180 align:middle line:90%
let's go with higher self--

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:29.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how else to
phrase it-- is asking me

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:31.350 align:middle line:90%
permission to say these things.

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And that was-- yeah,
yeah, should I say it?

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.150 align:middle line:90%
Is it OK?

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:37.410 align:middle line:90%
And I'm answering.

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:40.710 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] I'm having a
conversation with myself

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:42.510 align:middle line:90%
in my head.

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:44.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, go ahead.

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:44.880 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead and say it.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And I started speaking
in the third person.

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:50.460 align:middle line:90%
It was a very strange sensation.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:54.270 align:middle line:84%
But what I do say here
in the third person

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:59.790 align:middle line:84%
is that I didn't want
to know this stuff.

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:00.930 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that interesting?

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:07.200 align:middle line:84%
That I was putting up a
wall, and now it's go time?

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.790 align:middle line:90%
Like, right, this is it.

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:11.859 align:middle line:84%
And the floodgates
are about to open.

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:12.659 align:middle line:90%
And that's--

00:17:12.659 --> 00:17:15.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Because your higher self is
not going to show you anything

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:19.697 align:middle line:84%
that you're not completely ready
to see, because they are you.

00:17:19.697 --> 00:17:20.890 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:26.599 align:middle line:84%
And why do you think
I or another client

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:31.340 align:middle line:84%
would say that this is
something I don't want to know?

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:32.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm fighting this.

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:37.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't need this right now
in my life, which apparently

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:39.350 align:middle line:90%
is what I'm trying to suggest.

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:42.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Because before, you
didn't want to know.

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:46.160 align:middle line:84%
But you were obviously ready
now to find this information.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, and OK.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.310 align:middle line:84%
This is, again-- I'm just
being perfectly honest.

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:56.240 align:middle line:90%
I didn't necessarily--

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to discount
therapists and hypnotherapy

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:01.130 align:middle line:90%
and regression, OK, I don't.

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:04.920 align:middle line:90%
And a lot has come from it.

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.930 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't think
I had anything.

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:10.860 align:middle line:84%
I thought that my life
was just a 2D existence.

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.460 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing to see here.

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:13.690 align:middle line:90%
Let's move on.

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And there was--
any type of therapy

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:19.260 align:middle line:84%
like this would just
be a waste of time.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:23.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm completely shocked that
these statements were made

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:28.300 align:middle line:84%
and these kinds of revelations
came out about myself.

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:29.400 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to the next clip.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.610 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm not shocked, Jimmy.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:31.410 align:middle line:90%
I feel like--

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Why is that?

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:34.657 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I feel like anyone
who's super deep in our space,

00:18:34.657 --> 00:18:36.990 align:middle line:84%
who's really passionate about
communicating these issues

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:40.290 align:middle line:84%
usually has a family member
with experiences or themself

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:41.400 align:middle line:90%
as an experiencer.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.990 align:middle line:84%
As we found out
even on this show,

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:45.330 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the people on the
inside have experiences.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:45.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's true.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe you've been denying
that your whole life, you know?

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:48.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's true.

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:48.890 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:51.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, have you experienced
that too as well,

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:56.910 align:middle line:84%
where somebody that may not
be aware of an experience

00:18:56.910 --> 00:19:01.590 align:middle line:84%
has had them, and
family members have been

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:03.090 align:middle line:90%
going through the same thing?

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:05.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Definitely, all the time.

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:09.670 align:middle line:84%
So many of my clients have
no idea that they've actually

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:11.020 align:middle line:90%
been contacted.

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And then, when they're
under hypnosis,

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:14.620 align:middle line:90%
they'll find these things out.

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:18.280 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a very
normal experience for them.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.560 align:middle line:90%
>> All right, this next clip--

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.320 align:middle line:84%
OK, now this is interesting
just from the notes,

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.300 align:middle line:90%
from our producers here.

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:29.110 align:middle line:84%
This is How Disclosure
Will Happen.

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:31.600 align:middle line:84%
OK, all right, go ahead
and roll this, Josh.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's do it.

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:39.590 align:middle line:84%
>> This happens with
every species eventually--

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:40.490 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you mean?

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>> --throughout the universe.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.255 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you mean by that?

00:19:44.255 --> 00:19:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>> There comes a time when
every species finds out that

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:58.870 align:middle line:84%
they're not alone, and we
are now that species that is

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:02.830 align:middle line:84%
at that moment in
their own evolution.

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Will this be
known to everyone?

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:09.850 align:middle line:90%
How will this play out?

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:12.850 align:middle line:84%
>> It will all happen
at the same time.

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:15.860 align:middle line:90%
It's all very simple.

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:19.700 align:middle line:90%
It will be taught in schools.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:24.765 align:middle line:84%
It will be something that
can be touched and shown.

00:20:24.765 --> 00:20:27.080 align:middle line:90%


00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:27.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:28.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Touched--

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:29.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:30.490 align:middle line:90%
>> --and shown.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:34.330 align:middle line:84%
>> I've never said
that in my life.

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:37.960 align:middle line:84%
Again, thousands of hours
of broadcasting and guest

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.250 align:middle line:90%
in interviews.

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:43.540 align:middle line:84%
It will be something that
is touched and shown.

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.160 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty dramatic.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.350 align:middle line:90%
That's a pretty heavy statement.

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:49.000 align:middle line:84%
What did you think
when you heard

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.180 align:middle line:90%
me say something like that?

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:53.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I thought that was very
consistent to what I'm getting

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:58.240 align:middle line:84%
in my sessions, especially
that all species eventually get

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.350 align:middle line:84%
to this point, because that's
what my clients say when

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:04.570 align:middle line:84%
they're under hypnosis,
just what you said.

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And I know that we're
going in this direction

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:10.790 align:middle line:84%
to start really uncovering
who we really are.

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:14.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's in the stars, I
mean, literally in the stars.

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Like, a lot of the
extraterrestrials

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.970 align:middle line:84%
that come through
claim that we all have

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:21.415 align:middle line:90%
a star that we're tethered to.

00:21:21.415 --> 00:21:24.340 align:middle line:84%
Our stars are actually
portals, and each person

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:26.590 align:middle line:90%
is tethered to a portal or star.

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And so they've described it like
this, that there are 13 stars,

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.290 align:middle line:90%
so we're all tethered to.

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:36.060 align:middle line:90%
And they move in a wave pattern.

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And when they go above
the Galactic plane,

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:42.410 align:middle line:84%
is when people start to
become more aware of what's

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:43.560 align:middle line:90%
really going on.

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, all our 13
stars are moving up,

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:49.610 align:middle line:84%
so it's actually in
alignment for us to actually

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:50.810 align:middle line:90%
start evolving.

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's why this
alignment within our stars

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.270 align:middle line:84%
is actually one of the
reasons why we're going

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:57.830 align:middle line:90%
through this great awakening.

00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:01.430 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the
alignment of the stars.

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:07.130 align:middle line:84%
>> The touched and
shown parts sounds--

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:09.110 align:middle line:90%
it's not a suggestion.

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:15.490 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like for
everybody to understand

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:20.810 align:middle line:84%
in a finality type of
way, they won't get there

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:24.155 align:middle line:84%
until they have something that
they can touch and see, right?

00:22:24.155 --> 00:22:25.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm, yeah.

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:28.010 align:middle line:84%
>> No matter what, all the
video, all the imaging,

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:30.950 align:middle line:84%
all the Eyewitness testimony,
all the lights in the sky that

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:33.530 align:middle line:84%
you can see and talk
about is not enough.

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:35.900 align:middle line:84%
All of the witnesses that
you're going to bring forward

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:39.720 align:middle line:84%
and whistleblowers-- all
of that is not enough.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.360 align:middle line:90%
Touched and shown.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.710 align:middle line:90%
Here it is.

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:45.390 align:middle line:90%
Go up and fondle it.

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:47.490 align:middle line:90%
And what do you think?

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:50.160 align:middle line:84%
That's a pretty
profound-- and again, I've

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.030 align:middle line:90%
never said these words before.

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:55.150 align:middle line:90%
It's strange to hear me say it.

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:55.950 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:57.492 align:middle line:84%
Touched and shown--
is that what it's

00:22:57.492 --> 00:22:58.770 align:middle line:90%
going to take for disclosure?

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:00.687 align:middle line:84%
>> I think for a lot of
people, even myself--

00:23:00.687 --> 00:23:03.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm a true believer, and I think
the evidence is overwhelming.

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:05.670 align:middle line:84%
But until I see it
at least on camera,

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:06.810 align:middle line:90%
even that is not enough.

00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:09.150 align:middle line:84%
I think I need to see it
in person, eventually.

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:10.845 align:middle line:90%
I'm 99% there.

00:23:10.845 --> 00:23:12.450 align:middle line:90%
>> This next clip--

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:15.000 align:middle line:90%
How We Need to be One Species.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.560 align:middle line:90%


00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:21.580 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, I'm guessing that this
is the clip when you are saying

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:24.640 align:middle line:84%
that we are going to
all be one species.

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:30.070 align:middle line:84%
What I found so fascinating is
I asked your higher self just

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:34.240 align:middle line:84%
which extraterrestrials are
behind the disclosure movement

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.600 align:middle line:84%
and your answer was
that all of them are,

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.390 align:middle line:90%
which is so mind-blowing to me.

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And it is very
consistent, but it's

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:45.760 align:middle line:84%
mind blowing that
all of them, even

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.190 align:middle line:84%
the ones you would
consider more negative,

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:52.730 align:middle line:84%
are all in this to move this
disclosure movement forward.

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:53.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Isn't that--

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:56.320 align:middle line:84%
>> All of them, that we are
going to become one race.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:57.580 align:middle line:90%
>> We need popcorn.

00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:00.340 align:middle line:90%
We need popcorn here.

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:01.210 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:02.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's do it.

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:03.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's see-- let's
see what happens here.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.100 align:middle line:90%
How we need to be one species.

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:11.800 align:middle line:84%
We look at different species
from around the universe

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:17.520 align:middle line:84%
and contemplate and discuss
species from a planet.

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, we need to be that
species from this planet.

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.150 align:middle line:90%
We can't be divided.

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And the only way to get to
the next level of being one,

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:38.880 align:middle line:84%
to be looked at like we want
to look at everything else

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:44.550 align:middle line:84%
is to be one species
from Earth, humans.

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:46.530 align:middle line:90%
We cannot be divided.

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:50.490 align:middle line:90%
It's really that simple.

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:51.630 align:middle line:90%
>> That's heavy.

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:52.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:55.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could definitely
tell that you were deep under.

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:56.190 align:middle line:90%
>> I was deep.

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>> But I thought that was
so profound when you said,

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.420 align:middle line:90%
become one species.

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:03.540 align:middle line:84%
Because once we all
get this, whatever

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:07.770 align:middle line:84%
it is, that we can touch
it and see it, then

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:10.470 align:middle line:84%
I think we're all going
to have a different sense.

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
become that one species.

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:16.350 align:middle line:84%
So I thought it was so
profound because, really,

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:19.140 align:middle line:84%
who we all are, I mean,
every single person--

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:22.980 align:middle line:84%
we're all part of this ancient
group, this ancient group

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:27.510 align:middle line:84%
of beings that have traveled
from planet to planet.

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And we've all expanded
our consciousness,

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:31.860 align:middle line:90%
and we keep evolving.

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And we do this over and over
again in cyclical patterns,

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:37.470 align:middle line:90%
and that's who we really are.

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And when we have this thing,
that we can touch and see it,

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:44.040 align:middle line:84%
it's going to
change our purpose.

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:47.550 align:middle line:84%
We're going to understand
that we are one species.

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and isn't
that what we expect?

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And I totally understand
what I'm saying here.

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Again, I wish I would
have said this before.

00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And here on out, we can now
discuss it a little bit more

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:01.720 align:middle line:90%
in the open.

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:06.700 align:middle line:90%
But we say things like Martians.

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:10.990 align:middle line:84%
We're speaking of a
species from Mars,

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:14.200 align:middle line:84%
and that's the way
that we perceive

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:18.830 align:middle line:84%
and we want to look at the rest
of the universe in that way.

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:21.350 align:middle line:84%
But we don't look at
ourselves that way.

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:25.090 align:middle line:84%
So we do have to
become one species.

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:30.370 align:middle line:84%
We cannot be-- we wouldn't
look at subspecies on Mars

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:31.900 align:middle line:90%
and comment about that.

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:36.590 align:middle line:84%
No, we're looking at one planet,
one species from that planet.

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:37.390 align:middle line:90%
And that's how--

00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:38.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, we actually are.

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:39.545 align:middle line:84%
>> --how we need
to be looked at.

00:26:39.545 --> 00:26:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>> We actually are one species.

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:46.220 align:middle line:84%
We're not any different at all
from extraterrestrial races.

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:48.430 align:middle line:84%
In fact, a lot of
my clients, when

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:50.350 align:middle line:84%
they're deep under
hypnosis and they're

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:52.840 align:middle line:84%
going through their
contact experience,

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:56.590 align:middle line:84%
they realize that it's another
version of themselves that's

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:57.820 align:middle line:90%
contacting them.

00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And really, when you go
deep within yourself,

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:03.100 align:middle line:84%
you find out that
everything that you see

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:07.690 align:middle line:84%
is a reflection of you, even
your close relationships, even.

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:08.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, sure.

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:10.310 align:middle line:90%
>> So essentially, we are.

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:17.260 align:middle line:84%
>> I do remember commenting
about the physical side

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:20.950 align:middle line:84%
of these beings on this ship,
and I didn't know it was

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:21.950 align:middle line:90%
a ship.

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:22.750 align:middle line:90%
I didn't.

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:23.920 align:middle line:90%
I knew it was a room.

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.000 align:middle line:90%
I could see the room.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.080 align:middle line:90%
There were some windows.

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:29.410 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like I saw somebody
piloting or anything.

00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:36.460 align:middle line:84%
But that being said, they
all had a human construct,

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:37.510 align:middle line:90%
had a torso.

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:38.560 align:middle line:90%
They had legs.

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:39.700 align:middle line:90%
They had arms.

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:40.630 align:middle line:90%
They had a head.

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:44.570 align:middle line:84%
They did have a mouth, and
they were sitting like humans.

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:46.090 align:middle line:90%
They were standing like humans.

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:47.890 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see anybody
walk, by the way.

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:50.950 align:middle line:84%
But everything had a--
you know what I mean?

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:51.920 align:middle line:90%
Two arms, two legs--

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:52.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Bipedal.

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:53.230 align:middle line:90%
>> --had a head.

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:54.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, yeah, totally.

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:55.110 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:57.700 align:middle line:90%
So there was that aspect to it.

00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And it makes you
wonder, and listening

00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:03.340 align:middle line:84%
to my description
of this, are we

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:05.650 align:middle line:84%
looking at a future
version of ourselves?

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:07.240 align:middle line:84%
Are we looking at
time travelers?

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:12.010 align:middle line:84%
Is this an evolutionary process
of what we will eventually

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:13.800 align:middle line:90%
become.

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And the interdimensional
part of it--

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:18.280 align:middle line:84%
I think is a great
suggestion, that that's

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:22.780 align:middle line:84%
why it was fuzzy, because I
wasn't on the exact frequency

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:25.030 align:middle line:90%
that they were on.

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:27.140 align:middle line:84%
We're just separated
by a few degrees.

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:29.290 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, they're
just out of focus.

00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, also, some
extraterrestrial races--

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:34.640 align:middle line:84%
like, aside from
their avatar body,

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:39.100 align:middle line:84%
they have this kind of white
film that goes over them.

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:42.430 align:middle line:84%
Their skin is usually like
a dolphin-like skin, kind

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:45.280 align:middle line:90%
of like a wetsuit material.

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:49.240 align:middle line:84%
But then over them, they
have this compression film.

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And that can also be
why they're very fuzzy,

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:55.120 align:middle line:84%
because that
compression film on them

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:59.860 align:middle line:84%
is also making them a little
bit more invisible to your eye.

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:04.330 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that it was a
ship that I was on, but I

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:06.190 align:middle line:90%
didn't feel-- it wasn't moving.

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:08.650 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have the
sense of motion.

00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:10.120 align:middle line:90%
But there were no windows.

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:10.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So I don't have that
component to the story.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And I know that I am going
to get asked about that,

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:18.030 align:middle line:90%
like I ask everybody else.

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:18.830 align:middle line:90%
And I don't--

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:20.180 align:middle line:90%
I don't have an answer there.

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:21.830 align:middle line:84%
>> It doesn't feel
like you're moving,

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:24.440 align:middle line:84%
because they use
this toroidal field.

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:25.850 align:middle line:90%
That's how they travel.

00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And so in that toroidal field,
there's no sense of movement.

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:32.630 align:middle line:84%
But because you have
brown eyes, you're

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:38.270 align:middle line:84%
more likely to be contacted by a
being that isn't using windows,

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:41.630 align:middle line:84%
because they're usually
further away from the sun.

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Whereas people with
blue eyes or people

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:48.440 align:middle line:84%
with a circle around
the pupil would normally

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:53.240 align:middle line:84%
be contacted by Pleiadians,
say, who would have windows.

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.680 align:middle line:90%
So it's really interesting how--

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.280 align:middle line:90%
>> What color are your eyes?

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.080 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you're next.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:57.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Brown.

00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:58.400 align:middle line:90%
>> You're next.

00:29:58.400 --> 00:29:58.670 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:58.670 --> 00:29:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>> I want to be next.

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:01.910 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, we've got--

00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:03.110 align:middle line:90%
we've got two other clips.

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:06.650 align:middle line:84%
I think these might
be a little shorter.

00:30:06.650 --> 00:30:09.770 align:middle line:90%
This next one, again, I--

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:11.940 align:middle line:90%
Now Jimmy Knows.

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:15.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Ooh, that sounds ominous.

00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:17.450 align:middle line:90%
>> We are being visited.

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:27.110 align:middle line:84%
We are in contact, that
the discussion about this

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.980 align:middle line:90%
needs to happen.

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:32.700 align:middle line:90%


00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:34.985 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't-- he
doesn't have a fear.

00:30:34.985 --> 00:30:38.560 align:middle line:90%


00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.275 align:middle line:90%
Now he knows.

00:30:40.275 --> 00:30:41.075 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:30:41.075 --> 00:30:41.945 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:30:41.945 --> 00:30:43.310 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:44.450 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:48.500 align:middle line:90%
All right, now I remember.

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:52.490 align:middle line:84%
That was my higher self
talking in the third person

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:56.790 align:middle line:84%
that now I know
how to move forward

00:30:56.790 --> 00:31:01.250 align:middle line:84%
and that I don't have a fear
of what's about to happen

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:04.910 align:middle line:84%
or the subject and/or
a concern about it.

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:07.310 align:middle line:90%
Now I know and--

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:12.110 align:middle line:84%
and it's my mission, I
guess, the hero's journey

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:13.040 align:middle line:90%
to present this.

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:14.265 align:middle line:90%
That's what I get from that.

00:31:14.265 --> 00:31:15.065 align:middle line:90%
>> Me too.

00:31:15.065 --> 00:31:15.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:15.950 align:middle line:90%
>> You too?

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:17.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:19.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Does it suggest--

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:21.620 align:middle line:90%
this is strange for me to say--

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:24.920 align:middle line:90%
that I didn't know before?

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:28.310 align:middle line:84%
Because the higher self is
saying, now Jimmy knows.

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:31.960 align:middle line:84%
That must be because of
the reveal on the ship.

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:32.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm.

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:33.015 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:31:33.015 --> 00:31:33.815 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:31:33.815 --> 00:31:35.070 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:36.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that what's going on here?

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>> It sure seemed like that.

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:41.400 align:middle line:84%
Like, now you know
just how important

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:43.890 align:middle line:84%
you are to this
disclosure movement,

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:47.440 align:middle line:84%
and now you know that you
were taken aboard that ship.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.110 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:50.630 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:51.920 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:54.260 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'm excited.

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:55.367 align:middle line:90%
Can we watch one more?

00:31:55.367 --> 00:31:56.450 align:middle line:90%
Do we have the time, Josh?

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:57.170 align:middle line:90%
You're the boss.

00:31:57.170 --> 00:31:57.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's do it.

00:31:57.690 --> 00:31:58.490 align:middle line:90%
>> But wait.

00:31:58.490 --> 00:32:02.270 align:middle line:84%
I want to say that it is very
important and so interesting

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:04.790 align:middle line:84%
that you said that you
don't have fear about this

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:07.520 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of the
extraterrestrials

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:09.950 align:middle line:84%
want to use people
that don't have

00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:15.690 align:middle line:84%
fear because they get to know us
through our reactions to them.

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:16.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And so describing that
you don't have fear makes you

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.690 align:middle line:90%
actually more open for contact.

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:22.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:23.290 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's the way that--
if you put it in context,

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:30.170 align:middle line:84%
it's the way that it's
said, he doesn't have fear.

00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:30.978 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:32:30.978 --> 00:32:32.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's very interesting.

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:37.160 align:middle line:84%
OK, this next clip
is not about peace.

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:39.260 align:middle line:90%
It's about happiness.

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:40.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm.

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:40.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm.

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:41.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you remember this?

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:42.340 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:43.450 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:44.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's do it.

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:45.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's go.

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:54.130 align:middle line:84%
We have to have our goal,
and that will give us

00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:58.780 align:middle line:90%
the goal to move forward.

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:02.010 align:middle line:90%


00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:07.620 align:middle line:84%
Peace is the wrong word, but
happiness is the right word.

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:08.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And we have to have
a goal in front of us,

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:22.580 align:middle line:84%
and that goal is knowing
finally that we are not alone.

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:23.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:23.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Whoa.

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:24.460 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:30.930 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's unpack this
a little bit here.

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:34.020 align:middle line:90%
I said, peace is the wrong word.

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:35.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:39.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Happiness is the right word.

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And you would think that
they were almost synonymous,

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:44.270 align:middle line:84%
but I removed peace
from the table.

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:45.440 align:middle line:90%
It's not peace.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:47.780 align:middle line:90%
It's happiness.

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And until we achieve that,
we can't get to the goal.

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:54.650 align:middle line:90%
Pretty interesting.

00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:56.300 align:middle line:84%
Pretty interesting
choice of words,

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:58.730 align:middle line:84%
again, something I've
never even thought about,

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:00.335 align:middle line:90%
I've certainly never said.

00:34:00.335 --> 00:34:02.940 align:middle line:90%


00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:04.070 align:middle line:90%
What do you make of that?

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, but according
to your higher self,

00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:09.980 align:middle line:84%
we should all get excited
because it sounds like

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:12.350 align:middle line:90%
disclosure is happening now.

00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:16.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the way they made
it sound, like, we are all

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:18.810 align:middle line:84%
going to know that
we are not alone,

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:20.810 align:middle line:90%
that we can actually be happy.

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:24.630 align:middle line:84%
We can be free knowing that we
really are much more powerful.

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:27.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, that's a great--
that's a really great point.

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:29.239 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:34:29.239 --> 00:34:32.900 align:middle line:90%
It's like a conundrum.

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:34.570 align:middle line:84%
You can't have one
without the other.

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:36.909 align:middle line:84%
You can't get to the
goal without happiness,

00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:39.539 align:middle line:84%
and you can't have happiness
unless you get to the goal.

00:34:39.539 --> 00:34:40.339 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:40.339 --> 00:34:43.659 align:middle line:84%
>> So you have to have both
happen at the same time,

00:34:43.659 --> 00:34:46.780 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't matter
about a peaceful existence.

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:50.710 align:middle line:84%
You have to be
happy and smiling--

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:51.820 align:middle line:90%
>> That's happiness.

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:54.520 align:middle line:84%
>> --and finding out
that we're not alone.

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:56.739 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's remove the
fear from disclosure.

00:34:56.739 --> 00:34:57.610 align:middle line:90%
I like this.

00:34:57.610 --> 00:34:59.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely incredible.

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:00.830 align:middle line:90%
I want to do this again.

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:03.190 align:middle line:90%
And how many--

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:06.400 align:middle line:84%
I could understand
after the questions

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:10.030 align:middle line:84%
that I've had about doing
this kind of therapy.

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:14.320 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I
could do it tonight.

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I could
do that two days in a row.

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:16.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:17.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:18.250 align:middle line:90%
It's like doing anything--

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:19.050 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a test.

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>> --too that-- right,
too fun, too much.

00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:24.430 align:middle line:90%
It's in excess.

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:27.970 align:middle line:84%
But I really look
forward to the next time.

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:32.200 align:middle line:84%
How many clients do the exact
same thing, where they come off

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:35.080 align:middle line:84%
of something like this, and
they just want to circle back

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:36.820 align:middle line:90%
and schedule another session?

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Honestly, my clients
usually come once a year

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:43.533 align:middle line:84%
because it's like they
uncover everything.

00:35:43.533 --> 00:35:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>> That's exactly
what I'm saying.

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:49.438 align:middle line:84%
>> And they need to process
it because, as you know,

00:35:49.438 --> 00:35:51.460 align:middle line:90%
it's kind of intense.

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:54.730 align:middle line:84%
It's like, wow, you found
out all this information.

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And then it's almost like
an onion is peeling back.

00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And you start to
realize, oh, wow,

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:04.220 align:middle line:84%
I slowly start to know
a lot more about myself.

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And then you get curious again
and want another session.

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what happened
to me last night.

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:16.020 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sleeping, and I
remember I'm dreaming.

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:18.570 align:middle line:90%
Very restful night, by the way.

00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:21.600 align:middle line:84%
It was pretty
incredible how well--

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.610 align:middle line:90%
an uneventful night.

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:27.040 align:middle line:84%
I remembered the
dome in the room.

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.950 align:middle line:90%
And I sat-- I woke up.

00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:30.800 align:middle line:90%
I was like [CLICKS FINGERS].

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.450 align:middle line:90%
It was a dome.

00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:36.830 align:middle line:84%
I was having a hard time
describing these curved walls,

00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:38.370 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't understand it.

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw it and
went, oh, it was a dome.

00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:43.820 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that we were
going to show that clip today.

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:45.870 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what was
going to be revealed.

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:48.410 align:middle line:84%
But that was part of
it, where you continue

00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:51.560 align:middle line:90%
to unpack and understand.

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:54.600 align:middle line:90%
And you remember all of it.

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:57.410 align:middle line:84%
It's not like it's
gone away, but you

00:36:57.410 --> 00:36:58.970 align:middle line:90%
need to slowly unpack this.

00:36:58.970 --> 00:37:01.790 align:middle line:84%
I could see that, once a
year, that it would take--

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:05.420 align:middle line:84%
it would take a while to
take advantage of everything

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:09.080 align:middle line:84%
that you're taught,
revealed, and learn.

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:10.610 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely incredible.

00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:12.680 align:middle line:90%
Sarah, thank you so much.

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:13.880 align:middle line:90%
The community thanks you.

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:16.220 align:middle line:84%
This is a very,
very special show,

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:18.320 align:middle line:84%
one that I really
don't want to end.

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.850 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think I can watch
another clip of myself today.

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:21.650 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:23.360 align:middle line:90%
Josh, what did you learn?

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I learned a ton.

00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:25.800 align:middle line:90%
I just want to do it myself.

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.140 align:middle line:84%
I just want to know when
your next appointment is

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:28.550 align:middle line:90%
so I can sign myself up.

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:29.990 align:middle line:90%
I want that experience.

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:31.650 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing to go through.

00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>> I didn't mention
this earlier.

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:38.760 align:middle line:84%
So for everybody to understand,
we did this session alone

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:39.720 align:middle line:90%
in a studio.

00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:41.530 align:middle line:84%
We had the camera
set up in there,

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:43.470 align:middle line:90%
but we were alone in there.

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:45.442 align:middle line:84%
You were watching
from the other room.

00:37:45.442 --> 00:37:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I didn't see anything.

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:47.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, you didn't see any of it?

00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:48.570 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't see one thing.

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:48.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, yeah, I
purposely waited till--

00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:52.005 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, that's why you
weren't looking at me strange

00:37:52.005 --> 00:37:52.260 align:middle line:90%
afterwards.

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:53.635 align:middle line:84%
>> No, that was
all right for me.

00:37:53.635 --> 00:37:54.810 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, good, good, good.

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:56.130 align:middle line:90%
OK, I feel better.

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:57.780 align:middle line:90%
Sarah, thank you so much.

00:37:57.780 --> 00:37:59.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:37:59.050 --> 00:38:00.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Congratulations.

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And our friendship is
special, but that friendship

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:06.180 align:middle line:90%
is what allowed this to happen.

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And I learned so
much about myself.

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, we
can move forward

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:13.230 align:middle line:84%
with not only
disclosure, but I can

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:16.650 align:middle line:84%
use the tools of this
show and other media

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:21.220 align:middle line:84%
from what I learned from this to
continue to talk to the world.

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:22.020 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:22.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:26.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm so honored I was your
first hypnosis regression.

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:27.450 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:29.880 align:middle line:84%
>> For "Into the Vortex,"
I'm Jimmy Church.

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:31.800 align:middle line:90%
And we'll see you next time.

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:35.150 align:middle line:90%
