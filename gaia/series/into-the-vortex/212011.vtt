>> I'm radio and television
host Jimmy Church,

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.280 align:middle line:84%
and I am here to uncover
the truth about some

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.660 align:middle line:90%
of life's biggest mysteries.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.200 align:middle line:84%
If this is revealed,
everything has to be rewritten.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.690 align:middle line:84%
My guest today is Andrew
Gough, historical investigator

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.440 align:middle line:84%
exploring the secrets of the
Temple of Solomon's treasures

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.920 align:middle line:84%
and the enduring
Knights Templar legacy.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.520 align:middle line:84%
>> The Knights Templar were
given residence over the Holy

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.050 align:middle line:84%
of Holies in 1119, and they
undoubtedly were looking

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.760 align:middle line:90%
for some very specific objects.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.450 align:middle line:84%
>> As always, MUFON
Field Investigator Josh--

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh, can you
pull up the map?

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:49.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.340 align:middle line:84%
>> --joins us to
help set the scene.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.300 align:middle line:84%
Join us as we dive deep to
get to the bottom of some

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.570 align:middle line:84%
of the most intriguing
questions of our time.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe these things were
buried because our overlords

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.540 align:middle line:90%
aren't very nice people.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And the day when these
overlords are gone,

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.500 align:middle line:84%
this information can come out
and we can all benefit from it.

>> Welcome to "Into the Vortex."

00:01:26.895 --> 00:01:28.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host Jimmy Church.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And today, I'm talking
to Andrew Gough.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.075 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go into
deep history today.

00:01:33.075 --> 00:01:36.253 align:middle line:84%
He's a historian and
specializes on the Ark

00:01:36.253 --> 00:01:37.920 align:middle line:84%
of the Covenant, and
of course, research

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.640 align:middle line:84%
into artifacts out of
the Temple of Solomon.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And Josh, before we get
started, deep history today.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.290 align:middle line:84%
This is what the world
is talking about.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.440 align:middle line:84%
There is an interest
about things

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.250 align:middle line:84%
that may have been held
from us in the past.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.070 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
about this, and are we

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.790 align:middle line:90%
about to get the big reveal?

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.790 align:middle line:84%
>> More and more, every
day is getting revealed.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.267 align:middle line:84%
I'm excited, all this new
information I wasn't aware of.

00:02:05.267 --> 00:02:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm getting more
and more into it.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.009 align:middle line:90%
I find it fascinating.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Deep history is
where we're at, Andrew.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.270 align:middle line:84%
We talk about the Ark of
the Covenant and the Knights

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.550 align:middle line:84%
Templar, and Steven
Spielberg will

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.280 align:middle line:84%
come to mind, and
all of these things.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.840 align:middle line:90%
And we all want to be that.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.090 align:middle line:90%
There's a fascination there.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.100 align:middle line:84%
How accurate is the
stuff that's been

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.800 align:middle line:84%
depicted about the
historical significance

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.270 align:middle line:90%
of the Temple of Solomon?

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's the
question, right?

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.820 align:middle line:84%
It's such a romantic
subject that people just

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.660 align:middle line:84%
extrapolate on very
flimsy foundations

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.170 align:middle line:84%
and make these incredible
stories and mythologies

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.220 align:middle line:84%
about something that we're
not entirely sure what it was

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.890 align:middle line:84%
or if the temple even
existed in the first place,

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.020 align:middle line:84%
or if Solomon even existed
in the first place.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.920 align:middle line:84%
But what we do know is
that the legend is greater

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.230 align:middle line:90%
than any other from Antiquity.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, then we
have the other side,

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.880 align:middle line:84%
the religious aspect of
it, and its importance.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.940 align:middle line:90%
And it's been ransacked.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.830 align:middle line:84%
It's been built. It's been
rebuilt. What's under it?

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:10.630 align:middle line:90%
The tunnels.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.260 align:middle line:84%
The religious side of
it is just as important.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's very
charged, as you know.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And the prophecies about
what happens if you do

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.420 align:middle line:84%
find something like the
Ark of the Covenant.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And if you do, go ahead
and build the third temple.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.900 align:middle line:84%
The implications from
a religious standpoint,

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.200 align:middle line:84%
a political standpoint, a world
awareness standpoint are huge.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.470 align:middle line:84%
So it makes me wonder
if the Ark is out there

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.360 align:middle line:90%
and someone has discovered it.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.340 align:middle line:90%
Would you want anyone to know?

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Do we know really what
the temple looked like?

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And is there any
evidence showing that?

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.520 align:middle line:84%
Because it's been rebuilt. It's
been built. It's been attacked.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.720 align:middle line:90%
It's been invaded.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.870 align:middle line:84%
But originally, the original
design, what did it look like?

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.020 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, so what we have left
is the second temple, right?

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.270 align:middle line:10%
And we can go to
Jerusalem and look at it

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.560 align:middle line:10%
and touch it and feel it.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.475 align:middle line:90%
The first temple?

00:04:03.475 --> 00:04:04.275 align:middle line:90%
Hmm.

00:04:04.275 --> 00:04:05.770 align:middle line:90%
Not so sure.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.350 align:middle line:84%
It could be because we're
looking in the wrong era.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:09.550 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's older.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.990 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's more recent
than we think it is.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.310 align:middle line:10%
But what we do know is that
it was a massive edifice that

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.010 align:middle line:10%
was created, amongst
other purposes,

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.310 align:middle line:10%
to have the Ark of the Covenant
and other sacred relics

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.250 align:middle line:10%
in something called
the Holy of the Holies.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.475 align:middle line:84%
But we know very little
about where it was.

00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And historians and scholars
enthusiastically, let's put it

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.780 align:middle line:84%
that way, debate the whereabouts
of it, the existence of it

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.070 align:middle line:90%
to this very day.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Can we actually stop
right there for a second?

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.610 align:middle line:84%
Because when we talk
about the general layout

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.080 align:middle line:84%
of these temples,
you have access to--

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.320 align:middle line:90%
and then you have access.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
the Holy of Holies

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.100 align:middle line:90%
where nobody can go into.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.300 align:middle line:90%
It's a very privileged area.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And nobody really gets to
see what is in there, right?

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.580 align:middle line:84%
Is that the tradition, to
have these chambers get

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.990 align:middle line:84%
more and more secret as you go
deeper into the temple itself?

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.258 align:middle line:84%
The high priests
were the only ones

00:05:07.258 --> 00:05:08.950 align:middle line:84%
who had access to
the Holy of Holies,

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.970 align:middle line:84%
and even they on just
particular dates.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.375 align:middle line:84%
Where I think the Ark of
the Covenant might be today

00:05:17.375 --> 00:05:20.650 align:middle line:84%
is guarded, and it has
been guarded for centuries

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.910 align:middle line:84%
by sultans who only had access
to it on one day of the year,

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:25.750 align:middle line:90%
during Ramadan.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.020 align:middle line:84%
So that whole tradition
of the most sacred relics

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.020 align:middle line:84%
are in a place that is so
guarded that very few get

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.590 align:middle line:90%
a chance to ever see them.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>> So the Knights Templar, if
we go with the romantic side

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.860 align:middle line:84%
of this and the Crusades and
they arrive in Jerusalem,

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:43.960 align:middle line:90%
these stories--

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.500 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want to
call it folklore,

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.970 align:middle line:84%
but it's kind of
hard to nail down.

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.940 align:middle line:84%
But it appears that they were
interested in what was there

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.050 align:middle line:84%
and what was hidden there
at the temple itself.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.813 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the examples
of the artifacts that they

00:06:01.813 --> 00:06:02.980 align:middle line:90%
would have been looking for?

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, as we know,
or as we've been told,

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.430 align:middle line:84%
the Knights Templar were
given residence over the Holy

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:15.820 align:middle line:84%
of the Holies in 1119, and
they undoubtedly were looking

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.390 align:middle line:90%
for some very specific objects.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.550 align:middle line:10%
So you have the legendary Temple
of Solomon treasure, which

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.890 align:middle line:10%
includes the Ark of the
Covenant, which included

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:28.560 align:middle line:10%
in itself the Ten Commandments,
the staff of Aaron,

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.450 align:middle line:10%
and a pot of manna.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:34.440 align:middle line:10%
But you have, according
to Solomon's mythology,

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.300 align:middle line:10%
500 tons of gold, gold
from the Garden of Eden.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.030 align:middle line:84%
You have the menorah,
the tabernacle.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:46.710 align:middle line:84%
You have all these incredible
artifacts right there

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.210 align:middle line:90%
in the Holy of Holies.

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, let's take a look at
the Ark of the Covenant really

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.800 align:middle line:90%
quick.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.960 align:middle line:84%
Josh, if you could pull this
up, this is a general idea.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we're all
used to what it may be.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.455 align:middle line:10%
But when we look at this image
of the Ark of the Covenant,

00:07:04.455 --> 00:07:05.640 align:middle line:10%
what are we looking at?

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.890 align:middle line:10%
Dimension-wise,
is this accurate?

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:11.340 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, well, you know,
I travel a lot and I see

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.920 align:middle line:10%
representations of the
Ark many places I go.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.430 align:middle line:10%
This is in Paris, in a church
of St. Mary the Virgin,

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:18.900 align:middle line:10%
not too far from the Louvre.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.540 align:middle line:10%
And the instructions for
the Ark are really specific.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:27.760 align:middle line:84%
It's 51 inches in
length, 31 inches deep,

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.595 align:middle line:90%
and 31 inches wide.

00:07:30.595 --> 00:07:32.115 align:middle line:90%
They left no doubt about that.

00:07:32.115 --> 00:07:33.490 align:middle line:84%
>> So anybody
could build an Ark.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Anyone could build an Ark.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it has a
certain kind of wood,

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.700 align:middle line:84%
and it has a certain
kind of gold on the top,

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.700 align:middle line:84%
and it has the two winged
angels, as you see here.

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And this is just
a rendition of--

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.090 align:middle line:84%
anyone could create
something that

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:51.550 align:middle line:84%
looks like this because
the instructions to build

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:55.120 align:middle line:90%
it are so uniquely specific.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.980 align:middle line:84%
Nowhere else in
ancient texts do you

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:03.790 align:middle line:84%
find dimensions and
contents and substances that

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:05.900 align:middle line:84%
go into a product
like you do when

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.150 align:middle line:90%
they're talking about the Ark.

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it makes
me a little suspicious.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:19.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, this obviously isn't
the actual Ark because I can see

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.640 align:middle line:90%
a depiction of the cross there.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:26.170 align:middle line:10%
And the original Ark--
that's in the time of Moses--

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:28.360 align:middle line:10%
predates the time of Jesus.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.420 align:middle line:84%
So this was built after
Jesus came and went, right?

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:33.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.679 align:middle line:84%
So this is just an
enthusiast building

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:38.809 align:middle line:84%
an ark for their church,
and we see that many places.

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:40.480 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it in
Saint-Sulpice in Paris.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.820 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it in churches
in London where I live.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.460 align:middle line:84%
Because the directions
are so specific

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.350 align:middle line:84%
and the dimensions
are so specific,

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:50.150 align:middle line:84%
it's easy to recreate
what it looks like.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And people do that
just to honor it.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Here you can see images
of the cross and things

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.410 align:middle line:84%
that came much
later than the Ark.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:09:00.220 align:middle line:84%
The Ark of Moses was
about 1500 BC-ish.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:01.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, 1500 BC.

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And so if you rebuild the acacia
wood and your gold plating

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:09.190 align:middle line:84%
and you've got the
right angels on the top

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:12.430 align:middle line:84%
and you've got the
shafts and the rings

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:16.500 align:middle line:84%
and you build it
correctly, is it magical?

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.040 align:middle line:90%
Does it have power?

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:18.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:19.920 align:middle line:90%
No, great question.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.530 align:middle line:84%
So if you were to ask
me, what is the Ark,

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:24.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell
you, I don't know.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:28.140 align:middle line:84%
It appears-- well,
the Ark of Moses.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.690 align:middle line:84%
Let's be really specific
because there are probably

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.300 align:middle line:84%
many different arks,
but there's only

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.790 align:middle line:84%
one Ark of Moses
that was created

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.860 align:middle line:90%
at the foot of Mount Sinai.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's the one that
I've been researching.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.210 align:middle line:90%
I don't think--

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:43.530 align:middle line:90%
I might be wrong.

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:45.870 align:middle line:84%
If you and I went out
and bought the materials

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:48.090 align:middle line:84%
and created one
today, that we could

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:51.270 align:middle line:84%
create some kind of
cosmic energy effect

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:53.730 align:middle line:90%
that the Ark is legendary for.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:54.910 align:middle line:90%
>> I would love to try.

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:55.710 align:middle line:90%
>> I'd like to try.

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:58.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you mentioned
the staff of Moses.

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is very intriguing
to me too as well.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And so at the Temple
of Solomon, this

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.255 align:middle line:84%
would have been something
else in the Holy of Holies.

00:10:06.255 --> 00:10:07.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yes.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:08.370 align:middle line:90%
We have the staff of Moses.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:09.960 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's heard about that.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:14.340 align:middle line:84%
Arguably, that was a big, proper
staff, a staff like a pharaoh

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:15.250 align:middle line:90%
would have.

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:19.120 align:middle line:84%
But his brother, Aaron,
also had a staff.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.780 align:middle line:84%
And it was equally as magical,
according to the Old Testament.

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:25.450 align:middle line:84%
However, it was a
different kind of staff.

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:27.460 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like a
pharaoh's staff.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:31.375 align:middle line:84%
And it had little buds that
were coming out of the staff.

00:10:31.375 --> 00:10:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's this staff that
was inside the Ark of Moses.

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:39.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, we've got an im--
yeah, pull it up, Josh.

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Is this what you're
referring to?

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:47.500 align:middle line:10%
So this is in Istanbul in
Topkapi Palace in a museum

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.290 align:middle line:10%
and in the privy chamber
of the museum that

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:54.490 align:middle line:10%
has some of the holiest
relics from Antiquity.

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:58.570 align:middle line:84%
They call this the
staff of Moses.

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:00.200 align:middle line:90%
And when I look at it--

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.770 align:middle line:84%
and for reasons I'll
share in a moment--

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:05.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's the
staff of Moses at all.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.995 align:middle line:90%
I think it's the staff of Aaron.

00:11:06.995 --> 00:11:07.795 align:middle line:90%
Also--

00:11:07.795 --> 00:11:08.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Why?

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:09.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Why?

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:12.670 align:middle line:84%
Because you can see the
little kind of buds.

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:15.820 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps-- I've been going
here for about 15 years,

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:19.970 align:middle line:84%
and they've just allowed you to
photograph it, thank goodness.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:20.770 align:middle line:90%
It's small.

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:24.890 align:middle line:84%
It would fit into
a 51-inch chest.

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:30.040 align:middle line:84%
It has the growths on it
that the Old Testament

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.830 align:middle line:90%
says the staff of Aaron did.

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:35.620 align:middle line:84%
So I look at that
and I think, no.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.210 align:middle line:90%
That's not the staff of Moses.

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:38.710 align:middle line:90%
It's the staff of Aaron.

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:40.790 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's not very big.

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:41.860 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not very big.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And it would have to
be kind of small-ish

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:49.300 align:middle line:84%
if it's going to fit into
a 51-inch chest, right?

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And for instance,
a friend of mine,

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.710 align:middle line:84%
a colleague, Graham Phillips,
argues the staff of Moses

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:54.970 align:middle line:90%
is a big pharaoh's staff.

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:57.400 align:middle line:90%
It's in a museum in Birmingham.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:01.165 align:middle line:84%
This is his brother's staff,
and it's altogether different.

00:12:01.165 --> 00:12:05.680 align:middle line:84%
But this is in a room that
has the pot of Abraham.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.630 align:middle line:90%
It has the turban of Joseph.

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:11.650 align:middle line:84%
It has scripture from
John the Baptist.

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:12.730 align:middle line:90%
It has his arm.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And it has everything
of Muhammad.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.450 align:middle line:84%
His footprint, his
beard, his teeth.

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:18.730 align:middle line:84%
It has all these sacred
relics, including

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:21.430 align:middle line:84%
the Shroud of the
Holy Stone of Kaaba

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:23.140 align:middle line:90%
and the keys to the Kaaba.

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:26.020 align:middle line:84%
But it's what is
in the other room

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:29.230 align:middle line:84%
30 feet away that
really got me thinking,

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:32.560 align:middle line:84%
that is not the staff of
Moses, but the staff of Aaron.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And what was
in the other room?

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So all those incredible
relics are in the room I just

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:38.290 align:middle line:90%
described, right?

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.780 align:middle line:84%
You can walk around, touch
the screen, take your time,

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:42.325 align:middle line:90%
look at them.

00:12:42.325 --> 00:12:44.680 align:middle line:84%
You walk into the
other room and you

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:48.730 align:middle line:84%
have men looking very serious
with semi-automatic machine

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:53.510 align:middle line:84%
guns and a chap who reads out
loud live from the Quran 24

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:56.950 align:middle line:84%
hours a day because what's
in there is so much more

00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:59.150 align:middle line:90%
holy than what's in there.

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:00.910 align:middle line:84%
>> We're talking
about the Holy Mantle.

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:01.850 align:middle line:90%
>> The Holy Mantle.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:02.650 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:05.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've got an image
of the Holy Mantle.

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And as we pull this up, you
make an interesting comment

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.550 align:middle line:90%
that this is guarded, right?

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:14.200 align:middle line:90%
Armed, armed gentlemen.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And not to get
ahead of our skis,

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:20.470 align:middle line:84%
but there are other
locations around the world

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:22.900 align:middle line:84%
with alleged Ark
of the Covenants

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.090 align:middle line:90%
that are unguarded, right?

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And you would think that if
it is the Ark of the Covenant

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.900 align:middle line:84%
that held the Ten
Commandments and built

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:35.230 align:middle line:84%
by Moses, by instructions
of God at the foot--

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:38.800 align:middle line:84%
foothills of Mount Sinai that
it would be better protected.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.730 align:middle line:90%
But is this the Holy Mantle?

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:46.240 align:middle line:10%
>> I look at this and I
think, OK, it's in a big room,

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.550 align:middle line:10%
shielded with glass, and scary
men with these machine guns,

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:50.350 align:middle line:10%
right?

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:52.600 align:middle line:10%
I'm like, OK, well,
what's in that chest

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.940 align:middle line:10%
because it must be
incredible, right?

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:59.380 align:middle line:10%
Well, it is a coat
that Muhammad gave

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.810 align:middle line:10%
to his friend who was a poet.

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:03.980 align:middle line:90%
And I think, OK, that's cool.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:04.780 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:05.740 align:middle line:90%
That's sacred.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.700 align:middle line:84%
But it's nothing like
what's in the other room.

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Then I researched that,
and there's another chest

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:13.648 align:middle line:90%
in the foreground.

00:14:13.648 --> 00:14:14.940 align:middle line:90%
You can't see it in this photo.

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:15.960 align:middle line:90%
Same sort of thing.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:24.680 align:middle line:84%
It has a flag or a banner from
the period that Muhammad lived.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:29.360 align:middle line:84%
But these chests were
taken out into battle

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.267 align:middle line:90%
by the Ottomans and others.

00:14:31.267 --> 00:14:32.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Like the Ark of the Covenant.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Like the Ark of the Covenant.

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:37.310 align:middle line:84%
Like, Joshua and the Philistines
took it out in the battle.

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:40.130 align:middle line:84%
They took this chest
out into battle.

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And then it occurred to me,
it's not what's in the chest.

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:45.920 align:middle line:84%
It's not the coat that Muhammad
gave his friend, the poet.

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:48.020 align:middle line:90%
It's the chest itself.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:49.730 align:middle line:84%
It's the only
reason why it would

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:51.740 align:middle line:84%
be guarded by men
with machine guns

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:54.600 align:middle line:84%
and a chap who reads live
from the Quran 24 hours a day.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.200 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.590 align:middle line:84%
Is there dating on
the Holy Mantle?

00:14:58.590 --> 00:14:59.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:01.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like everything--
and forgive me

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:04.925 align:middle line:84%
for being cynical-- in
today's world of the Internet,

00:15:04.925 --> 00:15:05.930 align:middle line:90%
we're censored.

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:08.180 align:middle line:84%
Imagine how easy it would
be to censor something

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.400 align:middle line:84%
before the internet,
before the printing press,

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:11.383 align:middle line:90%
back in this era.

00:15:11.383 --> 00:15:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>> You could do
whatever you want.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.550 align:middle line:84%
>> You could say
anything you want, right?

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:17.180 align:middle line:84%
So the history of this is
that it comes from Egypt, et

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.470 align:middle line:90%
cetera, et cetera.

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:19.940 align:middle line:90%
Very vague.

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.780 align:middle line:90%
Not ancient.

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:23.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it inscribed?

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything on
it that would identify?

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:31.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So the Ottomans inscribed
various things that the sultans

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:35.170 align:middle line:84%
imbued with it because the
sultans actually were the only

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:38.320 align:middle line:84%
ones allowed to see it, and only
one day a year during Ramadan.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.650 align:middle line:84%
No one else could
approach that chest.

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:44.750 align:middle line:84%
They could see the other stuff,
but they couldn't see this.

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:51.140 align:middle line:84%
And I just think it's really
conspicuous, especially when--

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.840 align:middle line:84%
so you have the chest
they took out into battle.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.230 align:middle line:84%
In the other room
you have the staff

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:59.360 align:middle line:84%
of Aaron, which
was in this chest,

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.860 align:middle line:90%
in the Ark of the Covenant.

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:05.600 align:middle line:90%
You have Abraham's bowl, pot.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:11.180 align:middle line:84%
But what if that was just a
renaming of the pot of manna

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:13.010 align:middle line:84%
that was in the Ark
of the Covenant?

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And you have loads of
tablets in this museum

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:19.070 align:middle line:84%
just like the alleged
Ten Commandments.

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>> So what you're
suggesting here--

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Josh, are you putting
this together?

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.380 align:middle line:84%
Are you suggesting that
that chest is possibly

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:29.930 align:middle line:84%
the Ark of the Covenant
that had everything in it

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:34.970 align:middle line:84%
and that was brought to Turkey
by the Knights Templar who

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:36.890 align:middle line:90%
would have brought it to Turkey?

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:38.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, great question.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:44.810 align:middle line:84%
So I call this journey
to Constantinople the ark

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:48.290 align:middle line:84%
on the run because literally,
you have the temple built

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:49.700 align:middle line:90%
in 1000 BC, right?

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And then the Egyptians come,
and they take it to Tanis,

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:54.450 align:middle line:84%
and we see that
scene in "Indiana

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:56.550 align:middle line:90%
Jones and the Temple of Doom."

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:59.970 align:middle line:84%
But then in 586, the
Babylonians come and take it

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:01.020 align:middle line:90%
back to Babylonia.

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Or did Jeremiah take
it to Mount Nebo?

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:04.319 align:middle line:90%
No one knows.

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:06.810 align:middle line:84%
60 years later, the
second temple's built.

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:09.750 align:middle line:84%
But then for 500
years, it's pretty calm

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:14.010 align:middle line:84%
until the Romans come in 70 AD
and sack it and just totally

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:17.474 align:middle line:84%
destroy the second temple,
take the booty back to Rome,

00:17:17.474 --> 00:17:18.599 align:middle line:90%
parade it through the city.

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And on the Arch of Titus,
you can see the menorah.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.638 align:middle line:84%
You can see things
that look like the Ark,

00:17:24.638 --> 00:17:26.430 align:middle line:84%
although historians
will say, no, it's not.

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:27.869 align:middle line:90%
It's this or it's that.

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And from that point onwards,
no one cares about Jerusalem.

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:33.810 align:middle line:90%
They start to sack Rome.

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:36.480 align:middle line:84%
The Visigoths come
in in 410, and they

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:41.640 align:middle line:84%
take two days worth of sacking
back to the French Pyrenees.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is interesting
because that's

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:46.410 align:middle line:84%
where you have the
legend of Parsifal

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:49.377 align:middle line:84%
and the Sacred Chalice
and the Holy Grail.

00:17:49.377 --> 00:17:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
world's greatest grail

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:52.710 align:middle line:90%
hunter, Otto Rahn, went.

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:55.170 align:middle line:84%
This is where Dan Brown got
his story for "The DA Vinci

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:56.837 align:middle line:84%
Code," the mystery
of Rennes-Le-Chateau,

00:17:56.837 --> 00:17:58.440 align:middle line:84%
the Holy Blood and
the Holy Grail.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:03.490 align:middle line:84%
So the artifacts of Solomon go
to Rome and go to the Pyrenees.

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:04.290 align:middle line:90%
But guess what?

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:05.970 align:middle line:84%
The Visigoths were
there for two days.

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:07.840 align:middle line:84%
They barely scratched
the surface,

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.645 align:middle line:90%
and the Romans saw them coming.

00:18:09.645 --> 00:18:14.475 align:middle line:84%
50 years later, the vandals
come, hence the term vandalism.

00:18:14.475 --> 00:18:18.870 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so the vandals take the
treasure back to North Africa,

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:19.950 align:middle line:90%
to Carthage.

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And Rome knows
what they've lost,

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:24.210 align:middle line:84%
so they get in their
ships and chase them,

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:26.080 align:middle line:90%
but they can't catch them.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.930 align:middle line:84%
So you have the
treasure of Solomon.

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:31.300 align:middle line:84%
They were there for two weeks,
and Rome never saw it coming.

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:34.650 align:middle line:84%
So they really took
all there was to take.

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:37.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, fast forward
a couple of years.

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:41.310 align:middle line:84%
The Hagia Sophia has burned to
the ground in the Nika riots.

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:45.135 align:middle line:90%
You have Justinian, the emperor.

00:18:45.135 --> 00:18:48.480 align:middle line:84%
He hears that the
vandals have assassinated

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.160 align:middle line:90%
their Catholic king.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:54.180 align:middle line:84%
He's not pleased about that,
so he sends his general

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.650 align:middle line:90%
to go sort it out.

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:59.550 align:middle line:84%
The general goes
there and comes back

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:02.610 align:middle line:84%
with the treasures
of Solomon, which

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:08.220 align:middle line:84%
are inventoried by a historian
who says, OK, you've got it.

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.210 align:middle line:84%
Now what are you
going to do with it?

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:14.790 align:middle line:84%
And he makes this ambiguous
comment about, well, of course,

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:17.060 align:middle line:84%
I'll return it to
whence it came.

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:21.920 align:middle line:84%
But he's about to open the
greatest temple on the planet,

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.750 align:middle line:90%
the Hagia Sophia.

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And when it is opened-- they
wouldn't let him near it

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:30.920 align:middle line:84%
for the months leading up to
the final opening ceremony,

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:31.800 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And Justinian goes in,
and what does he say?

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And he says, Solomon,
I have outdone thee.

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:40.120 align:middle line:90%
Of course, he has.

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:44.240 align:middle line:84%
He has effectively the third
temple, the greatest temple

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.910 align:middle line:90%
on the planet, and the Ark.

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:51.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, when we look at
the time in a linear sense,

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:56.870 align:middle line:84%
the timing of all of this,
when the Templars arrive

00:19:56.870 --> 00:20:01.550 align:middle line:84%
in Jerusalem, are they
recovering and looking

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:02.960 align:middle line:90%
at duplicates?

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.570 align:middle line:84%
Are they looking at
the actual artifacts?

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:09.860 align:middle line:84%
Are they looking at Ark of
the Covenant version 1 Moses?

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:11.600 align:middle line:90%
Are they looking at a duplicate?

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.330 align:middle line:84%
And that includes--
because everybody wanted

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:15.980 align:middle line:90%
these biblical artifacts.

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:20.545 align:middle line:84%
Everybody wanted the True Cross
or the Ark or the Holy Grail,

00:20:20.545 --> 00:20:23.020 align:middle line:84%
and there's different
versions of everything.

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:27.420 align:middle line:84%
So what was it that
the Knights Templar--

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:29.080 align:middle line:90%
were they seeing the real thing?

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:32.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, great question
because everybody said, OK,

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:33.360 align:middle line:90%
second temple has been sacked.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.290 align:middle line:90%
Rome took it.

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:35.610 align:middle line:90%
We'll leave Jerusalem alone.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:36.660 align:middle line:90%
They don't have anything.

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the Knights
Templar begged to differ.

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And they rock up there, and they
find what they're looking for.

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:44.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, nobody knows
what they found.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And if they tell
you, question it,

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:51.480 align:middle line:84%
because what I surmise is they
may have found or have been

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:55.080 align:middle line:84%
given something like the
Copper Scroll that let them

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.510 align:middle line:90%
know what was buried where.

00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And it probably wasn't just the
temple and the Holy of Holies.

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:04.350 align:middle line:84%
It could have been other
sites around the Holy Land.

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:10.350 align:middle line:84%
Our research shows that when
they were founded roughly 1119

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:13.950 align:middle line:84%
in Jerusalem over the
old Holy of Holies,

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:15.840 align:middle line:90%
they didn't waste any time.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:20.290 align:middle line:84%
They took the mother lode
to the South of France,

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:23.920 align:middle line:84%
and they took it to a
place near the meridian.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And the meridians
become really curious

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:30.130 align:middle line:84%
because back then, there wasn't
a meridian, not in France.

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:34.120 align:middle line:84%
So why are these
locations so important?

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.850 align:middle line:84%
Our research shows that
the mother lode was there

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:40.720 align:middle line:84%
near the meridian
for about 80 years.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting is
the Knights Templar just

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:47.670 align:middle line:84%
didn't mess around in
Europe, in the Middle East.

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:49.080 align:middle line:90%
They went all over the world.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Iceland to Russia, South
America, South Africa.

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:53.160 align:middle line:90%
They were everywhere.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:56.490 align:middle line:84%
So they have all these
relics, but not just relics.

00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:57.660 align:middle line:90%
They have information.

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:02.375 align:middle line:84%
Papyrus, books,
knowledge, devices.

00:22:02.375 --> 00:22:04.100 align:middle line:84%
That's all, according
to our research

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.170 align:middle line:90%
now in the South of France.

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:09.300 align:middle line:84%
They move it up to Le
Havre after 80 years.

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.220 align:middle line:90%
So it's in the North of France.

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:15.440 align:middle line:84%
Two boats to Nova Scotia,
three boats to England.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.860 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, let's stop right there.

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:24.960 align:middle line:84%
We have a collection of
relics in Rome at 580, right?

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And with the rebuilding
of temples and the last

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:29.760 align:middle line:90%
of the Caesars, and so forth.

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:30.940 align:middle line:90%
That's going on.

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:37.440 align:middle line:84%
We have Helen and stuff
going up to Turkey.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:42.840 align:middle line:84%
We have the Knights Templar
coming in at 1100 AD, all

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:45.840 align:middle line:90%
looking for the same relics.

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.570 align:middle line:90%
Who's got the real stuff?

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:52.650 align:middle line:84%
Was it the Knights
Templar that ultimately

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:56.070 align:middle line:84%
got into those tunnels
and underneath the temple

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:57.690 align:middle line:90%
and retrieved the real stuff?

00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the case,
what's sitting in Rome,

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:03.180 align:middle line:84%
and what's sitting
up in Constantinople?

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:04.380 align:middle line:90%
You know, modern Turkey.

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:05.908 align:middle line:90%
I mean, great question.

00:23:05.908 --> 00:23:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And what mystifies me is
that the historians account

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:12.420 align:middle line:84%
for the Ark last being
seen in Constantinople.

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:13.840 align:middle line:90%
Nobody talks about that.

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.510 align:middle line:90%
It's like the 600-pound gorilla.

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:19.750 align:middle line:84%
What I find fascinating
is fast forward to 1453.

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:23.740 align:middle line:10%
Mehmed the Conqueror is trying
to do what no Ottoman's ever--

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:27.250 align:middle line:10%
no anyone's ever done before
is conquer Constantinople.

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:28.810 align:middle line:84%
All his armies
have been defeated.

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:32.080 align:middle line:84%
He has one army left and
he's ready to roll the dice.

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:36.250 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden, out of
the top of the Hagia Sophia

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:38.560 align:middle line:10%
are these lights
going up into the sky.

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:39.430 align:middle line:10%
Massive lights.

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:42.070 align:middle line:10%
Firsthand accounts
from various people--

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:44.110 align:middle line:10%
>> It's been depicted
historically.

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:46.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Been depicted historically.

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:48.220 align:middle line:84%
Television programs,
you can see this.

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:51.640 align:middle line:90%
And Mehmed went, holy cow.

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:55.840 align:middle line:84%
I can't-- Allah is on
their side, clearly.

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:58.150 align:middle line:10%
Well, after three or
four days of this light

00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:01.270 align:middle line:10%
going up from the top of the
Hagia Sophia into the sky--

00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:03.700 align:middle line:10%
and by the way, the
Hagia Sophia now

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:08.500 align:middle line:10%
has four cherubim,
four angels with wings

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:12.130 align:middle line:10%
on the top of the inside,
just like the Ark.

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:15.610 align:middle line:84%
But these lights move out
of the city and disappear.

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:17.290 align:middle line:90%
And Mehmed says, mm.

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:18.770 align:middle line:90%
Allah has forsaken them.

00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:19.630 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:21.790 align:middle line:90%
And he conquers Constantinople.

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:23.470 align:middle line:90%
But that tells me--

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:25.390 align:middle line:84%
and no one's put two
and two together.

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:27.100 align:middle line:84%
It's not rocket
science, I don't think.

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.690 align:middle line:84%
What if they were
trying to activate

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:30.210 align:middle line:90%
the Ark after 1,000 years?

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Didn't know how to do
it, but they managed

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.790 align:middle line:90%
to activate some element.

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:35.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Maybe it activated itself.

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:36.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:37.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:38.550 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:40.990 align:middle line:90%
Now, OK.

00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Again, if some of this
went to North America,

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:49.690 align:middle line:84%
some of it to Scotland,
and some of it

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:53.800 align:middle line:84%
is in the South of France,
where is this today,

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.610 align:middle line:84%
and what evidence do we have
that these holy relics did

00:24:57.610 --> 00:25:01.900 align:middle line:84%
actually make it out of
Jerusalem and are in--

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:05.890 align:middle line:84%
and wouldn't state actors be
involved with protecting this

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:07.210 align:middle line:90%
with machine guns?

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:08.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:10.630 align:middle line:84%
Again, great question
because I don't

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:13.990 align:middle line:84%
think there's anything
from the Temple of Solomon

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.980 align:middle line:90%
left in Jerusalem.

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:16.810 align:middle line:90%
Nothing substantial.

00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:17.860 align:middle line:90%
Nor in Rome.

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:19.360 align:middle line:90%
Maybe a few things.

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:22.982 align:middle line:84%
Constantinople has always
been the place where

00:25:22.982 --> 00:25:24.190 align:middle line:90%
these relics would have been.

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:27.280 align:middle line:84%
In 330, Constantine created
this incredible pillar

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.370 align:middle line:84%
that had not the True Cross,
but the two chaps that

00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:31.640 align:middle line:90%
were crucified with Christ.

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:35.800 align:middle line:84%
It had the baskets from the
loaves and the fish miracle.

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.510 align:middle line:90%
It had jars of Mary Magdalene.

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:41.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's always been the place
where sacred relics were taken.

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:44.440 align:middle line:84%
But the Knights Templar
are in possession

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:48.190 align:middle line:84%
of the lion's
share of the relics

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:53.230 align:middle line:84%
and the bodies of
the patriarchs.

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And our research shows the two
ships that went to Nova Scotia,

00:25:57.490 --> 00:25:59.830 align:middle line:84%
they've got some
goodies on them,

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:01.810 align:middle line:84%
but you're not going
to risk that ocean

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:03.970 align:middle line:90%
voyage with the big stuff.

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:05.500 align:middle line:90%
That's going to England.

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to go
overland-- guess what--

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.282 align:middle line:84%
to the prime
meridian once again.

00:26:11.282 --> 00:26:12.490 align:middle line:90%
Something about the meridian.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:13.300 align:middle line:90%
I can't answer it.

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.010 align:middle line:84%
But I just look and
see where it was

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:17.290 align:middle line:84%
in France, where the
lion's share of it

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:19.690 align:middle line:84%
is today in England
where I'm excavating it

00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:23.920 align:middle line:84%
with my team, my
colleagues and I.

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting that
that's where they place it.

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:29.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, OK.

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:30.890 align:middle line:90%
The big question.

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:33.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's two
big questions here.

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:35.735 align:middle line:84%
I'll let you ask the
biggest one, Josh.

00:26:35.735 --> 00:26:38.465 align:middle line:84%
But what's coming
out of the ground?

00:26:38.465 --> 00:26:40.010 align:middle line:90%
What is being excavated?

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:41.390 align:middle line:90%
What everybody wants.

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:42.950 align:middle line:90%
It's about the evidence.

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:44.480 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what you've got.

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.270 align:middle line:84%
What are you-- what are you
getting out of the ground?

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:49.012 align:middle line:90%
>> My colleague has a technique.

00:26:49.012 --> 00:26:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
sound silly, and people

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:53.750 align:middle line:84%
are going to think, oh,
it's a bit woo-woo for me,

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:58.190 align:middle line:84%
but a technique of finding where
these underground chambers are.

00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:02.610 align:middle line:84%
My job is to validate that with
state-of-the-art technology.

00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:06.650 align:middle line:84%
So I have used literally
SpaceX satellites,

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:10.040 align:middle line:84%
which are the world's most
powerful tools for identifying

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:13.110 align:middle line:84%
deep underground military
bases, et cetera.

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:16.070 align:middle line:84%
I've used the latest
GPRS technology.

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:19.670 align:middle line:84%
I've used dowsers that
Exxon employs to find oil.

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:22.310 align:middle line:84%
I've used remote viewers,
psychics, and mediums.

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:26.050 align:middle line:84%
I've thrown the
kitchen sink at it.

00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And I must say, it's important
to note for the viewers

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:32.640 align:middle line:84%
and authorities in particular
that we're absolutely

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:36.450 align:middle line:84%
proceeding in accordance
with the 1996 Treasure Act.

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:38.190 align:middle line:84%
We're under contract
with homeowners.

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:39.450 align:middle line:90%
Everything is above board.

00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:41.700 align:middle line:84%
Councils are made aware
of what we're doing.

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:44.160 align:middle line:84%
But here is the
interesting thing.

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:48.450 align:middle line:84%
We have found some things at 10
meters that shouldn't be there.

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:51.510 align:middle line:84%
The viewers will forgive
me for not being explicit.

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:55.140 align:middle line:84%
But what I will say-- and if
this wasn't happening to me,

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:57.450 align:middle line:90%
I would think it's rubbish.

00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:01.020 align:middle line:90%
But these sites are protected.

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:03.280 align:middle line:90%
>> By who?

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Magically, spiritually.

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:05.560 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:07.615 align:middle line:90%
I'm all about the woo.

00:28:07.615 --> 00:28:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And so you're saying
30 feet, right?

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:11.020 align:middle line:90%
10 meters?

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:12.700 align:middle line:90%
30 feet?

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:16.240 align:middle line:90%
Give me an idea of size and age.

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:24.360 align:middle line:84%
>> The chambers appear to be
around eight to 10 meters deep.

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:28.890 align:middle line:90%
And the age is around--

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:30.420 align:middle line:84%
at the time of the
Knights Templar.

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:34.620 align:middle line:90%
So in the early 13th century.

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about
them being protected--

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:42.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Is this like the
pharaoh's curse?

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, [SIGH] I don't think
it's the pharaoh's curse,

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:51.240 align:middle line:84%
but the question I
ask is, 10 meters.

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:55.920 align:middle line:84%
That's more deep than
any house or skyscraper

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:57.120 align:middle line:90%
is going to expose.

00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:59.190 align:middle line:84%
So when you're the
Knights Templar,

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:00.990 align:middle line:90%
it's 11th, 12th, 13th century.

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:03.540 align:middle line:84%
You have the greatest relics
and most valuable possessions

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:04.470 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:05.310 align:middle line:90%
Cash them in.

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:06.150 align:middle line:90%
Have a good life.

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:07.140 align:middle line:90%
Build some castles.

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:07.950 align:middle line:90%
Kick back.

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:08.760 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:09.630 align:middle line:90%
They hide them.

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And they hide them so
deep and so obscure

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:17.030 align:middle line:84%
that they're not meant to be
found for a very long time.

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:19.660 align:middle line:84%
They just didn't put them
in the ground for 100 years

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:22.645 align:middle line:84%
until things smoothed
over with Philip the Fair.

00:29:22.645 --> 00:29:24.895 align:middle line:84%
They've put them in
there for the long term.

00:29:24.895 --> 00:29:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And why is a question
that I continue to ask.

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:35.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Did the transport of stuff to
Nova Scotia, did it stop there?

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:37.720 align:middle line:84%
Did it go further
into North America?

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:38.890 align:middle line:90%
Did it go inland?

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Or did it just find its way
on one of the islands there,

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:45.250 align:middle line:90%
so to speak?

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:47.830 align:middle line:84%
>> First of all, the brains
of the operation that I'm part

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:54.700 align:middle line:84%
of is Klaus Dona, and his work
is what I support and work hand

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:56.080 align:middle line:90%
in glove with.

00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:01.390 align:middle line:84%
In terms of Nova Scotia, they
should look on the mainland.

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And you think about
the fact that you

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:06.850 align:middle line:84%
don't want to sink a ship
with all the biggies in it.

00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:07.900 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:10.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So the ships that
went to Nova Scotia,

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:13.300 align:middle line:84%
they've got some goodies, but
they also have some bodies.

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:17.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, think Solomon,
Bathsheba, Aaron, David.

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.590 align:middle line:90%
We never found those tombs.

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:21.890 align:middle line:90%
They must have massive tombs.

00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:24.057 align:middle line:84%
If they were in Jerusalem,
we would have found them.

00:30:24.057 --> 00:30:28.660 align:middle line:84%
They would have had very amazing
places of memorial, but no.

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:30.430 align:middle line:90%
So they've gone.

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:31.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you think--

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:35.500 align:middle line:84%
and it's the big-- the
million dollar question,

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:38.020 align:middle line:84%
but do you think that the
Indigenous cultures of North

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:44.530 align:middle line:84%
America would have welcomed
ships and things like this

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:50.300 align:middle line:84%
to be brought onto the mainland
and that they would have

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:53.350 align:middle line:90%
a history of where these--

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:56.050 align:middle line:84%
not only locations of
this, but the relationship

00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:57.200 align:middle line:90%
that was built?

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the era--
again, we're talking

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:05.050 align:middle line:90%
sort of early 13th century.

00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:07.000 align:middle line:84%
So you think about who
the Native Americans

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:07.990 align:middle line:90%
were at that time.

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:08.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:09.060 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:12.550 align:middle line:10%
>> I don't know how you could
not have entrusted them.

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:14.830 align:middle line:90%
So it's a very good question.

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:18.070 align:middle line:84%
But they buried them with
a high degree of confidence

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:22.918 align:middle line:84%
that you're not going to have
pirates digging them back up.

00:31:22.918 --> 00:31:25.210 align:middle line:84%
The example I like to use--
and I've done a lot of work

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:27.100 align:middle line:84%
on Yamashita's gold
in the Philippines.

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:30.910 align:middle line:84%
Yamashita sacked-- not
Yamashita-- the Japanese sacked

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:33.790 align:middle line:84%
12 Asian countries
for 100 years.

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:36.730 align:middle line:84%
Every museum piece, every
gold bar, private collections.

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And that was going to fuel their
country for hundreds of years

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:41.360 align:middle line:84%
to come, but didn't
work out that way.

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:44.050 align:middle line:84%
So the end of World War II, they
bury them in the Philippines.

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And we know that these
amazing artifacts were buried,

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:52.815 align:middle line:84%
and historically were told the
Shinto priest would go down

00:31:52.815 --> 00:31:54.940 align:middle line:84%
into the chambers-- and
I've been there, 15 meters,

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:56.170 align:middle line:90%
straight down--

00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:59.180 align:middle line:84%
and perform rituals to
make sure that what's down

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:00.920 align:middle line:90%
there won't be seen.

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:01.910 align:middle line:90%
It'll be forgotten.

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:03.830 align:middle line:84%
It'll never be
found, and certainly

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:06.290 align:middle line:90%
not by someone who's not worthy.

00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And I've been to these villages,
and I've spoken to the locals.

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And they see these ghost dancers
of Japanese soldiers going

00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:17.780 align:middle line:84%
up and down the street
by the tombs where

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:19.985 align:middle line:90%
all these treasures are buried.

00:32:19.985 --> 00:32:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's in modern times that
rituals are being performed

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:28.250 align:middle line:90%
to make the treasure invisible.

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, when it comes
to the Knights Templar--

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:36.620 align:middle line:84%
and we think of historically
it is the Red Cross

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:38.450 align:middle line:90%
and the shining armor.

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, that really
wasn't the case.

00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:41.550 align:middle line:90%
These guys were rough.

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:42.510 align:middle line:90%
They were tough.

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:43.340 align:middle line:90%
They were smart.

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:44.780 align:middle line:90%
They were businessmen.

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:46.160 align:middle line:90%
They knew a lot.

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:50.825 align:middle line:84%
The modern-day version
of the Knights Templar,

00:32:50.825 --> 00:32:52.880 align:middle line:84%
are they covering
up the-- do they

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:55.500 align:middle line:90%
know where these locations are?

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:58.670 align:middle line:90%
Do they know the secret history?

00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Or is this a tradition that has
constantly been handed down?

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:03.480 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't think it has.

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:06.140 align:middle line:84%
I think it's been
completely lost.

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:09.680 align:middle line:84%
One of the places that
we're excavating now, I do

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.620 align:middle line:84%
believe people are aware
of what's down there.

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:15.270 align:middle line:90%


00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:19.800 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole village and
in one particular location.

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.800 align:middle line:84%
So some of these
locations are known.

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:26.210 align:middle line:84%
Some have just been
completely lost through time.

00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And in this world,
you need a combination

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:33.545 align:middle line:84%
of old school and new school
technology to find them.

00:33:33.545 --> 00:33:34.670 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you think, Josh?

00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I do have one
big, burning question here.

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:39.650 align:middle line:84%
There's been a lot of intrigue,
a lot of locations mentioned.

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:42.110 align:middle line:84%
But where do you think
the actual real--

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:45.858 align:middle line:84%
not a replica of the Ark of
the Covenant resides today?

00:33:45.858 --> 00:33:46.900 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a great question.

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:48.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was
last seen in 1453,

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.100 align:middle line:84%
as far as I was
concerned, and it

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:54.022 align:middle line:84%
was in the vicinity
of Constantinople.

00:33:54.022 --> 00:33:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Can I tell you a really
quick story about that?

00:33:55.980 --> 00:34:00.360 align:middle line:84%
Because just 10 years ago, three
Turkish men went and found--

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:04.380 align:middle line:84%
and I have a home in Istanbul,
so I spent a lot of time

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:07.170 align:middle line:84%
there looking at these sites
and investigating firsthand.

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:09.810 align:middle line:84%
They found an
underground tunnel system

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:13.080 align:middle line:84%
that is near the Hagia
Sophia, in the old town,

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:13.989 align:middle line:90%
in Sultanahmet.

00:34:13.989 --> 00:34:15.989 align:middle line:84%
And they have a big
generator, and they're going

00:34:15.989 --> 00:34:19.870 align:middle line:84%
and they're researching and
trying to find these relics.

00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And all of the sudden,
they run out of kerosene.

00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:25.350 align:middle line:84%
So the one chap says, I'll
go back, and you wait here,

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:28.110 align:middle line:84%
and I'll get some more
kerosene for our lamp.

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:29.190 align:middle line:90%
He comes back.

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:33.659 align:middle line:84%
The other two guys are dead,
and just brutally murdered.

00:34:33.659 --> 00:34:35.699 align:middle line:84%
I mean, dismembered,
the one chap.

00:34:35.699 --> 00:34:38.759 align:middle line:84%
So he goes and reports it to the
police, and they're like, ha.

00:34:38.759 --> 00:34:40.409 align:middle line:90%
You murdered them.

00:34:40.409 --> 00:34:42.210 align:middle line:90%
So they put him in jail.

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:44.850 align:middle line:84%
But fortunately, the
one chap recovers.

00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:45.730 align:middle line:90%
He lives.

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:46.870 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, wh--

00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:48.100 align:middle line:90%
you've arrested my friend.

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:50.100 align:middle line:90%
He didn't do it.

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:51.630 align:middle line:90%
They were giants.

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:53.100 align:middle line:90%
They were huge.

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:54.270 align:middle line:90%
And they weren't human.

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not even sure
if they were real,

00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:58.470 align:middle line:84%
but they just beat the
daylights out of us.

00:34:58.470 --> 00:35:01.200 align:middle line:90%
They were guarding something.

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:02.955 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:35:02.955 --> 00:35:04.380 align:middle line:90%
First off, thank you, Andrew.

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:05.910 align:middle line:90%
What a great conversation today.

00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And keep the-- the
work needs to be done.

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:14.760 align:middle line:84%
But can we expect-- the
world wants to see something,

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:18.210 align:middle line:84%
you know, whether it is the
True Cross or the Holy Grail

00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:21.960 align:middle line:84%
or the staff of Moses, or of
course the Ark of the Covenant,

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:25.680 align:middle line:84%
are we going to
finally see something?

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:28.590 align:middle line:90%
>> I really hope so.

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:30.330 align:middle line:84%
I believe we have
found something.

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:33.000 align:middle line:84%
The heat dissipation
from the SpaceX satellite

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.550 align:middle line:84%
show precious metals
at regular intervals

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:36.720 align:middle line:90%
and tunnels and chambers.

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.070 align:middle line:90%
That's physical proof.

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, the question that
I have is twofold.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:43.830 align:middle line:84%
One, not anyone's going to
be allowed to extract it.

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:46.530 align:middle line:90%
So one, are you worthy?

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:48.270 align:middle line:84%
Are you in it for
the money, or do you

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:50.580 align:middle line:90%
want to have the truth revealed?

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:54.310 align:middle line:90%
Two, is the time right?

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:58.030 align:middle line:84%
I believe these things were
buried because our overlords

00:35:58.030 --> 00:36:00.280 align:middle line:90%
aren't very nice people.

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And the day when these
overlords are gone,

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:06.980 align:middle line:84%
this information can come out
and we can all benefit from it.

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that
time is very soon.

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:11.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Truly amazing work.

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.400 align:middle line:90%
What a fascinating conversation.

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:14.530 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Andrew.

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:16.720 align:middle line:90%
And seriously, keep up the work.

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And when the big reveal
happens, do it here

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:20.570 align:middle line:90%
on "Into the Vortex."

00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:21.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:36:21.370 --> 00:36:21.820 align:middle line:90%
Will do.

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:22.750 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me, Jimmy.

00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:23.440 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, Josh.

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:24.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:24.910 align:middle line:90%
>> And there you go.

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:26.680 align:middle line:90%
"Into the Vortex."

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:28.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Jimmy Church.
