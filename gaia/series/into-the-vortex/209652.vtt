>> I'm radio and television
host Jimmy Church.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.079 align:middle line:84%
And I'm here to uncover
the truth about some

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.150 align:middle line:90%
of life's biggest mysteries.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.690 align:middle line:84%
If this is revealed,
everything has to be rewritten.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.570 align:middle line:84%
My guest today is Micah
Hanks, editor-in-chief

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.870 align:middle line:84%
of "The Debrief," where he
covers science, technology,

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:28.920 align:middle line:90%
and futurism.

thing I want to do is drop down

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.900 align:middle line:84%
on the White House
lawn and say hi.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Technical assistant, Josh.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.080 align:middle line:90%
Josh, can you pull up the map?

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.260 align:middle line:10%
>> Also joins us to
help set the scenes.

Join us as we deep-dive to
get to the bottom of some

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.680 align:middle line:84%
of the most intriguing
questions of our time.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.580 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, guys.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.090 align:middle line:90%
We're not alone.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.310 align:middle line:90%
So what do we do now?

00:00:51.310 --> 00:01:04.480 align:middle line:90%


00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.815 align:middle line:90%

I'm your host Jimmy Church.

And today Micah Hanks is
with us, editor-in-chief over

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:11.620 align:middle line:90%
at "The Debrief."

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be
talking about UAPs.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.250 align:middle line:90%
Used to be UFOs.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.210 align:middle line:84%
Today it's UAPs in
the rest of the world.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And, Josh, are you
used to UAP yet?

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>> I resisted for a while, but
I've come around, and now I am.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.390 align:middle line:84%
If you can't tell from this hat,
I'm really into your research,

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.570 align:middle line:90%
sir.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.153 align:middle line:10%
And I'm excited for
this conversation.

00:01:30.153 --> 00:01:33.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, it's a good way to
remind yourself UAP and not

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:34.690 align:middle line:10%
UFO.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.740 align:middle line:90%
But that's where we are today.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.220 align:middle line:90%
And, Micah, welcome.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.720 align:middle line:84%
Here's the deal with "The
Debrief" and its importance

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.930 align:middle line:84%
to not only the community,
but people reference over

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:48.730 align:middle line:90%
at "The Debrief."

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.850 align:middle line:84%
You guys are quoted
and used a lot today.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.000 align:middle line:84%
Are you careful
about how you select

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.740 align:middle line:84%
what you guys write about
because of its importance?

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:58.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, certainly.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've got to always
think of yourself almost

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.290 align:middle line:84%
like a steward because
looking at the possibilities,

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Unidentified Aerial Phenomena,
the artists formerly known

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.100 align:middle line:84%
as UFOs, to me, could be one of
the most important topics we'll

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.730 align:middle line:84%
ever face as team
civilization, whether or not

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.400 align:middle line:84%
they're necessarily
extraterrestrial technology.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.210 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, for me,
I look at it like,

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.120 align:middle line:84%
OK, this isn't
about what I write.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.360 align:middle line:84%
This isn't about what the
big names are talking about.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.100 align:middle line:84%
We have to look at
this in terms of what

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.370 align:middle line:90%
it means to all of humanity.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And so when you report on it
at a site like "The Debrief,"

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.120 align:middle line:84%
we've got to think about what
are the credible sources, what

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.940 align:middle line:84%
are the major developments,
what is the importance

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.090 align:middle line:84%
culturally in terms of
politics and government,

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.650 align:middle line:90%
science, all those things.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:42.860 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, I mean, it's huge.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And as far as what you
call it, hey, listen,

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.020 align:middle line:84%
they've been known for
a long time as UFOs.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm still cool with that.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.880 align:middle line:84%
But I think that, especially
the military going with UAP,

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.250 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to kind of
lift those old stigmas.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.383 align:middle line:84%
Either or work for me
as long as we're all

00:02:56.383 --> 00:02:59.050 align:middle line:84%
talking about the same thing and
trying to move forward with it.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, back in
May of this year,

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.970 align:middle line:84%
we had a hearing at
House of Representatives.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.470 align:middle line:84%
It was very important
that even the House

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.740 align:middle line:90%
tried to continue with UFOs.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.010 align:middle line:84%
They called it themselves,
in social media,

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.560 align:middle line:90%
"The UFO Hearing."

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.560 align:middle line:84%
The two witnesses that were
brought forward would say UAP.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.560 align:middle line:84%
What effect does this
have on the public?

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.450 align:middle line:90%
Do they want to hear UAP?

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Or are we still calling
these things UFOs?

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.690 align:middle line:84%
>> I think some people want
to hear them called UAP.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.740 align:middle line:90%
I mean, again, it's confusing.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And when you're seeing
people in the media, even

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.500 align:middle line:84%
people in government
who still say UFOs,

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.050 align:middle line:84%
we won't get lost in
the woods talking about

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.940 align:middle line:84%
whether these objects
are really flying

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.180 align:middle line:84%
in the traditional sense
of aircraft that we know

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.040 align:middle line:84%
and the kinds of
technologies that we

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.240 align:middle line:90%
have built here on Earth.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.910 align:middle line:84%
Especially with the introduction
of terms like transmedium,

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.202 align:middle line:84%
it seems like we're looking
at technologies that can do

00:03:57.202 --> 00:03:58.630 align:middle line:90%
a whole lot more than just fly.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.090 align:middle line:84%
But for my own part, again,
I think the important thing

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.280 align:middle line:84%
to never lose sight of is, there
appear to be technologies which

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.775 align:middle line:90%
are not easy to place.

00:04:07.775 --> 00:04:09.400 align:middle line:84%
We shouldn't leave
with the presumption

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.358 align:middle line:84%
that we know what they
are, where they're from.

00:04:11.358 --> 00:04:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And whatever terminology
is used by anybody

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.730 align:middle line:84%
who discusses this
topic, as long

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.272 align:middle line:84%
as we keep in mind
that we're talking

00:04:17.272 --> 00:04:19.930 align:middle line:84%
about a major development
in terms of humankind

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.480 align:middle line:84%
and our awareness to
perceive our environment,

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.570 align:middle line:84%
technologically and otherwise,
and that this phenomenon

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.110 align:middle line:84%
is one that is entirely worthy
of scientific attention,

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't really think it matters
that much what we call it.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's gone completely
into pop culture though.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.400 align:middle line:84%
If you look at Jordan
Peele's new film

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.670 align:middle line:84%
"Nope," there is an
actual discussion

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:48.490 align:middle line:84%
in the film about
UFOs and why it is now

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.650 align:middle line:84%
UAP and the conversation,
no, I'm staying with UFOs.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's that part of
popular culture today.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
world looks at UFOs

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.680 align:middle line:84%
as being extraterrestrial and
UAP carries another identifier

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.030 align:middle line:84%
to it that it may be
something from here.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, somewhat.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.913 align:middle line:10%
Again, if we go all the
way back to the early days

00:05:10.913 --> 00:05:13.750 align:middle line:10%
of Project Blue Book, the very
first director, Edward Ruppelt,

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.050 align:middle line:10%
he was the first person to use
Unidentified Flying Object.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.280 align:middle line:90%
Why did he do that?

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.130 align:middle line:84%
That, of course, was to use
a better identifier, actually

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.830 align:middle line:84%
a more ambiguous one,
than flying saucer, which

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.500 align:middle line:84%
had come before that, because
not all of these objects

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.690 align:middle line:84%
necessarily resemble
disks or saucers.

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:29.530 align:middle line:90%
Some are spheres.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.530 align:middle line:84%
Some are torpedo
or cigar-shaped.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.000 align:middle line:84%
Some are even
stranger than that.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.610 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are just amorphous
kind of blobs of light.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.910 align:middle line:84%
But in any case, Ruppelt
felt we need a better way

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.500 align:middle line:90%
to describe these objects.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.418 align:middle line:84%
And we seem to be going through
the same thing all over again.

00:05:44.418 --> 00:05:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you if
there's one thing I've

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.370 align:middle line:84%
learned about this subject, it's
that history repeats itself.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.900 align:middle line:90%
So here we are all over again.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.150 align:middle line:84%
Now borrowing from Project
Condign in the United Kingdom,

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.790 align:middle line:84%
they had preferentially used
Unidentified Aerial Phenomena.

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And the US military
following suit,

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.310 align:middle line:84%
hoping to, again,
kind of say instead

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.060 align:middle line:84%
of these ideas about
spaceships or aircraft,

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.070 align:middle line:84%
let's say phenomena
because that's

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.770 align:middle line:84%
a broader kind of a catchall
that might cover everything

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.880 align:middle line:84%
from natural phenomena, the
potential for surveillance

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.360 align:middle line:84%
platforms being used
by Russia or China

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.090 align:middle line:84%
or another nation,
maybe even non-nations.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.890 align:middle line:84%
Something along the
lines of some kind

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:26.980 align:middle line:84%
of a experimental project
being cooked up that's

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.570 align:middle line:90%
not related to a government.

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.540 align:middle line:84%
Then, of course, there are
also those other categories

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.880 align:middle line:84%
as were described in the
ODNI report from last year.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.080 align:middle line:84%
We don't know exactly
what all UAP may be

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.080 align:middle line:84%
or that they are all
necessarily the same thing.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.788 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
why the military wants

00:06:40.788 --> 00:06:41.950 align:middle line:90%
to go with that term.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.290 align:middle line:84%
But, again, it's
happened before.

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And probably a few
decades from now,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.430 align:middle line:84%
they'll have an all-new
term that they use for them.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:53.410 align:middle line:84%
>> With the hearing that
happened back in May of this

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:58.340 align:middle line:84%
year, 2022, what effect did
that have on disclosure?

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And there was so much attention
from the UFO community

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:04.870 align:middle line:84%
that this is a
breakthrough moment.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.830 align:middle line:90%
Did that actually happen?

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yes and no.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.210 align:middle line:84%
To me, disclosure is
sort of a loaded term.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:14.562 align:middle line:90%
There's some issues with that.

00:07:14.562 --> 00:07:15.520 align:middle line:90%
But I'll tell you this.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.300 align:middle line:84%
The immediate effects that
the Congressional hearing had

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.770 align:middle line:90%
were essentially this.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.760 align:middle line:84%
We had a direct interaction
between lawmakers

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:25.870 align:middle line:90%
and military officials.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:27.820 align:middle line:84%
When Scott Bray and
Ronald Moultrie appear

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.250 align:middle line:84%
and they are speaking with
Andre Carson and all the folks

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:31.810 align:middle line:84%
there from the
Intelligence Committee

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.102 align:middle line:84%
and they're talking about
this-- at least part of that,

00:07:34.102 --> 00:07:36.820 align:middle line:84%
the first hour or so is public,
and we're all able to watch it.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.560 align:middle line:84%
Then there was the
classified session.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.210 align:middle line:84%
But when they're
talking, I mean,

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:42.910 align:middle line:84%
this is probably the clearest
display that the public got

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:45.640 align:middle line:84%
that, wow, OK, our
military, they're

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.810 align:middle line:90%
looking at these phenomena.

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:50.360 align:middle line:84%
They're actively trying to
gather information about this.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And we've got
lawmakers in Washington

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.670 align:middle line:84%
that are really trying to
get to the bottom of what

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:57.320 align:middle line:84%
the military knows and how
it plans to study this.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.400 align:middle line:90%
So that's one thing.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.910 align:middle line:84%
The second big takeaway
for me was this.

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:04.420 align:middle line:84%
After those hearings,
we've seen a continuation

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.725 align:middle line:84%
of this interest from lawmakers
to try and draft legislation.

00:08:07.725 --> 00:08:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And, again, with the National
Defense Authorization

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:13.390 align:middle line:84%
Act that's passed every year,
the big defense-spending bill,

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:15.760 align:middle line:84%
we're already seeing
draft language for 2023

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.760 align:middle line:84%
that's looking at not only
protections for people

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.140 align:middle line:84%
who may have worked
in government

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:23.230 align:middle line:84%
and who actually had served
in special access programs

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.750 align:middle line:84%
and things that may have
dealt with UAP protections,

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.600 align:middle line:84%
if they come out, and if in a
reasonable sense, if it's not

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.820 align:middle line:84%
a danger to national
security for them to do so,

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.487 align:middle line:84%
if they come out and
they talk about it,

00:08:32.487 --> 00:08:35.544 align:middle line:84%
that may be something that will
be helped to be facilitated

00:08:35.544 --> 00:08:36.669 align:middle line:90%
through this bill language.

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:39.580 align:middle line:84%
But we also see
the hope that there

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.890 align:middle line:84%
will be means through
which information

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:43.340 align:middle line:90%
can be declassified.

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:46.425 align:middle line:84%
And, again, those aspects of
the phenomena that are studied

00:08:46.425 --> 00:08:47.800 align:middle line:84%
and information
gathered about it

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.560 align:middle line:84%
that does not conflict with
national security interests

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.960 align:middle line:84%
can be, at least to some
extent, conveyed to the public.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Because, again, this is
the big question everybody

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:55.520 align:middle line:90%
wants to know.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.450 align:middle line:84%
Hey, our military
has the best toys.

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:01.840 align:middle line:84%
They may not necessarily always
be actively looking for UAP.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.480 align:middle line:84%
But with the gear that
they've got, they pick it up.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.160 align:middle line:84%
They detect them almost
before anybody else.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.580 align:middle line:84%
So we want to know
what they're finding.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, the
military says, yeah,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.580 align:middle line:84%
but if we give you
all that information,

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.480 align:middle line:84%
it's going to tell our enemies
and everybody else out there

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.990 align:middle line:84%
a lot about what we have, how it
works, what we can do with it.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:21.430 align:middle line:90%
They may be able to spoof us.

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:23.980 align:middle line:84%
They may be able to operate
on the same frequencies.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.060 align:middle line:84%
They may be able to
replicate that technology.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.700 align:middle line:84%
So we can't give
you guys this stuff.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And that brings us
back to why I say

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:32.530 align:middle line:84%
disclosure is kind of tricky
because if we spend all

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:35.770 align:middle line:84%
of our time lobbying
for disclosure,

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:39.400 align:middle line:84%
I think that part of the
problem we meet is, hey,

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.027 align:middle line:84%
we are going to
have a limitation.

00:09:41.027 --> 00:09:42.610 align:middle line:84%
We're always going
to meet a wall when

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:45.520 align:middle line:84%
it comes to how much government
may be able to release

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.787 align:middle line:84%
or it will be
willing to release.

00:09:47.787 --> 00:09:49.120 align:middle line:90%
They were going to give us some.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.310 align:middle line:84%
We've already seen that
with the ODNI report.

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:53.960 align:middle line:84%
But there were also very
few specifics in that.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.610 align:middle line:84%
So, again, I say one part
of it should be disclosure.

00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:59.830 align:middle line:84%
But we've also got to
put emphasis on science.

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:02.020 align:middle line:84%
Really, to me,
Jimmy, the ball is

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.760 align:middle line:90%
in the court of the scientists.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.490 align:middle line:84%
We now know that the military
takes this seriously.

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:09.640 align:middle line:84%
Their incredibly
sophisticated capabilities

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:12.160 align:middle line:84%
with their sensory
equipment shows

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.020 align:middle line:84%
that there are
apparently phenomena

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:15.100 align:middle line:90%
that are being observed.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, the scientific
community may not always

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:20.950 align:middle line:84%
have all the best
toys and toys on par

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:23.530 align:middle line:84%
with what the military uses,
but there's nonetheless

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:24.850 align:middle line:90%
a precedent set by that.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And there are still ways
that with proper funding

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.260 align:middle line:84%
and with proper academic
approaches that I think

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.940 align:middle line:84%
the scientific
community could really

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:32.330 align:middle line:90%
make some headway with this.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:33.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad to see
people like Avi Loeb

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:36.080 align:middle line:84%
and others are actually
doing that right now.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.970 align:middle line:84%
But it's got to be a
multi-tiered approach.

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:40.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it can
all be about disclosure.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.960 align:middle line:90%
>> So we go from UFO.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.930 align:middle line:90%
We're now into the UAP world.

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And then you just
talked about legislation

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:53.680 align:middle line:84%
where now a clearer
definition has

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.860 align:middle line:84%
been written into the
legislation from UAP

00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:02.290 align:middle line:84%
to UAUP where they want
Underwater, this transmedium

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:04.450 align:middle line:90%
aspect, applied to UAP.

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:08.080 align:middle line:90%
So we now have UAUPs.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.910 align:middle line:90%
It's UAPUP.

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Is this to confuse the lens and
what we're trying to see here?

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And why do this and write
this into legislation?

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:22.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Listen, bottom line, they
need to come and consult with

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.800 align:middle line:90%
us before they pick these names.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we had the
UAP Task Force,

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.900 align:middle line:84%
and then we had the Airborne
Object Identification

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:30.520 align:middle line:84%
Management and
Synchronization Group.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:31.720 align:middle line:84%
Try saying that
three times fast.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.260 align:middle line:90%
>> That's correct.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:33.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And then they changed
it again to AARO,

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:34.730 align:middle line:90%
which is a little better.

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:35.772 align:middle line:90%
I actually like that one.

00:11:35.772 --> 00:11:40.270 align:middle line:84%
But what is it, All-domain
Anomaly Resolution Office?

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:44.010 align:middle line:84%
So now, again, the point
is what the office does.

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:46.510 align:middle line:84%
But there have been times when--
you and I have talked about

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:47.310 align:middle line:90%
this--

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:52.270 align:middle line:84%
I've wondered if the name isn't
intentionally unpronounceable

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:54.088 align:middle line:84%
so that it makes it
more difficult for us

00:11:54.088 --> 00:11:55.630 align:middle line:84%
to have these kinds
of conversations.

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:58.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, good for them, good for
us that we've got guys like you

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:00.130 align:middle line:84%
and I who do
memorize these names.

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And we contribute to
that clutter in our minds

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:03.130 align:middle line:90%
by trying to do so.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:05.080 align:middle line:84%
But, I mean, again, for me,
at the end of the day, that's

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.510 align:middle line:84%
why I don't want to get too
hung up on what the names are

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:08.760 align:middle line:90%
that we apply to these things.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's recognize the
apparent capabilities.

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:14.170 align:middle line:84%
For instance, with the ODNI
report that we saw last year--

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:15.380 align:middle line:90%
and this is really important.

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.170 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people just
glossed over this.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:18.977 align:middle line:10%
We had this report
published on the website

00:12:18.977 --> 00:12:21.310 align:middle line:10%
of the Office of the Director
of National Intelligence--

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:24.550 align:middle line:10%
Preliminary Assessment,
Unidentified Aerial Phenomena.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:28.210 align:middle line:84%
It groups UAP into
several categories.

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And it ranges from
the possibility

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.470 align:middle line:84%
of foreign
surveillance platforms

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:35.530 align:middle line:84%
to natural phenomena,
things like this.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:38.440 align:middle line:84%
But then there's
that other category.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Other bin, I
think they called it.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:42.940 align:middle line:84%
>> The bin, the other bin,
which is a catchall bin.

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.845 align:middle line:84%
But if you read what the
report's actually describing--

00:12:45.845 --> 00:12:47.470 align:middle line:84%
and this is fascinating
to me-- they're

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:50.710 align:middle line:84%
saying there are some phenomena
that have been observed.

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And they appear to possess
technological capabilities that

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:57.940 align:middle line:84%
may require advances in science
and scientific understanding

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:00.580 align:middle line:84%
on our part in order
to fully understand.

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.550 align:middle line:84%
They appear to exhibit things
like rapid acceleration,

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:04.425 align:middle line:90%
signature management.

00:13:04.425 --> 00:13:06.133 align:middle line:84%
For anyone who doesn't
know what that is,

00:13:06.133 --> 00:13:08.560 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about the ability
to electronically lessen

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.690 align:middle line:90%
your ability to be detected.

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's fascinating
that we see technologies

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.360 align:middle line:84%
that can't be
identified that seem

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.210 align:middle line:84%
to possess these capabilities
and may require a few more

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:21.580 align:middle line:84%
years of scientific
advancement ourselves

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.028 align:middle line:90%
before we can identify them.

00:13:23.028 --> 00:13:25.570 align:middle line:84%
That's what's going in the other
bin, at least some of what's

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:26.370 align:middle line:90%
going in that bin.

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:28.030 align:middle line:84%
So the report is
describing to me

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:31.270 align:middle line:84%
very anomalous phenomena, which
I think we could call vehicles.

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:33.730 align:middle line:84%
Let's emphasize
what they can do,

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.280 align:middle line:84%
what our military has
observed them doing,

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.040 align:middle line:84%
and worry a little less
about what we call them.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Going back to the hearing,
I think that from the committee

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:51.930 align:middle line:84%
members that they were trying
to keep the conversation to ET,

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:55.320 align:middle line:84%
something off planet
that is visiting here.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:59.460 align:middle line:84%
But when you looked
at the testimony

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:03.750 align:middle line:84%
that they were receiving
from Bray and Moultrie,

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:06.240 align:middle line:84%
that there was a
military aspect to this

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.810 align:middle line:84%
and they were trying to push
it back in that direction.

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:11.850 align:middle line:90%
Where do we sit with this?

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:17.640 align:middle line:84%
Is there a component here that
is ET that we need to address?

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:23.700 align:middle line:84%
Or is the military going to
focus on an adversarial spin

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:24.975 align:middle line:90%
on the UAP issue?

00:14:24.975 --> 00:14:26.350 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a really
good question.

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:28.470 align:middle line:84%
I think that, really, we have
to take into consideration

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:30.870 align:middle line:84%
the fact that when we're
talking about the United States

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.540 align:middle line:84%
military, they're
always going to want

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:37.710 align:middle line:84%
to look at what is of immediate
concern to the United States

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:40.020 align:middle line:90%
and to national security.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:44.040 align:middle line:84%
What is a greater concern
to the Pentagon right now?

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.730 align:middle line:84%
What China may be capable of,
what Russia may be capable of,

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:50.820 align:middle line:84%
or whether or not there are
extraterrestrial technologies

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:53.040 align:middle line:90%
operating in Earth's air space?

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:57.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we've got ET
technology in our atmosphere

00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:00.690 align:middle line:84%
and they don't seem to do
anything but just kind of buzz

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:02.910 align:middle line:84%
around, we see them
from time to time.

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:04.860 align:middle line:84%
They aren't firing
lasers or anything.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.960 align:middle line:84%
They aren't causing any
damage to our systems

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.320 align:middle line:90%
or our personnel.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.242 align:middle line:90%
But they're up there.

00:15:09.242 --> 00:15:10.200 align:middle line:90%
They'll hover up there.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:13.080 align:middle line:84%
You remember the pilots who
were part of the 2014, 2015

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.830 align:middle line:84%
sightings with the USS
Theodore Roosevelt. They

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:17.580 align:middle line:84%
said these objects
would just sit up there

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:18.990 align:middle line:90%
for hours and hours.

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:21.450 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I'm thinking, OK,
what kind of energy source

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:22.050 align:middle line:90%
allows that?

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:22.870 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:24.538 align:middle line:84%
But if that's all
they do, is that

00:15:24.538 --> 00:15:26.580 align:middle line:84%
going to be an immediate
concern to the military?

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:30.540 align:middle line:84%
Probably not when compared with
the modern 21st-century space

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:32.760 align:middle line:84%
race, China trying to
compete with us to get up

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.950 align:middle line:84%
into space to build
new space stations,

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:37.710 align:middle line:84%
inviting Russia, of course,
to be a part of all that,

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:39.600 align:middle line:90%
war games in the Pacific.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.340 align:middle line:84%
These are the more
immediate concerns.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.020 align:middle line:90%
Now, I don't think it isn't--

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:45.930 align:middle line:84%
or rather, I wouldn't say that
the military is not concerned

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:48.370 align:middle line:90%
about the prospect of ET.

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:49.980 align:middle line:84%
But, again, whatever
the phenomena

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:52.110 align:middle line:84%
is, without leading
with that presumption

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:54.810 align:middle line:84%
that that's what it may
represent, if it doesn't seem

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:57.390 align:middle line:84%
to show any kind of threat,
if there doesn't seem

00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:59.760 align:middle line:84%
to be any obvious
overt threat, it's

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.160 align:middle line:84%
always going to be
secondary in terms of what

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.630 align:middle line:90%
the government looks for.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:07.212 align:middle line:84%
And so what I have gleaned
from people I've spoken with,

00:16:07.212 --> 00:16:08.670 align:middle line:84%
some in-the-know--
as a journalist,

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:11.070 align:middle line:90%
we speak with a lot of sources.

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:12.840 align:middle line:10%
And I've had the
benefit of speaking

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.760 align:middle line:10%
with some who have been
directly associated

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.122 align:middle line:10%
with the efforts of
the UAP Task Force.

00:16:17.122 --> 00:16:19.080 align:middle line:84%
They've even given me
some interesting insights

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.360 align:middle line:84%
about going forward
what AARO will do

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.330 align:middle line:84%
and how some of its leadership
perceives this phenomenon.

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And it does seem to be very
much that they want to throw out

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:29.220 align:middle line:90%
all the past stuff--

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:33.030 align:middle line:84%
Blue Book and even some of the
studies from more recent years.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:35.940 align:middle line:84%
They said we want the
stuff with the best data.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.820 align:middle line:84%
We want the cases
that involve the best

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.560 align:middle line:84%
technological
signatures that we've

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.303 align:middle line:84%
gathered that we
can really study,

00:16:42.303 --> 00:16:44.220 align:middle line:84%
we can really learn from,
and that will really

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:47.160 align:middle line:84%
help us to discern what
this phenomenon might be.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.910 align:middle line:84%
We don't care at this point
about trying to hypothesize

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:51.840 align:middle line:90%
what it could be.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:54.550 align:middle line:84%
Show us the data, and
let's go from there.

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:56.670 align:middle line:84%
But in the event that
they do determine,

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:59.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, on that outside
chance, hey, we've

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.470 align:middle line:84%
got good sensory
capabilities that

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:04.230 align:middle line:84%
have discerned these things
coming from outer space

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:08.040 align:middle line:84%
into our atmosphere, clearly
coming to Earth from someplace

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.530 align:middle line:84%
else, I mean, that's
obviously going

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:13.470 align:middle line:84%
to have to-- at some point, it's
going to be a reckoning point.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:15.940 align:middle line:90%
OK, guys, we're not alone.

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:17.220 align:middle line:90%
So what do we do now?

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:19.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Shouldn't this
information be public?

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.740 align:middle line:90%
And let me clarify that.

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:23.579 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:26.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Just recently, within
the last couple of days,

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:27.960 align:middle line:84%
it was announced
by the Pentagon,

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.990 align:middle line:84%
through The Black Vault
and John Greenewald,

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:36.030 align:middle line:84%
that all UAP videos in
possession of the United States

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:40.380 align:middle line:84%
Navy are classified and
will not be made public.

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:45.420 align:middle line:84%
If something is visiting
us from interstellar space

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:48.270 align:middle line:84%
to this planet, shouldn't
that be public knowledge?

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And shouldn't we
have access to that?

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>> To your immediate question,
I would think so, yeah.

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:59.730 align:middle line:84%
But this brings us back to
that debate about disclosure.

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:02.280 align:middle line:84%
For instance, I think that
disclosure shouldn't happen.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.950 align:middle line:84%
But I try to always be
practical about this.

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:07.680 align:middle line:84%
Is it likely that
our government is

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.900 align:middle line:84%
going to tell us
everything that it knows,

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:13.260 align:middle line:84%
everything that it has learned,
everything that we, the people,

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.572 align:middle line:84%
feel like we should know
about this phenomenon?

00:18:15.572 --> 00:18:17.280 align:middle line:84%
I just don't think
that's very realistic.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.322 align:middle line:84%
And, again, you couldn't
bring up a better point.

00:18:19.322 --> 00:18:22.080 align:middle line:84%
When John got this response
to this FOIA the other day,

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.820 align:middle line:84%
what it's talking
about is-- again,

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.190 align:middle line:84%
he was appealing for all
of these government videos,

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:26.990 align:middle line:90%
any video--

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:27.810 align:middle line:90%
>> That has UAP.

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:28.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And they come back,
and they say, listen,

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.610 align:middle line:84%
if we release these
videos, it will

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:36.700 align:middle line:84%
be harmful to the national
security interest of the United

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.670 align:middle line:84%
States because of the
information that will

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:41.620 align:middle line:90%
be conveyed with those videos.

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:44.447 align:middle line:84%
The information-- the systems,
of course, how they operate,

00:18:44.447 --> 00:18:46.780 align:middle line:84%
what kind of data they collect,
and how they collect it.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Our enemies can't
have that information.

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:51.880 align:middle line:84%
But, again, fundamentally,
Jimmy, at the end of the day,

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.000 align:middle line:84%
does the public have
a right to know?

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.032 align:middle line:84%
As far as I'm concerned,
if these things

00:18:56.032 --> 00:18:57.740 align:middle line:84%
are from outer space--
and we don't know.

00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:59.920 align:middle line:84%
But if some UAP do
represent some kind

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.890 align:middle line:84%
of a technological advancement
either here from Earth

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:05.440 align:middle line:84%
or from someplace else
with exotic origins,

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.540 align:middle line:84%
we do have a right
to know about that.

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:09.230 align:middle line:90%
>> We do have a right to know.

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And it also contradicts
the ODNI report

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:18.850 align:middle line:84%
from August of last year, which
clearly stated it's not China,

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:21.850 align:middle line:84%
it's not Russia,
and it's not us.

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:24.470 align:middle line:90%
That was in the report.

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:29.170 align:middle line:10%
So if that's the case, how
can you do a blanket security

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:33.670 align:middle line:10%
classification on all UAP videos
that it's a national security

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:34.480 align:middle line:10%
risk?

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:37.090 align:middle line:84%
They're saying and speaking out
of both sides of their mouth.

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:39.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, on the one hand, of
course, what they're saying is,

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:42.280 align:middle line:84%
they want to use the
technologies that might obtain

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.470 align:middle line:90%
evidence of UAP.

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:45.670 align:middle line:90%
They want to protect that.

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want
China and Russia

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:50.810 align:middle line:84%
to see sensitive information
that those videos might

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:51.610 align:middle line:90%
contain.

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:54.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's more about protecting
that from foreign adversaries.

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:55.990 align:middle line:90%
But you're right.

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:57.940 align:middle line:10%
In the ODNI report,
they also say

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.610 align:middle line:10%
that, based on what
we have observed,

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:03.070 align:middle line:10%
there doesn't seem to be
any kind of indication

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:06.490 align:middle line:10%
that the more exotic-like
technologies, the stranger

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:09.250 align:middle line:10%
phenomena that we would
group in the UAP category,

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:11.440 align:middle line:10%
we haven't seen any
indication that this actually

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.540 align:middle line:10%
might be from Russia
or from China,

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:15.730 align:middle line:10%
that they have seen such a
significant technological

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:17.105 align:middle line:10%
advancement that
would place them

00:20:17.105 --> 00:20:20.020 align:middle line:10%
maybe decades ahead
of the United States.

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:21.530 align:middle line:84%
We haven't seen
evidence of that.

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:23.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, here's the point.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:30.220 align:middle line:10%
If we go back to 1952, 1953,
Los Alamos and Enrico Fermi

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.230 align:middle line:10%
talking with his friends
over lunch saying,

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:36.880 align:middle line:10%
OK, there must be so much life
out there in the universe.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And where is everybody
if that's the case?

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:43.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, is that what's
going on today?

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:46.060 align:middle line:84%
Do you think-- let
me ask you, Josh.

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Do you think the
everybody is here

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:52.690 align:middle line:84%
with all of these sightings
and the UAP confirmation that

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:56.230 align:middle line:84%
is going on in the
skies, is that Fermi's

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:59.140 align:middle line:84%
paradox of his paradox
that we are being visited

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.070 align:middle line:90%
and they are here?

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the evidence is
overwhelming that some sort

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.820 align:middle line:84%
of intelligent life
is visiting us.

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:06.400 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I do think that.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.460 align:middle line:84%
As for Fermi's paradox, I
would say we're past that.

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:10.630 align:middle line:90%
The evidence is here.

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:11.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:14.890 align:middle line:84%
So is Fermi's paradox
actually a paradox now

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:18.410 align:middle line:84%
in that this is confirmation
of something going on

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:19.210 align:middle line:90%
in the skies?

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And could it be that these
extraterrestrial civilizations,

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.980 align:middle line:84%
these advanced
civilizations are doing

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.180 align:middle line:90%
what they should be doing?

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:29.590 align:middle line:90%
What we are doing--

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:30.970 align:middle line:90%
we're looking at the stars.

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:32.800 align:middle line:90%
We're trying to find life.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.680 align:middle line:84%
If they're advanced and they're
out there building probes

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:38.590 align:middle line:84%
and moving across the
Milky Way that they

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.630 align:middle line:84%
found us and they're
just checking us out,

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:41.740 align:middle line:90%
what's wrong with that?

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:43.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Nothing in principle.

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:46.390 align:middle line:84%
We've got to give
props to Enrico Fermi,

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:48.130 align:middle line:84%
the guy who we can
credit for building

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:49.630 align:middle line:90%
the first nuclear reactor.

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:53.080 align:middle line:84%
His paradox was essentially
this-- mathematically,

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.390 align:middle line:84%
the universe should
be teeming with life.

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:58.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there should be life
from one corner to the next.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And yet with all the
probability that life exists,

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:04.360 align:middle line:90%
we have found no evidence of it.

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, that was, of course,
what Fermi had said.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.350 align:middle line:90%
And for him, that was a paradox.

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:13.030 align:middle line:84%
If there should be so much
life, why the great silence?

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:15.070 align:middle line:90%
Now, maybe it's a fair question.

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:18.220 align:middle line:84%
Many scientists today
tend to still operate

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:22.040 align:middle line:84%
on the presumption that, well,
Fermi was fundamentally right.

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.700 align:middle line:84%
There should be a lot
of life in the universe.

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.170 align:middle line:90%
And where is the evidence?

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:30.280 align:middle line:84%
And some astronomers,
physicists, exobiologists,

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:33.255 align:middle line:84%
and others have even gone so far
as to say maybe we are unique.

00:22:33.255 --> 00:22:34.630 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there isn't
life out there.

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:36.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, for my own part, I
think there's a lot of life

00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:37.650 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:39.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we're all
that good at detecting it.

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:42.760 align:middle line:84%
More fundamentally-- and think
about how strange this would

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:43.810 align:middle line:90%
be--

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:49.570 align:middle line:84%
if indeed UAP do represent
if not actual visitation

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:51.400 align:middle line:84%
by an advanced
civilization, what

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:56.350 align:middle line:84%
if these are autonomous probes
or drones maybe that were

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:59.678 align:middle line:84%
designed a long time ago to
be capable of self-replication

00:22:59.678 --> 00:23:01.720 align:middle line:84%
or self-improvement so
that they could come here,

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:05.440 align:middle line:84%
they could continue to operate
for a long time, self-repair

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:08.980 align:middle line:84%
themselves where necessary,
harvest mineral resources

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:12.730 align:middle line:84%
and things from nearby, if not
from Earth, from asteroids,

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:14.950 align:middle line:84%
near-Earth objects
and they were built

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:17.350 align:middle line:84%
to be able to operate
for a long time?

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:20.680 align:middle line:84%
The operators, the
creators of said technology

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:21.910 align:middle line:90%
may be long gone.

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:24.100 align:middle line:90%
The technology may persist.

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.800 align:middle line:84%
Could UAP actually
represent something

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.810 align:middle line:84%
along the lines of
Von Neumann probes?

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is a
hypothetical kind of probe

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:33.500 align:middle line:84%
that is essentially capable
of self-replication.

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:34.847 align:middle line:90%
I've often thought about that.

00:23:34.847 --> 00:23:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And there are three
really interesting kinds

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.030 align:middle line:90%
of probes worthy of discussion.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:39.613 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in addition
to the Von Neumann

00:23:39.613 --> 00:23:42.800 align:middle line:84%
replicating probes,
Bracewell probes--

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:47.000 align:middle line:84%
a probe that would be designed
for the express intent

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.595 align:middle line:90%
and purpose of communication.

00:23:48.595 --> 00:23:50.970 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, we haven't found
evidence of one of those yet.

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:51.770 align:middle line:90%
But here's a good question.

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:53.450 align:middle line:84%
Have we really gone
looking for one?

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Would we know
what to look for?

00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:57.493 align:middle line:84%
>> Would we recognize
it if we found it?

00:23:57.493 --> 00:23:58.910 align:middle line:84%
These are all
important questions.

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:00.830 align:middle line:84%
But then the third kind
of probe-- and these

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:02.780 align:middle line:90%
aren't mutually exclusive.

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:07.100 align:middle line:84%
Recently, the idea of a lurker
probe has been discussed a lot.

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:07.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Stop right there.

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:10.220 align:middle line:90%
What is a lurker probe?

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:15.270 align:middle line:84%
Before you start to tell us
about it, it's a new term.

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:16.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.460 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:18.980 align:middle line:84%
A lurker probe would essentially
work in the same way.

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:20.990 align:middle line:84%
But what we may be dealing
with is a probe that

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:22.460 align:middle line:90%
is either difficult to spot.

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:25.430 align:middle line:84%
Again, if it's needle-sized
and it's parked on a near-Earth

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:27.650 align:middle line:84%
object somewhere
out there, not going

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:29.528 align:middle line:84%
to be very easy to
detect it, especially

00:24:29.528 --> 00:24:31.070 align:middle line:84%
if we don't know to
go looking for it

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:32.990 align:middle line:84%
or haven't even
tried to find one.

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:36.200 align:middle line:84%
The other alternative-- and
this is an interesting one too--

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:39.200 align:middle line:84%
is what if a lurker
probe were designed

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.390 align:middle line:90%
to operate without being seen.

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:43.160 align:middle line:90%
Now, again, I'm a nature lover.

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:46.640 align:middle line:84%
When I go out into the forest,
I don't put on all hot pink

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.070 align:middle line:84%
and take a pair of bongos
and start beating the drum

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:50.660 align:middle line:84%
and try to call
all the animals in.

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.160 align:middle line:90%
No, what I do is, I put on my--

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.960 align:middle line:84%
>> You don't want to
attract attention.

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.070 align:middle line:90%
>> I put on camo.

00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:58.520 align:middle line:84%
I get up against or even up in
a tree, get my camera ready,

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.410 align:middle line:90%
and I'm quiet.

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:03.440 align:middle line:90%
It's using the art of stealth.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And there may be reasons,
good ones, in fact,

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:07.970 align:middle line:84%
considering our
nuclear proliferation

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:10.370 align:middle line:84%
and other problems of the
20th and 21st century.

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:12.020 align:middle line:84%
There may be very
good reasons why

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:16.070 align:middle line:84%
a hypothetical extraterrestrial
civilization would not directly

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:19.880 align:middle line:84%
want to engage with us or
to announce their presence.

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And yet, often we hear
scientists kind of--

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:25.430 align:middle line:84%
what was it Stanton
Friedman used to say?

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:27.230 align:middle line:90%
Science by proclamation?

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:29.510 align:middle line:84%
You hear these kinds of
proclamations all the time.

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:32.210 align:middle line:84%
If we were being visited,
we would know it.

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:35.090 align:middle line:84%
If an extraterrestrial
spacecraft came to Earth,

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:35.930 align:middle line:90%
we'd know it.

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if we flip that
around, if we've been observed

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:45.990 align:middle line:84%
for 1,000 years by an ETC, they
would know that we have one

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:47.970 align:middle line:90%
thing built into our DNA.

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:50.380 align:middle line:84%
We shoot first and
ask questions later.

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:51.180 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:54.370 align:middle line:84%
>> They would know us to have
that part of our character

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:55.170 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:57.130 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we would do.

00:25:57.130 --> 00:25:58.080 align:middle line:90%
We would shoot first.

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>> You look at our
warlike tendencies.

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And, again, all
of this is fairly

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:05.400 align:middle line:84%
anthropomorphic or
anthropocentric, I guess.

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.300 align:middle line:90%
We are humans.

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:07.200 align:middle line:90%
We think like humans.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.810 align:middle line:84%
We should always be careful
about projecting our ideals

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:11.760 align:middle line:90%
onto any hypothetical ETs.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.570 align:middle line:84%
But we're all we've
got to work with.

00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:16.000 align:middle line:84%
So for here and now,
let's just roll with it.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.330 align:middle line:90%
So we are warlike.

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:20.130 align:middle line:84%
We're not really
historically known

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:23.550 align:middle line:84%
for being kind to one another,
for treating each other

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:25.920 align:middle line:84%
as equals, for respecting
each other's boundaries

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:30.450 align:middle line:84%
and land and space and culture
and all of our differences.

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:33.410 align:middle line:84%
We've got our wonderful
atomic weapon.

00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:36.150 align:middle line:84%
We've got our pandemics
that have occurred.

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:40.380 align:middle line:84%
We've got all of the cultural
unrest that's occurred just

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:41.760 align:middle line:90%
in the last few years.

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:44.700 align:middle line:84%
If I were ET, the last
thing I want to do

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:46.920 align:middle line:84%
is drop down on the White
House lawn and say hi.

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:49.003 align:middle line:84%
And yet again, this is
another one of those tropes

00:26:49.003 --> 00:26:51.785 align:middle line:84%
that I hear modern scientists,
many of whom I really respect--

00:26:51.785 --> 00:26:53.160 align:middle line:84%
but they'll say
things like this.

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.680 align:middle line:84%
We would know it if an
ET spacecraft arrived.

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.330 align:middle line:84%
Why would they come
all this distance

00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:58.633 align:middle line:90%
and not introduce themselves?

00:26:58.633 --> 00:27:00.300 align:middle line:84%
Look, I can give you
all kinds of lists.

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:01.967 align:middle line:84%
We can spend all day
talking about that.

00:27:01.967 --> 00:27:05.820 align:middle line:84%
Point being, if we're
talking about a lurker probe,

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:10.290 align:middle line:84%
there are some very good
reasons why a hypothetical ET

00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:15.030 align:middle line:84%
technology might not be
designed to be easily spotted.

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:17.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, just really quickly, let's
tie that in with UAP again.

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:20.880 align:middle line:84%
If we back to the ODNI report,
one of the interesting things

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.530 align:middle line:84%
that they observed that I
mentioned earlier-- and this

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:24.197 align:middle line:84%
is why I always point
this out because I

00:27:24.197 --> 00:27:26.790 align:middle line:84%
think it's significant--
signature management.

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:30.240 align:middle line:84%
We talk about low observability
described with relation

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.740 align:middle line:90%
to certain UAP.

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm not making an explicit
connection between UAP

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:36.930 align:middle line:84%
and the idea of Von
Neumann or lurker probes.

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:39.180 align:middle line:84%
But there is a consistency
in the idea of how

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:41.400 align:middle line:84%
one hypothetically
would operate and things

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:44.640 align:middle line:84%
we observe about UAP,
which could be significant.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's one reason
I think, Jimmy,

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:51.630 align:middle line:84%
as we move toward trying to
get science applied toward UAP

00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:54.220 align:middle line:84%
and more scientists involved
in the study of them,

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:57.000 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going to be
helpful to start phrasing

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.220 align:middle line:84%
the discussion of UAP
in terms of things

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:02.280 align:middle line:84%
like Von Neumann probes, lurker
probes, Bracewell probes,

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:05.460 align:middle line:84%
the ideas of what
scientists have

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:08.620 align:middle line:84%
gone looking for through the
CETI program and what have you.

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:10.500 align:middle line:84%
But we need to extend
that to UAP too.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:13.020 align:middle line:84%
Do we start seeing
patterns that we

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:16.470 align:middle line:84%
might expect from an
intelligent civilization?

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:18.258 align:middle line:84%
Should we be looking
for certain things

00:28:18.258 --> 00:28:19.800 align:middle line:84%
out there that we
haven't looked for?

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Should we get more creative
about what we might find?

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:23.910 align:middle line:90%
Think about this.

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:27.102 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned, if the
creators of the technology

00:28:27.102 --> 00:28:28.560 align:middle line:84%
are no longer
around, we're getting

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.260 align:middle line:84%
into the realm of
extraterrestrial archeology,

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:32.580 align:middle line:90%
which fascinates me.

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:36.510 align:middle line:84%
If a probe is no longer in
service, does that mean--

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:39.600 align:middle line:84%
for instance, if it completed
its mission millions, maybe

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.678 align:middle line:84%
even billions of years
ago, but it's still

00:28:41.678 --> 00:28:44.220 align:middle line:84%
laying up there somewhere buried
in the regolith on the lunar

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:47.130 align:middle line:84%
surface, if we discover
it, we haven't just

00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:48.450 align:middle line:90%
found old alien junk.

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:52.200 align:middle line:84%
We have proven the existence of
extraterrestrial intelligence.

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.307 align:middle line:90%
Now, it may be long gone.

00:28:53.307 --> 00:28:55.140 align:middle line:84%
But we've answered the
question nonetheless.

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:56.310 align:middle line:90%
No, we're not alone.

00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:57.810 align:middle line:90%
No, we aren't the only ones.

00:28:57.810 --> 00:29:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And if life existed at least
once before, maybe a long time

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:03.990 align:middle line:84%
ago somewhere out there,
it could exist again.

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And that just, to me,
really emboldens our search.

00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:10.080 align:middle line:84%
It really kind of gives us
more reason to go out there

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.570 align:middle line:84%
and to continue looking
for other life like us.

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:16.780 align:middle line:84%
>> To that end, Josh,
pull up this picture,

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:18.900 align:middle line:90%
this image of the Tic Tac.

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And I want to get
your opinion on this.

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going to turn this
over to Micah for a second.

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:30.960 align:middle line:10%
When we look at this, Josh,
does that look offensive to you?

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.790 align:middle line:90%
Would you be scared of that?

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:34.150 align:middle line:90%
>> It depends how close I was.

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:34.950 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:36.115 align:middle line:90%
In this picture, no.

00:29:36.115 --> 00:29:38.490 align:middle line:84%
The stories of the Tic Tacs
we hear about, no, not to me.

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:40.157 align:middle line:84%
But the fighter pilots,
different story.

00:29:40.157 --> 00:29:42.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's exactly
my point here.

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:48.060 align:middle line:84%
That if you are going to have
something collect data and come

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:50.260 align:middle line:84%
here, you would do
a couple of things.

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:51.830 align:middle line:90%
One, you wouldn't be scary.

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:53.080 align:middle line:90%
That would be the first thing.

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:57.330 align:middle line:84%
The second thing is, you
would want to avoid problems.

00:29:57.330 --> 00:30:00.850 align:middle line:84%
It's a dumb AI that
is built into it.

00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:03.960 align:middle line:84%
But if you encounter
something that

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:08.760 align:middle line:84%
might be a little bit offensive,
you're going to avoid it.

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:13.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have F-18s come
on site and observe this,

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:14.520 align:middle line:90%
and what does it do?

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:16.920 align:middle line:90%
It runs away.

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:18.900 align:middle line:90%
And it's seen.

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:20.130 align:middle line:90%
It's observed.

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:24.060 align:middle line:84%
It now knows that it is
seen, and it takes off.

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:25.800 align:middle line:84%
Josh, doesn't that
make sense to you?

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:28.930 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't want to stick
around and get shot at or have

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:29.730 align:middle line:90%
issues.

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:32.288 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't you just fly
away and avoid problems?

00:30:32.288 --> 00:30:33.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I agree with you.

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:33.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:35.922 align:middle line:84%
It looks like they're actively
trying to make it easier

00:30:35.922 --> 00:30:36.990 align:middle line:90%
for us to accept them.

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:38.990 align:middle line:84%
>> So doesn't this
fit your definition?

00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:39.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, OK.

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:42.590 align:middle line:84%
So to that point, they
have an appearance

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:45.200 align:middle line:90%
that might be easily accepted.

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.730 align:middle line:84%
Maybe non-confrontational
would be another term.

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:49.940 align:middle line:90%
Maybe even easily overlooked.

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:52.070 align:middle line:84%
By the way, this is not a
photograph of a Tic Tac.

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:54.710 align:middle line:84%
This is a digital representation
that I made myself

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:57.350 align:middle line:84%
so that we would have a talking
point because, again, this

00:30:57.350 --> 00:31:00.620 align:middle line:84%
is pretty close to the
description given by Commander

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Dave Fravor and pilot
Alex Dietrich who

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:05.750 align:middle line:90%
observed this object in 2004.

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:07.883 align:middle line:84%
I know if I saw that,
probably, the first question

00:31:07.883 --> 00:31:09.800 align:middle line:84%
I would have is, is that
a balloon down there?

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.000 align:middle line:90%
What am I looking at?

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.370 align:middle line:84%
Maybe intent to confuse
even is part of it.

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:17.325 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of
its behavior, yeah,

00:31:17.325 --> 00:31:18.950 align:middle line:84%
this thing doesn't
want to stick around

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:20.240 align:middle line:90%
and say, hi, we come in peace.

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.290 align:middle line:90%
No, it's gone.

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>> There was a comment.

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:24.060 align:middle line:90%
And I want to thank you.

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:26.360 align:middle line:84%
This has been a
great conversation.

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:29.990 align:middle line:84%
But in closing, I
wanted to ask you this.

00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:37.130 align:middle line:84%
There was a comment at
the UFO House hearing.

00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:40.400 align:middle line:10%
And one of the
representatives said,

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:50.990 align:middle line:10%
we need to act on media outlets
out there that are possibly

00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:55.430 align:middle line:10%
spreading misinformation and
disinformation on this subject

00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:58.730 align:middle line:10%
and almost suggesting
criminalizing

00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:00.890 align:middle line:10%
reporting about UAPs.

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was a
direct reference at people

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:08.060 align:middle line:84%
like yourself and like the
work that I have been doing

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:11.150 align:middle line:84%
and we have been doing
that we aren't entitled

00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:15.440 align:middle line:84%
to comment on the phenomenon
and it needs to be handled

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:18.260 align:middle line:90%
through other official means.

00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:20.540 align:middle line:90%
Did you take offense to that?

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And shouldn't we have freedom of
the press and freedom of speech

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.060 align:middle line:84%
and be able to comment
on the phenomenon?

00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:28.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Look, freedom
of speech, I mean,

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:29.807 align:middle line:84%
there's simply no
question about that.

00:32:29.807 --> 00:32:30.890 align:middle line:90%
That is a must, all right?

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:34.220 align:middle line:84%
That is an integral
part of our society.

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And yes, also the role
of the fourth estate

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:41.480 align:middle line:84%
to be able to hold
officials accountable.

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:45.230 align:middle line:84%
Look, let's not forget
that it's we, the people.

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:48.030 align:middle line:84%
We pay the taxes,
which pay their bills.

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:51.830 align:middle line:84%
So for my own part, that
gets into shaky territory.

00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:54.110 align:middle line:84%
I didn't take offense at
it, to answer your question.

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:55.640 align:middle line:84%
I didn't perceive
it as necessarily

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.420 align:middle line:90%
being directed at journalists.

00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:00.410 align:middle line:84%
But I think that it
was an open statement

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:04.580 align:middle line:84%
about the possible
implementation of--

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:06.080 align:middle line:84%
this is a strong
word, but I'll use

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:10.310 align:middle line:84%
it-- penalties for someone who
would misrepresent information

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:12.200 align:middle line:84%
that might thereafter
be passed along

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.760 align:middle line:84%
to the government
in their efforts

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.190 align:middle line:84%
to try and get to the bottom
of what UAP may represent.

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:18.710 align:middle line:84%
Although I understand
that, we need

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:21.560 align:middle line:84%
to be very careful when it
comes to having discussions

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:24.200 align:middle line:84%
about who should be
able to talk about this.

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.240 align:middle line:84%
Right now we don't
know what UAP are.

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.830 align:middle line:90%
There are no UAP experts.

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:28.800 align:middle line:90%
I've got news for you.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.010 align:middle line:84%
I may know a lot
about this subject,

00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:32.695 align:middle line:90%
but we don't know what they are.

00:33:32.695 --> 00:33:34.070 align:middle line:84%
We don't know
where they're from.

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:35.737 align:middle line:84%
The military doesn't
know what they are.

00:33:35.737 --> 00:33:39.295 align:middle line:84%
If we've got a subject that
perplexes humans that much,

00:33:39.295 --> 00:33:40.670 align:middle line:84%
it's not really
right for anybody

00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:42.860 align:middle line:84%
to call themself an
expert and, therefore--

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:44.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Which includes
the government.

00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:45.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Which includes
the government.

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:48.830 align:middle line:84%
So right now, as far
as I'm concerned,

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:50.660 align:middle line:84%
it's difficult to
really say, well,

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:52.700 align:middle line:84%
who should have
more qualifications?

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:53.810 align:middle line:90%
Who has the expertise?

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:55.100 align:middle line:90%
Now, I will say this.

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:57.980 align:middle line:84%
As we're closing out here, I'm
very excited about the fact

00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:00.260 align:middle line:84%
that NASA is going
to be conducting

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:02.630 align:middle line:84%
its own independent
study because NASA has,

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:04.910 align:middle line:84%
as a government
agency, a tradition

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:07.550 align:middle line:84%
behind it of openness
and transparency.

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Thomas Zurbuchen and
others, they've said,

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:11.512 align:middle line:84%
look, this report,
once it's complete,

00:34:11.512 --> 00:34:13.429 align:middle line:84%
we're going to make it
available to the public

00:34:13.429 --> 00:34:15.620 align:middle line:84%
and let you guys
read it and decide.

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:17.210 align:middle line:90%
I hope that happens.

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And whatever they
find, I hope that this

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:22.909 align:middle line:84%
will be another stepping stone
toward a broader discussion

00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:24.080 align:middle line:90%
to be had about this.

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And rather than
talking about penalties

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:28.469 align:middle line:84%
for people who
misrepresent it, I say,

00:34:28.469 --> 00:34:31.159 align:middle line:84%
look, how can we all get
on the same page about how

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:32.181 align:middle line:90%
to best represent this?

00:34:32.181 --> 00:34:33.889 align:middle line:84%
Again, going back to
what I said earlier,

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:36.469 align:middle line:84%
this phenomenon is bigger
than all of us potentially.

00:34:36.469 --> 00:34:39.440 align:middle line:90%
We effectively are stewards.

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And one day, we may look back
and think, can you imagine back

00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:44.179 align:middle line:84%
in the day, back
when we weren't sure

00:34:44.179 --> 00:34:46.100 align:middle line:84%
what UAP were and some
people didn't even

00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:47.600 align:middle line:90%
believe they were real?

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:49.117 align:middle line:84%
That may sound
absurd, but, I mean,

00:34:49.117 --> 00:34:51.409 align:middle line:84%
guys, I mean, as recently as
a couple of centuries ago,

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:53.480 align:middle line:84%
we didn't know that
stones fell from space,

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.679 align:middle line:90%
entered Earth's atmosphere.

00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:58.640 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know that there were
potentially deadly pathogens

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:00.800 align:middle line:84%
that could be spread
invisibly in our environment.

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.150 align:middle line:84%
People didn't wash
their hands because they

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:03.188 align:middle line:90%
didn't believe that.

00:35:03.188 --> 00:35:04.730 align:middle line:84%
If we look at the
history of science,

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:08.390 align:middle line:84%
we have all the reason to be
moving forward very seriously

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:09.740 align:middle line:90%
with the UAP subject.

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:12.050 align:middle line:90%
But let's have an open dialogue.

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:13.940 align:middle line:84%
I think we, the people,
deserve that, right?

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:15.170 align:middle line:90%
>> We do.

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:16.430 align:middle line:90%
And I agree with you.

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:20.540 align:middle line:84%
NASA's administrator Bill
Nelson has been very public

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:24.980 align:middle line:84%
lately about this subject, about
ET, about life in the universe,

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:28.050 align:middle line:84%
and what may or may not
be visiting us right now,

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:29.520 align:middle line:90%
and they want to focus on that.

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:32.420 align:middle line:84%
I think he's very genuine
in his statements.

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And he's gone public
and stated those.

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:36.890 align:middle line:90%
Micah Hanks, thank you so much.

00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:38.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Jimmy Church,
always a pleasure.

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:39.880 align:middle line:90%
>> You're the best.

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:41.230 align:middle line:90%
"Into the Vortex."

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:43.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, Jimmy
Church, and along with Josh,

00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:45.670 align:middle line:90%
we'll see you guys next time.

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:48.420 align:middle line:90%
