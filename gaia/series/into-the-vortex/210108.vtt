00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm radio and television
host Jimmy Church,

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.620 align:middle line:84%
and I'm here to uncover
the truth about some

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.660 align:middle line:90%
of life's biggest mysteries.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.230 align:middle line:84%
If this is revealed,
everything has to be rewritten.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.690 align:middle line:10%
My guest today is
Linda Moulton Howe,

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.630 align:middle line:10%
an award winning investigative
journalist and host

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.670 align:middle line:10%
of Gaia's "Truth Hunter."

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.840 align:middle line:84%
>> And they say, I
was at a crash site,

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.720 align:middle line:84%
and there were bodies
that were not human.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And whatever made that craft
fly, we don't understand.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Technical assistant Josh--

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.690 align:middle line:90%
Josh, can you pull up the map?

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.930 align:middle line:10%
>> --also joins us to
help set the scene.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.010 align:middle line:84%
Join us as we deep dive to
get to the bottom of some

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.800 align:middle line:84%
of the most intriguing
questions of our time.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.550 align:middle line:84%
How sure are you
that Earth is being

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.830 align:middle line:90%
visited by extraterrestrials?

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.255 align:middle line:90%

00:01:07.255 --> 00:01:15.020 align:middle line:90%


00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.490 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "Into the Vortex."

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, Jimmy
Church, and today, our guest

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.240 align:middle line:90%
is Linda Moulton Howe.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to
jump straight into it.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.340 align:middle line:84%
Linda, welcome to
"Into the Vortex."

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And thank you, Jimmy Church,
for inviting me and an audience

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.680 align:middle line:84%
into the vortex with you,
because this is the area that

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.530 align:middle line:84%
we all have to learn
a lot more about.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Linda, you've been
a leader of our community

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.150 align:middle line:90%
for many years--

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.360 align:middle line:84%
"Strange Harvest," and
so many great books,

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.950 align:middle line:90%
and of course, "Earth Files."

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.100 align:middle line:84%
But out of the thousands of
interviews that I've done,

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.170 align:middle line:84%
I've probably
interviewed you the most.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And the one tradition that
we've had over the years

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.700 align:middle line:90%
is, no agenda.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Let's just get
started and do this.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what
we're going to do today.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.340 align:middle line:90%
Josh, are you ready for this?

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.880 align:middle line:90%
>> I am ready.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm a big fan of you, Linda.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And I've listened to a
lot of those interviews,

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.450 align:middle line:90%
so I'm excited for today.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm so glad to be here.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, how do I start an
interview with Linda after all

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.610 align:middle line:90%
of these years?

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.910 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to go here.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.750 align:middle line:84%
Linda, you get one
word, one answer.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.670 align:middle line:84%
From 1 to 100, how sure
are you that Earth is being

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.790 align:middle line:90%
visited by extraterrestrials?

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.665 align:middle line:90%
>> 100.

00:02:32.665 --> 00:02:34.540 align:middle line:84%
>> A one-word answer
from Linda Moulton Howe.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.350 align:middle line:90%
That's remarkable.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.120 align:middle line:90%
And here's the reason why.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.340 align:middle line:84%
I think our government
agrees with you.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.690 align:middle line:84%
I think that they are firmly
planted on 100 now, too,

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:44.540 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And for the first
time in history--

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.730 align:middle line:84%
and you've been a
part of this now,

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.410 align:middle line:90%
and you're living through this--

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.780 align:middle line:84%
our government has an extreme
interest in this subject.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.270 align:middle line:84%
Why is there a military aspect
to this coming from them,

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:07.030 align:middle line:84%
and why isn't there more of a
focus on personal experiences

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.500 align:middle line:90%
and contactees?

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I would
add the question,

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.740 align:middle line:84%
why haven't they told us the
truth in 85 years since World

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.680 align:middle line:90%
War II?

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.190 align:middle line:84%
I have spoken to so
many whistleblowers,

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.500 align:middle line:84%
whether they were in
aerospace, whether they

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.870 align:middle line:84%
had worked in the
Pentagon, whether they

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.050 align:middle line:84%
were a scientist that was
brought in to study something

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.270 align:middle line:90%
specifically, or medical.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And all of those
categories were involved

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.980 align:middle line:84%
in World War II, when our
government knew that whether it

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.190 align:middle line:84%
was around craft, whether
it was a wedge-shaped craft,

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.820 align:middle line:84%
whether it was a
cylindrical craft.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.630 align:middle line:84%
We had teams that no
one knew anything about.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, they would be called
Project Pounce and other names.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.950 align:middle line:84%
But there were people
who were assigned,

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.560 align:middle line:84%
when they got something
on radar and they

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.580 align:middle line:84%
knew that one of these
unidentified aerial vehicles,

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.300 align:middle line:84%
or UFOs, had come down,
whether it was in New Mexico,

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.120 align:middle line:84%
whether it was in Missouri,
wherever it was on the world.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.640 align:middle line:84%
Our government was actively
looking for, searching for,

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.190 align:middle line:84%
craft of unknown origin in the
skies from World War II on.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And one of the best
books, one of the best

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.020 align:middle line:84%
researchers from that period,
was Leonard Stringfield.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Certainly.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>> And he did a very valuable
book called "Situation Red."

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And Len had me come to
his house, to his office,

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.150 align:middle line:84%
around a conference
that we did together.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And he had various file
drawers, and boxes, and cases.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And he walked over to one and he
pulled it out and he showed me.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.030 align:middle line:84%
He said, when I was
in the Air Force--

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.750 align:middle line:84%
and he said, and I can
tell you firsthand,

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:10.330 align:middle line:84%
there was an order that any UFO
that was in front of any pilot

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.430 align:middle line:90%
was to be shot down.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.530 align:middle line:84%
It was a standing
shoot down order.

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is what Len, looking
straight up my eyes, said.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And Linda, the number of
pilots that we lost is huge.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And not a single parent
or brother or sister

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.410 align:middle line:90%
was ever told the truth.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And I still think of that as
one of the most pivotal days

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.200 align:middle line:84%
in my entire existence,
because Len was showing

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.050 align:middle line:84%
me material that
he had in his file

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.950 align:middle line:84%
drawers that related
to the standing orders,

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.210 align:middle line:90%
but they were not public.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>> And this connection to the
military, which, obviously,

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:58.450 align:middle line:84%
has been verified and goes
back 70-plus years now, today,

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.670 align:middle line:84%
even though we
have an interest--

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:03.310 align:middle line:90%
an obvious, tangible interest--

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.810 align:middle line:84%
with the Pentagon
and Washington,

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:10.960 align:middle line:84%
DC, their response, publicly, is
we don't know what's going on.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.950 align:middle line:90%
We're trying to figure that out.

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.400 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty clear
that they've known

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.720 align:middle line:84%
exactly what's going on
all the way back to 1947,

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.160 align:middle line:90%
and probably before that.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.390 align:middle line:90%
>> 1941, Cape Girardeau.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:24.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>> The amount of evidence and
firsthand testimony around Cape

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.660 align:middle line:90%
Girardeau.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And there's something
really important.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.450 align:middle line:90%
The month was probably April.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.660 align:middle line:90%
The day was probably the 12th.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.320 align:middle line:84%
There is a book called
"MO41" by Paul Blake Smith.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.110 align:middle line:84%
It came out about three
or four years ago.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:45.790 align:middle line:90%
He lives in Cape Girardeau.

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:51.970 align:middle line:84%
He had heard, his entire life,
about this strange thing coming

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:59.120 align:middle line:84%
down in Cape Girardeau, and
probably on April 12 of 1941.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And what Paul did,
in that book, was

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.660 align:middle line:84%
he reached out to a lot of
people in the Cape Girardeau

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.940 align:middle line:84%
and found that there
was a photographer

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.820 align:middle line:84%
from a local newspaper who
came with one of those cameras

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.060 align:middle line:84%
then, where it blasted
off a lot of light.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And people remembered
and told him there

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.340 align:middle line:84%
was somebody there with a
camera and the light went off.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they saw bodies
on the ground and a craft that

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:27.230 align:middle line:90%
was wedge-shaped.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.390 align:middle line:90%
That was the description.

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:36.260 align:middle line:84%
Wedge shapes were actually
what came down in Roswell

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.510 align:middle line:90%
in the 1947 period.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.630 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
'41 in Cape Girardeau.

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:44.270 align:middle line:90%
Bodies in both situations.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:48.350 align:middle line:84%
But here is why Cape
Girardeau is so important.

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Paul was able to
find some people who

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.700 align:middle line:84%
were related to various
officials in Washington, DC,

00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:00.860 align:middle line:84%
at the time, and learned that
there was an autopsy report.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was
two or three bodies.

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And this was the phrase
they discovered and reported

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.210 align:middle line:90%
that they were clones.

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Clones means identical
cell structure.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.080 align:middle line:90%
Each body was identical--

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.050 align:middle line:90%
>> To the other.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:24.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And I can hear Truman's
voice, George Wallace,

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:31.090 align:middle line:84%
and the Secretary of State, that
they would have been getting

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:36.460 align:middle line:84%
this report that these were
clones and they would have been

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:39.580 align:middle line:84%
looking at each other and
said, if these are clones,

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.170 align:middle line:90%
where are the clone makers?

00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:42.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:43.345 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:08:43.345 --> 00:08:43.720 align:middle line:90%
1941.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.710 align:middle line:90%
>> And that would be--

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:47.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Would that have
been Forrestal?

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Forrestal came with
Truman, and Truman came later,

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:56.960 align:middle line:84%
and the President of the
United States in 1941 was FDR.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's right.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>> But there's another
very important point.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:04.720 align:middle line:84%
FDR, and Truman, and
the Secretary of War,

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.840 align:middle line:84%
and the Secretary of
State, that whole group,

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.780 align:middle line:84%
they were all
33rd-degree Masons.

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:14.530 align:middle line:84%
These were men who were
used to keeping secrets.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And the implication is that
the 33rd-degree Masons also

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:21.910 align:middle line:84%
knew something about
other intelligence,

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:25.180 align:middle line:84%
and that this has been one
of the ongoing secrets.

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:28.570 align:middle line:84%
So those men, as
33rd-degree Masons

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:31.630 align:middle line:84%
getting this
information, as being

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:36.370 align:middle line:84%
the highest-office
people, they would have

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:39.880 align:middle line:90%
said to each other, not a word.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:45.400 align:middle line:84%
This is absolutely policy of
denial, policy of silence.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's where it
would have begun.

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>> So why the sudden interest,
today, out of Washington, DC?

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.210 align:middle line:90%
Why the about-face?

00:09:54.210 --> 00:10:00.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if you go to two
or three people that I have

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.590 align:middle line:90%
as sources--

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:06.090 align:middle line:84%
and one has been an executive
in one of the largest aerospace

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:08.670 align:middle line:90%
companies in the United States.

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:11.790 align:middle line:90%
Another was a physicist.

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And another was working
in aerospace as a pilot.

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And what they have all
told me is not only

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:29.430 align:middle line:84%
was Missouri the first bodies
that we retrieved and analyzed,

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:34.680 align:middle line:84%
but that as you go to Roswell
and that whole unfolding

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.010 align:middle line:84%
of various UFO crashes around
the world that would make

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:41.340 align:middle line:84%
headlines, and then there
would be some government policy

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:44.580 align:middle line:84%
statement-- it's
a weather balloon.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:45.870 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing.

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:48.390 align:middle line:84%
No, we're not dealing
with extraterrestrials.

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:51.120 align:middle line:84%
Behind the scenes, of
course, they knew exactly

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.360 align:middle line:84%
that they were dealing with
an extraterrestrial presence

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.460 align:middle line:84%
and technology that
they were learning

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:59.940 align:middle line:84%
was beyond anything
that humans could make.

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:05.130 align:middle line:84%
You get to a discussion
with these whistleblowers

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:10.710 align:middle line:84%
and the punishment for talking,
the nondisclosure agreements

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:14.010 align:middle line:84%
that everybody has
been forced to sign,

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:17.550 align:middle line:84%
that there were penalties
that people knew-- and I know

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:21.960 align:middle line:84%
for a fact of one whistleblower
four years ago who

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.050 align:middle line:84%
came to me with information,
and after he gave me

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:31.120 align:middle line:84%
the information in what we
thought was a confidential way,

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.690 align:middle line:90%
a bank account was emptied.

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:36.400 align:middle line:90%
He had a family.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And the government
emptied a checking account

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:45.280 align:middle line:84%
and let him know, this
is just for openers

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.730 align:middle line:90%
if you talk any more.

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:47.920 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I can't--

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.810 align:middle line:90%
they used my name.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:52.585 align:middle line:84%
They said, you are not to
talk with Linda Moulton Howe

00:11:52.585 --> 00:11:53.440 align:middle line:90%
ever again.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And we had been
extremely careful.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And I've come to the
conclusion that we

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.500 align:middle line:84%
live in such a
schizophrenic country

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:06.850 align:middle line:84%
because, going back
to World War II,

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:10.600 align:middle line:84%
I have talked with pilots
who fought in World War II.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.430 align:middle line:90%
They have passed, unfortunately.

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:15.100 align:middle line:84%
But I have talked
with them about them

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:18.010 align:middle line:84%
being inside of a
plane and having

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:21.850 align:middle line:84%
a silver disk, or a
cigar, or a shape come.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And they know-- it's
outside their window.

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And they know that
they are looking

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.290 align:middle line:84%
at something that
no human has made,

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:32.800 align:middle line:90%
no pilot even understands.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And when they land, there
are people waiting for them

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:39.270 align:middle line:90%
in suits.

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:42.850 align:middle line:84%
You are never to
talk about this.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:45.630 align:middle line:90%
And if you do, and punishment.

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:52.700 align:middle line:84%
So this is why we are living
in a schizophrenic age of 2022

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:58.490 align:middle line:84%
where, starting, maybe, if
you go back to the 1980s,

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:02.270 align:middle line:84%
I would say that was
the first small crack.

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And it was because there were
more and more whistleblowers

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:09.800 align:middle line:84%
that were frustrated by
the fact that there were

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:15.110 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of interactions in the
1980s between UFOs and pilots,

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:20.060 align:middle line:84%
between UFOs and the military,
shutting down radar, doing

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.400 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of aggressive things.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.370 align:middle line:84%
But nobody could tell
the truth because they

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:27.830 align:middle line:90%
had signed all of these NDAs.

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Slowly, as you went through
the '90s, and the interest

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:35.180 align:middle line:84%
of the Clintons, after Bill
Clinton became president,

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:39.290 align:middle line:84%
and he wanted to find out more,
and Hillary wanted to find out

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:46.580 align:middle line:84%
more about UFOs, I was invited
to go to Laurance Rockefeller's

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:51.170 align:middle line:84%
beautiful sort of
ranch in Wyoming,

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:53.690 align:middle line:84%
with a group of people
that included Robert

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:56.450 align:middle line:90%
Bigelow and Mrs. Rockefeller.

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:58.880 align:middle line:90%
And Leo Sprinkle was there.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.560 align:middle line:90%
There were a variety of us--

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.330 align:middle line:90%
Bruce Maccabee.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And what Mr. Rockefeller hoped
is that if he brought together

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:12.380 align:middle line:84%
a group of us who were actually
trying to get evidence,

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:14.030 align:middle line:90%
report it--

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:21.690 align:middle line:84%
he asked me if I would bring my
working "Glimpses, Volume I."

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:25.200 align:middle line:90%
And I brought this huge binder.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.830 align:middle line:10%
And I had the
experience of sitting

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:32.150 align:middle line:10%
at a table with all of these men
and showing what would become

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:33.650 align:middle line:10%
"Glimpses of Other Realities--

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:36.890 align:middle line:10%
Volume I, Facts
and Eyewitnesses,"

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:39.620 align:middle line:10%
that was filled with
material from military,

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:43.550 align:middle line:10%
and from citizens, and
from medical reports.

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And having Laurance Rockefeller
look through this binder

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:51.620 align:middle line:84%
and turn to me at one
point, and he said, Linda,

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:55.500 align:middle line:84%
this is extremely
important material.

00:14:55.500 --> 00:15:00.000 align:middle line:84%
We all were having that
dialogue with him directly.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And it went on for
about three days.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And after that was
completed, he took material,

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.200 align:middle line:84%
with our permission,
and put them

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:13.320 align:middle line:84%
into a binder that was
published, printed,

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.850 align:middle line:90%
by Laurance Rockefeller.

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And he sent it to every
member of Congress.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>> That was part of
his foundation, right?

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:19.500 align:middle line:90%
That's what--

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:20.970 align:middle line:90%
>> --the cover was, right?

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:21.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And so there was the
feeling, suddenly,

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:27.780 align:middle line:84%
that we were no longer--
those of us who were actually

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:32.130 align:middle line:84%
gathering facts and firsthand,
eyewitness testimony,

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:37.560 align:middle line:84%
that the world could still
say, oh, you're at the fringe.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:42.420 align:middle line:84%
We were being pulled into the
center of gravity of the United

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:43.440 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, when the
Clintons tried to open it up

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:49.980 align:middle line:84%
and they were
rebuffed, to me, I felt

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:55.200 align:middle line:84%
that this was a look into the
power structure, the power

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.610 align:middle line:90%
brokers.

00:15:56.610 --> 00:16:01.650 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to let go
of their hands on power.

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And so they have all kinds
of deflection excuses

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:07.540 align:middle line:90%
in the background.

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And when somebody like
President Bill Clinton

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:13.650 align:middle line:84%
asked, through various
intermediaries,

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:17.700 align:middle line:84%
I want to see the photographs--
because he had been told.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:21.000 align:middle line:84%
Photographs of bodies,
that we had various--

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.730 align:middle line:84%
whether it was
Wright-Patterson, a whole--

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:25.890 align:middle line:84%
>> He didn't even know
about Area 51 at that time.

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:28.060 align:middle line:90%
That's absolutely right.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.780 align:middle line:90%
And that as the--

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:34.920 align:middle line:84%
we'll call it the '80s to the
'90s, that more and more was

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:39.300 align:middle line:84%
opening up through actual
experiences and whistleblowers.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And the Clintons knew,
and Laurance Rockefeller

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:48.170 align:middle line:84%
knew, those of us who were
trying to report facts--

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:52.040 align:middle line:84%
that's been my only goal,
facts and the truth.

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:56.780 align:middle line:84%
I had an alien harvest
on animal mutilations,

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:59.640 align:middle line:84%
a subject that most people
want to run away from.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And it is a big
part of this story.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.359 align:middle line:84%
Then "Glimpses of
Other Realities--

00:17:04.359 --> 00:17:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Volume I" went into crop
circles, abductions,

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:13.630 align:middle line:84%
mutilations, and
government cover-ups.

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:17.290 align:middle line:84%
What were people
who talked to me--

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:19.720 align:middle line:84%
they were showing me
actual documents that are

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.560 align:middle line:90%
in "Glimpses--

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.300 align:middle line:90%
Volume I" and "Glimpses--

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:27.819 align:middle line:84%
Volume II" and that there was
increasing amounts of evidence,

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:33.130 align:middle line:84%
like Bob Wood, worked at
McDonnell Douglas, PhD.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:36.920 align:middle line:84%
One of the best aerospace
engineers you could ever want.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And it was Bob Wood, working
with Stanton Friedman, and me,

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:44.920 align:middle line:84%
and a few others, who was so
convinced that when there was

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:48.880 align:middle line:84%
a leak of something called
the "SOM1-01 Training Manual--

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:53.890 align:middle line:84%
Extraterrestrial Technology and
Entities, a Training Manual."

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:58.180 align:middle line:84%
That came through an
intermediary to a UFO group,

00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:59.800 align:middle line:90%
and they gave it to Stanton.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:03.700 align:middle line:10%
And it was in 35-millimeter
form, not paper.

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Stanton called up Bob
Wood, who had just

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:11.230 align:middle line:84%
retired from McDonnell Douglas,
and said, I need your help.

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:14.980 align:middle line:84%
Bob called me, called
three or four of us.

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.020 align:middle line:90%
We met together.

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking at what
Bob did, first off, which

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:23.450 align:middle line:90%
was fantastic.

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:27.870 align:middle line:84%
He got the 35-millimeter
turned into photographs.

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:31.060 align:middle line:10%
There was no jerry rigging
of anything on paper.

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And we all came together
in a private meeting,

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:37.120 align:middle line:84%
and we're looking at the
photographs of what is

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:41.320 align:middle line:84%
the "SOM1-01," which I
personally think is the single

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:45.010 align:middle line:84%
most important
leaked document ever.

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:50.860 align:middle line:84%
It goes into full descriptions,
including what a particular

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.620 align:middle line:84%
short grey would look
like, a taller grey.

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:56.620 align:middle line:84%
They're already reporting
these different greys.

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:59.140 align:middle line:84%
There is a page
that has sketches

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:01.540 align:middle line:90%
of different shaped UFOs.

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>> What to do with the ships,
what to do with the crash

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:06.260 align:middle line:84%
retrieval, who to call,
the processes involved.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:07.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:07.540 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:08.890 align:middle line:90%
>> It's an incredible book.

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:14.560 align:middle line:84%
Let me jump in right there,
because this is exactly what I

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.530 align:middle line:84%
feel is the
frustration of Congress

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:20.872 align:middle line:84%
and the Senate, where they
are backing up, saying,

00:19:20.872 --> 00:19:22.330 align:middle line:84%
we didn't know
anything about this.

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:23.130 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:24.370 align:middle line:90%
We need information.

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:27.310 align:middle line:84%
That's how
compartmentalized it is.

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:29.110 align:middle line:90%
The secrets have been held.

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And today, it seems
like a big surprise.

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:35.110 align:middle line:84%
But they're finding out now
that this has been going on

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:36.880 align:middle line:84%
for quite a long time,
and a lot of people

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:40.030 align:middle line:84%
know about it-- the agencies
and the Pentagon, everybody

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:41.620 align:middle line:90%
but elected officials.

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:42.580 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:45.840 align:middle line:84%
President Harry Truman
knew everything.

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:51.620 align:middle line:10%
And he is the one who
appointed Majestic-12, MJ-12,

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:55.700 align:middle line:10%
12 men who were in science,
medicine, business,

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:57.540 align:middle line:10%
that he could trust.

00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And it is significant
that in September of 1947,

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:06.440 align:middle line:84%
only a couple of months
after the big headline about,

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:10.730 align:middle line:84%
what is it, the
big headline that

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:13.100 align:middle line:84%
was in the "Roswell
Daily Record,"

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:17.150 align:middle line:90%
saucer crashes on ranch.

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:19.310 align:middle line:84%
So there was a lot
of public interest.

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:23.030 align:middle line:84%
Truman understood, but
he wanted to make sure

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:26.820 align:middle line:84%
that he had a lot of control
on what was happening.

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:30.180 align:middle line:84%
He creates the MJ-12
group that will talk only

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:32.400 align:middle line:90%
to him as president.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And he creates the Central
Intelligence Agency

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:41.730 align:middle line:90%
on September 18, 1947.

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And people don't
realize, the reason

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:48.780 align:middle line:84%
that the Central Intelligence
Agency was created then

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:53.490 align:middle line:84%
was because Truman wanted a
government agency that he would

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:56.460 align:middle line:84%
have control over that
he would be telling,

00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:00.360 align:middle line:84%
with MJ-12, we have
extraterrestrials.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.680 align:middle line:90%
We have craft.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.480 align:middle line:90%
We have technology.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And you guys are going
to be the ones who

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.670 align:middle line:90%
are doing the investigations.

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And what we need is, we
need craft to back-engineer.

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:17.820 align:middle line:84%
We need to come toe to toe
with what we're dealing with,

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.100 align:middle line:90%
and we need that technology.

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Was that the beginning of
the method of operation for "The

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.940 align:middle line:90%
Art of the Cover-Up"?

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:25.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:28.320 align:middle line:84%
>> It started then and
continued through to today?

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.860 align:middle line:84%
>> It was earlier, at
Cape Girardeau in '41.

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:33.960 align:middle line:90%
But we went through the war.

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:39.740 align:middle line:84%
We didn't get into World War
II until December of 1941.

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:46.310 align:middle line:84%
The knowledge, having the bodies
that were clones, was in April.

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:50.680 align:middle line:84%
So the United States doesn't
have its toes in World War II

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.950 align:middle line:84%
until December of
'41, and then there

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:58.010 align:middle line:84%
were pilots that began reporting
UFOs all over the place.

00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:02.890 align:middle line:84%
But no one knew, going through
the World War II, except later,

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:05.530 align:middle line:84%
the pilots that told
me about what they saw.

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:09.370 align:middle line:84%
It was like there were UFOs in
the skies all over the place.

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:12.100 align:middle line:84%
And every order
was, you don't talk.

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And that comes back
to Len Stringfield

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:17.170 align:middle line:84%
and "Situation
Red," when he said

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:21.550 align:middle line:84%
we lost so many pilots
trying to engage

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:23.650 align:middle line:90%
in interact with those UFOs.

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And the word was,
no one is to talk,

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:31.480 align:middle line:84%
and that not even parents or
families ever knew the truth.

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:34.210 align:middle line:90%
Jump to 2022.

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:40.080 align:middle line:84%
What I have been
exposed to since 2014--

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:45.000 align:middle line:84%
a physicist who worked
at Area 51 and S4

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:52.500 align:middle line:84%
who was able to tell me,
in 2014, that not only

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:55.260 align:middle line:84%
were there bodies
between Wright-Patterson

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:58.920 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of other Air Force
bases-- and Los Alamos,

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:03.120 align:middle line:90%
and we have museums of them.

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:07.980 align:middle line:84%
But that he had worked
on projects at Area 51

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:12.850 align:middle line:84%
that had to do with information
about the past, present,

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:16.800 align:middle line:84%
and future of our planet,
apparently from information

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.800 align:middle line:84%
that they were either
gaining directly

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:23.400 align:middle line:84%
through interface,
whether it was telepathic

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.220 align:middle line:84%
or however they were doing
it, with extraterrestrial

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:31.410 align:middle line:84%
biological entities, and what
was first on the front line

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:33.540 align:middle line:84%
was the Central
Intelligence Agency.

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:36.120 align:middle line:84%
That was followed
by the creation

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:40.360 align:middle line:84%
of the National Security Agency
and the Defense Intelligence

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.160 align:middle line:90%
Agency.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.250 align:middle line:90%
Now, there's 17 agencies.

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:48.250 align:middle line:84%
The first three,
at their core, they

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:52.000 align:middle line:84%
were hiding all of
their investigations

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.310 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial technology
and extraterrestrial biological

00:23:57.310 --> 00:24:01.690 align:middle line:84%
entities, but they didn't want
any reporter from the "New York

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:05.980 align:middle line:84%
Times" or any
media or television

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:09.160 align:middle line:90%
to go out and use those words.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:15.590 align:middle line:10%
And therefore, from Truman
as president and the creation

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:20.600 align:middle line:10%
of MJ-12, it was
accepted policy--

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:25.250 align:middle line:10%
the media are never, ever to be
given the facts of the truth.

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:29.420 align:middle line:10%
And if there's anybody who
is reporting the truth,

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.880 align:middle line:10%
they will be undermined.

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.910 align:middle line:90%
They will be criticized.

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:37.550 align:middle line:90%
I know how difficult it is.

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:41.090 align:middle line:84%
When I started, the very
first investigations

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:46.770 align:middle line:84%
of animal mutilations
in September of 1979,

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:51.360 align:middle line:84%
already, I had a national
Emmy nomination for shows

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.500 align:middle line:90%
that I was doing.

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:54.990 align:middle line:90%
I had so many different awards.

00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:56.640 align:middle line:90%
And the reason I bring that up--

00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:00.000 align:middle line:84%
I have been, since I graduated
from Stanford University

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.780 align:middle line:84%
with a master's degree
in communication in 1968,

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:08.640 align:middle line:84%
I've been a professional
journalist playing by all

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.860 align:middle line:90%
of the rules of journalism.

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And when the
headlines in Denver,

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:18.660 align:middle line:84%
where I was director of special
projects at the CBS station,

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:21.270 align:middle line:84%
there were new headlines,
as I would learn

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:24.330 align:middle line:90%
that they had been many before.

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And they were talking
about the return--

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:29.490 align:middle line:90%
it was that word.

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:35.040 align:middle line:84%
The return of bloodless,
trackless, animal mutilations.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.950 align:middle line:90%
What is the return?

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:39.180 align:middle line:90%
>> What does that even mean?

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:40.890 align:middle line:90%
>> They had been--

00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:43.830 align:middle line:84%
animal mutilations
had been reported

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:46.650 align:middle line:84%
in the state of Colorado
going all the way back

00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:49.870 align:middle line:90%
to the end of the '50s.

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:51.430 align:middle line:90%
I did not know that.

00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:53.740 align:middle line:84%
Most people in the
public did not know that,

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:58.630 align:middle line:84%
because all of this, under the
same influence that Truman set

00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:02.380 align:middle line:84%
in motion with MJ-12,
anything that was happening,

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:04.030 align:middle line:84%
whether it was in
the abductions,

00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:05.950 align:middle line:84%
whether it was in
animal mutilations,

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:10.030 align:middle line:84%
whether it was up in the
sky between planes and UFOs,

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:11.860 align:middle line:90%
it was all to be--

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:15.520 align:middle line:84%
always, always--
neutralized by cover story.

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Would this be an offshoot
of Project Mockingbird

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:23.950 align:middle line:84%
and the control of the CIA with
journalists across the country

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:27.370 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that certain
things were suppressed?

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:29.080 align:middle line:90%
>> There were multiple.

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.760 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't just Mockingbird.

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.770 align:middle line:90%
It started with Truman.

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:37.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, and coming back, I
am completely and totally

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:41.470 align:middle line:84%
innocent about what is
behind the bloodless,

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:42.800 align:middle line:90%
trackless animal mutilations.

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:43.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:47.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And the one piece
that I can share,

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:51.370 align:middle line:84%
out of 43 years of trying to
get to the bottom of everything

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:55.960 align:middle line:84%
related to UFOs and ET
presence, that does include

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:59.080 align:middle line:84%
the bloodless, trackless
mutilation of animals around

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.650 align:middle line:90%
this planet.

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:06.450 align:middle line:84%
I wanted, as the director
of that department that I

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:09.220 align:middle line:90%
was in at the CBS station--

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:11.860 align:middle line:84%
immediately, what went
through my mind was,

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:13.960 align:middle line:84%
I need to talk with
law enforcement that

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:17.740 align:middle line:84%
would have to have been in
any of these investigations,

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:21.040 align:middle line:84%
and may have been
also responsible for,

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.800 align:middle line:90%
everybody keep their mouth shut.

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.840 align:middle line:84%
So I started calling
sheriff's offices,

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:29.050 align:middle line:84%
and everybody said, you've got
to talk with Sheriff Tex Graves

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:30.340 align:middle line:90%
up in Logan County.

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.500 align:middle line:84%
He's been dealing with
animal mutilations

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:36.950 align:middle line:84%
going back into the end of
the '60s to the early '70s.

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:41.060 align:middle line:84%
So I got a meeting set,
drove 2 and 1/2 hours up

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:43.130 align:middle line:90%
to Northern Colorado.

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:45.770 align:middle line:84%
He'd retired, and that's
why he agreed to talk to me.

00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:47.150 align:middle line:90%
He had just retired.

00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And we were in a
vacuum cleaner shop,

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:52.250 align:middle line:84%
that he was going
to sell vacuums

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:55.010 align:middle line:84%
for the remainder
of his retirement.

00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And I stress this, because
this was now, suddenly,

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:04.340 align:middle line:84%
the first safe environment in
his life, meaning he's retired.

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:05.940 align:middle line:90%
He's running a vacuum.

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:10.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm a reporter that he
knows from a CBS station.

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's why he
told me so much, because he

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:15.650 align:middle line:90%
pulled out photos.

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:17.900 align:middle line:90%
He pulled out the documents.

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:21.830 align:middle line:84%
He was really-- he had
everything ready for me to see.

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And after about three, four
hours of my putting out--

00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:29.810 align:middle line:84%
and I asked him if I
could put the Polaroids.

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:31.850 align:middle line:90%
He took everything on Polaroids.

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:34.220 align:middle line:90%
You cannot manipulate Polaroids.

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:35.390 align:middle line:90%
>> You cannot.

00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:38.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And I ended up on his
floor, with his permission,

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:44.210 align:middle line:84%
166 Polaroids that Sheriff
Tex Graves took with his own

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:45.290 align:middle line:90%
camera.

00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:47.270 align:middle line:90%
And I'm looking at it by time.

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:50.880 align:middle line:90%
I organized it by time.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And he was giving me details
about why this could not

00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:59.780 align:middle line:84%
have been Predator, why this
could not have been anything

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:02.150 align:middle line:90%
that was-- he was explaining.

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm asking him
questions about,

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:10.130 align:middle line:84%
how does a 1700-pound
steer bury a hole--

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:12.800 align:middle line:84%
or make a hole
with its head that

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:17.840 align:middle line:84%
was 8 inches deep by the
Sheriff bringing a ruler

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.820 align:middle line:90%
and measuring the hole.

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:24.950 align:middle line:84%
So you had an animal with
its head 8 inches in a hole,

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:30.080 align:middle line:84%
and the two front and the
two back legs are perfect.

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:33.560 align:middle line:90%
The hooves were touching.

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.322 align:middle line:90%
It was the most unnatural--

00:29:35.322 --> 00:29:36.530 align:middle line:90%
>> It doesn't make any sense.

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>> And there's not one track.

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:41.250 align:middle line:90%
It was all sand and dust.

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:43.280 align:middle line:84%
There was no grass,
which is often

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:45.150 align:middle line:90%
the case in northern Colorado.

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:47.100 align:middle line:90%
It gets that dry.

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And when I asked
the Sheriff, how

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:54.990 align:middle line:84%
did all of the removal of
the ear, the eye, the tongue,

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:56.590 align:middle line:84%
the jaw, and the
genitals occur--

00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:57.420 align:middle line:90%
>> And the blood.

00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:00.270 align:middle line:90%
>> And there's nothing.

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And the Sheriff said, Linda,
I'm going to tell you,

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:14.260 align:middle line:84%
the perpetrators of these
bloodless animal mutilations

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:17.850 align:middle line:90%
are creatures from outer space.

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking eye
to eye with him,

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:22.650 align:middle line:84%
after we had gone
through all of this.

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And at exactly
that moment, it was

00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:30.750 align:middle line:84%
as if I was shocked
by an electric wire.

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:32.970 align:middle line:84%
Little did I know,
at that moment,

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:36.990 align:middle line:84%
that my life was
changing forever.

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:40.710 align:middle line:84%
After my documentary, "A
Strange Harvest," was broadcast,

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:45.090 align:middle line:84%
and it got the highest rating
in Arbitron and Nielsen

00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:48.480 align:middle line:84%
of anything that had ever
been on the CBS station--

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.460 align:middle line:90%
and that was just the beginning.

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:57.090 align:middle line:84%
They started dragging these
big, big grey canvas bags from

00:30:57.090 --> 00:31:01.200 align:middle line:84%
the mailroom into my office
on the third floor at the CBS

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.690 align:middle line:90%
station in Denver.

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:08.250 align:middle line:84%
They estimated that I
got over 1,000 letters.

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:10.590 align:middle line:90%
And this is not computers.

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:14.640 align:middle line:84%
The only way people could
communicate then was,

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:19.470 align:middle line:84%
you had faxes, you had
teletype, you had the phone,

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:22.230 align:middle line:84%
and you could type
or handwrite letters.

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:27.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me jump in, because
at the beginning of this

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:32.220 align:middle line:84%
conversation, I said
1 to 100, how sure?

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:34.740 align:middle line:90%
And straight out, you said 100.

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:37.770 align:middle line:84%
Let's back up 50 years
ago, 47 years ago.

00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:42.600 align:middle line:84%
What would your answer have
been then if I said 1 to 100?

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Depends on who
I was working for.

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:48.360 align:middle line:84%
Truman and FDR knew
the whole truth.

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:50.040 align:middle line:90%
>> But you.

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:53.400 align:middle line:84%
As you started your journalism
career, were you at a 1?

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:58.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Everybody back in the
'40s, who worked in anything

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:03.870 align:middle line:84%
but the five-sided building--
well, at that time,

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:07.110 align:middle line:84%
there was a war office, and
then the Pentagon was built.

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:13.640 align:middle line:84%
But the demarcation, the
compartmentalization,

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:16.730 align:middle line:90%
it began with Missouri.

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And most people in
this planet have never

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:21.650 align:middle line:84%
heard of Cape
Girardeau unless they

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:24.470 align:middle line:84%
have heard some of our
interviews or someone

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:28.550 align:middle line:84%
talking about the "MO41"
that Paul Blake Smith did.

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:31.070 align:middle line:90%
It's not generally well-known.

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:35.960 align:middle line:10%
And so that means that
the Roswell record

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:41.570 align:middle line:10%
and on July 8 of 1947,
it is the only newspaper

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:44.840 align:middle line:10%
that you see anywhere
in any media.

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:48.260 align:middle line:84%
It's that front page
of the "Daily Record."

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:50.450 align:middle line:90%
'47 was six years later.

00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm trying to say
is, our government already

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:56.300 align:middle line:90%
knew so much.

00:32:56.300 --> 00:33:01.430 align:middle line:84%
They were covering up under
Truman and all of these people.

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:07.650 align:middle line:84%
The press-- the press would have
been the one thing that they

00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:08.450 align:middle line:90%
would--

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:09.800 align:middle line:90%
arm's length distance.

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And remember, there
was a video that

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:16.010 align:middle line:84%
was released of Sanford
after the July 1952

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:18.170 align:middle line:90%
flyover of Washington, DC.

00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
group of UFOs, made

00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:24.410 align:middle line:90%
a photograph that is famous.

00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:28.220 align:middle line:84%
Sanford, who was then in
the five-sided building

00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:32.430 align:middle line:84%
of the Pentagon,
called the press.

00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:34.340 align:middle line:90%
The press came.

00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And what does Sanford
do, this general?

00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:42.770 align:middle line:84%
He has a car hubcap
and he says, watch.

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And he throws the hubcap up in
front of the press and says,

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:48.350 align:middle line:90%
there's your UFO.

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:49.850 align:middle line:90%
>> There's your UFO.

00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:53.480 align:middle line:90%
>> And Sanford knew the truth.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:59.750 align:middle line:84%
They had just had the flyover
of Washington, DC, two weeks.

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:03.130 align:middle line:84%
The ability to
make the lies stick

00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:07.960 align:middle line:84%
were policies of denial that
were so strict and enforced,

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:12.639 align:middle line:84%
and people who had their
checking accounts drained

00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:16.489 align:middle line:84%
or other penalties
inside of Washington.

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:19.780 align:middle line:84%
I've heard from one man who
was working in the Pentagon

00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:22.030 align:middle line:84%
at one point as a
high-ranking officer.

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:26.909 align:middle line:84%
He said, anybody who
approached me, Linda, I said,

00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:31.280 align:middle line:84%
don't talk to me at
all, when they said,

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:33.489 align:middle line:84%
we want to talk
to you about UFOs.

00:34:33.489 --> 00:34:41.880 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking from '41
up to, let's say, 2021.

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:46.889 align:middle line:84%
Policies of denial
and policies of lies

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:51.190 align:middle line:84%
that were backed up
by severe penalties

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:54.240 align:middle line:90%
classified reality, Jimmy.

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:55.040 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:58.990 align:middle line:84%
>> We have been living
with classified reality.

00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And when I am with people
who have been in the military

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:08.770 align:middle line:84%
and they're looking at me
eye to eye and they say,

00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:12.670 align:middle line:84%
I was at a crash
site and there were

00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:14.740 align:middle line:90%
bodies that were not human.

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And whatever made that craft
fly, we don't understand.

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard more pilots
say, Linda, I know for a fact

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:30.320 align:middle line:84%
that we were tracking on
radar this unknown object that

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:32.450 align:middle line:84%
was traveling at
12,000 miles an hour.

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:35.210 align:middle line:90%
It stopped.

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:37.730 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing humans make--

00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:40.820 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing
humans could sustain--

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:43.290 align:middle line:84%
that could go at
12,000 miles an hour

00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:46.760 align:middle line:84%
and stop as if it
hit a clear wall.

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And then all of
the reports, more

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:53.900 align:middle line:90%
of these, 12,000 miles an hour.

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:55.010 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't stop.

00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:57.440 align:middle line:90%
It does a 90-degree turn.

00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:01.550 align:middle line:84%
These are not Homo sapiens
sapiens technologies.

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And all of the pilots, the
physicists, the scientists,

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:07.140 align:middle line:90%
they know.

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:11.190 align:middle line:84%
But they were told that
to keep their jobs,

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:14.690 align:middle line:84%
to be a good,
patriotic American,

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:18.710 align:middle line:84%
this was the subject that they
were never, ever to reveal.

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>> You brought up Los Alamos
earlier as a possible location

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:26.480 align:middle line:90%
for debris and alien bodies.

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And we've talked about
science and physicists

00:36:28.850 --> 00:36:34.700 align:middle line:84%
at Fermi, at Los Alamos, created
what is now known as the Fermi

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:38.840 align:middle line:84%
paradox when he says, OK, we've
got all of these star systems

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:40.970 align:middle line:84%
and we've got
everything going on.

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:42.390 align:middle line:90%
There must be life out there.

00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:43.760 align:middle line:90%
But where is everybody?

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:45.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Because it's too silent.

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:49.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, so today, with
your answer of 100,

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:55.310 align:middle line:84%
and the Pentagon, and the
military, and Washington, DC,

00:36:55.310 --> 00:37:00.660 align:middle line:84%
now confirming this number 100,
has the Fermi paradox changed?

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:04.760 align:middle line:84%
Is it no longer, where is
everybody, but certainly,

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:07.430 align:middle line:90%
everybody seems to be here now?

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Every time I've heard that
argument, the Fermi paradox,

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:19.310 align:middle line:84%
I always want to say, but
they're all telepathic.

00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:23.340 align:middle line:84%
They're not a noisy
planet like we are.

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, everything I have
been exposed to in, let's say,

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:28.860 align:middle line:90%
the last--

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:30.510 align:middle line:90%
since 2014.

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:33.550 align:middle line:90%
It's almost a decade.

00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:40.810 align:middle line:84%
Physicists, medical doctors,
aerospace, some executives,

00:37:40.810 --> 00:37:44.560 align:middle line:90%
SEALs, military.

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:48.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say a sentence
that, as far as I'm concerned,

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:54.920 align:middle line:84%
is absolutely accurate, but
I cannot prove it to you with

00:37:54.920 --> 00:38:00.340 align:middle line:84%
the images, with the documents
that our five-sided building

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:01.690 align:middle line:90%
in Washington has.

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:04.720 align:middle line:90%


00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:11.690 align:middle line:10%
There are two sources over
this almost a decade that

00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:16.160 align:middle line:10%
in the last two years
have confirmed for me

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:20.880 align:middle line:10%
we have been working
side by side--

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:23.640 align:middle line:10%
I mean side by side--

00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:30.070 align:middle line:10%
human, Homo sapiens sapiens,
with tall whites and Nordics.

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:35.240 align:middle line:84%
Those are two of maybe a
dozen firsthand, eyewitness

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:36.040 align:middle line:90%
sightings.

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:42.420 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of different
extraterrestrial bodies.

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Engineers, physicists, have
been working elbow to elbow

00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:53.650 align:middle line:84%
with tall whites that are eight
feet tall when they are adult.

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:55.720 align:middle line:10%
Try to imagine this
in your mind's eye.

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:58.780 align:middle line:84%
Most humans are between
five and six feet tall.

00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:00.790 align:middle line:90%
Some men are taller.

00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:02.170 align:middle line:90%
But eight.

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And that they say,
you get used to it.

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:08.620 align:middle line:90%
And one man said to me--

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:09.970 align:middle line:90%
engineer.

00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:14.110 align:middle line:84%
He said, Linda, it's
like working side

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:18.340 align:middle line:84%
by side with a human
who had five Cray

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:23.400 align:middle line:84%
computers for a brain, because
the discussions with me

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:29.640 align:middle line:84%
have been so detailed by people
who are tremendously educated,

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:35.230 align:middle line:84%
with so many details, and
said, the tall whites,

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:39.280 align:middle line:84%
beginning three
years after Armstrong

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:44.060 align:middle line:90%
walked on the moon, 1972.

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:47.570 align:middle line:84%
We started having
a Space Force that

00:39:47.570 --> 00:39:52.020 align:middle line:84%
has gone with the tall
whites and the Nordics

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:56.060 align:middle line:90%
to other solar systems.

00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And, Linda, what we
have been being taught

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:02.210 align:middle line:84%
is how you enter
into a solar system

00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:05.540 align:middle line:90%
and how you log what is there.

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And he said, in this
particular case,

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:12.830 align:middle line:90%
we have had logging education.

00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:17.570 align:middle line:84%
We have logs on 28
different solar systems

00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:20.970 align:middle line:84%
at our end of the
Milky Way galaxy.

00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Further, he said,
do some research

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:28.860 align:middle line:84%
and just look at what
we have in photographs

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:31.830 align:middle line:90%
that allegedly depict--

00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:34.140 align:middle line:84%
taken from other
galaxies, because we

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:38.440 align:middle line:84%
don't have refined photographs
of the Milky Way galaxy.

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.830 align:middle line:90%
We have of Andromeda and others.

00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:42.690 align:middle line:84%
But there are
illustrations that have

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:48.000 align:middle line:84%
been done from work about
this strange little band

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.750 align:middle line:84%
that the Earth and our
solar system is in.

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:55.970 align:middle line:84%
Linda, just in
this band, we know

00:40:55.970 --> 00:41:01.930 align:middle line:90%
there are 168 civilizations.

00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, when that was
said to me for the first time,

00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:09.640 align:middle line:90%
it was like your mind does go--

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:13.330 align:middle line:90%
168 in just this little arm?

00:41:13.330 --> 00:41:15.970 align:middle line:90%
Back to the Fermi paradox.

00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:18.110 align:middle line:90%
How could it be so silent?

00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:23.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, it really hasn't,
because if you go back

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:27.430 align:middle line:84%
through to the real
history of our planet,

00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:32.170 align:middle line:84%
into Egypt, into
Mesopotamia, into what

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:38.470 align:middle line:84%
would have been Egypt, but way
before, whatever the Anunnaki

00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:44.080 align:middle line:84%
and going back, the presence
of other intelligences

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:49.030 align:middle line:84%
on this planet working with
what would have been, let's say,

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:53.470 align:middle line:84%
45,000 years ago,
the first cross-fade

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:57.250 align:middle line:84%
between neanderthalensis
and Homo sapiens sapien,

00:41:57.250 --> 00:42:02.700 align:middle line:84%
I think the better educated
estimate would be about 45,000.

00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:07.610 align:middle line:84%
John Anthony West,
a good friend who,

00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:11.450 align:middle line:84%
we used to have long discussions
about his being in Egypt

00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:15.230 align:middle line:84%
and how he went there with
Robert Schoch, who was

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:18.950 align:middle line:90%
a Yale-educated PhD geologist.

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:20.690 align:middle line:90%
Back in the early 1990s--

00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:24.020 align:middle line:84%
I think it was '92, they made
headlines in the "New York

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:28.050 align:middle line:84%
Times" and all over, being
together because Schoch said,

00:42:28.050 --> 00:42:32.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at water
weathering on the Sphinx,

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:35.150 align:middle line:84%
and I would estimate-- and
that's where they got quoted--

00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:39.350 align:middle line:84%
that the Sphinx was at
least 14,000 years old.

00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:42.710 align:middle line:84%
Then the year
before John passed,

00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:45.230 align:middle line:84%
we were at contact
in the desert.

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>> I was with you.

00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And that was the night that
John Anthony West came up.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And I still remember, he
put his hand on my arm

00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:57.890 align:middle line:84%
and he reached over, in
my left ear, and he said,

00:42:57.890 --> 00:43:01.550 align:middle line:84%
Schoch now thinks
that the Sphinx is

00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:03.950 align:middle line:90%
at least 45,000 years old.

00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>> I was there.

00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:06.320 align:middle line:90%
I was jealous.

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:08.030 align:middle line:90%
I saw this go down.

00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:10.340 align:middle line:90%
And Josh-- imagine this.

00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:17.030 align:middle line:84%
So I'm standing there, and John
then turns to Linda and says,

00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:18.890 align:middle line:90%
let's go to dinner and talk.

00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:20.900 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what about me?

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:23.660 align:middle line:90%


00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:24.960 align:middle line:90%
And they walked away.

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's the end-- but
yeah, I totally remember that.

00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:28.950 align:middle line:90%
Let me jump in.

00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:30.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I just wanted to
go one more step.

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:31.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I have done a documentary
about Antarctica,

00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:37.820 align:middle line:90%
"Alien Secrets Beneath the Ice."

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:40.910 align:middle line:90%
And it includes a Navy SEAL.

00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:42.710 align:middle line:90%
I know what unit.

00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:47.690 align:middle line:84%
I know photographs taken with
him with Nancy and Ronald

00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:49.330 align:middle line:90%
Reagan.

00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:53.460 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to talk with
him about UFOs and ETs.

00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And we know how interested
Nancy Reagan was in UFOs.

00:43:58.650 --> 00:44:00.257 align:middle line:90%
And her husband saw--

00:44:00.257 --> 00:44:01.590 align:middle line:90%
>> They had their own sightings.

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:02.882 align:middle line:90%
>> They had their own sighting.

00:44:02.882 --> 00:44:07.210 align:middle line:84%
So the SEAL that I
was working with that

00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:10.490 align:middle line:90%
is in my Antarctica documentary.

00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:17.020 align:middle line:84%
I knew that he was going to
Antarctica because of UFOs

00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:23.030 align:middle line:84%
and ETs, and went down two
miles deep below the ice,

00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:25.010 align:middle line:84%
underneath the
Beardmore glacier,

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:29.990 align:middle line:90%
into a phantasmagoria place.

00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:35.570 align:middle line:84%
80-foot ceilings, huge
hallways, 13-acre rooms.

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:39.140 align:middle line:84%
What does somebody need
13 acre all made out

00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:44.660 align:middle line:84%
of stone with the black sun
that we associate with Hitler

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:47.360 align:middle line:84%
in World War II,
but that this was

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:53.150 align:middle line:84%
on the back of every thick
door, was a black sun.

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:58.010 align:middle line:10%
And the estimated age
of this installation

00:44:58.010 --> 00:44:59.930 align:middle line:10%
that he was studying with--

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:03.620 align:middle line:10%
and going there because there
was a language expert trying

00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:07.010 align:middle line:10%
to figure out stuff--

00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:11.270 align:middle line:10%
that it could be as
old as 14 million

00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:16.230 align:middle line:10%
years, or even 32
million years, based

00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:19.260 align:middle line:10%
on a whole series of
things that happened

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:21.283 align:middle line:10%
after Pangaea split up.

00:45:21.283 --> 00:45:22.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that would
make a lot of sense.

00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:25.170 align:middle line:84%
That would be before
the ice was formed.

00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's really that
simple, isn't it?

00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And today, the very fact that
the SEAL that is in my film--

00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:36.300 align:middle line:90%
I get a call.

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:40.140 align:middle line:84%
First, it was really
innocent call--

00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:43.800 align:middle line:84%
nothing serious-- but to
set up a communication

00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:47.660 align:middle line:84%
method from a man
who said, I have

00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:52.700 align:middle line:84%
seen what your SEAL is telling
you is absolutely the truth.

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:56.530 align:middle line:10%
I know because I've
been there three times.

00:45:56.530 --> 00:45:59.920 align:middle line:84%
A whole other balloon
of information

00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:03.550 align:middle line:84%
after my documentary comes
out from another SEAL

00:46:03.550 --> 00:46:08.080 align:middle line:90%
who is telling me more.

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:11.780 align:middle line:90%
We are at a crossroads.

00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And it is the most
serious crossroads

00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:18.050 align:middle line:84%
that I think this planet
has been in, I think,

00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:21.240 align:middle line:90%
beyond World War.

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:27.640 align:middle line:84%
Every solid source that I've
had in the last 10 years,

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:32.080 align:middle line:84%
in various degrees
of communication,

00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:40.740 align:middle line:84%
in the year 2022, it has
been the most serious of all.

00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:46.870 align:middle line:84%
For humanity to
survive, ourselves,

00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:49.080 align:middle line:90%
this has to be opened up.

00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:52.800 align:middle line:84%
The truth, the whole
truth, has to be told.

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And the sentence at
the top, that everybody

00:46:56.250 --> 00:47:00.570 align:middle line:84%
is so afraid of in
Washington and other capitals

00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:03.390 align:middle line:84%
around the world,
is the sentence

00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:06.540 align:middle line:84%
that I was shown at
Kirtland Air Force base

00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:11.610 align:middle line:90%
in Albuquerque on April 9, 1983.

00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:13.170 align:middle line:90%
And why was I there?

00:47:13.170 --> 00:47:15.750 align:middle line:84%
Because Home Box
Office contracted

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:19.500 align:middle line:84%
me to do an hour for
HBO called "UFOs--

00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:21.420 align:middle line:90%
the ET Factor."

00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And a meeting is set
up by Peter Gersten who

00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:28.440 align:middle line:84%
had been doing a lot of Freedom
of Information Act requests

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:29.850 align:middle line:90%
through attorneys.

00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And he knew that I was in
Washington and New York,

00:47:34.530 --> 00:47:36.480 align:middle line:90%
and I was working on something.

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:37.890 align:middle line:90%
And we had a meeting.

00:47:37.890 --> 00:47:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And Gersten said,
I can set you up

00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:44.820 align:middle line:84%
with an Air Force Office
of Special Investigations

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:49.800 align:middle line:84%
agent in Albuquerque at
Kirtland because, Linda, I

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:52.890 align:middle line:84%
have firsthand testimony
that I could tell you

00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:56.730 align:middle line:84%
for your documentary that
at Ellsworth Air Force Base,

00:47:56.730 --> 00:47:59.220 align:middle line:90%
there was a landing of a craft.

00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:01.770 align:middle line:90%
Humanoids walked out.

00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:05.150 align:middle line:90%
A security guard pulled a gun.

00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:10.670 align:middle line:84%
On film, there is what
looks like a laser.

00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And the entire metal gun in the
Air Force security man's hand

00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:19.710 align:middle line:90%
evaporated.

00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And the man's hand
had barely any burns.

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And our government
wanted that technology,

00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:29.300 align:middle line:90%
and a clamp was put on that.

00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:32.270 align:middle line:84%
>> You were promised-- weren't
you told that you could have

00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:33.860 align:middle line:90%
access to that film?

00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:36.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that I
might be shown it.

00:48:36.590 --> 00:48:38.540 align:middle line:84%
But there was other film
that I was promised.

00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:44.180 align:middle line:84%
But to follow what is
really important about--

00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:47.120 align:middle line:84%
I've now got a
contract with HBO.

00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Peter Gersten has been pushing
FOIA to get intel documents.

00:48:52.310 --> 00:48:54.920 align:middle line:84%
I have a meeting
that gets set up

00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:59.540 align:middle line:84%
by Peter Gersten, who was
responsible for the Freedom

00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:03.890 align:middle line:84%
of Information Act request that
ended up at the Supreme Court.

00:49:03.890 --> 00:49:05.180 align:middle line:90%
And they only showed--

00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:07.070 align:middle line:90%
everything was blacked out.

00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And Stanton Friedman would show
all of those blacked out pages.

00:49:10.050 --> 00:49:10.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Redacted pages.

00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:11.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:11.810 --> 00:49:14.820 align:middle line:90%
>> So I get to Kirtland.

00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:18.660 align:middle line:84%
Because of what Peter
Gersten helped--

00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:23.520 align:middle line:84%
so and I'm in an office
with an AFOSI Special Agent

00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:26.420 align:middle line:90%
named Richard Doty.

00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:30.020 align:middle line:84%
I am sitting in front
of a desk thinking

00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:34.490 align:middle line:84%
that I am supposed to hear
names, addresses, phone

00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:39.830 align:middle line:84%
numbers for Ellsworth Air Force
Base about the exchange that

00:49:39.830 --> 00:49:42.620 align:middle line:84%
appeared to be a laser
that melted a gun

00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:44.030 align:middle line:90%
and didn't burn skin.

00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:47.240 align:middle line:90%
That's why I think I'm there.

00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And Doty says, my superiors have
asked me to show you something.

00:49:53.230 --> 00:49:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And out of-- and
he had me move--

00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:58.300 align:middle line:84%
>> From the chair to
the center of the room.

00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:00.250 align:middle line:90%
>> To the center of the room.

00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:01.840 align:middle line:90%
>> So you could be videotaped.

00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:04.200 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what was happening,
but I didn't know it

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:05.000 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:10.810 align:middle line:84%
But he reaches into a drawer and
pulls out an 11-by-14 envelope.

00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And pulls out these pages
and he said, my superiors

00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:16.540 align:middle line:84%
have asked me to
show this to you.

00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:19.480 align:middle line:84%
You can read it, but
you cannot take notes,

00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:22.960 align:middle line:84%
which is almost like a red
flag to any reporter worth

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:28.210 align:middle line:84%
their salt. You almost want
to say, I cannot take notes?

00:50:28.210 --> 00:50:29.710 align:middle line:90%
Who says?

00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:32.530 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't argue.

00:50:32.530 --> 00:50:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And I take the papers and
I go to the chair, now,

00:50:38.110 --> 00:50:42.130 align:middle line:84%
in the center of the room,
completely disoriented about,

00:50:42.130 --> 00:50:45.700 align:middle line:84%
why am I being asked
to move from the chair?

00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And when I look back, you
can see levels of-- when

00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:55.290 align:middle line:84%
you're green, I wasn't
suspecting cameras and audio

00:50:55.290 --> 00:50:58.840 align:middle line:84%
about which this big office
was built so that anybody was

00:50:58.840 --> 00:50:59.640 align:middle line:90%
in there--

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:01.110 align:middle line:90%
>> They were observing you.

00:51:01.110 --> 00:51:03.757 align:middle line:84%
Weren't they behind a one-way
mirror, or two-way mirror?

00:51:03.757 --> 00:51:04.590 align:middle line:90%
>> They recorded it.

00:51:04.590 --> 00:51:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And I have had two different men
at various conferences come up

00:51:08.550 --> 00:51:10.830 align:middle line:84%
and say, you were
wearing a polka dot

00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:13.350 align:middle line:84%
blouse at that
meeting in Kirtland,

00:51:13.350 --> 00:51:17.010 align:middle line:90%
and I've seen the footage.

00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:21.390 align:middle line:84%
When I start
reading these pages,

00:51:21.390 --> 00:51:25.060 align:middle line:84%
in a state of disorientation
about what is happening,

00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:27.930 align:middle line:84%
but my mind is
beginning to concentrate

00:51:27.930 --> 00:51:31.380 align:middle line:90%
on what it is I'm reading.

00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And a paragraph
I can still see--

00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:37.130 align:middle line:84%
I can see it as clearly
as I'm looking at you.

00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:40.970 align:middle line:84%
These extraterrestrial
biological entities

00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:46.700 align:middle line:84%
manipulated DNA in
already evolving primates

00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:49.730 align:middle line:90%
to create Homo sapien.

00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:55.370 align:middle line:84%
Down about five more pages, it
was a last page and at the top.

00:51:55.370 --> 00:51:56.840 align:middle line:90%
It said Project Garnet.

00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, I thought,
remember your birthday.

00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:00.950 align:middle line:90%
January.

00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:02.420 align:middle line:90%
The stone is garnet.

00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:04.160 align:middle line:90%
Project Garnet.

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:08.420 align:middle line:84%
All questions and mysteries
about the evolution

00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:13.230 align:middle line:84%
of Homo sapien on this
planet have been answered,

00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:16.880 align:middle line:90%
and this project is closed.

00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:20.750 align:middle line:84%
Through my 2022 mind
and experiences,

00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:23.750 align:middle line:84%
I can look back at how
accurate those sentences

00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:29.840 align:middle line:84%
that were shown to me on
April 9, 1983 at Kirtland,

00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:36.490 align:middle line:84%
because everything that I have
been exposed to since 2014--

00:52:36.490 --> 00:52:41.110 align:middle line:90%
Homo sapien is an experiment.

00:52:41.110 --> 00:52:46.350 align:middle line:84%
Homo sapien is a
manipulation of genetics by.

00:52:46.350 --> 00:52:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's where it
gets complicated.

00:52:50.290 --> 00:52:55.750 align:middle line:84%
Some versions are that the
tall whites and the Nordics

00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:58.670 align:middle line:90%
are the experimenters.

00:52:58.670 --> 00:53:03.290 align:middle line:84%
Others are that it is
grey, and the grey--

00:53:03.290 --> 00:53:06.020 align:middle line:84%
there are some biological,
but a lot of it

00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:07.860 align:middle line:90%
is artificial intelligence.

00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:09.860 align:middle line:84%
Why would artificial
intelligence

00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:12.530 align:middle line:84%
be behind an experiment
to manipulate

00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:18.470 align:middle line:84%
DNA in already evolving
primates to create Homo sapien?

00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:22.410 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't-- to me,
2 plus 2 doesn't work.

00:53:22.410 --> 00:53:25.930 align:middle line:84%
Reptilians come into
these discussions,

00:53:25.930 --> 00:53:29.730 align:middle line:84%
especially from people who
have served in the military.

00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:34.350 align:middle line:84%
People who fought in Vietnam
say that they came face

00:53:34.350 --> 00:53:37.830 align:middle line:84%
to face with something that was
like a standing-up alligator

00:53:37.830 --> 00:53:42.610 align:middle line:84%
or a standing-up lizard,
and it could fade out,

00:53:42.610 --> 00:53:44.970 align:middle line:84%
or they would be in
the jungle and they

00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:50.000 align:middle line:84%
would be moving forward
and something would pop in.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:56.200 align:middle line:84%
So reptilians, greys,
Nordics, tall whites.

00:53:56.200 --> 00:54:01.370 align:middle line:84%
Let's say that they
don't get along, either.

00:54:01.370 --> 00:54:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And if humanity,
once upon a time,

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:09.550 align:middle line:84%
going back 45,000
years to the cross-fade

00:54:09.550 --> 00:54:13.330 align:middle line:84%
with neanderthalensis,
maybe there

00:54:13.330 --> 00:54:18.190 align:middle line:84%
was a genetic manipulation
by three competing

00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:23.750 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial civilizations
who don't like each other,

00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:27.410 align:middle line:84%
and one makes one
genetic manipulation,

00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:31.280 align:middle line:84%
and another comes in and makes
their own genetic manipulation,

00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:33.870 align:middle line:90%
and a third comes in.

00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And then all of them
become surprised

00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:41.810 align:middle line:90%
at what starts evolving.

00:54:41.810 --> 00:54:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And that the 45,000
year cross-fade

00:54:44.570 --> 00:54:48.290 align:middle line:84%
with neanderthalensis
is the time

00:54:48.290 --> 00:54:53.360 align:middle line:84%
that John Anthony West,
the SEAL in Antarctica,

00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:55.940 align:middle line:84%
would come, finally,
to a conclusion.

00:54:55.940 --> 00:55:00.080 align:middle line:84%
Before John died, at
that conference, he said,

00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:04.880 align:middle line:84%
the Sphinx could be as
old as 45,000 years.

00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:09.890 align:middle line:84%
The SEAL told me that an
archaeologist and a language

00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:14.240 align:middle line:84%
expert on the Middle
East said they thought

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:17.900 align:middle line:84%
that the Sphinx and
that the Great Pyramid

00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:24.410 align:middle line:84%
could be as old as
50,000 to 70,000 years.

00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:29.680 align:middle line:84%
Our government's
rivers of information--

00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:34.860 align:middle line:84%
over 85 years
since World War II.

00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:37.470 align:middle line:84%
My own personal
opinion right now,

00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:41.180 align:middle line:84%
on this day, as
you and I speak, is

00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:46.010 align:middle line:84%
they begin to be confused by
all of the different stories

00:55:46.010 --> 00:55:50.760 align:middle line:84%
that they got from
different ET groups.

00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, Homo
sapiens sapien,

00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:56.070 align:middle line:84%
in the five-sided
building, the Pentagon,

00:55:56.070 --> 00:55:58.920 align:middle line:84%
which is
military-oriented, if we're

00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:02.350 align:middle line:84%
getting different
stories, I don't

00:56:02.350 --> 00:56:06.250 align:middle line:84%
know how we believe any
one as being the truth.

00:56:06.250 --> 00:56:11.040 align:middle line:84%
This is where it began
to be really complicated.

00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:14.800 align:middle line:10%
What would be the
vested interest--

00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:18.790 align:middle line:10%
why would there be
a vested interest--

00:56:18.790 --> 00:56:22.060 align:middle line:10%
by eight foot-tall
whites that are supposed

00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:25.030 align:middle line:10%
to be the geniuses
of the universe,

00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:27.880 align:middle line:10%
and the blond,
blue-eyed Nordics that I

00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:30.130 align:middle line:10%
have been told, as a
straightforward sentence,

00:56:30.130 --> 00:56:33.160 align:middle line:10%
they are, Linda, the
Vikings of history.

00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:35.040 align:middle line:90%
And they were violent.

00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:37.570 align:middle line:90%


00:56:37.570 --> 00:56:45.240 align:middle line:84%
Why would tall whites be
collaborating with Nordics

00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:50.430 align:middle line:84%
as if they had a vested interest
in what happened to humanity

00:56:50.430 --> 00:56:55.050 align:middle line:84%
while grays have been the ones
that seem to have abducted

00:56:55.050 --> 00:56:58.080 align:middle line:84%
humans the most
and the reptilians,

00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:01.260 align:middle line:84%
the standing-up lizards
and standing-up alligators,

00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:04.350 align:middle line:84%
which hundreds of
people have sketched--

00:57:04.350 --> 00:57:08.490 align:middle line:84%
this is what was
in front of them--

00:57:08.490 --> 00:57:12.900 align:middle line:84%
that the reptilians have
claimed, over and over,

00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:17.730 align:middle line:84%
to abductees, this
is our planet.

00:57:17.730 --> 00:57:19.950 align:middle line:90%
We were here first.

00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And they want the Nordics,
they want the tall whites,

00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:26.640 align:middle line:84%
they want the
grays out of Earth.

00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:28.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that's where--

00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:29.920 align:middle line:90%
I will say it--

00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:33.180 align:middle line:84%
that's where the Fermi
paradox has been changed.

00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:34.770 align:middle line:90%
They are here now.

00:57:34.770 --> 00:57:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And this wasn't used
today on "Into the Vortex"

00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:41.880 align:middle line:84%
because we had Linda
Moulton Howe here.

00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:44.380 align:middle line:90%
Linda, thank you so much.

00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:46.230 align:middle line:90%
What a great conversation.

00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:48.300 align:middle line:90%
Josh, amazing.

00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:51.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I am fascinated, but also
a little angry that the last 80

00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:52.680 align:middle line:90%
years has been denied from us.

00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:53.847 align:middle line:90%
And thank you for your work.

00:57:53.847 --> 00:57:57.450 align:middle line:84%
>> And, guys, think about the
programs that we can continue

00:57:57.450 --> 00:57:58.450 align:middle line:90%
to do now.

00:57:58.450 --> 00:57:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't wait.

00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:01.320 align:middle line:84%
>> It's beginning
to break you guys.

00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:02.160 align:middle line:90%
This is what my--

00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:04.410 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you, it's
beginning to break.

00:58:04.410 --> 00:58:06.720 align:middle line:84%
I have more and
more whistleblowers.

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:08.820 align:middle line:90%
I have more and more proof.

00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:12.240 align:middle line:84%
So next year, let's do,
what happens in 2023?

00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:14.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Part two, part
three, part four.

00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:17.250 align:middle line:84%
Linda Moulton Howe,
thank you so much.

00:58:17.250 --> 00:58:19.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Jimmy Church.

00:58:19.350 --> 00:58:21.480 align:middle line:84%
You've just been
into the vortex.

00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:24.050 align:middle line:90%
And we'll catch you next time.

00:58:24.050 --> 00:58:28.000 align:middle line:90%
