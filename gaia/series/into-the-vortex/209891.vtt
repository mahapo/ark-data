>> Thank you.

00:01:27.245 --> 00:01:29.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Jacques, if I may,
I want to start here.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.490 align:middle line:84%
You've been pursuing knowledge
about what may be visiting us

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.080 align:middle line:90%
for over 50 years.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.430 align:middle line:84%
But the Trinity case
is not your first case.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.860 align:middle line:84%
You've been looking
at other things.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And when you think about
it, how does Trinity rate

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.970 align:middle line:84%
with some of the other
cases you've Investigated

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what got me
started, as you may know,

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:59.250 align:middle line:84%
is that as a kid and
wanting to be a scientist,

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.450 align:middle line:84%
I had an observation of my
own with two other independent

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.280 align:middle line:90%
witnesses in France.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And for a long time,
I thought, well,

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.300 align:middle line:84%
this may be a new device
that's under testing

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.680 align:middle line:90%
or under development.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And then when I started
working at Paris observatory

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.640 align:middle line:84%
as an astronomer, tracking
satellites, and computing

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.610 align:middle line:84%
orbits, and so on, I
realized that there

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.930 align:middle line:84%
was nothing in the sky
like what I had seen.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.410 align:middle line:84%
So that started me
getting information

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.480 align:middle line:84%
from other scientists,
from other people who

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.170 align:middle line:90%
reported to us.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that there
was a much larger problem

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.400 align:middle line:90%
than anybody had realized.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
using my training

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.670 align:middle line:84%
and using computers to try to
find out what the patterns were

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.260 align:middle line:90%
behind the phenomena.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think
that over the last--

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.000 align:middle line:90%
as we get into Trinity--

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.600 align:middle line:84%
over the last four
or five years--

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.350 align:middle line:84%
with the revelations that have
been coming forward nearly

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.140 align:middle line:84%
daily over the last
five years, is this

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.420 align:middle line:84%
starting to validate your
past research and in some ways

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.360 align:middle line:84%
a vindication of your
past research, too?

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.100 align:middle line:90%
>> It's more than that.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.880 align:middle line:84%
I think of all the people I've
worked with over the years, Dr.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.650 align:middle line:84%
MacDonald, Dr. Hynek, of course,
with the Air Force Project Blue

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.100 align:middle line:84%
Book and so on, who are
waiting for this day

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.550 align:middle line:84%
when the stigma would be
removed, when people wouldn't

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.190 align:middle line:84%
be laughing at the
problem, but they

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.310 align:middle line:84%
would start taking it
seriously, and when scientists

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.600 align:middle line:84%
would join us because there are
only so many things we could

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.060 align:middle line:90%
do with the resources we had.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And now, Dr. Avi Loeb at
Harvard, Dr. Nolan at Stanford,

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.260 align:middle line:84%
and I work closely with him
on trace materials and so on.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.660 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of data that
now can see the light of day.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.520 align:middle line:90%
And that's a wonderful day.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:09.330 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that you
started to present to the world

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:16.500 align:middle line:84%
and to our community very early
on was this contact in these

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.000 align:middle line:84%
craft may not be what
we want them to be.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.670 align:middle line:84%
There may be something
inter-dimensional here.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.440 align:middle line:84%
There may be something
else or maybe

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.360 align:middle line:84%
a connection with
our consciousness

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.670 align:middle line:84%
to what may be
happening to as well.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.960 align:middle line:84%
This case isn't from
that side of the fence.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.560 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel about that?

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And is it something
that conflicts

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.690 align:middle line:90%
with your past research?

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.700 align:middle line:90%
>> It doesn't conflict.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.600 align:middle line:84%
It validates past
research, not only

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.060 align:middle line:84%
mine but that of
many other people

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.320 align:middle line:84%
who've looked at crashes
or close encounters.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.290 align:middle line:84%
The case in Socorro and
there is a similar case

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.430 align:middle line:84%
in Valenzuela in France,
in all three cases,

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.830 align:middle line:84%
there was a thorough
investigation

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.320 align:middle line:84%
by the state, not by a UFO
group or volunteers or people

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.860 align:middle line:84%
like me, but by the French
government, for example,

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.110 align:middle line:84%
in the case of Valenzuela,
by the Army and the Air Force

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Project Blue Book and Dr. Hynek
in the case of Socorro where

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.880 align:middle line:90%
we--

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.830 align:middle line:84%
in the book, we brought new
descriptions, new interviews

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.400 align:middle line:84%
that nobody has seen
before about Socorro.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.520 align:middle line:84%
In all three cases,
it wasn't a disk.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.020 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a flying saucer.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.400 align:middle line:90%
It was an egg-shaped object.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Let me jump in.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.500 align:middle line:90%
Josh, pull that up.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.050 align:middle line:90%
We have a drawing here.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.210 align:middle line:90%
This is part of your research.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.180 align:middle line:10%
And obviously,
there's a similarity

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.170 align:middle line:10%
here between not only
Socorro and France,

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.530 align:middle line:10%
but today, some of the
descriptions of the Tic Tac

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.230 align:middle line:10%
in that we are dealing
with an oval-- this

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.400 align:middle line:10%
isn't a flying saucer.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.870 align:middle line:10%
It's not a triangle.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.440 align:middle line:90%
It's a very descriptive craft.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.970 align:middle line:90%
And here it is.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.180 align:middle line:10%
Here, does it remind you of
not only modern phenomena

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.100 align:middle line:10%
but back to Socorro?

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Certainly.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.930 align:middle line:84%
Again, my background
is in computer science

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.650 align:middle line:84%
and in looking for
patterns and applying

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.680 align:middle line:84%
artificial intelligence
to complex patterns

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.020 align:middle line:90%
and in science.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.210 align:middle line:90%
Here, it's inescapable.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.070 align:middle line:90%
When you look at-- one case is--

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.450 align:middle line:84%
there is no one case, whether
it's Tic Tacs or anything else,

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.030 align:middle line:84%
that's going to convince
the public, that's

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.160 align:middle line:90%
going to convince the Academy.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.730 align:middle line:84%
What is going to be
convincing and move us along

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:44.140 align:middle line:84%
is looking for patterns,
looking for statistical patterns

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.470 align:middle line:84%
on a large number of cases,
which as you know, I've done.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.080 align:middle line:84%
But also, looking
at specific patterns

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.280 align:middle line:84%
on the ground where we can
have intense investigation

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.330 align:middle line:84%
over weeks and months and
investigation of the materials

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.240 align:middle line:84%
that are recovered in
all three of these cases

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.920 align:middle line:84%
or more cases that build
a picture that we can show

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.710 align:middle line:84%
to scientists that will
convince them there

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:10.090 align:middle line:90%
is a phenomenon there.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:15.250 align:middle line:10%
>> So in the new edition of your
book that you wrote with Paola

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:20.980 align:middle line:10%
Harris, Trinity, we've got new
witnesses and more information

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.990 align:middle line:10%
that has come forward.

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:26.140 align:middle line:10%
But what Trinity,
I think, represents

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:30.700 align:middle line:10%
for me is the possibility of
this being the first crash

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.610 align:middle line:10%
retrieval and one
of the first times

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.480 align:middle line:10%
that the Department of
Defense and certainly there

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:42.070 align:middle line:10%
in New Mexico where so much
high-level security stuff

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:43.600 align:middle line:10%
was going on at that time.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.700 align:middle line:84%
To have a crash retrieval
happen that predated Roswell

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.140 align:middle line:90%
is extraordinary.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.640 align:middle line:90%
Were you surprised by that?

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Everybody was surprised.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:59.710 align:middle line:84%
The witnesses hadn't
spoken for 60, 65 years.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:00.850 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:03.760 align:middle line:90%
The Air Force hadn't spoken.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, there was no
Air Force in 1945.

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:08.350 align:middle line:90%
There was an Army Air Force.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:11.650 align:middle line:84%
The planes you're going
to see were Army planes

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:14.530 align:middle line:84%
and the pilots
had Army uniforms.

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:16.810 align:middle line:90%
But the object was taken away.

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:20.170 align:middle line:84%
We know it was taken
away first to White Sands

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:22.060 align:middle line:90%
and then to Los Alamos.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And there, there is no
trace of it after that.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.040 align:middle line:84%
It's an object that was
the size of two trucks that

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:34.450 align:middle line:84%
took 10 days to remove from
the site where it crashed.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:40.059 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it was a controlled
crash landing that they made.

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And we have all the details
now because finally, Paola

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:49.000 align:middle line:84%
found the witnesses and got
them to speak on the record

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.340 align:middle line:84%
and then brought
me into the case

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.400 align:middle line:84%
to continue the research at
the site and the analysis.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:09:00.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Before we get to that, let's
set the stage on how everything

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:02.200 align:middle line:90%
unfolded.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.980 align:middle line:84%
We had initial witnesses,
again, the Army, Air Force.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And here Josh, we have
an image of a pilot.

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And what can you tell us about
this image, and who was he?

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.550 align:middle line:90%
>> So this was at the--

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:20.620 align:middle line:84%
right at the end
of World War II.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.990 align:middle line:84%
This pilot was coming
in for a landing.

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:26.800 align:middle line:84%
This was a month
after the explosion

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.730 align:middle line:90%
of the first atomic bomb.

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.240 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, great
historic moment,

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.180 align:middle line:90%
history changes at that point.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And he's coming in for
a landing at Alamogordo,

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.600 align:middle line:84%
which is inside the
White Sands area, which

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.310 align:middle line:90%
is very, very large--

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:45.100 align:middle line:84%
where they had detonated
the first bomb.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:50.440 align:middle line:84%
The tower asked him to check
a communication system that's

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:55.570 align:middle line:84%
on the communication tower at
the north end of the range.

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:58.360 align:middle line:84%
The tower has been hit
by something, and it's--

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.290 align:middle line:90%
the communication is broken.

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:03.070 align:middle line:84%
He circles that
communication tower.

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Reports that it's bent and
it's out of commission.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And then he sees some
smoke in the brush.

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And he sees an
egg-shaped object.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:16.600 align:middle line:84%
There is no saucer in
anything in the book.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.470 align:middle line:84%
He sees an oval object,
the size of two trucks

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:23.350 align:middle line:90%
with burning brush around it.

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And he sees two kids,
two Indians on horseback.

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:30.040 align:middle line:84%
They are not Indians,
but from where

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.470 align:middle line:84%
he is, he assumes
that they are Indians

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:34.480 align:middle line:90%
guarding the cattle there.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And then he makes a landing and
gives a report on what he saw.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:46.580 align:middle line:84%
So we can place everything at
that inception of the case,

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.220 align:middle line:90%
which we cannot do in Roswell.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:52.420 align:middle line:84%
In Roswell, if you remember,
the traces, the object

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:56.740 align:middle line:84%
was seen a couple of days later
after searching in the desert

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:57.850 align:middle line:90%
for the crash site.

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:01.185 align:middle line:84%
Here, we can place
everybody at the crash site.

00:11:01.185 --> 00:11:04.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I have to jump in here
because we need to understand

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:08.800 align:middle line:84%
the location, because with the
timing of a witness like that,

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.860 align:middle line:84%
a military pilot, we have the
location, we have the date,

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.570 align:middle line:90%
and we have the time.

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:18.830 align:middle line:84%
Josh, can you pull up the
map of where this occurred?

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:20.320 align:middle line:10%
And if you can
help us understand,

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.750 align:middle line:10%
Jacques, what we are looking at.

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:24.480 align:middle line:10%
>> So White Sands
was, of course,

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:30.600 align:middle line:10%
the secret area where Project
Manhattan installed all

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.480 align:middle line:10%
the equipment and for the
detonation of the first atomic

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.280 align:middle line:10%
bomb.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:39.090 align:middle line:90%
It happened in July 1945.

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:46.560 align:middle line:84%
One month later to the day, this
object crashes in San Antonito.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:50.910 align:middle line:10%
That is the bottom
red dot that you see.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:54.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Jacques, so the elephant
in the room for me here is we

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:56.800 align:middle line:10%
detonated the first
nuclear weapon,

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.340 align:middle line:10%
and then one month
later, a UFO crashed.

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:01.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, anyone who's
researched ufology

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:04.230 align:middle line:84%
realizes there's a connection
between nuclear weapons

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:05.460 align:middle line:90%
and UFOs.

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:10.980 align:middle line:84%
>> I think Trinity was a signal
from somewhere that you think

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:14.452 align:middle line:84%
you're clever with your
technology, look at this one.

00:12:14.452 --> 00:12:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it was a big moment.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:16.470 align:middle line:90%
>> We tried to figure it out.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:17.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>> So what happened
next with this,

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:24.280 align:middle line:84%
where we have the
two kids out there?

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.130 align:middle line:90%
We've got a pilot there.

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:28.185 align:middle line:90%
And what happened next?

00:12:28.185 --> 00:12:31.410 align:middle line:90%
>> The pilot makes his report.

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:36.420 align:middle line:84%
The Army Air Force gets
involved, of course,

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.160 align:middle line:90%
in retrieving this.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.700 align:middle line:84%
The kids have gone home
and told their families.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:46.680 align:middle line:10%
And Jose Padilla, who is
our main witness today,

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.040 align:middle line:10%
is still alive.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.530 align:middle line:90%
He's about 85.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:51.750 align:middle line:90%
Remembers clearly what happened.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:55.320 align:middle line:90%
His father called the Army.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:59.160 align:middle line:84%
An officer came to the
house, and they told him

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.210 align:middle line:90%
about the case.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And then the next day,
the two kids drove the--

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:08.144 align:middle line:84%
guided the two
adults, the father

00:13:08.144 --> 00:13:11.220 align:middle line:84%
and the-- and an
officer, to the site

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.695 align:middle line:84%
to show them where
the object was.

00:13:13.695 --> 00:13:18.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, with trace evidence,
which is always important,

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:22.240 align:middle line:84%
not only with UFO
but with any case,

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.650 align:middle line:90%
it's always the first question.

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:24.780 align:middle line:90%
What evidence do you have?

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.130 align:middle line:90%
What have you collected?

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And in the case of
Trinity, the evidence

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.940 align:middle line:84%
that has been
presented to you, how

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.850 align:middle line:84%
does that stand up with
the other trace evidence

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:37.665 align:middle line:84%
that you've been
analyzing in the past?

00:13:37.665 --> 00:13:41.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So first, we have the
evidence in the terrain.

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:43.730 align:middle line:90%
And that's fully documented.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:46.740 align:middle line:84%
We know the-- the Army
had to ask permission

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:53.610 align:middle line:84%
to cut the fence to that
ranch to drive a big truck

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:55.450 align:middle line:90%
to go recover that object.

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:57.690 align:middle line:84%
So anybody who says,
well, this could

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:01.200 align:middle line:84%
have been a hoax
with a fancy balloon,

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.190 align:middle line:84%
that fancy balloon was weighing
between two and five tons.

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And we know that from the kind
of truck that they brought

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.620 align:middle line:84%
and the crane that
the Army would bring.

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.390 align:middle line:90%
This would take three days.

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:14.890 align:middle line:84%
The kids are watching
this every day.

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:17.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for the kids, of
course, this was extraordinary.

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And they had the opportunity to
help adults recover this thing

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:24.900 align:middle line:84%
and to tell them about
what they had seen.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.990 align:middle line:84%
The fire that the
pilot had described,

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:30.150 align:middle line:90%
the craft was not on fire.

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:33.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, an airplane would
have been broken into pieces

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.940 align:middle line:90%
when it hit the tower.

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And this object hit the
tower, bent the tower,

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:45.300 align:middle line:84%
and then plow the boulevard
for about half a kilometer

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:51.010 align:middle line:84%
way into that brush and
made a turn under control.

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:54.150 align:middle line:84%
So it was really a
controlled crash.

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:58.680 align:middle line:84%
The kids are going to see
three creatures that we

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:03.180 align:middle line:84%
can talk about later in
an opening in the object,

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:05.460 align:middle line:84%
but the rest of the
object is intact.

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, but-- sorry
to pull you up,

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:09.755 align:middle line:84%
but why did the object hit
a tower and then crash?

00:15:09.755 --> 00:15:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Is there any
information on that?

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:12.060 align:middle line:90%
>> We don't know that.

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.430 align:middle line:84%
There had been a
thunderstorm before.

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:18.600 align:middle line:84%
It may have disturbed something
about the object trajectory.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.730 align:middle line:84%
We don't know
where it came from.

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And what we know is
that it hit the tower,

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:26.640 align:middle line:90%
and it crash-landed there.

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:29.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, the problem is
to go recover it.

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And the Army is going
to take most of the week

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:34.090 align:middle line:90%
to go there and recover it.

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:35.760 align:middle line:90%
And we have all the details.

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.700 align:middle line:84%
In the book I reconstructed
the temperature,

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:43.830 align:middle line:84%
the weather on every single
day and the action of the Army

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:45.060 align:middle line:90%
on every single day.

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:48.120 align:middle line:84%
We know that from the
very detailed testimony

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:52.380 align:middle line:90%
of the two kids, one of them--

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:57.210 align:middle line:84%
there were all, of course, grown
man, died a couple of years

00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:58.920 align:middle line:90%
before I became involved.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:02.370 align:middle line:10%
But Paola Harris started
the investigation.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:04.890 align:middle line:10%
And we had all the tapes
of these interviews

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:07.500 align:middle line:10%
that we transcribed
for the book.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:11.940 align:middle line:10%
Jose Padilla, who was an
officer with the Highway

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.640 align:middle line:10%
Patrol in California
for many years,

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:18.310 align:middle line:10%
had fought in Korea, had
two bullets in his body.

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:21.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is the
best witness you

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:24.000 align:middle line:84%
could have because
it's someone who

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.300 align:middle line:84%
has been in conditions of
where his value of observation

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:31.930 align:middle line:90%
was really the key.

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And he's really an
excellent observer.

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And we were able
to reconstruct what

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:38.580 align:middle line:84%
happened on every
single day when

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:42.520 align:middle line:84%
they were there, the object
and the witnesses and so on.

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:46.200 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is
the context, why are

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.120 align:middle line:90%
these two kids running a ranch?

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.850 align:middle line:10%
Well, this is the
end of World War II.

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:53.340 align:middle line:10%
All the able-bodied
men and women

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:55.890 align:middle line:10%
are in uniform scattered
all over the world.

00:16:55.890 --> 00:17:01.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was born in 1939
when Germany invaded France.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:06.390 align:middle line:84%
The first five years of
my life were in invaded--

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:08.950 align:middle line:90%
in German controlled France.

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:11.040 align:middle line:90%
I remember that vividly.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.980 align:middle line:84%
I've studied the end of
World War II in Europe.

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:17.579 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea or only
a vague idea of what

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:19.560 align:middle line:90%
had happened in the Pacific.

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Here, this is two days
after the capitulation

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:27.660 align:middle line:84%
of Japan, one month
after the detonation

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:29.790 align:middle line:90%
of the first atomic bomb.

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And this object
comes out of nowhere,

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:37.560 align:middle line:84%
destroys the communication
tower for Project Manhattan

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:41.700 align:middle line:84%
and crashes in the bushes in
front of a pilot and two kids.

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:42.900 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:46.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, isn't that a historic
moment, among other things,

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.920 align:middle line:90%
as well as a scientific puzzle?

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.600 align:middle line:10%
So this is how I--

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:56.220 align:middle line:10%
when I realized--
thanks to Paola

00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:01.170 align:middle line:10%
who had seen that also from a
historic perspective, not just

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:03.090 align:middle line:10%
as another UFO.

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:06.960 align:middle line:84%
This is what we try to
bring into the book,

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:14.070 align:middle line:84%
into the significance of some
of these unique observations

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:15.330 align:middle line:90%
in the whole history.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And there's another dynamic
here that is just staring

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:25.770 align:middle line:84%
at us, which is we have a
white, egg-shaped, oval craft,

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:32.130 align:middle line:84%
but also, that there were beings
sighted with this too as well.

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:34.265 align:middle line:90%
What-- the description--

00:18:34.265 --> 00:18:36.840 align:middle line:90%
>> It was grey.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:37.890 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't white.

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:42.880 align:middle line:84%
The kids rushed there to
try to help the pilots.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:43.890 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they had--

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:47.460 align:middle line:84%
nobody had any idea
of UFOs at that time.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And what they see is
three short beings

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:55.530 align:middle line:84%
about their size,
about three feet,

00:18:55.530 --> 00:19:00.420 align:middle line:84%
a little over three feet
tall, that breathe our air.

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:02.080 align:middle line:90%
So they look human.

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.690 align:middle line:84%
They don't have a
helmet, they don't

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:07.680 align:middle line:84%
have what you would expect
extraterrestrial to have.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.390 align:middle line:90%
They breathe our air.

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:12.510 align:middle line:84%
They're alive, but
they are moving,

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:15.030 align:middle line:90%
sliding inside this object.

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:16.560 align:middle line:90%
They never come out.

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And they seem to be in a
state of total confusion.

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:22.650 align:middle line:84%
We are not going
to see them again.

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:26.820 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what happened
that night, whether they

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:30.420 align:middle line:84%
were picked up by something,
but how they disappeared.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:34.140 align:middle line:84%
But we're not going to see
them again in the later days.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.480 align:middle line:90%
>> We have an image of that.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.950 align:middle line:90%
Josh, can you pull this up?

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And this is fascinating to
me, to have this so many years

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:44.650 align:middle line:90%
later.

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:49.712 align:middle line:84%
So the direction starts on
the left side of this image.

00:19:49.712 --> 00:19:51.420 align:middle line:84%
Jacques, what can you
tell us about this?

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:52.795 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it comes
from the north,

00:19:52.795 --> 00:19:55.860 align:middle line:84%
and it's going
south under control.

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:59.640 align:middle line:84%
It's actually digging
up a boulevard.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And about half a
foot of dirt is going

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:05.490 align:middle line:90%
to be removed by that thing.

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:09.900 align:middle line:84%
As it glides down
the hill, it gets

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:13.080 align:middle line:84%
to that point with the
circle, with the red circle,

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:17.370 align:middle line:84%
and it makes a controlled turn
against the landscape there.

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:19.710 align:middle line:84%
Then it stops where
the bushes are.

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:21.390 align:middle line:90%
The bushes catch fire.

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:23.580 align:middle line:90%
The object does not catch fire.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And the-- that's the point where
the pilot coming in with a B-25

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:34.030 align:middle line:84%
is going to circle over the
area and see all of that,

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:37.810 align:middle line:84%
and see the two kids while
taking care of the cattle

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:38.610 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:42.030 align:middle line:84%
>> How long did it take
for them to load this up?

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And how many trucks and
how big were the trucks?

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.660 align:middle line:90%
>> So that's the funny part.

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:53.400 align:middle line:84%
You'd expect if-- you've
seen the movies by Spielberg.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:57.360 align:middle line:84%
The Army gets there
with big helicopters.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.340 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't that.

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:02.820 align:middle line:84%
The Army had to ask permission
to get on the ranch.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:05.820 align:middle line:84%
A lieutenant arrives,
goes to the house

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:12.780 align:middle line:84%
of the owner, the father of Jose
Padilla, Mr. Faustino Padilla,

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:17.700 align:middle line:84%
and says in Spanish,
Senor, we've

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:22.055 align:middle line:84%
lost one of our weather
balloons on your land.

00:21:22.055 --> 00:21:22.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Heard that before.

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:26.690 align:middle line:84%
>> We would like to
go and get it back.

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:30.690 align:middle line:84%
Senor Padilla says, oh,
you want weather balloons?

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:33.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I catch your
weather balloons.

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:35.450 align:middle line:84%
They-- this is a
very large ranch.

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:38.600 align:middle line:84%
White Sands is sending
weather balloons every morning

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.590 align:middle line:90%
for wind directions and so on.

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:41.930 align:middle line:90%
And he picks them up.

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:44.130 align:middle line:90%
Everybody wants to help the war.

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:45.890 align:middle line:84%
Everybody wants
to help the Army.

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:48.530 align:middle line:84%
So he goes into the
next room, comes back

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:51.770 align:middle line:84%
with an armful of nicely
folded weather balloons.

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:53.330 align:middle line:90%
Gives it back to the officer.

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And he says, no, Senor, it's
a special weather balloon,

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.730 align:middle line:90%
and we need to go and get it.

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:02.360 align:middle line:84%
So we would like to
catch your fence.

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:07.130 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Padilla says there is
a cattle gate in my fence

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:09.830 align:middle line:90%
where I go to get the cows out.

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:10.850 align:middle line:90%
You can use that.

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:13.400 align:middle line:90%
You're welcome to use that.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.461 align:middle line:90%
Says no, we have a--

00:22:15.461 --> 00:22:20.750 align:middle line:84%
we need a bigger truck to
get the weather balloon.

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And we're going
to cut your fence,

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:26.300 align:middle line:84%
but you'll have a nice fence
that the Army will give you

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:28.890 align:middle line:84%
that will stay there
that will be large.

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And then we need
to bring a tractor

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:40.100 align:middle line:84%
and dig a road to where the
object is to get it out.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:42.050 align:middle line:90%
And they do that.

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:43.550 align:middle line:90%
And you can still see it.

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:46.130 align:middle line:84%
When you go to
that ranch, there's

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:50.120 align:middle line:84%
this very wide area where
they brought what they--

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:53.870 align:middle line:84%
a lowboy which was one
of those Army trucks

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:55.820 align:middle line:90%
where you could put two tanks.

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:59.510 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, that gives you an idea
of what kind of weather balloon

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:00.410 align:middle line:90%
that was.

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:01.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Pretty heavy one.

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:06.140 align:middle line:84%
I love the second
Spielberg reference today.

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:08.750 align:middle line:84%
We're going to need
a bigger truck.

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:15.195 align:middle line:84%
So the object was so big it
couldn't go through town.

00:23:15.195 --> 00:23:16.070 align:middle line:90%
You had streetlights.

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:18.365 align:middle line:84%
You have power lines
going across the street.

00:23:18.365 --> 00:23:23.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, there is a bridge--

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:24.640 align:middle line:90%
you're looking at the--

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:29.930 align:middle line:84%
the Pacific Highway is going
down there all the way south.

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And there was a bridge where the
object when it was on the truck

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:37.220 align:middle line:90%
would have hit the highway.

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:41.630 align:middle line:84%
So they had to bring a crane
also in addition to the truck

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:43.760 align:middle line:90%
to turn the object around.

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's how the kids
could-- on their last day

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:48.540 align:middle line:90%
could see the underside of it.

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:50.390 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have
the description.

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:54.590 align:middle line:84%
The kids saw the object
when it was on the truck,

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:57.620 align:middle line:84%
on the Army truck, on the
lowboy that the crane had

00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:58.490 align:middle line:90%
put it there.

00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:02.130 align:middle line:10%
And of course, they
wanted to get close to it.

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:03.980 align:middle line:84%
There was a time when
they could get close

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:06.170 align:middle line:84%
without the soldiers
looking at them.

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And they looked
at the underside.

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:11.570 align:middle line:84%
The underside had no
trace of an engine.

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:13.400 align:middle line:90%
It was completely smooth.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.410 align:middle line:90%
And there was no propeller.

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:16.880 align:middle line:90%
There were no reactors.

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.270 align:middle line:90%
There was none of that.

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:19.700 align:middle line:90%
So how does it work?

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that's a question
for any scientist when you

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.580 align:middle line:90%
have that kind of description.

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:28.100 align:middle line:84%
When it was on the
side, it was egg-shaped.

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:31.430 align:middle line:84%
They called it an
avocado in Spanish.

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And then it could go
under the overpass.

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, going back
to the evidence,

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:42.920 align:middle line:84%
is there a paper trail
about the retrieval of this,

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.450 align:middle line:90%
where they took it?

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:47.570 align:middle line:84%
Did it end up maybe
at Wright Patterson?

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:50.420 align:middle line:90%
Are there reports of the crash?

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:53.330 align:middle line:90%
Is there a military paper trail?

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:55.640 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's the
interesting part,

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:59.510 align:middle line:84%
that the Air Force was not
involved and all this was

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:00.320 align:middle line:90%
the Army.

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And the Army had
planes and pilots,

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:05.180 align:middle line:84%
but it was all
in-- the Air Force

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:09.110 align:middle line:84%
is not going to exist
until two years later.

00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:12.380 align:middle line:84%
Truman is going to sign
the order for the creation

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:13.370 align:middle line:90%
of the Air Force.

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:15.710 align:middle line:84%
The term flying
saucer is not going

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:18.960 align:middle line:84%
to be in the English language
until two years later.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:19.760 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:26.330 align:middle line:84%
So we're way before what people
think of as the UFO flying

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:28.100 align:middle line:90%
saucer era.

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Few of the documents
have survived,

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:34.700 align:middle line:84%
but we know from the
testimony and the testimony

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.550 align:middle line:84%
of other witnesses
we keep finding,

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:40.910 align:middle line:84%
that's where our
investigation continues,

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:44.720 align:middle line:84%
there must be other people
who are there afterwards.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:47.250 align:middle line:90%
Of course, they would be older.

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:50.570 align:middle line:84%
They would be in
their late 60s or 70s,

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:53.150 align:middle line:84%
but people who've seen
the aftermath of this.

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And we've already
found two of them

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:58.490 align:middle line:84%
who can describe
the materials that

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:02.930 align:middle line:84%
were retrieved after the Army
had gone and taken the thing.

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:05.030 align:middle line:84%
As you know, I've
participated in a number

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:11.660 align:middle line:84%
of studies including the
classified Base-80 research.

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:13.730 align:middle line:84%
I've spoken to a
number of people

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:19.160 align:middle line:84%
who were cleared as I was
cleared for these cases.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.170 align:middle line:84%
None of them knew about
this particular case.

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:27.410 align:middle line:84%
The reason is it didn't go
through the normal secret path

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:31.190 align:middle line:84%
of secret, top secret,
and SAP, and so on.

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:35.390 align:middle line:84%
It went to the Atomic Energy
Commission classification

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:40.100 align:middle line:84%
system, which is P and
Q and R, classification

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:43.430 align:middle line:84%
that's very specific
for the atomic secrets.

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:46.070 align:middle line:84%
The craft never went
to the Air Force.

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:50.120 align:middle line:84%
Air Force never had custody
of it as far as we can tell.

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:53.570 align:middle line:84%
It would have gone
to White Sands, which

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:55.640 align:middle line:90%
was the Manhattan Project.

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:59.960 align:middle line:84%
The Manhattan Project after
the war, within weeks of this,

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:04.790 align:middle line:84%
merged into a new entity
which became the Atomic Energy

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:08.180 align:middle line:84%
Commission and became
the Department of Energy.

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:12.230 align:middle line:84%
We know that the
object went there.

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:13.730 align:middle line:84%
It would have gone
first-- it would

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:18.500 align:middle line:84%
have been taken to Los Alamos
to be taken to the lab.

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:20.480 align:middle line:84%
For all I know, it
may still be there.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:25.250 align:middle line:84%
But we lose trace of it
there, except that one

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:31.550 align:middle line:84%
of the witnesses, Reme Baca,
became a prominent businessman

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:33.380 align:middle line:90%
in the state of Washington.

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:36.680 align:middle line:84%
Worked with the
unions there and with

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:41.000 align:middle line:84%
the Spanish-speaking population
in the state of Washington,

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.170 align:middle line:84%
and worked with Dixy Lee Ray who
was the governor of Washington.

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And then she was the first
director of the Atomic Energy

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:50.900 align:middle line:90%
Commission.

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:54.600 align:middle line:84%
Dixy Lee Ray heard
about the case.

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.740 align:middle line:84%
He told her about what
he had seen as a kid.

00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And she went to the safe
and took the report,

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:05.930 align:middle line:84%
the official report, and
showed him the Atomic Energy

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:09.380 align:middle line:90%
Commission report on the crash.

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:10.940 align:middle line:90%
They didn't let him keep it.

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:13.910 align:middle line:84%
It was obviously
classified, but she

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:17.390 align:middle line:84%
felt that she trusted
him enough that she

00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:18.785 align:middle line:90%
could show him the report.

00:28:18.785 --> 00:28:23.690 align:middle line:84%
>> This is where things get
pretty dark and pretty serious.

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:25.910 align:middle line:84%
When you are trying
to research this,

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:28.190 align:middle line:84%
we do go to the Department
of Defense first.

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:32.780 align:middle line:84%
We think about the Air Force
or the Navy and military.

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:36.290 align:middle line:84%
But there is a lot
of conversation today

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:39.890 align:middle line:84%
that if you want to get to
some of this information,

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:41.880 align:middle line:84%
and you want to get
to the real stuff,

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:43.550 align:middle line:84%
you go to the
Department of Energy.

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:46.220 align:middle line:84%
You go to the Atomic
Energy Commission.

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:50.420 align:middle line:84%
It's easier to keep stuff
buried there because that's not

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:51.680 align:middle line:90%
where people look first.

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:52.940 align:middle line:90%
Is this what you're finding?

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:54.770 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's legitimate.

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:56.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
where it should be.

00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:59.380 align:middle line:84%
The atomic secrets,
there is no reason

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:01.780 align:middle line:84%
why anybody with a
security clearance

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:04.330 align:middle line:84%
should have access to
the atomic secrets.

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And there is a third
classification,

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:10.330 align:middle line:84%
which is a State Department
with foreign secrets.

00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:11.740 align:middle line:90%
There is no reason--

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:16.630 align:middle line:84%
if you're working in DOD
working on some new prototype

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:18.280 align:middle line:84%
of an aircraft,
there is no reason

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:21.730 align:middle line:84%
why you should have
access to what's

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:24.740 align:middle line:84%
going on politically in South
America or something like that.

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:27.010 align:middle line:90%
So these are appropriate.

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying
that we should just

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:33.310 align:middle line:84%
break the classification
on all of that.

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:36.580 align:middle line:84%
You have been
collecting and doing

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:41.200 align:middle line:84%
testing on collected evidence
for many, many years.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Too many years.

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:43.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Too many years.

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.220 align:middle line:90%
Have you been able to--

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:46.630 align:middle line:90%
and the second--

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:48.760 align:middle line:90%
Josh, pull this up.

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:52.660 align:middle line:84%
Your evidence and
some of the images

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:56.740 align:middle line:84%
that I've seen of you with
this in a laboratory setting,

00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:58.900 align:middle line:90%
I find it extraordinary.

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:01.720 align:middle line:84%
What's the secret that
you can share with me now?

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:05.770 align:middle line:84%
Is there something between
this collected evidence

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:09.385 align:middle line:84%
that suggests an
extraterrestrial origin?

00:30:09.385 --> 00:30:13.960 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, obviously, you
look for physical evidence.

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:20.020 align:middle line:84%
We know of physical evidence
at the ranch in San Antonio

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:22.390 align:middle line:84%
because we have witnesses
who've played with it

00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:25.390 align:middle line:84%
when they were kids,
including fibers

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:28.750 align:middle line:84%
that would light up and
change colors and so on.

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:33.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, Colonel Corso who was
in charge of-- we know--

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:35.830 align:middle line:84%
through the interviews
that Paola Harris has

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:39.530 align:middle line:84%
done with him, both in the
US and in Italy and so on,

00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:41.740 align:middle line:84%
we know that at the
end of World War II,

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:46.330 align:middle line:84%
he was in charge of evidence
that had been collected

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:49.090 align:middle line:84%
and that was given to
different laboratories,

00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:52.450 align:middle line:84%
to IBM, to Battelle,
to Lockheed, and so

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:58.210 align:middle line:84%
on of different fibers and
different pieces of metal that

00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:00.550 align:middle line:90%
were analyzed by different labs.

00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:03.100 align:middle line:90%
We know that data is out there.

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:05.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in my own
career, I've spoken

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:08.680 align:middle line:84%
to people who had
had access to those

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:12.250 align:middle line:84%
and could describe what
those characteristics were.

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:14.260 align:middle line:90%
Good luck making sense of it.

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:16.280 align:middle line:90%
It's very complex.

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:19.430 align:middle line:84%
It's ahead of what we
have, but we can test it.

00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:20.230 align:middle line:90%
We can--

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we've started to do.

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:25.810 align:middle line:84%
So I've collected--
this is part of the data

00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:28.450 align:middle line:84%
that I've collected that
people have given me.

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:31.090 align:middle line:84%
Professor Schrock at
Stanford University

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:36.490 align:middle line:84%
had studied that work 30, 40
years ago with instruments

00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:39.880 align:middle line:84%
that enabled him to look not
only at the composition--

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:42.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, composition
is one thing,

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:46.030 align:middle line:84%
but somebody could fool you
with chemicals and so on,

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:48.370 align:middle line:90%
but looking at the isotopes.

00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:52.540 align:middle line:84%
If there is something
that has been modified

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:55.630 align:middle line:84%
about the characteristics
of the materials

00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:59.290 align:middle line:84%
for a particular purpose,
whether it's biology

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:03.610 align:middle line:84%
or whether it is
travel in outer space,

00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:06.010 align:middle line:84%
you would expect them
to need to modify

00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:08.770 align:middle line:90%
the elements that we have--

00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:11.770 align:middle line:84%
that we can collect
in the chemistry lab.

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, some
of the indications

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:19.360 align:middle line:84%
are that some of the isotopic
ratios have been changed.

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:22.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, that could only be done
by a very sophisticated lab.

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:27.160 align:middle line:84%
This is not something you
can do in your kitchen.

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And we have started
to look at this.

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And I've transferred
all of that including

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.890 align:middle line:84%
data that I got from
Professor Schrock

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:38.960 align:middle line:90%
to Dr. Nolan at Stanford.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And we're expanding
that collection

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:43.450 align:middle line:90%
and redoing the testing.

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:46.750 align:middle line:84%
Then we just published the
first scientific article

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:53.020 align:middle line:84%
vetted by a review board
published in Astronautics

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.360 align:middle line:90%
journal, international journal.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:59.530 align:middle line:84%
So we hope that that will open
the way to other scientists

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:01.360 align:middle line:90%
to submit data.

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:03.640 align:middle line:90%
Until now, there was a barrier.

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:06.400 align:middle line:84%
Most of the big
reviews in science

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:08.320 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to
publish anything that

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:11.480 align:middle line:84%
had to do with UFOs
because of the stigma.

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:12.910 align:middle line:90%
We have removed that stigma.

00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:17.650 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that the
UFO community enjoys about you

00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:21.760 align:middle line:84%
is their discussion about
Jacques Vallee knowing

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:26.170 align:middle line:84%
the secret stuff, and what does
he know and what is he going

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:28.150 align:middle line:90%
to possibly share with us?

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:32.210 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to ask
you right now is

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:36.320 align:middle line:84%
our government in
possession of either a crash

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:40.370 align:middle line:84%
retrieval or controlled
landing craft

00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:44.690 align:middle line:84%
that was made not
on planet Earth?

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:49.970 align:middle line:84%
>> We know-- it's not a secret
anymore that those things have

00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:51.230 align:middle line:90%
been retrieved.

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:55.010 align:middle line:84%
They've been retrieved all over
the world by special teams.

00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:57.890 align:middle line:84%
They've been taken
to the best labs.

00:33:57.890 --> 00:34:01.070 align:middle line:84%
Again, I respect the
need for secrecy,

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:03.920 align:middle line:84%
but there is a
point where secrecy

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.920 align:middle line:90%
becomes a thing for itself.

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.250 align:middle line:84%
That the small group
of men and women

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:12.620 align:middle line:84%
have access to
certain things, that

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:16.070 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean that they are
necessarily the ones most

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:18.320 align:middle line:90%
qualified to work on it.

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.360 align:middle line:84%
I think we're
getting to the point

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:24.260 align:middle line:84%
and it's, again,
to me a great day

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:28.280 align:middle line:84%
when Congress says open the
doors, open the windows,

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:29.840 align:middle line:90%
let us in.

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.889 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at what
you have there.

00:34:31.889 --> 00:34:35.719 align:middle line:84%
But that has to be done
in a way that's careful,

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:39.170 align:middle line:84%
that will involve the
scientific community.

00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:40.969 align:middle line:84%
If I was a betting
man, I wouldn't

00:34:40.969 --> 00:34:44.030 align:middle line:84%
bet that the secret
projects have any answers.

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:45.366 align:middle line:90%
>> Jacques, thank you so much.

00:34:45.366 --> 00:34:46.449 align:middle line:90%
What a great conversation.

00:34:46.449 --> 00:34:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:48.100 align:middle line:90%
Always a pleasure.

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:49.610 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm your host Jimmy Church.

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:51.770 align:middle line:90%
This is Into the Vortex.

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And along with Josh,
we'll see you next time.

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:59.000 align:middle line:90%
