Would you like to be able
to handle big life changes

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.970 align:middle line:90%
with more grace in your life?

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.580 align:middle line:84%
Often, big changes can be
very disruptive to our lives.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.330 align:middle line:84%
Leading to stress
and loss and anxiety.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.480 align:middle line:84%
But what if we could
learn to thrive on change?

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.480 align:middle line:10%
Well, this is at the
heart of the lessons

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.240 align:middle line:10%
that we now encounter in
our next steps of the hero's

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.160 align:middle line:10%
journey.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.190 align:middle line:10%
We're now in the ascending
stages of the hero's

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.840 align:middle line:10%
evolutionary journey.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And we're coming to a
time of real testing

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.240 align:middle line:84%
for the hero, when the
alchemical process becomes

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.140 align:middle line:90%
more intense.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.930 align:middle line:10%
And these next
several stages will

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.020 align:middle line:10%
reveal whether we've really
truly integrated the lessons

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.510 align:middle line:10%
from the previous steps
and where we still

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.290 align:middle line:10%
have our work to do.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.330 align:middle line:10%
And by the time we
emerge from this process,

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.330 align:middle line:10%
though, we'll be transformed
and much more in touch

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.760 align:middle line:10%
with our deeper
aspects of our soul.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.610 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we
meet the archetypes

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.220 align:middle line:10%
of Death and Temperance.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.720 align:middle line:10%
Death deals with all matters of
transformation and transition.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.400 align:middle line:10%
While Temperance is about
verification and balance.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.380 align:middle line:84%
These are important
stages of development

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.830 align:middle line:84%
in our search for understanding
the laws of the universe

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.770 align:middle line:90%
and achieving self-mastery.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.040 align:middle line:10%
Following from The Hanged
Man's self-sacrifice,

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.090 align:middle line:10%
the next archetype we meet on
the hero's journey is Death.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.380 align:middle line:10%
This key is obviously
about death of any kind,

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.450 align:middle line:10%
and its image shows
death's familiar face.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.280 align:middle line:90%


00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.080 align:middle line:84%
According to
Kabbalisitc tradition,

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.290 align:middle line:84%
what happens after you leave
the physical vehicle is actually

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.730 align:middle line:90%
better than what happens here.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.470 align:middle line:84%
So when a loved one dies, our
grief is more for our own loss,

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.389 align:middle line:90%
than it is for them.

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:12.540 align:middle line:84%
For they're really, now
more alive even than we are.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.928 align:middle line:84%
And that's why Death is also
called the Key of Deliverance.

00:02:16.928 --> 00:02:21.010 align:middle line:84%
Now most people's biggest
fear in life is facing death.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And this single fear
holds more people back

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.240 align:middle line:84%
from truly living than
you might realize.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.470 align:middle line:84%
Because truly living
requires taking risks.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Initiation is about
becoming what we call twice

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.930 align:middle line:90%
born within this lifetime.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.390 align:middle line:84%
Where we willingly
let our old life die.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Our old personality
dies in order

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.690 align:middle line:84%
for us to attain the
knowledge of our eternal self,

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.420 align:middle line:84%
and then begin a new
life from that awareness.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.500 align:middle line:84%
This is why Death is also
called the Great Initiator.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.910 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.190 align:middle line:90%
The body develops by renewal.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.270 align:middle line:84%
The cells of our body die daily,
but new ones are also made,

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.370 align:middle line:90%
and life continues.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And every night, our
consciousness goes to sleep.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.850 align:middle line:84%
But every morning,
it's revived, again.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.410 align:middle line:90%


00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.720 align:middle line:84%
So let's not make the
mistake of looking

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.650 align:middle line:84%
at death in just the
conventional and literal way.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.660 align:middle line:84%
Like it's an absolute
ending or something.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.410 align:middle line:84%
In Tarot, death signifies change
and transformation of any kind.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.150 align:middle line:10%
And like the
ouroboros serpent that

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.080 align:middle line:10%
bites its own tail, consuming
and renewing itself,

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.210 align:middle line:10%
each ending is a new beginning.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And the cycles of
change go on and on.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.460 align:middle line:90%


00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.960 align:middle line:84%
Now the key of Death is
ruled by the number 13.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.420 align:middle line:90%
Is that any big surprise?

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.910 align:middle line:84%
But contrary to
popular superstition,

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.020 align:middle line:84%
13 is not actually
an unlucky number.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.650 align:middle line:90%
13 is just one more than 12--

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.350 align:middle line:90%
the number of completion.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's a step beyond the
ending, into a new beginning.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.400 align:middle line:10%
13 is a powerful number in terms
of cycles of transformation.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.640 align:middle line:84%
For example, there's 13
lunar months within a year.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And when we add the 1
plus the 3, we get 4.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.160 align:middle line:10%
And this shows us
that this key is

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.649 align:middle line:10%
related to The
Magician, number one,

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:19.930 align:middle line:10%
to The Empress, number three.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.610 align:middle line:10%
And that results in The
Emperor, number four.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.190 align:middle line:90%


00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.990 align:middle line:84%
Now let's explore the imagery
and symbolism of the Death key.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.810 align:middle line:10%
We see a skeleton rider, clad
in a full suit of black armor.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.020 align:middle line:10%
And he rides in from the
West upon a white horse.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.690 align:middle line:10%
He carries a banner,
and this banner

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.010 align:middle line:10%
has the same two colors
of black and white in it.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.240 align:middle line:10%
The scene shows a king has
died, and his wife and child

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.950 align:middle line:10%
are on their knees.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.430 align:middle line:10%
The woman is struck with grief.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.550 align:middle line:10%
And the child holds
a bouquet of flowers.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.740 align:middle line:10%
There's also a
Hierophant, or a priest,

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.800 align:middle line:10%
standing and praying
over all of them.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.070 align:middle line:10%
But you can see that Death
is much larger and more

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.080 align:middle line:10%
powerful than them all.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.620 align:middle line:84%
When he appears, no one
is immune to the changes

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.360 align:middle line:90%
that he brings.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.250 align:middle line:84%
Now recall that in Tarot,
the male figures usually

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.590 align:middle line:84%
represent aspects of
our self-consciousness

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.320 align:middle line:90%
or our conscious mind.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, the female figures
represent aspects

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.050 align:middle line:90%
of the subconscious mind.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.930 align:middle line:84%
Children represent a
product of the masculine

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.840 align:middle line:90%
and the feminine in co-creation.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And the Hierophant
represents that High Priest

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.980 align:middle line:84%
of the mysteries, who
conducts the higher

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.050 align:middle line:84%
levels of initiations
and sacred rites.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.510 align:middle line:84%
But what does the
skeleton represent here?

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.940 align:middle line:10%
The skeleton actually
represents your true self.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.860 align:middle line:84%
It's the essential part of you
that is beyond your personality

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:52.860 align:middle line:90%
and body.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.790 align:middle line:84%
Now the skeleton is a great
symbol for our true self

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:00.250 align:middle line:84%
because it's the core structure
that the body is built upon.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.440 align:middle line:84%
The skeleton remains, even
after the worms of the Earth

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.520 align:middle line:90%
have consumed the flesh.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.060 align:middle line:84%
The skeleton is the
toughest part of our body.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.390 align:middle line:84%
Flesh may decay, but
the bones remain.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.850 align:middle line:84%
So the skeleton is
our eternal self

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.550 align:middle line:84%
that always remains,
even after the Earth has

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:19.525 align:middle line:90%
claimed our limbs.

00:06:19.525 --> 00:06:22.080 align:middle line:90%


00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.260 align:middle line:84%
This tells us that this
ominous-looking character

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.720 align:middle line:90%
of Death is actually, us.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.200 align:middle line:90%
It's our eternal self.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And in this form, our
true self is saying,

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.740 align:middle line:90%
it's time for change.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.250 align:middle line:84%
Now the black colors
that we see in this image

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.250 align:middle line:84%
relate to Saturn,
or Father Time,

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.430 align:middle line:84%
which is also related to
the principle of elimination

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.770 align:middle line:90%
and limitation.

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.320 align:middle line:84%
We all have things that
we want to and need

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.020 align:middle line:84%
to eliminate in our
lives, including

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.800 align:middle line:84%
emotional attachments, limiting
thoughts, and various worldly

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.420 align:middle line:90%
attachments.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.260 align:middle line:84%
So Death's role is to help
us to let go of those things,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:05.680 align:middle line:84%
and to let that which
no longer serves us die.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.590 align:middle line:84%
Now there are five
characters in this card--

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.690 align:middle line:84%
the dead king on the ground,
a priest or the Hierophant,

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:16.100 align:middle line:84%
a woman, a child,
and Death, himself.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And this alludes to
the power of the number

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.120 align:middle line:90%
five and its connection here.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Also, the banner
the Death carries

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.560 align:middle line:90%
has a five-petaled rose.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.440 align:middle line:84%
Now five, if you'll recall,
represents the quintessence,

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.230 align:middle line:84%
the fifth element,
the spirit of life,

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:34.890 align:middle line:84%
which is concealed
within the four elements.

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:38.310 align:middle line:10%
It is the source
of all living form.

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:41.730 align:middle line:10%
The white rose on the banner
appears only one other time

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:45.420 align:middle line:10%
in the whole of Tarot, which
is in The Fool's left hand

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:46.950 align:middle line:10%
at key zero.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:49.590 align:middle line:10%
Which represents that
super consciousness

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:51.810 align:middle line:10%
of our pure spirit.

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.970 align:middle line:10%
So in both these
keys, the white rose

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:57.700 align:middle line:10%
refers to the purification
of our desired nature.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:01.520 align:middle line:10%
It's a symbol of illumination.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.420 align:middle line:10%
Now, many might assume
that the sun that we

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.070 align:middle line:10%
see in the background
of this card

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.490 align:middle line:10%
is setting because they
consider death an ending.

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:11.290 align:middle line:10%
But in truth, the
mystery teachings

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:13.930 align:middle line:10%
say that this is a rising sun.

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:17.610 align:middle line:10%
It's rising on the
Eastern side of this card.

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:19.720 align:middle line:10%
As the Key of
Sunrise, therefore, it

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.700 align:middle line:10%
symbolizes rebirth.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.490 align:middle line:10%
And is a continuous
process of recreation,

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:28.330 align:middle line:10%
day by day, and with
each breath we take.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.640 align:middle line:84%
Now the rising sun
also symbolizes that we

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.250 align:middle line:90%
should look forward to the new.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.350 align:middle line:10%
Also notice in the
background of this card

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:38.260 align:middle line:10%
that there's the river or
the stream of consciousness.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.480 align:middle line:90%
That river of life.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.909 align:middle line:90%
And we can see a boat upon it.

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And the boat is sailing
towards the sun,

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:50.050 align:middle line:84%
to indicate the flow or the
direction of this river.

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:52.630 align:middle line:84%
Its flowing towards the sun,
which means its returning

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:54.700 align:middle line:90%
to the source of light.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Just like we are now,
on the ascension path

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:00.110 align:middle line:90%
back towards our source.

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And as you can see, some
things about this key

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:05.950 align:middle line:84%
are actually very positive
and happy, rather than sad.

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:08.860 align:middle line:90%
It's truly, an optimistic key.

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.650 align:middle line:84%
Now just remember,
the major character

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:17.450 align:middle line:84%
depicted as Death in this
key is your essential self.

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:20.070 align:middle line:84%
Now what is Death
trying to teach us here?

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:22.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, this key involves all
matters of transformation,

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.520 align:middle line:90%
change, and movement.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.680 align:middle line:90%
We actually thrive on change.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And the good things that
we wish for in our life

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.970 align:middle line:90%
depends on change.

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:33.460 align:middle line:84%
It teaches us that
perpetual change

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.850 align:middle line:90%
is the root of everything.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And on this path, there
are many kinds of death.

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:41.470 align:middle line:84%
One way or another,
when death appears,

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.020 align:middle line:84%
we must be willing to
surrender to the process

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:46.250 align:middle line:90%
of transformation.

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Fighting our changes will only
make things more difficult.

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:53.330 align:middle line:84%
So the main lesson is
to not resist change.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And the transformation
implied here involves

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:58.150 align:middle line:90%
both a death and a rebirth.

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:01.820 align:middle line:84%
It requires a willingness to
let go of old ways of being,

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.790 align:middle line:84%
as well as to be open
to new experiences.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:06.730 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:08.970 align:middle line:84%
Now what are some other
important correspondences

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:10.430 align:middle line:90%
of death?

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:13.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, his secret
title or esoteric name

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:16.950 align:middle line:84%
is the child of the
great transformers

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:20.300 align:middle line:84%
and the lord of
the gates of death.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.160 align:middle line:84%
The element associated
here is water,

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.760 align:middle line:84%
which relates to the
astrological correspondence,

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.340 align:middle line:90%
which is Scorpio.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.150 align:middle line:84%
So death is ruled by the sign of
Scorpio, which is a fixed water

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:34.040 align:middle line:90%
sign in the Zodiac.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And water gives us
the feelings that

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:42.320 align:middle line:84%
can range from pure feelings,
to intense, to a spiritual

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.870 align:middle line:90%
and nature-type of feeling.

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And in matters of
love, water also

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.990 align:middle line:84%
seeks soulmate-type
relationships

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:51.270 align:middle line:84%
that are rather
intense and spiritual.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:52.860 align:middle line:84%
So this is the kind
of relationship

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.440 align:middle line:90%
that Scorpios tend to like.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.500 align:middle line:84%
Now in astrology, Scorpio
rules the Eighth House

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.440 align:middle line:84%
of the Horoscope, which
is the House of Death.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's co-ruled by Mars,
which is related to the Tower

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.340 align:middle line:84%
and Pluto, which is related
to judgment, which we'll

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:11.730 align:middle line:90%
be exploring down the line.

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:15.840 align:middle line:84%
Scorpio's introspective nature
allows people to honestly look

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.250 align:middle line:90%
within themselves.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:20.340 align:middle line:84%
To find out what needs to
be transformed or healed,

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:24.393 align:middle line:84%
and then emerge renewed
and rejuvenated.

00:11:24.393 --> 00:11:26.560 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting about
Scorpio is that it actually

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:30.790 align:middle line:84%
has three symbols, which
represent three different types

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:33.520 align:middle line:90%
or stages of transformation.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.390 align:middle line:84%
There's the scorpion, which
most people think of as Scorpio.

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And this represents the parts
of ourselves that might lash out

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:45.400 align:middle line:84%
and sting during times of change
and letting go because it feels

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.450 align:middle line:90%
threatened.

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:49.180 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes a scorpion
actually stings itself, more

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:51.730 align:middle line:90%
than anyone else.

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Second symbol is the
snake, which reminds us

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.080 align:middle line:84%
that in order to
transform, we have

00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:03.220 align:middle line:84%
to shed our old skin in order
to emerge into a new identity.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And the third
symbol is the eagle

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:07.450 align:middle line:90%
and/or sometimes the phoenix.

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And this reflects the overall
vision and perspective

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:11.320 align:middle line:90%
that's needed--

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.680 align:middle line:84%
that higher perspective
that's needed to become more

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.770 align:middle line:90%
of who we truly are.

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:18.440 align:middle line:90%


00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.180 align:middle line:84%
Some other key words
that are associated

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:24.830 align:middle line:84%
with death and Scorpio include
transformation, change,

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:31.238 align:middle line:84%
emergence, release, transition,
endings, new beginnings.

00:12:31.238 --> 00:12:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And the strengths
and virtues that we

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:35.420 align:middle line:84%
can achieve in
working with this key

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:41.290 align:middle line:84%
include transcendence,
liberation, acceptance.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:44.360 align:middle line:84%
Now these strengths are the more
pure and balanced expressions

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.540 align:middle line:84%
of this key, but if they
get into any distortions

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.370 align:middle line:84%
of too much or too
little, it leads

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:51.410 align:middle line:90%
to weaknesses and imbalances.

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:53.750 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:55.250 align:middle line:84%
So some of the
things to watch out

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:59.660 align:middle line:84%
for in the shadow side of death
include a resistance or fear

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:00.830 align:middle line:90%
of change.

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:03.140 align:middle line:90%
Being unwilling to move on.

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:06.190 align:middle line:84%
An inability to
understand others.

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And allowing fear to control
you or keep you stuck.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.200 align:middle line:84%
Any kind of
stagnation, as well as

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:16.030 align:middle line:84%
an unwillingness to experience
and express our emotional pain.

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:18.940 align:middle line:90%


00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:22.180 align:middle line:84%
Now think of times when
you've encountered the Death

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.160 align:middle line:90%
archetype in your life.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.350 align:middle line:84%
In a very literal way,
any time that you've

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:28.810 align:middle line:84%
had to deal with the
death of a loved one,

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:31.300 align:middle line:90%
this archetype was present.

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:32.890 align:middle line:84%
But this could
also have shown up

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:35.770 align:middle line:84%
through any type of
ending and new beginning,

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:39.670 align:middle line:84%
such as a divorce or
breakup of a relationship.

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:44.023 align:middle line:84%
Or a job loss, which then
set you on a new surge.

00:13:44.023 --> 00:13:45.940 align:middle line:84%
Or it could have been
the death of an old part

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:50.290 align:middle line:84%
of your own personality or way
of life that no longer served.

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:53.680 align:middle line:84%
In all these endings, we'll
experience a sense of loss

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.840 align:middle line:90%
and grief, and that's natural.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's Death who helps us
through this grieving process.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.200 align:middle line:84%
So long as we allow
ourselves to actually feel

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.770 align:middle line:90%
these deep emotions.

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:06.940 align:middle line:84%
Now anytime you've
committed yourself

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:09.830 align:middle line:84%
to changing some
aspect of your life,

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:12.910 align:middle line:84%
Death was there, especially
when it comes to letting go

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:14.990 align:middle line:90%
and moving forward.

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:17.170 align:middle line:84%
Or you may have had times
when you helped others

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:22.780 align:middle line:84%
during a time of change in their
life or some kind of a loss.

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:25.260 align:middle line:84%
The more you come to
recognize Death in your life,

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.040 align:middle line:84%
the more it will
also help you connect

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.440 align:middle line:84%
with one of your parallel
lives where Death

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.080 align:middle line:90%
is the dominant archetype.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.890 align:middle line:84%
So examples might include a
hospice and a care worker,

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:39.100 align:middle line:84%
who support people through
their process of transition

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:40.210 align:middle line:90%
into the afterlife.

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:44.840 align:middle line:90%


00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.050 align:middle line:84%
But it's also the
midwives, the nurses,

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:52.090 align:middle line:84%
and doctors who play key roles
in the birth process of babies.

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:53.980 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps, it might
be various types

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.770 align:middle line:84%
of counselors who specialize
in assisting people

00:14:56.770 --> 00:15:01.420 align:middle line:84%
with handling the loss of
loved ones or through divorce

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.276 align:middle line:90%
or any kind of physical death.

00:15:03.276 --> 00:15:04.076 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:04.076 --> 00:15:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And these are often very loving
and compassionate people,

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:12.040 align:middle line:84%
with this capacity to experience
life and relationships very

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.350 align:middle line:90%
deeply.

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:16.660 align:middle line:84%
They've learned that
both death and birth are

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.540 align:middle line:84%
very sacred moments,
when the veils

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:23.500 align:middle line:84%
between the physical and
the spiritual are very thin.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.330 align:middle line:84%
So these people
tend to recognize

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.310 align:middle line:90%
the existence of spirit.

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:29.170 align:middle line:90%
They're very empathic.

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:32.290 align:middle line:10%
And they feel, how special
it is to hold space

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:36.145 align:middle line:10%
for such transitions.

00:15:36.145 --> 00:15:38.990 align:middle line:10%
And by working with Death
and invoking its energies

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:42.020 align:middle line:10%
into your life, you, too,
can awaken your capacity

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:46.070 align:middle line:10%
to understand the mysteries
of birth, life, and death.

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And to more
gracefully, transform.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:51.180 align:middle line:90%


00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.790 align:middle line:10%
As we move beyond
the lessons of Death,

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:55.680 align:middle line:10%
our next step on
the hero's journey

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.930 align:middle line:10%
brings us to the Temperance key.

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:02.160 align:middle line:10%
Now this is where we learn
to thrive on the changes that

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.440 align:middle line:10%
have been brought on by Death.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:07.860 align:middle line:10%
And it brings us a
renewed sense of purpose.

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:12.270 align:middle line:84%
Here, we meet one of the
major alchemists of the deck.

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:16.440 align:middle line:84%
Temperance means literally,
tempering or modifying,

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:20.170 align:middle line:90%
which relates to adaptation.

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Now to adapt is to
adjust, to evolve

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.080 align:middle line:84%
in a way that really
leads towards a greater

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.780 align:middle line:90%
equilibrium and balance.

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And temperance is a process
of creative transformation.

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:36.520 align:middle line:84%
Now in times when metalworking
was one of the ancient arts

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.820 align:middle line:84%
and sciences of alchemy,
this process of tempering

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.490 align:middle line:84%
involved heating the
metal up in the fire

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:45.400 align:middle line:84%
until it became
pliable and soft.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.730 align:middle line:84%
Then taking it out,
hammering it into shape,

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:52.150 align:middle line:84%
and then dowsing it in the
water to re-solidify it.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And then repeating this
cycle as many times as

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:58.690 align:middle line:84%
is needed, until the metal
became strong and unbreakable.

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:01.490 align:middle line:90%


00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Now in metalworking,
we're often trying

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.510 align:middle line:84%
to get to different
types of metal

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:08.510 align:middle line:84%
to blend together
into an amalgam.

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
same kind of thing

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.650 align:middle line:84%
that temperance will
do in our lives.

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:15.980 align:middle line:84%
It's trying to merge our
feminine and our masculine

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:18.890 align:middle line:84%
or our subconscious
and our conscious sides

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:22.430 align:middle line:84%
into one balanced
and integrated whole.

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And in the alchemical
process, temperance

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:28.310 align:middle line:84%
brings us to the stage
known as conjunction.

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:31.520 align:middle line:84%
It's a rejoining of
the separate essences

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.080 align:middle line:90%
that have now been purified.

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And we're bringing them back
now into a harmonious mixture.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.630 align:middle line:10%
This card teaches us that when
we moderate our indulgences,

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:44.960 align:middle line:10%
whether they're physical,
emotional, or spiritual,

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.740 align:middle line:10%
we'll find the equilibrium
and the balance at some point.

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:52.115 align:middle line:84%
So this is all about moderation
and finding that balance.

00:17:52.115 --> 00:17:55.110 align:middle line:90%


00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:56.930 align:middle line:84%
Now Temperance is
ruled by the number

00:17:56.930 --> 00:18:00.710 align:middle line:90%
14, which represents challenge.

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:02.690 align:middle line:10%
It's a combination
of the number one

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:04.190 align:middle line:10%
and the number
four, which relate

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:08.090 align:middle line:10%
to the ideas of The Magician
and The Emperor, both of which

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:11.720 align:middle line:10%
are masculine,
action-oriented keys that work

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:14.280 align:middle line:10%
with conscious use of will.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Now 14 is the outer expression
or practical application

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:20.210 align:middle line:90%
of the essence of five.

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:24.458 align:middle line:10%
So Temperance is an outer
expression of the Hierophant.

00:18:24.458 --> 00:18:25.700 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:29.720 align:middle line:10%
Let's now explore some of the
imagery and symbolism embedded

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.820 align:middle line:10%
within this card.

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:35.330 align:middle line:10%
We see an angelic
presence of being,

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:37.850 align:middle line:10%
in a white robe
with red wings, who

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:40.520 align:middle line:10%
stands with one foot
in a pool of water

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:43.520 align:middle line:10%
and the other foot
on solid rock.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.280 align:middle line:10%
He's carefully mixing
liquid essences

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:49.100 align:middle line:10%
between two golden challis.

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And their union creates
the elixir of life.

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:56.300 align:middle line:10%
There is a path that leads
from this pool of water

00:18:56.300 --> 00:19:00.020 align:middle line:10%
off to a distant mountain, where
we see a shining crown that

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:02.880 align:middle line:10%
hovers above the mountains.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.630 align:middle line:84%
Now this being is
Archangel Michael,

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:09.350 align:middle line:84%
or we actually pronounce
his name Michael.

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:12.290 align:middle line:84%
His name literally means
the likeness of God

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:14.690 align:middle line:90%
or that which is like God.

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:18.230 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that he shows us the
light of our own divinity

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:19.490 align:middle line:90%
within.

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:21.620 align:middle line:84%
He is like a holy
guardian angel,

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:27.090 align:middle line:84%
who shows us a vision of our
true self that we aspire to be.

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:29.840 align:middle line:10%
Now the reason that we know
that this is Archangel Michael

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:33.210 align:middle line:10%
is because of the upright
triangle on his chest

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:36.710 align:middle line:10%
which represents fire,
the disk on his forehead

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:40.130 align:middle line:10%
which is a symbol of the
sun, and the red wings which

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:43.530 align:middle line:10%
are also an element of fire.

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:46.400 align:middle line:10%
Now of the four
cardinal angels, Michael

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:50.330 align:middle line:10%
relates to fire and the
direction of the South, as well

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:53.480 align:middle line:10%
as that noonday summer sun.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:58.070 align:middle line:84%
So Michael is the fire
that enlivens, purifies,

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:00.440 align:middle line:90%
and transforms our soul.

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:05.840 align:middle line:84%
He dispels ignorance,
distortion, and immaturity.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.820 align:middle line:10%
Now if we look back
to this pool of water

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:11.190 align:middle line:10%
that he has one of his feet
in, this water, remember,

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:12.920 align:middle line:10%
comes from the stream
of consciousness

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.510 align:middle line:10%
that originated in The
High Priestess card.

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's a symbol of
that cosmic mind stuff.

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:21.710 align:middle line:10%
So Michael's right
foot is standing

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:25.160 align:middle line:10%
in these waters of life,
while his left foot stands

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.850 align:middle line:10%
on a rock, which is a symbol
of stability and concrete

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:30.530 align:middle line:10%
manifestation.

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:32.720 align:middle line:84%
The Earth plane
is the outer world

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.840 align:middle line:84%
of expression and
experience, while the waters

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.880 align:middle line:84%
are the inner planes
of consciousness.

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:42.560 align:middle line:84%
So what this is showing us
is that to achieve balance,

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:46.790 align:middle line:84%
we should have one foot in
heaven and the other on Earth.

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:49.850 align:middle line:84%
Also, it suggests that
a spiritual foundation

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:54.050 align:middle line:84%
or practice really supports
our daily physical life.

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, having a
strong physical foundation

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:58.860 align:middle line:90%
supports our spiritual growth.

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:01.860 align:middle line:90%
So we need both.

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:06.170 align:middle line:10%
Now notice also, how the path
rises over the rolling hills.

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:09.440 align:middle line:10%
This hints at the
principle of vibration.

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.600 align:middle line:10%
And this path leads
to the mountains

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.540 align:middle line:10%
of understanding and wisdom.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And it suggests that the
path's end is within reach.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.740 align:middle line:90%
We can see it right now.

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:21.890 align:middle line:84%
And that shining
crown is a symbol

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:24.480 align:middle line:84%
of Katara at the top
of the Tree of Life.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:29.560 align:middle line:10%
And that shows us the light
at the end of the tunnel.

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:32.610 align:middle line:84%
So what's this key of
Temperance trying to show us?

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:34.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, Temperance
wants us to align

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:39.250 align:middle line:84%
with the energies of beauty,
harmony, and moderation.

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:41.470 align:middle line:84%
It holds the key
to how to safely

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:44.290 align:middle line:84%
use higher levels of
consciousness, as well.

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Now rising up to a higher level
of consciousness too quickly

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:51.140 align:middle line:84%
can bring a rapid onset
of psychic awareness,

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:54.010 align:middle line:84%
which actually
destabilizes us if we

00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:57.340 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to do with
it or how to understand what

00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:59.550 align:middle line:90%
it is we're seeing and sensing.

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:03.160 align:middle line:84%
So temperance is showing us not
to forsake our physical life

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.740 align:middle line:84%
foundation in pursuit
of spiritual awareness.

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:09.820 align:middle line:84%
We must keep one foot
firmly grounded in Earth.

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:12.700 align:middle line:84%
Balancing the spiritual
and physical sides of life

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:16.180 align:middle line:84%
is essential for this
attainment process.

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And only through this kind
of balance equilibrium

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:20.950 align:middle line:84%
can we discover our
true purpose in life

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:24.230 align:middle line:84%
and really fulfill
our potential.

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Now let's go through some other
correspondences of Temperance.

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:30.040 align:middle line:84%
It's secret name
or esoteric title

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:32.470 align:middle line:84%
is the daughter
of the reconcilers

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:35.760 align:middle line:90%
and the bringer forth of life.

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:38.830 align:middle line:84%
The element here
is immutable fire,

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:41.470 align:middle line:84%
which corresponds with
the astrological sign

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:43.540 align:middle line:90%
of Sagittarius.

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:46.150 align:middle line:84%
It's all this
introspection and healing

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:48.290 align:middle line:84%
that we had from
the time of Scorpio

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:52.110 align:middle line:84%
can leave us feeling a bit
subdued and melancholy.

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
Sagittarius comes in.

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:55.520 align:middle line:90%
It wants to play.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:59.860 align:middle line:84%
Now Sagittarians are full
of optimism, joviality,

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:03.280 align:middle line:84%
and they are the
life of the party.

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.700 align:middle line:84%
So Sagittarius also has a
philosophical side, though.

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:10.940 align:middle line:84%
It seeks answers to deep,
meaningful, spiritual,

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:14.470 align:middle line:84%
religious, or esoteric
questions that the philosophers

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:17.060 align:middle line:90%
throughout the ages have posed.

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And because of this,
Sagittarius has

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:21.130 align:middle line:90%
become wise and understanding.

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And they're usually able
to give very good advice.

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:27.490 align:middle line:84%
Sagittarius rules
the Ninth House

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:31.540 align:middle line:84%
of journeys and philosophy,
which is about experience

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:33.580 align:middle line:90%
through expansion.

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's also ruled
by the planet Jupiter.

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:39.730 align:middle line:84%
Now Sagittarians are
usually very charismatic,

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:42.220 align:middle line:84%
and they are artisans
of creating the image

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:45.310 align:middle line:84%
that they want the world
to see, whether that's

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:48.820 align:middle line:90%
through words or appearances.

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And as we work with
Temperance, some

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:52.930 align:middle line:84%
of the strengths and virtues
that it awakens in us

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:56.860 align:middle line:90%
can be productivity, endurance.

00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:00.530 align:middle line:90%
And always remember, moderation.

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:03.430 align:middle line:84%
Now these strengths are the
pure and balanced expression

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:05.290 align:middle line:90%
of Temperance.

00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:07.360 align:middle line:84%
But if we get into
distortions where it's either

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:10.960 align:middle line:84%
too much or not enough, then
we fall into the weaknesses

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.800 align:middle line:90%
and the shadow side.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.740 align:middle line:84%
So some of those
shadows that we need

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:16.510 align:middle line:84%
to watch out for
here with Temperance

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:21.820 align:middle line:84%
include self-doubt,
falling into temptation,

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:25.360 align:middle line:84%
being irresponsible,
being overly indulgent

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:29.290 align:middle line:84%
and getting into
addictions, exaggeration,

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:32.770 align:middle line:90%
and narrow-sightedness.

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:36.345 align:middle line:84%
So how does Temperance
show up in your life?

00:24:36.345 --> 00:24:37.720 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever been
through a time

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:40.760 align:middle line:84%
where you felt like you were
being put through the wringer?

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:44.980 align:middle line:84%
Or burned by the fire, doused
in the water, hammered by life?

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, these were likely
tempering life lessons for you

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.560 align:middle line:84%
that were meant
to help you mature

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:53.080 align:middle line:90%
and become more resilient.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:56.920 align:middle line:84%
While not easy, these
lessons teach us patience.

00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:01.000 align:middle line:84%
They teach us steadfastness
and determination.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.960 align:middle line:84%
They're necessary developmental
phases for our inner growth.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:08.680 align:middle line:84%
Initiations were once a part
of every shamanic society.

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And such challenges
that tempered us

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:13.750 align:middle line:84%
were understood as
rites of passage.

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:17.230 align:middle line:84%
But today, unfortunately, this
understanding is less common.

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And too many people tend to see
themselves as victims of life,

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.200 align:middle line:84%
rather than rising
to the challenges

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.960 align:middle line:84%
that they're presented with
and using them as opportunities

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.860 align:middle line:90%
to become stronger.

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:31.150 align:middle line:84%
So when you need some help
with meeting challenges,

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:33.250 align:middle line:84%
call on Temperance
to support you.

00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:36.505 align:middle line:90%


00:25:36.505 --> 00:25:38.380 align:middle line:10%
Now the more you come
to recognize Temperance

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:40.360 align:middle line:10%
in your life here
and now, the more

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:43.150 align:middle line:10%
it will also connect you with
one of your parallel lives,

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:46.960 align:middle line:10%
where Temperance is
the dominant archetype.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.050 align:middle line:84%
What might our parallel life
look like under the archetype

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:51.630 align:middle line:90%
of Temperance?

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Well people under the
influence of Temperance

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:57.430 align:middle line:84%
have a natural ability to work
with the principles of alchemy

00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:58.870 align:middle line:90%
in life.

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:01.150 align:middle line:84%
They're constantly
learning how two or more

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:03.850 align:middle line:84%
is always better
than one, so long

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:08.020 align:middle line:84%
as they can establish the right
synergy amongst the parts.

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:13.510 align:middle line:84%
Whether these parts are people,
ingredients for art, ideas,

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:16.080 align:middle line:90%
or scientific disciplines.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:19.510 align:middle line:84%
Now as a quintessential
example, think of someone

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:21.820 align:middle line:90%
like Leonardo da Vinci.

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.930 align:middle line:84%
As one of the greatest
minds of all times,

00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:25.660 align:middle line:84%
he's an excellent
example of both

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:29.410 align:middle line:84%
the creative and alchemical
expressions of Temperance.

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:32.500 align:middle line:84%
Da Vinci was the
original Renaissance man,

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:34.370 align:middle line:90%
blending art and science.

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:37.600 align:middle line:84%
He was a painter, a sculptor,
an engineer, an inventor,

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.270 align:middle line:90%
and a scientist.

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And Temperance often
expresses itself

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:44.320 align:middle line:84%
through artists who are
practitioners of what

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:47.470 align:middle line:90%
we might call creative alchemy.

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:52.270 align:middle line:10%
Or they might also be a maverick
or a well-connected networker,

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:55.780 align:middle line:10%
who's mastered the art
of relationship alchemy.

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And they love to entertain
guests, to tell stories,

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:02.420 align:middle line:84%
and to sell the ideas
they believe in.

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:04.120 align:middle line:84%
They also love
making new friends

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:06.460 align:middle line:84%
and connecting
people together where

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:07.855 align:middle line:90%
they see potential synergy.

00:27:07.855 --> 00:27:10.720 align:middle line:90%


00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.840 align:middle line:84%
Now by working with Temperance
and invoking its energies

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:16.810 align:middle line:84%
into your life, you, too,
can awaken your ability

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:18.280 align:middle line:90%
to thrive on change.

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:23.760 align:middle line:90%


00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.220 align:middle line:84%
Join me, again, as
we explore further

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:28.470 align:middle line:84%
into the 22 archetypes
of Tarot, and how

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:32.760 align:middle line:84%
they can help us to make our
big shift in consciousness.

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:34.290 align:middle line:10%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard.

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:36.540 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for exploring
the mysteries of Tarot

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:38.340 align:middle line:10%
and our
multi-dimensionality with me

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:42.020 align:middle line:10%
in this episode of
"Mystery Teachings."

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:52.000 align:middle line:90%
