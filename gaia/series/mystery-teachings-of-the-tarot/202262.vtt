>> I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard, and
this is "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.490 align:middle line:10%
When we're in the darkness,
how do we find the light?

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.420 align:middle line:10%
Well, the keys to this
are holding onto hope

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.250 align:middle line:10%
and connecting to
the light within

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.680 align:middle line:10%
to guide us out of the darkness
and into the light of day.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.210 align:middle line:84%
Our next steps on
the hero's journey

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.520 align:middle line:84%
help us to find
this light, as we

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.180 align:middle line:84%
begin to now see the light
at the end of the tunnel.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.890 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we
take a deeper dive

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.890 align:middle line:10%
into the archetypes of
the star and the moon.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.360 align:middle line:10%
These are the
archetypal principles

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.020 align:middle line:10%
of revelation and organization.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.300 align:middle line:84%
The star is a
symbol of unveiling.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.000 align:middle line:84%
She actually brings us a
disclosure and discovery

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.090 align:middle line:84%
of our connection to
the greater cosmos,

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.170 align:middle line:84%
while the moon represents
evolution at a physical level,

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.080 align:middle line:84%
as well as within
our unconscious,

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.720 align:middle line:84%
where ourselves, our DNA, and
our mind actually reorganize.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.040 align:middle line:84%
This is so that we may
integrate the magical body

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.860 align:middle line:84%
that we've been building, and
bring it into the physical.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.940 align:middle line:84%
This prepares us to then more
fully embody our true self

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.340 align:middle line:90%
in this life.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.710 align:middle line:84%
We're in the final stretch
of this journey that moves us

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.960 align:middle line:84%
through the last three
stages of alchemy,

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.950 align:middle line:84%
which are fermentation,
distillation, and coagulation.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.500 align:middle line:84%
These stages refine
our soul and bring us

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.840 align:middle line:90%
to spiritual attainment.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.760 align:middle line:84%
These are essential
stages, as we

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.100 align:middle line:84%
prepare for the
culmination of this journey

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.230 align:middle line:84%
towards self-actualization
and mastery.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.680 align:middle line:90%


00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.220 align:middle line:84%
Our next step on the hero's
journey brings us to the star.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.770 align:middle line:10%
Now, if we were to consider
the tower as the birth

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.130 align:middle line:10%
canal of the rebirthing
process we've been in,

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.680 align:middle line:10%
the star is the new
self that is born.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.480 align:middle line:10%


00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.304 align:middle line:10%
And like a child, she
comes naked to the world.

00:02:05.304 --> 00:02:06.590 align:middle line:90%
[BABY YAWNING]

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And in her purity, she provides
us guidance, hope, and optimism

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.060 align:middle line:84%
after the cataclysmic events
of the devil in the tower.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.460 align:middle line:84%
The grace that's offered
here is that when

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.070 align:middle line:84%
we submit to the
divine, it really

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.000 align:middle line:84%
helps us to pierce the darkness,
and it shines light upon us.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.700 align:middle line:84%
So the star is the
light of hope helping

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.520 align:middle line:84%
us to come out of the
darkness and bring us all

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.650 align:middle line:90%
the way through that process.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.230 align:middle line:84%
We're still in the
fermentation stage here,

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.530 align:middle line:84%
but at least now
there's more light.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And this gives us
the strength that we

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.240 align:middle line:84%
need to recreate our
foundation and move forward

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.810 align:middle line:90%
with our journey.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.060 align:middle line:84%
So the star marks the end of the
fermentation stage of alchemy,

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.540 align:middle line:84%
and she is bringing us
this revelation of light.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, here the light is
just a glimmer of hope

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.260 align:middle line:84%
that we're now emerging from
that dark night of the soul,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.130 align:middle line:84%
and that our situation
is improving.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, the numerology of
a star is the number 17,

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.750 align:middle line:84%
and 17 represents harmony,
spirituality, love, and peace,

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.480 align:middle line:84%
and it brings us the ability to
conquer failed relationships.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.190 align:middle line:84%
1 and 7 form this
number, showing us

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.980 align:middle line:84%
that it has a lot to do with
the self-consciousness, which

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.010 align:middle line:84%
is represented by the
magician, or number 1,

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.900 align:middle line:84%
as well as being
receptive to divine

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.930 align:middle line:84%
will, which is what we see
with number 7 and the chariot.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And the number 7 is also
about victory and achievement.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.690 align:middle line:10%
Now, in addition, when
we add the 1 plus the 0

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.180 align:middle line:10%
we get 8, which brings
us to the strength key.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.210 align:middle line:10%
Now, recall that
the strength key

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.880 align:middle line:10%
was about personal
trials that test

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.160 align:middle line:10%
our ability to tame
our animal nature

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.890 align:middle line:10%
and find harmony
within ourselves,

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.590 align:middle line:10%
while the star is, therefore,
the same woman that we see

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.190 align:middle line:10%
in strength, only now she's
emerging from her trial

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.390 align:middle line:10%
and has successfully learned
how to harmonize polarities.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at the imagery
and symbolism of this card.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, as we look at the
star, we see a naked woman

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.490 align:middle line:90%
kneeling over a pool.

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.550 align:middle line:10%
And she's pouring out
water from two pitchers.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.740 align:middle line:10%
One of them is
poured into the pool,

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.589 align:middle line:10%
while the other is
poured onto the land.

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:25.120 align:middle line:84%
Her foot seems as if it's
standing on or above the water,

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.230 align:middle line:84%
while her left knee is
supported by solid Earth.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.250 align:middle line:10%
Now, in the night sky
is lit by eight stars,

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.860 align:middle line:10%
and they're all
eight-pointed stars.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.860 align:middle line:10%
And in the midst of them
is a large central star,

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.840 align:middle line:10%
which hovers right
above her head.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the background,
we see also a tree

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.470 align:middle line:90%
and a red bird upon it.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.360 align:middle line:10%
And all of this is perched
up on a hill behind her.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.070 align:middle line:10%
And then off in the distance,
we see the mountain of the self.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, this large central
star that is yellow,

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.050 align:middle line:90%
it's radiating cosmic energy.

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And this light comes
from a distant sun

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.400 align:middle line:84%
somewhere beyond
our solar system.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.750 align:middle line:84%
It's symbolic of life power,
which is energizing principle

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.580 align:middle line:90%
of the entire universe.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.580 align:middle line:84%
It's the quintessence
of the universe.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And this light is sent to us
from the source through what we

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.040 align:middle line:84%
call the great
central sun, which

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.750 align:middle line:90%
this large star represents.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And then from
there, it flows out

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.070 align:middle line:84%
to the various stars,
the various galaxies.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.020 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, it comes
to us here on Earth

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.540 align:middle line:90%
by way of those other stars.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.170 align:middle line:84%
So the essential power
behind this energy

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.810 align:middle line:84%
that's transmitted
to us from the stars

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.350 align:middle line:84%
originates in the
source or in the spirit.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And this tells us that our link
to connecting back to spirit

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.600 align:middle line:84%
also involves connecting to the
galaxy, the stars, which are

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.681 align:middle line:90%
the transmitters of this light.

00:05:55.681 --> 00:05:58.750 align:middle line:10%
So this eight-pointed
star and its energy

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.200 align:middle line:10%
is also related to the
wheel of fortune in key 10,

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.870 align:middle line:10%
which has eight spokes.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.300 align:middle line:10%
It also relates to
the spirit wheel

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.060 align:middle line:10%
that we see embroidered
on the fool's tunic.

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:12.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, around that
central star, we

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.160 align:middle line:84%
see seven other smaller
stars that share

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.050 align:middle line:90%
in this cosmic energy.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.930 align:middle line:84%
But these refer now to
the seven ancient planets,

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.380 align:middle line:84%
or what we call the
fixed stars of astrology.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.620 align:middle line:84%
They also, though, relate
to the seven interior stars,

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.230 align:middle line:90%
which we call our chakras.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And this hints that working
with the opening of our chakras

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.980 align:middle line:84%
through practices like
breath work and visualization

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.830 align:middle line:84%
and meditation really
helps us to connect

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.570 align:middle line:84%
with this radiant cosmic energy
that also flows inside of us.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's important
that we do this gently

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.930 align:middle line:84%
and in a balanced
and controlled way.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.670 align:middle line:10%
Now, all seven of these
stars are energized

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.725 align:middle line:10%
by that main central star.

00:06:53.725 --> 00:06:56.920 align:middle line:90%


00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:01.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, since the number eight also
relates to the infinity sign,

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:04.810 align:middle line:84%
these eight stars represent
infinite possibilities

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.510 align:middle line:84%
that appear after
the tower has fallen.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.400 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole world
of possibilities

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.910 align:middle line:84%
now available to us of
what we're going to create.

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:14.740 align:middle line:84%
The naked woman
shown in this card

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.050 align:middle line:84%
is the embodiment
of the goddess.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:21.250 align:middle line:10%
She is nature herself,
who is now unveiled.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.410 align:middle line:10%
Now, in different
ways, she corresponds

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:27.490 align:middle line:10%
to the high priestess,
the empress, and strength.

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:29.710 align:middle line:10%
She's also the
Egyptian goddess, Isis,

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.215 align:middle line:10%
but she's now Isis unveiled.

00:07:32.215 --> 00:07:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And this shows us
that the cosmic mind

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:37.180 align:middle line:84%
stuff that creates
all matter and now

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:41.140 align:middle line:84%
pours through the vessels of
our purified consciousness

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.890 align:middle line:90%
into what we want to create.

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:46.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, images of
nakedness are symbolic

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:48.790 align:middle line:84%
of what we would say
the naked truth, which

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:51.760 align:middle line:90%
is stripped of our projections.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.300 align:middle line:84%
True reality is now laid
bare and revealed to us.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.300 align:middle line:90%
There is no more obscurity.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, from the star's
body position,

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.070 align:middle line:84%
we see that the Earth
supports her weight,

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:07.860 align:middle line:84%
but she's also balancing
herself by the water.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:11.260 align:middle line:10%
And yet, her foot hovers
or is just above the water.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.110 align:middle line:10%
And this is different from what
we see in the temperance key,

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:17.260 align:middle line:10%
where the angel's
foot is in the water.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.070 align:middle line:10%
Now, why does temperance
have his foot in the water,

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:24.090 align:middle line:10%
while the star has
her foot on the water?

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:27.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, temperance is dealing
with polarities still.

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:30.240 align:middle line:84%
He's actively mixing
them together.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.600 align:middle line:10%
The star's resting most of her
weight on the physical Earth,

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.120 align:middle line:10%
but she's using the
water which represents

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:39.799 align:middle line:10%
the inner life for balance.

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:44.110 align:middle line:84%
This suggests that the
inner can explain the outer,

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:48.190 align:middle line:84%
and we connect with our outer
life through meditation.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:50.440 align:middle line:84%
So we need to meditate
in order to really

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.170 align:middle line:84%
figure out what's
going on, or to make

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:55.420 align:middle line:90%
sense of our outer life.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:09:00.220 align:middle line:84%
So meditation is a key
activity in the star card.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.830 align:middle line:84%
The water being poured
out of the pitchers

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:06.220 align:middle line:84%
represents how we use
our consciousness.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And there's two
pitchers, so this

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.150 align:middle line:84%
means that there's two
ways that we can direct

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.550 align:middle line:90%
the flow of consciousness--

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:15.190 align:middle line:84%
either towards the inner,
which is pouring the water

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:17.890 align:middle line:84%
into the pool, or
towards the outer, which

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:19.660 align:middle line:90%
is pouring it onto the land.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.970 align:middle line:84%
This is the same as saying,
we can direct our attention

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:26.040 align:middle line:84%
towards spirits or towards
the physical world.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, these two
functions are sometimes

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.650 align:middle line:84%
referred to as higher
mind and lower mind.

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:36.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, the water coming from the
base that pours into the pool

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:39.490 align:middle line:84%
symbolizes what happens
when we meditate.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:43.060 align:middle line:84%
When we consciously connect
with the universal mind which

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:47.320 align:middle line:84%
this pool represents, it elicits
a response from the source,

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.660 align:middle line:84%
and we can see this
response through the ripples

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:52.300 align:middle line:90%
on the pond.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the background,
the image of the tree

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:57.870 align:middle line:84%
usually refers to the Tree
of Life from Kabbalah.

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And the branches and
trunk of this tree

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:04.940 align:middle line:84%
are also said to symbolize the
brain and the spinal column.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And the stream of consciousness
and the radiant light

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.770 align:middle line:84%
of the star card is running
through our nervous system

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:14.270 align:middle line:84%
and our brain, as
well as our chakras.

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:17.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, perched on top of
this tree is the red bird,

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:21.960 align:middle line:84%
and it's an ancient Egyptian
symbol for the soul.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, some relate this
bird to an ibis, which

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.820 align:middle line:90%
is connected to the God Thoth.

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.730 align:middle line:84%
But the bird, in general,
represents the ascension

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.250 align:middle line:84%
of our soul to
the supernal realm

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:35.625 align:middle line:90%
at the top of the tree of life.

00:10:35.625 --> 00:10:37.500 align:middle line:10%
And of course, the
mountain in the background

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.420 align:middle line:10%
is the same one that
we saw in the lovers

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.520 align:middle line:10%
card and the
strength card, and it

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.430 align:middle line:10%
represents that mountain
of inner attainment,

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:46.630 align:middle line:10%
or the great work.

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that
we're all climbing together,

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:53.192 align:middle line:84%
and the route that we travel
is the path to liberation.

00:10:53.192 --> 00:10:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And when we get to the top we
will unite with our true self.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:02.160 align:middle line:84%
So what's the star
trying to teach us?

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:06.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, her key lessons have to
do with meditation, revelation,

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:08.940 align:middle line:90%
and cosmic connection.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:10.890 align:middle line:84%
The water flowing
out onto the land

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:14.820 align:middle line:84%
also represents the outward
focus of our five senses.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:18.330 align:middle line:10%
Notice how there's five
streams as that water pours out

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.190 align:middle line:10%
onto the land.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:25.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, in a non-meditative state,
in our regular waking state,

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.080 align:middle line:84%
there is a continual
flow of stimulus

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.135 align:middle line:84%
that comes to us
from the outer world.

00:11:30.135 --> 00:11:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And when we meditate in the
ways that are indicated here

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.520 align:middle line:84%
by the star card,
we can actually

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.340 align:middle line:84%
generate a reverse
flow and begin

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:42.450 align:middle line:84%
to see the outer
world but from within.

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:46.830 align:middle line:84%
This changes how and
what we perceive.

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:49.140 align:middle line:84%
So our five senses
actually become

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:52.090 align:middle line:84%
linked to our
intuitive faculties,

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:55.470 align:middle line:84%
and when we're not
distracted by outer stimuli,

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:57.900 align:middle line:84%
then our senses can
actually become tools

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:01.490 align:middle line:84%
for directly perceiving
true reality.

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:04.590 align:middle line:84%
So the star is teaching
us to use meditation

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:08.250 align:middle line:84%
to develop intuition,
as well as to dip

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:11.820 align:middle line:84%
into the hidden side of life,
and to develop the ability

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:15.910 align:middle line:84%
to be steady in our mental
focus and concentration.

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:19.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, meditation is the only
safe regenerative practice

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:23.580 align:middle line:84%
that refines and directs
this cosmic energy that

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.490 align:middle line:84%
runs through our bodies,
which is also something

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:29.340 align:middle line:84%
we call the kundalini
energy, which relates back

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:30.805 align:middle line:90%
to the strength card.

00:12:30.805 --> 00:12:34.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we succeed in
meditation we feel better.

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:35.580 align:middle line:90%
We have more light.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.680 align:middle line:90%
We receive inspiration.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.050 align:middle line:84%
Our creativity draws
from these waters

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:43.020 align:middle line:84%
of our inner depth
and our subconscious,

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.950 align:middle line:90%
and this brings revelation.

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:47.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, at this stage
of the journey,

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:52.230 align:middle line:84%
meditation and connecting to
the cosmic or the universal mind

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:54.210 align:middle line:84%
is what will give
us the illumination

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:55.800 align:middle line:84%
and the revelations
that are needed

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.115 align:middle line:90%
to get to the next phase.

00:12:57.115 --> 00:12:59.690 align:middle line:90%


00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:03.900 align:middle line:84%
What are some other important
correspondences of the star?

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, her esoteric
title, or secret name,

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:09.460 align:middle line:84%
is the daughter
of the firmament,

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.600 align:middle line:84%
and her element is that
of fixed air, which

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:16.920 align:middle line:84%
relates to the astrological
correspondence of Aquarius.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:20.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, in astrology, Aquarius
rules the 11th house,

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:22.290 align:middle line:90%
which relates to society.

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's co-ruled by
both Saturn and Uranus.

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And they call Aquarius,
the water bearer,

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:32.940 align:middle line:84%
which is the symbol of
innovation, inspiration,

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.100 align:middle line:90%
and creative mind.

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And the symbology of the
sign, that water bearer,

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:41.340 align:middle line:84%
is seen to be pouring
out a jug of fluid

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:44.160 align:middle line:90%
into a larger mass of water.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.170 align:middle line:84%
But in actuality, this
substance isn't water.

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:51.530 align:middle line:84%
It's electrical energy
and cosmic mind stuff,

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:55.020 align:middle line:84%
and the contents of the
jug represent knowledge.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And so the act of this water
bearer pouring out the liquid

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:02.280 align:middle line:84%
is symbolic of spreading
the knowledge to the world.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, soon the awakening of
humanity through our knowledge

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:08.970 align:middle line:84%
of our cosmic connection
will lead us fully

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:12.350 align:middle line:84%
into the Age of Aquarius
that is now upon us.

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:15.336 align:middle line:84%
And this age is
ruled by the star.

00:14:15.336 --> 00:14:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, some other key words that
are associated with the star

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:23.130 align:middle line:84%
include confidence,
hope, vision, light,

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:27.160 align:middle line:84%
and investigating the depths
of our inner consciousness.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, these strengths are the
pure and balanced expression

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.340 align:middle line:90%
of the star key.

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:36.360 align:middle line:84%
But when any of this gets into
a distortion or an imbalance,

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:40.440 align:middle line:84%
we fall into the weaknesses in
the shadow side of the star.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.770 align:middle line:84%
So some of the things to watch
out for in terms of weaknesses

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:50.336 align:middle line:84%
include being prone to fantasy,
materialism, and idleness.

00:14:50.336 --> 00:14:53.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, how does the star
show up in your life?

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Any time, for
example, that you've

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.930 align:middle line:84%
been through a dark
period in your life

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:01.080 align:middle line:84%
and then you finally saw
the light, and any time

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:04.110 align:middle line:84%
that you've been filled with
a sense of hope or inspiration

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:06.785 align:middle line:84%
and creativity-- well,
that was the star.

00:15:06.785 --> 00:15:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And whenever we feel naturally
radiant and confident,

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:14.430 align:middle line:84%
that's the star
in us shining out.

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And if you've ever helped
someone else overcome

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:18.520 align:middle line:84%
their own self-esteem
issues, you

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:21.800 align:middle line:84%
were also being the
star in their life.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And when you practice meditation
and connect with your chakras,

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:30.103 align:middle line:84%
the light of the star
is awakening in you.

00:15:30.103 --> 00:15:31.520 align:middle line:84%
And the more you
come to recognize

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:32.960 align:middle line:84%
the star in your
life, the more it

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:36.110 align:middle line:84%
will also connect you to
one of your parallel lives

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:39.992 align:middle line:84%
where the star is the
dominant archetype.

00:15:39.992 --> 00:15:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, what might
our parallel life

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:45.160 align:middle line:84%
look like under the
archetype of the star?

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, these people are
quite literally the stars

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:52.740 align:middle line:84%
that we all admire and
look to for inspiration.

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:56.280 align:middle line:84%
The star's influence often
brings fame and recognition

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:59.310 align:middle line:84%
to the people who manifest
under this archetype.

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:02.400 align:middle line:84%
They possess a natural
charisma and a magnetism

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:06.060 align:middle line:84%
that draws people and
opportunities towards them.

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:07.890 align:middle line:84%
They're natural
visionaries, who are also

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:10.860 align:middle line:84%
in touch with their
intuition and feelings.

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.660 align:middle line:84%
They're the shining
examples that we

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.800 align:middle line:90%
can look to in our world.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.760 align:middle line:10%
Now, by working with the star
and invoking its energies

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:21.960 align:middle line:10%
into your life, you can awaken
your galactic connection

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.230 align:middle line:10%
and inner light.

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:27.780 align:middle line:10%
As we continue on with
our hero's journey,

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:33.300 align:middle line:10%
we come to an even greater light
as the full moon now rises.

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:36.120 align:middle line:10%
The amount of light shining upon
us from the celestial bodies

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.220 align:middle line:10%
is increasing now.

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:41.700 align:middle line:84%
The star taught us that we
should meditate upon nature,

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:44.280 align:middle line:90%
the cosmos, and our chakras.

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And now the moon
is going to suggest

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:51.310 align:middle line:84%
that the most fruitful place to
examine nature is our own body.

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:53.785 align:middle line:90%
It's like a universe of its own.

00:16:53.785 --> 00:16:56.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, consider all
the organizing forces

00:16:56.530 --> 00:17:00.370 align:middle line:84%
that hold our bodies together
and keep them operating.

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:03.430 align:middle line:84%
This key of the moon shows
us that we can consciously

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:08.950 align:middle line:84%
participate in our own
evolution and speed it up.

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:12.099 align:middle line:84%
The moon rules over subconscious
activities, as well as

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:14.500 align:middle line:90%
the biorhythms of our bodies.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And while the star may
guide us on our way,

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:19.869 align:middle line:84%
the moon also teaches us to
realize that things are not

00:17:19.869 --> 00:17:21.760 align:middle line:90%
always what they seem.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.680 align:middle line:84%
There's still some
illusions that

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.720 align:middle line:84%
are within the
subconscious that we

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:29.340 align:middle line:90%
must see our way through here.

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:33.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, the numerology of the
moon is ruled by the number 18.

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:36.370 align:middle line:10%
Thus, it has a lot to do with
self-consciousness represented

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:38.710 align:middle line:10%
by the number 1,
or the magician,

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:41.560 align:middle line:10%
as well as finding harmony
between our subconscious

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.830 align:middle line:10%
and our animal nature
represented by number 8,

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:46.330 align:middle line:10%
or strength.

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:48.730 align:middle line:10%
In addition, when we
add the 1 plus the 8

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:51.760 align:middle line:10%
we get 9, which
relates to the hermit.

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.980 align:middle line:10%
So the moon is the
outer expression,

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:58.810 align:middle line:10%
or the result of themes
established in the hermit.

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:02.800 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, the hermit is
the inner essence of the moon.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, recall that
the hermit relates

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:07.570 align:middle line:84%
to matters of
solitary development,

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:10.720 align:middle line:84%
the inner development that
happens when we withdraw

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.180 align:middle line:84%
inwards, and we
meditate and connect

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:14.870 align:middle line:90%
with our inner guidance.

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:19.060 align:middle line:84%
So the moon, or key 18, is
the greater light now shining

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:25.170 align:middle line:84%
upon our inner world as a result
of our developmental cycles.

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:30.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's explore the imagery
and symbolism of the moon card.

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:33.010 align:middle line:10%
We see a full moon
shining brightly,

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:34.780 align:middle line:10%
which reflects the
light of the sun

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:37.210 align:middle line:10%
into the darkness of the night.

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:41.240 align:middle line:84%
We also see a face in the
moon, which is in profile.

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And this indicates that the
moon is a conscious being.

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.230 align:middle line:84%
There are flames of
moonlight that also

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:49.770 align:middle line:90%
rain down on the Earth below.

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:53.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, at the bottom of
this card, a crawfish

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:56.870 align:middle line:84%
emerges from a pool of
water onto a dirt path.

00:18:56.870 --> 00:19:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And on either side of this path
we see a dog on the left side,

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:03.640 align:middle line:84%
and a wolf on the right,
and they're looking up

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.260 align:middle line:90%
and they're howling at the moon.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, the path widens
its way of a rolling

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:14.290 align:middle line:84%
fields between and beyond
two tall watchtowers.

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And it continues, then,
all the way up to the peak

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:19.200 align:middle line:90%
of the distant mountains.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.670 align:middle line:10%
Now, the pool here
is the same as that

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:25.570 align:middle line:10%
which is shown in the temperance
and in the star cards.

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:28.960 align:middle line:10%
It represents the great
deep of the cosmic mind

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.480 align:middle line:10%
stuff, the waters
of which originate

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.490 align:middle line:10%
in the robe of the
high priestess.

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:36.400 align:middle line:10%
Now, from this pool,
all organic life

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:40.960 align:middle line:10%
comes forth, which is what the
crawfish emerging represents,

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:44.270 align:middle line:10%
as well as the plants
that also line the pool.

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:46.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, the pool also refers
to the ninth sefira

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.750 align:middle line:84%
towards the bottom of the
tree of life known as Yesod,

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:51.590 align:middle line:90%
which means foundation.

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And this is also known
as the sphere of the moon

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:58.440 align:middle line:90%
and the sea of the subconscious.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, in Tarot the
subconsciousness

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:02.560 align:middle line:84%
emanates from the
high priestess,

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:06.100 align:middle line:84%
whose archetypal and
astrological correspondence

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.700 align:middle line:90%
is the moon.

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:10.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, they both also relate
to the moon goddesses, Diana

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:11.860 align:middle line:90%
and Luna.

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:15.010 align:middle line:10%
Now, Diana was also
known as the huntress who

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:18.760 align:middle line:10%
happened to have two
hounds as her companions,

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:22.660 align:middle line:10%
and this is what we
see here in this key.

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:25.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, out of this pool
emerges the dry land

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.290 align:middle line:90%
of physical manifestation.

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:30.460 align:middle line:84%
The crawfish climbing
out from the pool

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:34.760 align:middle line:84%
is a symbol of the early
stages of conscious unfoldment.

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:38.140 align:middle line:84%
And the crawfish represents
also this instinctive energy.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:42.510 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of that old
brain type of energy.

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:45.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is about
physical evolution as well.

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, in these first
developments of conscious life,

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:51.700 align:middle line:84%
the individual seems
to be kind of isolated

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.196 align:middle line:90%
from the rest of nature.

00:20:54.196 --> 00:20:58.840 align:middle line:10%
Now, the path rising and falling
represents the principles

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.810 align:middle line:10%
of vibration and
rhythm, which relate

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:05.300 align:middle line:10%
to the cycles of life
energy as it manifests

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.840 align:middle line:10%
through the path of evolution.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.330 align:middle line:10%
This path passes between
the dog and the wolf.

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:13.408 align:middle line:10%
Both are canines, and they
represent the same energy

00:21:13.408 --> 00:21:14.950 align:middle line:10%
as the crawfish,
but they're actually

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:17.800 align:middle line:10%
more evolved life forms.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.290 align:middle line:84%
The wolf is a symbol
of nature, and it

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:24.730 align:middle line:84%
remains wild and
untamed, whereas, the dog

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:28.810 align:middle line:84%
is more domesticated as a
result of human adaptation,

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:32.860 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, is a symbol
of what we call the art.

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:35.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, this path also then
passes between the extremes

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:39.520 align:middle line:84%
of wild nature and
human art, and there

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.800 align:middle line:84%
is an alchemical saying
actually that says,

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:47.960 align:middle line:84%
nature gives us the wild
body, but art must perfect it.

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.770 align:middle line:84%
So the middle way, or
the path of balance,

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:53.900 align:middle line:90%
is between art and nature.

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:55.890 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't go too
far to one side

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:59.080 align:middle line:84%
of being like
artificial invention,

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.800 align:middle line:84%
nor does it go too far to
being ungoverned impulses

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.680 align:middle line:90%
that just allow nature to rule.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, at the beginning,
where the path

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:10.030 align:middle line:84%
is rising up out of
the edge of this pool,

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:12.400 align:middle line:84%
it's bordered with
stones and plants.

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.560 align:middle line:10%
And these are symbols
of the mineral kingdom

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:16.750 align:middle line:10%
and the vegetable kingdoms.

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:20.350 align:middle line:84%
Then as it progresses to where
the dog and the wolf are,

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:23.720 align:middle line:84%
this represents
the animal kingdom.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And then the path
continues on, and it

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:30.650 align:middle line:84%
comes to watchtowers, which
mark the boundaries between what

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:33.380 align:middle line:90%
is known and what is unknown--

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:35.780 align:middle line:84%
the unknown being
more the mountains,

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:37.550 align:middle line:84%
and that's why their
color is darker

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:40.250 align:middle line:90%
beyond those watchtowers.

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:43.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, this path then
continues to the beyond,

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:46.520 align:middle line:84%
rising and falling through
blue distances which

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.800 align:middle line:84%
represent the plains
of consciousness that

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:55.150 align:middle line:84%
are open to us, especially
during sleep or trance states.

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:56.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, even though
the path progresses

00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:01.630 align:middle line:84%
in this wave-like motion, it's
actually continually ascending,

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:05.350 align:middle line:84%
raising the baseline just
as evolution is continually

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:09.890 align:middle line:84%
improving upon creating higher
and higher forms of life.

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:12.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, as we progress
on this path,

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:16.120 align:middle line:84%
the time will come when even
our lowest states will be higher

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.970 align:middle line:90%
than our old highs.

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:21.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, under the
watch of the moon,

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:24.790 align:middle line:84%
the path takes us through
an evolutionary process

00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:28.860 align:middle line:90%
to the peak of understanding.

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:32.580 align:middle line:84%
So what's the moon
trying to show us here?

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:36.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, its key lesson or
concept is inner organization.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
point in our journey

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:42.190 align:middle line:84%
where all that we've learned
and gained in consciousness

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:46.330 align:middle line:84%
is now going to be integrated
within the foundation

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:48.940 align:middle line:90%
of our subconscious mind.

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:51.400 align:middle line:84%
This, then, in turn,
causes a restructuring

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.620 align:middle line:84%
or a reorganizing
of our bodies in

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:56.380 align:middle line:90%
an atomic and cellular level.

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:58.780 align:middle line:84%
Our magical body is
now becoming anchored

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:01.220 align:middle line:90%
within our physical body.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:04.010 align:middle line:84%
But we're still not fully
in the daylight yet.

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:07.090 align:middle line:84%
So we still have some
illusions and some shadows

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:10.300 align:middle line:84%
within the subconscious that
also need to be cleared.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.900 align:middle line:84%
We need to bring them
to consciousness.

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.570 align:middle line:84%
This will, in turn,
help us have clear sight

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:19.110 align:middle line:84%
on the goal of climbing to
the top of the mountain.

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:21.840 align:middle line:90%


00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:25.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's explore some other
correspondences of the moon.

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:28.140 align:middle line:84%
Her esoteric title,
or her secret name,

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:31.770 align:middle line:90%
is the ruler of flux and reflux.

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:34.140 align:middle line:84%
Her element is
mutable water, which

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:37.500 align:middle line:84%
relates to the astrological
sign of Pisces, which

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:39.720 align:middle line:90%
rules the moon.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:43.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, Pisces seeks to stretch
beyond the reality of just

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:45.940 align:middle line:84%
here and now and
search for clues

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:49.080 align:middle line:84%
into past, present,
and future worlds.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is one of the
reasons why Pisces normally

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:58.030 align:middle line:84%
responds to psychic impressions
more so than cold, hard facts.

00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:01.090 align:middle line:84%
They begin to ask deeper,
spiritual questions,

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:04.390 align:middle line:84%
such as, what more
is there to reality

00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:06.900 align:middle line:90%
beyond what meets the eye?

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And why are these feelings
inside me so strong?

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:14.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, some other key words
that are associated here

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:21.050 align:middle line:84%
with the moon and with Pisces
include passage, choice, truth,

00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:25.640 align:middle line:84%
illusion, romance,
dreams, and fantasies,

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:29.390 align:middle line:84%
and it's the time that
relates to twilight.

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:32.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of the strengths and
the virtues that the moon helps

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:37.340 align:middle line:84%
to awaken in us include
intuition and imagination,

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:40.730 align:middle line:84%
having more faith,
creating family harmony,

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:43.880 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
animals and nature.

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:46.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, these strengths
and these keys

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:50.060 align:middle line:84%
are related to the balanced and
pure expression of the moon.

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:53.570 align:middle line:84%
But again, if it goes into
any imbalances or distortions

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:56.540 align:middle line:84%
of too much or too little,
it creates the weaknesses

00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:58.040 align:middle line:90%
in the shadow side of the moon.

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:00.540 align:middle line:90%


00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:02.790 align:middle line:84%
And some of these things
that we need to watch out for

00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:07.110 align:middle line:84%
are hallucinations,
escapism, being

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:12.180 align:middle line:84%
imbalanced, societal and
personal intolerances

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:18.100 align:middle line:84%
of old illusions, delusions,
and self deceptions.

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.770 align:middle line:84%
How does the moon
show up in your life?

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:22.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, think of the
times when you've

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:24.220 align:middle line:84%
either been or
felt this influence

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:26.120 align:middle line:90%
of the moon in your life.

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:29.740 align:middle line:84%
For example, have you ever felt
yourself caught in deception

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:33.880 align:middle line:84%
or illusion, whether it was
your own or someone else's?

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:38.110 align:middle line:84%
This would have been the
moon's shadow casting upon you.

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:39.790 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps on your
spiritual journey,

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:41.860 align:middle line:84%
you've reclaimed
authentic aspects

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:43.870 align:middle line:90%
of yourself and your truth.

00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:47.310 align:middle line:84%
This would have been the moon's
light shining in your life.

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And when you've evolved
enough on your path

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:51.340 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual development,
it's possible

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:53.770 align:middle line:84%
that you've found your body
actually making changes

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:58.450 align:middle line:84%
to adjust to the new level
of light that you hold.

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.490 align:middle line:84%
Examples of this could
include differences

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:04.750 align:middle line:84%
in dietary needs and
different metabolism shifts,

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:08.140 align:middle line:84%
natural changes even in
your facial structures,

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:13.220 align:middle line:84%
amazing healings within
your body and so on.

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:16.890 align:middle line:84%
The moon might also show up when
you're having to make choices,

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:21.090 align:middle line:84%
and when you're feeling
pulled between what you think

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:24.380 align:middle line:84%
and what you feel
is the right choice.

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And as you become
more aware of this

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:28.710 align:middle line:84%
and you recognize the
moon in your life,

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:32.070 align:middle line:84%
it will then help you to connect
with one of your parallel lives

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:36.228 align:middle line:84%
where the moon is the
dominant archetype.

00:27:36.228 --> 00:27:39.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, people manifesting
under the moon archetype

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:42.330 align:middle line:84%
have a great deal of
personal magnetism.

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:44.660 align:middle line:90%
People are drawn to them.

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:48.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, their emotional nature
is like the great, still lake,

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:53.520 align:middle line:84%
whose waters run deep,
because they feel very deeply,

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.260 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, they've
learned that they

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:58.590 align:middle line:84%
have to establish trust and
loyalty with people before they

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:01.350 align:middle line:84%
allow them to get
in closer to know

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:03.960 align:middle line:90%
the depths of their nature.

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:07.080 align:middle line:84%
These people are romantic
types, but they can often

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.390 align:middle line:84%
get disappointed
by what they feel

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:14.080 align:middle line:84%
was a deception or a betrayal
from others in matters of love.

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.110 align:middle line:84%
So they can also be
guarded to a point,

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:18.990 align:middle line:84%
and only the devoted
ones will make it

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:22.080 align:middle line:84%
past their watchtowers
to explore the deeper

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:23.730 align:middle line:90%
terrain of their soul.

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:25.620 align:middle line:84%
Thus, these people
are often drawn

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:30.240 align:middle line:84%
into fields of philosophy,
spirituality, or mysticism,

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:33.300 align:middle line:84%
because of their deep
nature, and as a way

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:35.340 align:middle line:84%
of coming to know the
depths of their own soul.

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:38.310 align:middle line:90%


00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:41.290 align:middle line:10%
And by working with the moon
and invoking its energies

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:46.760 align:middle line:10%
into your life, you, too, can
awaken your personal magnetism.

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:48.980 align:middle line:84%
Join me again as
we explore further

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:51.710 align:middle line:84%
into the 22 archetypes
of Tarot, and how

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:55.610 align:middle line:84%
they can help us to make our
big shift in consciousness.

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:56.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard.

00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:59.000 align:middle line:10%
