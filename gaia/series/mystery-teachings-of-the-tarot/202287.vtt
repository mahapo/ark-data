00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:20.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.680 align:middle line:10%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard,
host of "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.320 align:middle line:10%
Now, today, we're going to
meditate on the archetypes

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.870 align:middle line:10%
of the Star and the Moon.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.300 align:middle line:10%
Together, they help
us to find the light,

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.000 align:middle line:10%
even in the darkest of nights.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.940 align:middle line:10%
The Star brings us hope and
it reveals our connection

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.440 align:middle line:10%
to the cosmos, while the
Moon reorganizes our mind

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.270 align:middle line:10%
and our physical body to
support our evolution.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.950 align:middle line:84%
Here's the formula
that you can follow

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.410 align:middle line:84%
for invoking these two
archetypes of the Star

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.800 align:middle line:90%
and the Moon into your life.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.980 align:middle line:84%
We'll first work with one at a
time, beginning with the Star.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And once you're ready, find
the Star card in your deck

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.480 align:middle line:90%
and take it out.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Place this card in front
of you at eye level.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And go ahead and sit
on a meditation stool

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.640 align:middle line:84%
or cushion so that you can place
the card on the table in front

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.200 align:middle line:84%
of you at eye level, with
it upright on the table.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Then get yourself into a relaxed
position and a light meditative

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.720 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.090 align:middle line:90%
Take in several deep breaths.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.280 align:middle line:90%
Relax your body.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.600 align:middle line:90%
Begin to settle down.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.640 align:middle line:90%
Quiet your mind.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.970 align:middle line:84%
You want to bring your mind
to a state of emptiness.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And make sure that
you come to a positive

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.980 align:middle line:84%
or at least a neutral
state of being

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.600 align:middle line:84%
so that nothing is disturbing
you mentally or emotionally.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And once you're in
a peaceful state,

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.730 align:middle line:84%
go ahead and open your eyes and
look at the image of the Star

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.410 align:middle line:90%
card for a while.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.650 align:middle line:84%
For about five to 10 minutes,
study this card with your eyes

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.010 align:middle line:90%
open.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.160 align:middle line:90%
Take in all its symbolism.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.920 align:middle line:90%
Memorize its imagery.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.100 align:middle line:84%
Study all the
details of this card.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And as you do,
contemplate their meaning.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.860 align:middle line:84%
Notice any subtleties that
you might not have caught

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.070 align:middle line:90%
before or any new associations.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:17.150 align:middle line:10%
And really memorize this card
and imprint it upon your mind.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.210 align:middle line:10%
I'll remain silent now
for the next five minutes,

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.880 align:middle line:10%
as we now meditate on the
symbolism of the card.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:07:14.210 align:middle line:90%


00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.730 align:middle line:84%
Then after those first
five to 10 minutes,

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.520 align:middle line:84%
it's time to take
the card inside

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.540 align:middle line:84%
and to work with it in your
mind for another 10 minutes

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.670 align:middle line:90%
with your eyes closed.

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:28.540 align:middle line:84%
So closing the eyes, recreate
the image of this card

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.490 align:middle line:90%
within your mind.

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:33.460 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that the frame of
the card is like a doorway.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And on the other
side of that door

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:41.040 align:middle line:84%
is the scenery that you see
in the image of the Star card.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:48.220 align:middle line:10%
Build up all of its details, its
colors, the light of the stars

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.460 align:middle line:10%
shining down in the
night sky, the woman

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.790 align:middle line:10%
pouring the water
out of the vases,

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:57.530 align:middle line:10%
also seeing the red
bird on the tree

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:01.345 align:middle line:10%
off in the hills and the
mountain off in the distance.

00:08:01.345 --> 00:12:25.430 align:middle line:90%


00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:27.920 align:middle line:10%
Once this image is firmly
established in your mind

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.130 align:middle line:10%
and you've worked with it
for about 10 minutes, next,

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:33.710 align:middle line:10%
it's time to let
it come to life.

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:35.840 align:middle line:10%
Imagine that you're walking
through that doorway.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.790 align:middle line:10%
And you're walking
into the scenery,

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:40.820 align:middle line:10%
and it begins to take on a
three-dimensional, virtual

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.090 align:middle line:10%
reality experience around you.

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:45.470 align:middle line:10%
And everything comes to life.

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:49.910 align:middle line:10%
As you move into this setting,
just observe for a while.

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:52.670 align:middle line:10%
What does the star do?

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:56.090 align:middle line:10%
Notice how she behaves.

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:59.030 align:middle line:10%
Does she have any messages?

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:04.830 align:middle line:10%
And most importantly, feel
the energy of the star.

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:08.220 align:middle line:10%
Let it penetrate within you.

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:11.580 align:middle line:10%
Feel what she's emanating.

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:15.020 align:middle line:10%
Notice the vibrations.

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:19.500 align:middle line:10%
And really allow this
experience to play out

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.695 align:middle line:10%
within your active imagination,
using all five of your senses.

00:13:22.695 --> 00:13:27.770 align:middle line:90%


00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:30.290 align:middle line:10%
Once you feel that
energetic connection

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:33.290 align:middle line:10%
to the life of the
Star card, next,

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:35.660 align:middle line:10%
we're going to
merge with the star.

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:38.670 align:middle line:90%
Become the star.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:44.970 align:middle line:10%
Feel her come alive within you,
and see yourself as the star.

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:48.080 align:middle line:10%
When you feel this energy
awakening within you,

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.770 align:middle line:10%
we're next going to take
on the posture of the star.

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:55.040 align:middle line:10%
You're going to assume the
archetypal form and the body

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.190 align:middle line:10%
position.

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:59.030 align:middle line:10%
So going down on your
left knee and then

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:01.910 align:middle line:10%
having your right leg
up at a 90-degree angle

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:05.360 align:middle line:10%
to support and balance
you, your right hand

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.870 align:middle line:10%
is pouring water from a
vessel into a pool of water,

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:13.650 align:middle line:10%
while the left hand is pouring
the water out onto the ground.

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:18.120 align:middle line:10%
And from this position, you're
going to say this affirmation.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.360 align:middle line:10%
"I am the daughter
of the firmament.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.250 align:middle line:10%
I am a galactic being.

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:25.830 align:middle line:10%


00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:30.360 align:middle line:10%
The radiant energy of the
cosmos flows through me."

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:33.600 align:middle line:10%
Really feel that
reverberating through you,

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:37.300 align:middle line:10%
activating you at
a cellular level,

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.330 align:middle line:10%
integrating the star
energy deep within you.

00:14:40.330 --> 00:15:36.107 align:middle line:90%


00:15:36.107 --> 00:15:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
ready, we're now going

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:41.020 align:middle line:84%
to do the same process
with the Moon card.

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:44.630 align:middle line:84%
So take out your Moon
card from the deck.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:47.290 align:middle line:84%
Place it in front of you
where you can meditate upon it

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:51.580 align:middle line:84%
for about five to 10
minutes with your eyes open,

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:56.170 align:middle line:84%
studying its imagery,
taking in all the details,

00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:59.200 align:middle line:84%
memorizing it,
noticing the symbols,

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.597 align:middle line:90%
contemplating the meaning.

00:16:01.597 --> 00:16:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And work with this
card with your eyes

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:06.300 align:middle line:84%
open for about
five to 10 minutes.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.240 align:middle line:84%
Build this image
within your mind.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:11.580 align:middle line:10%
Bring in all the
details, all the colors,

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:17.770 align:middle line:10%
all the different beings
that are part of this card,

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:24.070 align:middle line:10%
the pool of water, the crawfish
emerging, the path, the dog

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:28.240 align:middle line:10%
and the wolf, the
two watchtowers, all

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:32.950 align:middle line:10%
the way rolling over hills and
fields off to the mountaintop,

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:37.660 align:middle line:10%
and the full moon shining
above, with moonbeams

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:41.980 align:middle line:10%
and moonlight raining
down, and noticing

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:46.320 align:middle line:10%
that the moon is a goddess.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.240 align:middle line:10%
She is alive.

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.740 align:middle line:10%
She has consciousness.

00:16:49.740 --> 00:21:12.760 align:middle line:90%


00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.890 align:middle line:84%
After 10 minutes of
working with this image

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:16.990 align:middle line:84%
and building it up
in your mind, it's

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:20.170 align:middle line:84%
now time to let the
moon come to life.

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that you're walking
through that doorway

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.150 align:middle line:84%
into the scenery,
letting it take

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:28.930 align:middle line:84%
on a three-dimensional
experience around you,

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:33.360 align:middle line:84%
using your active imagination,
all five of your senses.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And let this scene
fully come to life.

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:40.580 align:middle line:84%
Notice the dog and the
wolf howling at the moon.

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:44.810 align:middle line:84%
Observe all the behaviors of
the various beings in this card.

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:48.170 align:middle line:90%
And especially observe the moon.

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And feel her energy
that she emanates,

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:58.880 align:middle line:84%
her ways of being, her cycles,
her rhythm of flux and reflux.

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:03.140 align:middle line:90%


00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:06.650 align:middle line:10%
Really connect to the energy
and the archetype of the Moon.

00:22:06.650 --> 00:26:37.110 align:middle line:90%


00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:39.840 align:middle line:10%
Once you feel this
connection, the next step

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.270 align:middle line:10%
is to merge with the moon.

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:45.330 align:middle line:10%
Become the moon.

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:51.210 align:middle line:10%
See her coming alive within you,
and see yourself up in the sky,

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:53.430 align:middle line:10%
shining the moonlight
down upon the Earth.

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:58.500 align:middle line:90%


00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:01.200 align:middle line:10%
When you feel this connection
starting to integrate,

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.180 align:middle line:10%
you're going to stand
up and actually take

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:06.300 align:middle line:10%
on the archetype of the moon.

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:10.410 align:middle line:10%
Imagine yourself as the moon
shining down from the sky

00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:11.770 align:middle line:10%
above.

00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:14.860 align:middle line:10%
Assume her archetypal form.

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:20.830 align:middle line:10%
Feel her rhythms, her cycles,
your cycles, your rhythms.

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:26.860 align:middle line:90%


00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:31.360 align:middle line:10%
And as you feel this connection
from this archetypal form.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:34.690 align:middle line:10%
you're going to state
this affirmation out loud.

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:37.105 align:middle line:10%
"I am the ruler of
flux and reflux.

00:27:37.105 --> 00:27:39.670 align:middle line:10%


00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:44.170 align:middle line:10%
I am the cycle of evolution.

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:47.020 align:middle line:10%
My light shines upon
the depths of the soul."

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:51.340 align:middle line:90%


00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:54.010 align:middle line:10%
Allow that affirmation
to reverberate

00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:56.920 align:middle line:10%
throughout your being,
to activate your cells

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:59.620 align:middle line:10%
and help you integrate
this Moon key even more

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.810 align:middle line:10%
fully within your inner being.

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:48.493 align:middle line:90%


00:28:48.493 --> 00:28:49.910 align:middle line:10%
When you're ready,
we're now going

00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:53.740 align:middle line:10%
to place both the Star and the
Moon keys next to each other

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:57.760 align:middle line:10%
and meditate upon them together,
placing the Star on the left

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:01.150 align:middle line:10%
and the Moon on the right.

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:03.880 align:middle line:10%
As you look at them
and meditate upon them,

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.060 align:middle line:10%
notice how they
contrast one another.

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:09.290 align:middle line:90%


00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:12.650 align:middle line:10%
Notice also how they
complement each other.

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:15.250 align:middle line:10%
Notice the similarities
and the differences.

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:20.900 align:middle line:90%


00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:26.300 align:middle line:10%
The star stimulates
revelation within you,

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:29.500 align:middle line:10%
while the moon stimulates
your unconscious evolution

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:32.420 align:middle line:10%
at a deep cellular level.

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:34.240 align:middle line:10%
Finally, we want to
take these energies

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.825 align:middle line:10%
and express them
into our outer life.

00:29:36.825 --> 00:29:38.200 align:middle line:10%
So ways that we
can do that would

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:41.200 align:middle line:10%
be to bring the primary
colors into our life,

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.450 align:middle line:10%
into our environment,
in our dress.

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:45.830 align:middle line:10%
And so for the Moon
and the Star key,

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:50.470 align:middle line:10%
these are often associated
with deep purple and violet.

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:53.290 align:middle line:10%
You can also meditate upon
these symbols and images daily

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:56.500 align:middle line:10%
for the next week and continue
working with the affirmations

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:58.240 align:middle line:10%
that we just used.

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.220 align:middle line:10%
Contemplate the
meaning of each card

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:02.330 align:middle line:10%
and how it applies to your life.

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:05.140 align:middle line:10%
And watch for these archetypes
to appear in your dreams

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:07.270 align:middle line:10%
and through synchronicities
in your life.

00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:11.020 align:middle line:10%
And analyze any messages
they might be delivering you.

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.210 align:middle line:10%
And especially pay attention
to how you personally

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:16.333 align:middle line:10%
embody the strengths and
the weaknesses of each one.

00:30:16.333 --> 00:30:18.250 align:middle line:10%
And then consciously
work to make improvements

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:19.913 align:middle line:10%
in these areas.

00:30:19.913 --> 00:30:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And again, realize that when
we're working with archetypes

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:24.520 align:middle line:84%
in this way and
we're invoking them,

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:27.670 align:middle line:84%
they will set forces
in motion in your life.

00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:30.760 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going to engage
with this experiential process,

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:33.230 align:middle line:84%
then commit to seeing
it all the way through.

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:35.350 align:middle line:90%
We're almost to the end here.

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:39.160 align:middle line:84%
Work with each key all the
way through this series, not

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:42.700 align:middle line:84%
skipping any steps, and then
really give it your attention.

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:44.830 align:middle line:90%
We're on home stretch.

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:47.050 align:middle line:84%
Join me again, as
we explore further

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:49.780 align:middle line:84%
into the 22 archetypes
of Tarot and how

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:53.020 align:middle line:84%
they can help us to make our
big shift in consciousness.
