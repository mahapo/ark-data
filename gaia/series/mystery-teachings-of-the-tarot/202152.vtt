00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.100 align:middle line:90%


00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard,
and this is Mystery Teachings.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.200 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.510 align:middle line:10%
What happens when we
aren't willing to do

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.410 align:middle line:10%
the work of transforming
our shadow into light?

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, it'll wind up
getting the better of us

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.340 align:middle line:84%
and preventing us
from truly living

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.780 align:middle line:90%
the life we're meant to live.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.810 align:middle line:84%
When this happens, the
universe will usually

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.980 align:middle line:84%
send us hard lessons
that shake us to the core

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.750 align:middle line:90%
and try to redirect us in life.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.680 align:middle line:84%
The challenge is to recognize
those events as wake-up calls

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.810 align:middle line:84%
rather than
spiraling into deeper

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.450 align:middle line:90%
victimhood or resistance.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.360 align:middle line:10%
As we continue our ascent
on the hero's journey,

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.220 align:middle line:10%
we're now coming to
the two keys that

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.670 align:middle line:10%
tend to strike the
most fear in people.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.850 align:middle line:84%
These are the devil
and the tower.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.141 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:01:03.141 --> 00:01:04.849 align:middle line:84%
Well, these are the
archetypal principles

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:07.830 align:middle line:90%
of temptation and downfall.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.540 align:middle line:10%
The devil represents
the things that

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.250 align:middle line:10%
keep us enslaved to materiality,
while the tower represents

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.740 align:middle line:10%
a sudden, often rude,
awakening that's

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.210 align:middle line:10%
needed to get us to let go
of those final attachments.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.970 align:middle line:10%
Both these keys are often
depicted in the darkest

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.560 align:middle line:10%
of night as well.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.780 align:middle line:10%
And that's because
they mark the entrance

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.940 align:middle line:10%
into the fifth stage of
alchemy, the fermentation stage.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.800 align:middle line:84%
Fermentation is
about the final death

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.300 align:middle line:84%
of the old identity, and all the
more deeply-rooted attachments

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.720 align:middle line:84%
that hold us back from
being our true self.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.240 align:middle line:84%
These are some of the hardest
attachments to let go of,

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.980 align:middle line:84%
and this process
can often lead us

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.040 align:middle line:84%
into what's called a dark
night of the soul as we

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.720 align:middle line:84%
struggle with our
own inner demons.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.600 align:middle line:84%
We're also entering into
the final seven archetypes

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.300 align:middle line:90%
of the hero's journey.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.070 align:middle line:10%
These last seven bring us
to the final three stages

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.320 align:middle line:10%
of alchemy, which
refine our soul

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.560 align:middle line:10%
and bring us more
spiritual attainment.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.480 align:middle line:90%
So fear not.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.630 align:middle line:84%
We're on homestretch, and
there's much brighter days

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.470 align:middle line:90%
ahead.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.290 align:middle line:84%
But we must first make it
through this difficult stage

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.910 align:middle line:90%
of fermentation.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.710 align:middle line:84%
These are the final
tests of the hero

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.900 align:middle line:84%
on his journey of
self-actualization

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.510 align:middle line:90%
and self-mastery.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Our next step on
the hero's journey

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.440 align:middle line:84%
brings us an encounter
with the devil.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.610 align:middle line:10%
This is a very powerful
archetypal energy.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Next to death, the devil appears
most often in movie scenes.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.920 align:middle line:84%
Pretty much any horror movie
is based on this archetype.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.160 align:middle line:84%
The devil is the polar
opposite to the angel shown

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.620 align:middle line:84%
in the temperance card
who teaches us moderation

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.420 align:middle line:90%
and harmonization.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.670 align:middle line:84%
The devil, in
contrast, tempts us

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.730 align:middle line:90%
towards indulgence and gluttony.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, the word devil is evil
with a D in front of it.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.910 align:middle line:84%
It's also the word
lived spelled backwards.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And this suggests that when
we live with the devil,

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.110 align:middle line:84%
it's more like we're just
existing than living.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.620 align:middle line:84%
The word devil also derives
from the Greek word Diabolos,

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.010 align:middle line:90%
which simply means adversary.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.100 align:middle line:84%
This adversary actually
represents our own shadow self.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.820 align:middle line:84%
It carries our fears,
attachments, our self-loathing,

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.210 align:middle line:84%
parts of us that we've rejected,
and anything that society

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.670 align:middle line:90%
has taught us to despise.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.400 align:middle line:10%
And like the figures chained
to the devil in this card,

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.700 align:middle line:10%
our shadow side holds
us captive until it

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.220 align:middle line:10%
can be brought into the
light and integrated back

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.560 align:middle line:10%
into our total self.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.590 align:middle line:84%
This is the task of the hero
at this stage of the journey.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.590 align:middle line:90%


00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.590 align:middle line:84%
The devil is ruled
by the number 15.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.900 align:middle line:84%
We have one and five
that form this number.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.980 align:middle line:10%
So it has a lot to do with
self-consciousness, which

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.250 align:middle line:10%
is represented by number
one, or the magician,

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.230 align:middle line:10%
as well as the
number five, which

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.270 align:middle line:10%
is intuition and education
and relates to the Hierophant.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.370 align:middle line:10%
These two keys should be studied
in relationship with key 15.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.470 align:middle line:10%
In addition, when we
add one plus five,

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.209 align:middle line:10%
we get six, which relates
to the lovers card.

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.990 align:middle line:84%
The devil is actually an
outer material expression

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:25.050 align:middle line:84%
of the foundational principles
shown in the lovers,

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.020 align:middle line:84%
but apparently something's
gone wrong here.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.350 align:middle line:10%
The lovers have fallen too
much into their temptation

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.070 align:middle line:10%
and become enslaved by
their physical experience.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.980 align:middle line:84%
This key represents the work
we must do to free ourselves

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.060 align:middle line:90%
from this bondage.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.630 align:middle line:10%
Let's now take a look at
the rather gruesome imagery

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.870 align:middle line:10%
and symbolism of the devil card.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.170 align:middle line:10%
We see a devil who sits
perched on a half cube

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.860 align:middle line:10%
with two beastly versions
of a man and a woman chained

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.390 align:middle line:10%
to his stoop.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.820 align:middle line:84%
His wings are bat
wings, symbolizing

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.710 align:middle line:90%
the powers of darkness.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.560 align:middle line:84%
His face and horns
are that of a goat,

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.890 align:middle line:84%
relating him to the
sign of Capricorn.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.970 align:middle line:10%
His legs and feet
are eagle's claws,

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.230 align:middle line:10%
and the eagle is related
to the sign of Scorpio,

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.880 align:middle line:10%
which rules our sex organs.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.330 align:middle line:84%
So here it shows the
use of sexual energy

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.690 align:middle line:90%
to control or enslave others.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.430 align:middle line:10%
And this powerful
generative energy

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.040 align:middle line:10%
has been debased and abused.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.320 align:middle line:84%
The talons also symbolize how,
when we cling to this need

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.760 align:middle line:84%
to be right, despite all
evidence to the contrary,

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.930 align:middle line:90%
we are in the devil's clutches.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.190 align:middle line:10%
The devil's right hand is up,
with his fingers spread open.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.200 align:middle line:10%
And this is in
mock contradiction

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.110 align:middle line:10%
to the hierophant's
esoteric sign of blessing

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.090 align:middle line:10%
and hidden mysteries.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.890 align:middle line:10%
The devil's gesture
is trying to tell us

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.520 align:middle line:10%
that we should believe that
what we experience with our five

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.430 align:middle line:10%
senses is all there is.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.560 align:middle line:10%
And then meanwhile,
his left hand

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.390 align:middle line:10%
is holding a torch
pointing down,

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.420 align:middle line:10%
which burns wastefully
and gives off

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.110 align:middle line:10%
little light in this position.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.890 align:middle line:10%
Now the torch is also a phallic
symbol, a symbol of life force,

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.180 align:middle line:10%
which here is being wasted.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, the man and the woman
chained to the devil's stoop

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.190 align:middle line:84%
are obviously wasting
their life force energy

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.340 align:middle line:90%
and using it unwisely.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.800 align:middle line:84%
It's being wasted
through overindulgence,

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:32.890 align:middle line:84%
which can lead to exhaustion,
boredom, and addictions.

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:36.070 align:middle line:84%
Notice also how the
devil has a navel.

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.290 align:middle line:84%
This symbol shows us
that he's actually

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.420 align:middle line:90%
a product of the human mind.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And because of this, we know
he's actually not representing

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.370 align:middle line:90%
the fallen angel Lucifer.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Instead, he's a result of our
own projections of our shadow

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.660 align:middle line:84%
side onto an adversary
outside of us,

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.660 align:middle line:84%
because we haven't
owned our shadow.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.610 align:middle line:84%
So he's our scapegoat
for everything

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.070 align:middle line:84%
that we refuse to take
responsibility for.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:02.940 align:middle line:90%


00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.610 align:middle line:10%
The symbol of the pentagram
normally represents

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:09.210 align:middle line:10%
the five elements, and it's
also a symbol of humans.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.150 align:middle line:10%
Now, an upright pentagram
is a very positive symbol

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:15.420 align:middle line:10%
of man's mastery of the
elements and his ascent

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.010 align:middle line:10%
towards his divinity.

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:19.830 align:middle line:84%
But here, the
pentagram is inverted,

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:23.280 align:middle line:84%
suggesting the reversal of
true understanding of our place

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.680 align:middle line:90%
in the cosmos.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.450 align:middle line:84%
Rather than recognizing
our divinity,

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:30.180 align:middle line:84%
this inverted
pentagram symbolizes

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.210 align:middle line:84%
how we've pursued things
like sexual gratification

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:37.770 align:middle line:84%
and material gain
above all else.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.200 align:middle line:84%
The inverted pentagram
also represents

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.410 align:middle line:84%
a disregard for spiritual
laws and ethics,

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:46.070 align:middle line:90%
and is used in black magic.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:48.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is actually
central to the whole meaning

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:51.640 align:middle line:90%
of this key of the devil.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.215 align:middle line:84%
Now, the devil sits on a
pedestal which is a half cube.

00:07:55.215 --> 00:07:59.650 align:middle line:84%
The cube as a whole represents
knowledge of reality.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:03.960 align:middle line:84%
So the half cube symbolizes
half knowledge of that reality.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.170 align:middle line:84%
So for example, thinking that
the material realm of the five

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:10.950 align:middle line:84%
senses is all there is
while ignoring or denying

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:15.390 align:middle line:84%
the hidden and spiritual sides
of life is half knowledge.

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:18.600 align:middle line:90%
That's not the whole reality.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, the man and the
woman in the chains

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.570 align:middle line:84%
represent our self-conscious
and subconscious modes

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:28.290 align:middle line:84%
of human thinking that have
become trapped in material

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:30.750 align:middle line:90%
ways of being and thinking.

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:33.539 align:middle line:84%
Their horns, hooves,
and tails show

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:36.600 align:middle line:84%
that when we get caught
up in surface things,

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.314 align:middle line:84%
our consciousness
becomes more bestialized.

00:08:40.314 --> 00:08:43.049 align:middle line:84%
And they've become limited
by their attachments

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:46.920 align:middle line:84%
to half notions,
ignorance, and illusions.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.770 align:middle line:84%
Thinking that the illusion
of the matrix is real

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:53.070 align:middle line:90%
is what enslaves us.

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:54.930 align:middle line:84%
But the cool thing
about this card

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:57.900 align:middle line:84%
is that it shows us how
our enslavement is actually

00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.460 align:middle line:90%
voluntary.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.110 align:middle line:90%
It's our choice.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:05.160 align:middle line:84%
Notice how loose the chains
are around their necks.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.060 align:middle line:84%
They can easily lift them
off and free themselves,

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.140 align:middle line:90%
but they don't.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.630 align:middle line:90%
Because they don't seem to care.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.940 align:middle line:84%
They actually like
this situation.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:15.960 align:middle line:90%
They're getting by.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.710 align:middle line:84%
So why should they do
anything to change it, that

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:22.690 align:middle line:90%
involves some kind of effort?

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:26.510 align:middle line:10%
That's why the key that follows
this one, which is the Tower,

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:29.934 align:middle line:10%
is a necessary step.

00:09:29.934 --> 00:09:32.340 align:middle line:10%
Now, also notice the
parallels that we

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.770 align:middle line:10%
see between this
key of the Devil

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:36.980 align:middle line:10%
and the key of the Lovers.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.810 align:middle line:10%
The characters in the
Lovers have somehow

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:44.460 align:middle line:10%
here become beastialized by
the Devil or in the Devil card.

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:48.740 align:middle line:10%
And this key is thus a
distortion of the Lovers card.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:51.600 align:middle line:10%
The Lovers represent
choice and discernment

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.940 align:middle line:10%
in our lessons of duality.

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.560 align:middle line:10%
Here with the
Devil, they clearly

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.940 align:middle line:10%
haven't been discerning
or making wise choices.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.830 align:middle line:84%
In place of the love
and passion that

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:05.190 align:middle line:84%
was blessed by the angel
in the Lovers card,

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:08.190 align:middle line:84%
here our passions
have been misdirected

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:11.250 align:middle line:84%
to illusions and material
addictions, which

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:13.440 align:middle line:90%
chain us to them.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, our growth is stunted
by our unwillingness

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.410 align:middle line:84%
to face our own shadow
and to take responsibility

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:21.600 align:middle line:90%
for our decisions and actions.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.540 align:middle line:84%
Instead, we often
blame the adversary

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.630 align:middle line:84%
for all that goes
wrong in our lives.

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:30.060 align:middle line:84%
It's just easier to
blame others than it is

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.860 align:middle line:90%
to own our own responsibility.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.520 align:middle line:10%
Now, the black
background in this key

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.480 align:middle line:10%
is the color of darkness,
ignorance, and limitation

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.680 align:middle line:10%
and also that which is hidden.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's the Devil
trying to teach us here?

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:47.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, this key
involves all matters

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:49.810 align:middle line:90%
of temptation of the ego.

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:53.410 align:middle line:84%
Falling into these temptations
is a choice that we make.

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:56.710 align:middle line:84%
When we choose to indulge
our ego and prioritize

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:59.840 align:middle line:84%
things like materialism,
sensory experience,

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.840 align:middle line:84%
and sexual gratification
above all else,

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:07.850 align:middle line:84%
then we become entrenched in
the illusions of the matrix.

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:10.820 align:middle line:84%
But the choice is ours to
either keep or cast off

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.770 align:middle line:90%
the chains that bind us.

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:15.770 align:middle line:10%
We must realize that
materialism is not the road

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:17.800 align:middle line:10%
to happiness or freedom.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.270 align:middle line:84%
It's not that we can't
enjoy physical life.

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:22.730 align:middle line:84%
But if we think that these
material pursuits are

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:24.890 align:middle line:84%
what are going to
bring us happiness,

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:28.370 align:middle line:84%
then we'll end up being
enslaved by greed.

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:32.720 align:middle line:84%
We might be also chained to
narrow perspectives or opinions

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:39.100 align:middle line:84%
or living according to other
people's expectations for us.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:40.760 align:middle line:90%
Now, this stage of the journey--

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.970 align:middle line:84%
we're challenged with the
task of owning and integrating

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:45.370 align:middle line:90%
our shadow side.

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:48.120 align:middle line:84%
If we haven't done it
already, it's time.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is another
important rite

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.730 align:middle line:84%
of passage on the
hero's journey.

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:55.910 align:middle line:84%
We must come to understand
that perceptions

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:59.360 align:middle line:84%
that are based in duality,
separation, and materialism

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.150 align:middle line:90%
are just false and illusory.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:05.600 align:middle line:84%
Our task is to find balance
between light and dark

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.810 align:middle line:84%
and to become centered in
the middle pillar that unites

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:12.020 align:middle line:90%
all the polarities into one.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Once we're in control of this,
rather than the Devil being

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.090 align:middle line:84%
in control of us,
he will actually

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:20.060 align:middle line:90%
bring us great benefit.

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.830 align:middle line:84%
That's because he's
also what actually

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:24.110 align:middle line:90%
brings a sense of renewal.

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:27.800 align:middle line:84%
When we feel our limitations
and we become fed up with them,

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.020 align:middle line:84%
that's what motivates
us to actually free

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:34.250 align:middle line:84%
ourselves and choose
to take our chains off.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:40.198 align:middle line:84%
So this key represents the first
stage of spiritual unfoldment.

00:12:40.198 --> 00:12:42.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, what are some other
important correspondences

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:45.030 align:middle line:90%
of the Devil?

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, his esoteric
title or secret name

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:50.480 align:middle line:84%
is the Lord of the
Gates of Matter

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:54.400 align:middle line:84%
and the Child of
the Forces of Time.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.400 align:middle line:84%
His element that he is
associated with is Earth.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's an active
Earth, because it

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:03.170 align:middle line:84%
corresponds to the
astrological sign of Capricorn.

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And in astrology, Capricorn
also rules the tenth house

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:08.820 align:middle line:90%
of career and social status.

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And in turn, it's ruled
by the planet Saturn.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:15.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, Saturn is a double-ringed
planet that is most associated

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:19.990 align:middle line:84%
with things like balance,
discipline, limitation,

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:24.330 align:middle line:84%
and doing things in a methodical
and step-by-step manner.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.220 align:middle line:84%
A Capricorn helps people
to become successful.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:30.730 align:middle line:84%
Because it gives them a sense
of purpose and a lot of work

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:32.350 align:middle line:90%
ethic as well.

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Capricorn wants to be respected
and is very much concerned

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:40.510 align:middle line:84%
about its status and
reputation in the community.

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And some of the positive
strengths and virtues

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:47.140 align:middle line:84%
that can be awakened within
us through this process

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:50.660 align:middle line:84%
are heightened
perception, reproduction,

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:54.490 align:middle line:84%
a sense of fearlessness,
strength of will,

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:57.070 align:middle line:84%
also being willing to
look inward for guidance

00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:00.190 align:middle line:84%
and to see things as they
are, rather than as you

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:02.530 align:middle line:90%
want them to be.

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:05.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, these are the balanced
or pure expressions

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:09.340 align:middle line:84%
of this key when we've
really conquered our shadow.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:12.460 align:middle line:84%
But when we're still
chained to the shadow

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:16.330 align:middle line:84%
and we're still falling into
its weaknesses or distortions,

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:18.100 align:middle line:84%
the kinds of things
we need to look out

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:20.740 align:middle line:84%
for here that are the
vices of the Devil

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:23.560 align:middle line:84%
include things like
deception, being

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:27.790 align:middle line:84%
bound to our fears,
control and power issues

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:30.130 align:middle line:90%
as well as obsession.

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:32.950 align:middle line:84%
The other big danger that we
need to watch out for here

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:36.130 align:middle line:90%
is having an inflated ego.

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, this was captured expertly
in the "Star Wars" story

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.790 align:middle line:84%
of Anakin Skywalker
who became Darth Vader.

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:45.760 align:middle line:84%
He fell to the dark side,
because his ego was just

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.080 align:middle line:90%
too big.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:51.520 align:middle line:84%
He lacked patience, humbleness,
and trust in his Jedi mentors.

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.365 align:middle line:84%
And he thought that
he knew better.

00:14:53.365 --> 00:14:56.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, he thought that he
was doing the right thing.

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:58.630 align:middle line:10%
But it was his ego
that was driving him.

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:01.620 align:middle line:10%
And spiritual arrogance
is what caused his fall.

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:04.340 align:middle line:10%


00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:07.820 align:middle line:10%
So how has the Devil
shown up in your life?

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.170 align:middle line:10%
Have you ever been to
Sin City, AKA Las Vegas

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:12.910 align:middle line:10%
for a weekend of indulgence?

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:15.295 align:middle line:84%
Well, welcome to the
Devil's playground.

00:15:15.295 --> 00:15:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And remember the phrase,
money is the root of all evil?

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:20.890 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's not true.

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:24.370 align:middle line:84%
The full original verse
is the love of money

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:26.150 align:middle line:90%
is the root of all evil.

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:29.290 align:middle line:84%
So the issue isn't whether
you have money or not.

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:31.750 align:middle line:84%
It's really more
about what you use it

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:35.860 align:middle line:84%
for that makes it either a
tool of good or a tool of evil.

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And the more you recognize the
Devil at work in your life,

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:41.920 align:middle line:84%
the more you will also connect
with one of your parallel lives

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:46.270 align:middle line:84%
where the Devil is the
dominant archetype.

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:48.760 align:middle line:84%
So what might one of
our parallel lives

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.980 align:middle line:84%
be like under this
archetype of the Devil?

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:55.420 align:middle line:84%
He thinks that the power
comes from his own ego self

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.180 align:middle line:90%
and material gains.

00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And this kind of ego
inflation is a real danger

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.610 align:middle line:90%
on any path of spiritual power.

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:05.560 align:middle line:84%
But there is another
possibility of how

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.580 align:middle line:84%
this archetype might manifest
in a more positive way.

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:10.690 align:middle line:84%
That's because the
Devil also represents

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:14.080 align:middle line:84%
the universal principle
of mirth and humor,

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.480 align:middle line:90%
combined with stability.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.160 align:middle line:10%
Those who embody
this archetype find

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.800 align:middle line:10%
that it's important to
maintain a sense of humor

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.340 align:middle line:10%
and productivity
at the same time.

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:26.620 align:middle line:84%
Think of a comedian who
really just calls it

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:29.140 align:middle line:84%
like he sees it and has
an ability to bring humor

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.750 align:middle line:90%
to very worldly situations.

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:34.810 align:middle line:84%
Being able to accept and even
laugh at our human foibles

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:38.830 align:middle line:84%
is one way to bring light
to life's situations.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:40.520 align:middle line:90%
Laughter is good medicine.

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:43.240 align:middle line:90%


00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And by working with the Devil
in invoking these energies

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:49.960 align:middle line:84%
into your life, you too can
awaken your sense of humor

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.880 align:middle line:90%
and conquer your shadow.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:57.580 align:middle line:10%
Remember that this represents
your own shadow side.

00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:00.520 align:middle line:84%
After recognizing where
our shadow attachments

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.640 align:middle line:84%
and stagnations are, the next
step on our hero's journey

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:04.880 align:middle line:90%
brings us to the Tower.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.480 align:middle line:90%


00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:11.980 align:middle line:10%
Now, the Tower shakes things up
to get us to move again and not

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.230 align:middle line:10%
stay stuck in the shadow.

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:17.800 align:middle line:84%
The universe sends us
a bolt from the blue

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:21.400 align:middle line:84%
that shakes us to the core
and rocks our foundation,

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.560 align:middle line:84%
reminding us that
we're not as in control

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.633 align:middle line:90%
as we'd like to think.

00:17:25.633 --> 00:17:27.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, it differs from
the changes that

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:30.320 align:middle line:84%
can be brought on by the
wheel and the death keys.

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.800 align:middle line:84%
Because those often
relate more to changes

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.350 align:middle line:90%
in our outer circumstances.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:39.910 align:middle line:84%
What the Tower strikes down is
our old belief system, which

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:43.570 align:middle line:84%
we've worked so hard to build,
that our identity has become

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:46.320 align:middle line:90%
wrapped up in it.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.530 align:middle line:84%
The Tower itself represents
the ego's fortress

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:53.370 align:middle line:84%
of rationalization, and
excuses, and false identities,

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:55.320 align:middle line:90%
and limiting beliefs.

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.740 align:middle line:84%
The bricks that build this Tower
are the words and the stories

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:03.120 align:middle line:84%
that we tell ourselves to
reinforce our false identity.

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And like a castle built on
sand or the Tower of Babel,

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:08.620 align:middle line:84%
this mindset doesn't
serve our progression.

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:12.000 align:middle line:10%
So the life power intervenes
with a wake-up call

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.370 align:middle line:10%
to help us out of
this gross mistake.

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:17.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, that wake-up
call might feel more

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:20.760 align:middle line:84%
like a rude awakening,
but that awakening

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:25.750 align:middle line:84%
is the main theme or
keyword for this archetype.

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:27.420 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately,
that awakening

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:30.060 align:middle line:84%
might need to take the
form of a downfall.

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:34.290 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes our ego needs
to hit bottom to finally let

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:35.550 align:middle line:90%
go of its addictions.

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:38.700 align:middle line:90%


00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:43.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Tower's numerology
is ruled by the number 16.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And 16 represents the
victory over the ego

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:50.400 align:middle line:84%
as well as spiritual
rebirth and illumination.

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.730 align:middle line:84%
It's a combination
of 1 and 6, which

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:56.610 align:middle line:84%
is self-consciousness and
discernment in our choices.

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:59.240 align:middle line:84%
So it relates to the magician
and the lover's keys.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.710 align:middle line:84%
But these numbers
also add up to 7.

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is the outer expression
of the essence in the Chariot

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:10.610 align:middle line:84%
card as well as victory over the
negative ego and shadow side.

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:13.830 align:middle line:90%


00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Let's now explore the imagery
and symbolism of the Tower

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.170 align:middle line:90%
card.

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:22.240 align:middle line:10%
We see a flash of lightning
has struck a tower from above.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:26.240 align:middle line:10%
And when it strikes, a
crown flies off the rooftop.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.940 align:middle line:10%
The Tower is set on fire
and a king and queen

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:32.510 align:middle line:10%
fall from the Tower,
down to the rocks below.

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:36.750 align:middle line:84%
Flames of fire also rain
down in the night sky.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:37.550 align:middle line:90%
[THUNDER]

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And the lightening flashes
a masculine symbol.

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.650 align:middle line:90%
It's the power from above.

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:46.970 align:middle line:84%
This light or force breaks
down existing forms in order

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:51.980 align:middle line:84%
to release their trapped energy
and make room for new ones.

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:55.010 align:middle line:10%
The lightning flash is also in
the shape of the flaming sword,

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:57.290 align:middle line:10%
which traverses down
the tree of life

00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:01.820 align:middle line:10%
as the energy moves from the
source, down into the physical.

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:04.160 align:middle line:84%
This is a symbol of
divine intervention

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:08.900 align:middle line:84%
that causes a spontaneous
shift or restructuring.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:13.550 align:middle line:84%
It's this sudden influx of
spiritual consciousness.

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:15.740 align:middle line:10%
Falling figures
represent the chained up

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:19.250 align:middle line:10%
prisoners, the man and
woman from the Devil key.

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:20.840 align:middle line:10%
They fall head first here.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:24.200 align:middle line:10%
Because this sudden influx
of spiritual consciousness

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:28.390 align:middle line:10%
completely upsets their old
notions about themselves.

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:30.260 align:middle line:10%
Their red and blue
clothing also shows

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:36.132 align:middle line:10%
a mixture of self-conscious
and subconscious activities.

00:20:36.132 --> 00:20:38.090 align:middle line:10%
The crown knocked off
from the top of the Tower

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:41.840 align:middle line:10%
represents the dethroning
of materialistic ideas

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:46.460 align:middle line:10%
where we crowned matter as this
ruling principle of existence,

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:50.810 align:middle line:10%
also the egoic notion
that our individual will

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:53.910 align:middle line:10%
trumps that of the universe.

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:56.270 align:middle line:10%
Now, the flames of fire
that are raining down

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:59.990 align:middle line:10%
are actually 22 yods,
which are said to be

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:03.320 align:middle line:10%
the divine spark or the seed.

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.950 align:middle line:10%
Now, these represent the
22 archetypal forces.

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:09.740 align:middle line:10%
10 yods are on the
one side, which

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:13.040 align:middle line:10%
represent the 10th sefirot
of the tree of life,

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:16.100 align:middle line:10%
while there are 12 on the
other side representing the 12

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:18.550 align:middle line:10%
zodiac signs.

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And they hang in
the air to indicate

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:23.000 align:middle line:84%
that these archetypal
forces don't rest

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.070 align:middle line:90%
upon a physical foundation.

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:29.290 align:middle line:84%
They rest upon a
non-physical foundation.

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:33.010 align:middle line:84%
So what's the Tower
trying to show us?

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:35.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, where the Devil
was about becoming

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:39.370 align:middle line:84%
aware of self-imposed
chains that bond us,

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:45.080 align:middle line:84%
the Tower brings us a rapid
release from those chains.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.120 align:middle line:84%
When the lightning
strikes, it does so

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:50.210 align:middle line:84%
suddenly and powerfully,
that it swiftly

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:55.610 align:middle line:84%
destroys what no longer
serves so that we can rebuild.

00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And the Tower is
actually the birth canal

00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:59.690 align:middle line:84%
from the Devil and
the hell that we've

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:04.340 align:middle line:84%
created for ourselves into
the star or the bright future.

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:07.340 align:middle line:10%
Now, this key actually
represents a rebirth

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:10.340 align:middle line:10%
and when we're emerging from
the ordinary, everyday level

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:13.340 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness into a
type of consciousness that's

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:17.410 align:middle line:10%
free from societal and
cultural programming,

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:20.180 align:middle line:10%
And like any birth, this
rebirth is traumatic.

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:23.230 align:middle line:84%
But fortunately, it's
relatively quick.

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And our new self
will be born healthy

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:27.260 align:middle line:84%
and live happily
ever after, which

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:31.770 align:middle line:84%
is what the rest of the
keys ahead are about.

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:35.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's go through some other
correspondences for the Tower.

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:37.950 align:middle line:84%
Its esoteric title
or secret name

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:40.940 align:middle line:84%
is the Lord of the
Hosts of the Mighty.

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And its element is
fire, which relates

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:45.240 align:middle line:84%
to its astrological
correspondence,

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.400 align:middle line:90%
the planet Mars.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.380 align:middle line:90%
So this red planet--

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:53.450 align:middle line:84%
its color signifying an
energy that it possesses.

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And it corresponds
with this element

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:57.090 align:middle line:84%
of fire, which gives
it the force that

00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:59.325 align:middle line:90%
is needed to take action.

00:22:59.325 --> 00:23:03.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, Mars rules Aries,
which is the emperor sign.

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And it co-rules Scorpio,
which relates to death, along

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:11.260 align:middle line:90%
with Pluto co-ruling Scorpio.

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And it also rules the
first house of the south.

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:19.340 align:middle line:84%
So Mars is in control of that
first house of our own self.

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:22.505 align:middle line:84%
And it co-rules
the eighth house.

00:23:22.505 --> 00:23:25.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, traditionally,
Mars is the God of War.

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And in modern astrology, he
represents the prime source

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:31.790 align:middle line:90%
of energy in our horoscope.

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:33.730 align:middle line:84%
So wherever it is
in your natal chart

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:35.260 align:middle line:84%
or wherever it's
transiting, that's

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:40.460 align:middle line:84%
where our energy comes from
or is focused right now.

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And Mars can be aggressive if
its energy isn't controlled,

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:48.250 align:middle line:84%
which would make accidents
or mishaps occur.

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:50.440 align:middle line:84%
It also, though, has
an adventurous spirit,

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:53.470 align:middle line:84%
which will prompt it to
forge ahead, even when

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:58.360 align:middle line:84%
more timid souls would prefer
to wait for better conditions.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Some other keywords
associated with the Tower

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:06.730 align:middle line:84%
include awakening, unexpected
change, revelation,

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:10.180 align:middle line:84%
tearing down the old to build
the new, upon a stronger

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:12.070 align:middle line:90%
foundation.

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
strengths and virtues

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.820 align:middle line:84%
that it helps us to achieve
or awaken within ourselves

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:20.110 align:middle line:84%
is a rebirth, a
spiritual awakening.

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:23.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, these strengths are the
balanced and pure expression

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:24.640 align:middle line:90%
of the Tower.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.290 align:middle line:84%
But when any of it goes
into an imbalanced state,

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:31.610 align:middle line:84%
it produces the weakness or the
shadow aspects of the Tower.

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:33.350 align:middle line:84%
So some of those
shadow aspects that we

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:35.630 align:middle line:84%
need to watch out
for here include

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:38.970 align:middle line:90%
pessimism, a fear of change.

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And another big thing
to watch out for

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:45.230 align:middle line:84%
is releasing repressed energy
in an angry or destructive way.

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:47.816 align:middle line:90%


00:24:47.816 --> 00:24:50.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, how does the Tower
show up in your life?

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:54.292 align:middle line:84%
Well, think of times when you've
encountered the Tower in life.

00:24:54.292 --> 00:24:55.750 align:middle line:84%
There may have been
a time when you

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:58.330 align:middle line:84%
went through a
radical transformation

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:02.320 align:middle line:84%
or tore down old structures
and limiting patterns in life.

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:05.630 align:middle line:84%
It would have brought upset and
disruption to your normal flow.

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And it would have been really
difficult to get through,

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.310 align:middle line:90%
but you knew it had to happen.

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:12.430 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps your core
beliefs were challenged

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:16.390 align:middle line:84%
or you woke up to realize
that who you think you are

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:18.730 align:middle line:84%
and what you think
is important in life

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:21.050 align:middle line:90%
just really isn't the truth.

00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And it was built upon illusions
and faulty foundation.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:29.920 align:middle line:84%
Castles that are built on
sand ultimately crumble.

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:33.670 align:middle line:84%
But like the phoenix who burns
itself up in its own nest,

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:38.110 align:middle line:84%
the Tower also helps us to rise
again into our greater glory.

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:40.750 align:middle line:84%
So think of when you felt
like a phoenix rising

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:43.330 align:middle line:84%
from the ashes of
your former life.

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:46.330 align:middle line:84%
Those were Tower
experiences in your life.

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And the more you
come to recognize

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:50.567 align:middle line:84%
the Tower in your
life here and now,

00:25:50.567 --> 00:25:52.150 align:middle line:84%
the more it will
also help connect you

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:54.610 align:middle line:84%
with one of your parallel
lives where the Tower is

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:56.270 align:middle line:90%
the dominant archetype.

00:25:56.270 --> 00:26:01.180 align:middle line:90%


00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:03.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, Tower people are
really good at tearing down

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:06.990 align:middle line:84%
old structures that have
outworn their usefulness

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:09.090 align:middle line:84%
as well as rebuilding
or restoring

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:12.620 align:middle line:84%
things to their original
glory and potential.

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:14.790 align:middle line:84%
A one very literal
example of this

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:16.890 align:middle line:84%
might be contractors
in the industry

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:21.760 align:middle line:84%
of building restoration or
demolition and reconstruction.

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.010 align:middle line:84%
Or it could also be
applied as a consultant

00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:26.230 align:middle line:90%
in company restructuring.

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:28.480 align:middle line:84%
They're skilled at
sensing what needs

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.850 align:middle line:84%
to get transformed
to bring things

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:34.300 align:middle line:90%
into greater functionality.

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:37.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, another way that the
Tower archetype manifests

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:40.180 align:middle line:84%
that's actually very
active in our world today

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:42.610 align:middle line:90%
is as a disruptor.

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:45.550 align:middle line:84%
So for example, the name
of today's innovation game

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:49.210 align:middle line:84%
is to find the next
"disruptive" technology.

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:51.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, these inventors
bring radical changes

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.050 align:middle line:90%
to our way of life.

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:57.610 align:middle line:84%
But also, there's the disruptors
of the status quo in society.

00:26:57.610 --> 00:27:00.410 align:middle line:90%


00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And when the status quo has
become stale and corrupt,

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:07.090 align:middle line:84%
there's always going to be
a rising up of anger or Mars

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:09.880 align:middle line:84%
energy by those who
feel disregarded.

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:13.600 align:middle line:90%


00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:17.050 align:middle line:84%
Tower people come with a
warrior's mission like David

00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:22.840 align:middle line:84%
to take down Goliath or Jack
who killed the greedy giant.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:26.500 align:middle line:84%
But they do so with the aim of
renovating or restoring things

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:30.120 align:middle line:90%
to their greater potential.

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.850 align:middle line:10%
And by working with the Tower
and invoking its energies

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:35.970 align:middle line:10%
into your life, you too
can awaken your ability

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:40.910 align:middle line:10%
to rise like the phoenix
out of the ashes.

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:43.130 align:middle line:10%
Join me again, as
we explore further

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:45.380 align:middle line:10%
into the 22 archetypes
of tarot and how

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:49.310 align:middle line:10%
they can help us to make our
big shift in consciousness.

00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:50.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard.

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:53.060 align:middle line:84%
