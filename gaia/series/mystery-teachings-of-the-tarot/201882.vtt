00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.660 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard, and
this is "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.070 align:middle line:90%


00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.680 align:middle line:10%
What does it mean to be
multi-dimensional beings,

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.260 align:middle line:10%
and how do we
expand our awareness

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.477 align:middle line:10%
to harness the
fullness of who we are?

00:00:29.477 --> 00:00:31.060 align:middle line:84%
In this season of
"Mystery Teachings,"

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.280 align:middle line:84%
we embark on a journey
of self-discovery

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.820 align:middle line:84%
and transformation
through the 22 archetypes

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.790 align:middle line:90%
of our multi-dimensional self.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.850 align:middle line:84%
So a big part of this
journey is about helping

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.630 align:middle line:84%
us to, one, recognize
our multi-dimensionality,

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.930 align:middle line:84%
to recognize how these
22 archetypes play

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.240 align:middle line:84%
in our own life,
but also how they

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.483 align:middle line:84%
play in the life of our
higher self that has these 22

00:00:55.483 --> 00:00:56.525 align:middle line:90%
different parallel lives.

00:00:56.525 --> 00:00:59.710 align:middle line:90%


00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.560 align:middle line:84%
What do we mean
by parallel lives?

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, the idea goes
back to our true self

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.070 align:middle line:84%
as being something that
is beyond this hologram

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.240 align:middle line:90%
of this physical universe.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.690 align:middle line:84%
So if we were to
think of our true self

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.200 align:middle line:84%
as being beyond the
hologram, beyond the quantum

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.400 align:middle line:84%
sea in a place, metaphysically,
that we call the Great Central

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.540 align:middle line:84%
Sun, from that place
of our true self,

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.830 align:middle line:84%
there are 22 archetypal
rays or aspects

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.420 align:middle line:84%
of that true self that are
sent out through the universe.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And they go to
different planets,

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.030 align:middle line:84%
so each one becomes a being
on a different planet.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And then, from those
different places

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.530 align:middle line:84%
where our true self
emanates out to,

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.320 align:middle line:84%
it then reflects those
rays and those energies

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.770 align:middle line:84%
back to all the other
22 planets again.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.010 align:middle line:84%
So we one of those
planets is here on Earth,

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.880 align:middle line:84%
but we could also be out
in the Sirius system.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.670 align:middle line:90%
We could be out in the Pleiades.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.910 align:middle line:84%
We could be having
various aspects of ourself

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.450 align:middle line:90%
in 22 different planets.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And then, from those
places, those 22 archetypes

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.260 align:middle line:84%
get reflected back
here to Earth.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And our higher self that has
its emanations here on Earth

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.840 align:middle line:84%
then has 22 archetypes also
being emanated down to Earth

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.100 align:middle line:90%
and incarnating.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.320 align:middle line:84%
So when we say
parallel lives, it's

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.680 align:middle line:84%
like we have 22 different
aspects of our higher

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.820 align:middle line:84%
self living out these lives
here on Earth in parallel

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.910 align:middle line:84%
with each other, but they're
either on slightly different

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.880 align:middle line:84%
frequencies or they're
just different people

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.690 align:middle line:84%
who are having a life under a
different archetypal influence.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.340 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of similar to why
we don't hear all the radio

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.760 align:middle line:84%
stations being broadcast all at
once, because we're only tuned

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.790 align:middle line:90%
in to one frequency station.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And as we become more
aware of these archetypes

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.290 align:middle line:84%
and how they play
out in our lives,

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.310 align:middle line:84%
we can then start to consciously
connect with our higher self,

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.770 align:middle line:84%
and then that will also
help us consciously

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.960 align:middle line:84%
connect with these
parallel lives.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And the whole goal
is to ultimately

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.720 align:middle line:84%
bring those 22 into
one, to bring them

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.100 align:middle line:84%
all to coherence so that we can
live as our higher self, fully

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.290 align:middle line:84%
embodied and manifested
into this physical life.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.850 align:middle line:84%
So that is a matter of becoming
aware, becoming more expanded

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.040 align:middle line:84%
in our consciousness
of who we are.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And then, as we merge
those 22 down to one

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.280 align:middle line:84%
and we live as our higher
self, then our higher self

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.940 align:middle line:84%
steps onto its next journey of
not only mastering this life

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.940 align:middle line:84%
here on Earth, but then
becoming a galactic being

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.120 align:middle line:84%
and connecting with its other
22 emanations on other planets.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.238 align:middle line:90%


00:03:49.238 --> 00:03:51.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we had this kind of
multi-dimensional awareness

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.620 align:middle line:84%
of all these parallel
lives, our entire world view

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.680 align:middle line:84%
would shift from
how it is today.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.350 align:middle line:84%
For one thing, judgments
would fade away.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.260 align:middle line:84%
We'd no longer
judge our mistakes

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.720 align:middle line:84%
because we'd realize
that all of them

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.900 align:middle line:84%
brought different
learning opportunities.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.140 align:middle line:10%
We'd also no longer feel
competitive or jealous

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.690 align:middle line:10%
about the success of
others because, in one

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.910 align:middle line:10%
of our parallel
lives and realities,

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.510 align:middle line:10%
we are the champion and
the best of our class.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.880 align:middle line:84%
So many of the frailties
of our human ego

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.000 align:middle line:84%
would vanish because of
this expanded awareness

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.730 align:middle line:90%
of our total self.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.130 align:middle line:90%
Now, why 22?

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's based on the
structure of the tree of life.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.830 align:middle line:84%
There are 10 sefirot
on the tree of life

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.560 align:middle line:84%
and 22 paths that
connect those together.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.070 align:middle line:84%
The spheres represent
objective states of being,

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.100 align:middle line:84%
while the pathways represent
the subjective experience

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.830 align:middle line:84%
of traveling between them,
and they're often referred

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.350 align:middle line:90%
to as states of becoming.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.310 align:middle line:84%
These 22 pathways basically
define the key lessons

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.550 align:middle line:84%
and transformations that we're
meant to go through in life.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.550 align:middle line:84%
Each path invokes an energy
that brings movement,

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.390 align:middle line:84%
and it shifts us from one
state of being to another.

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.680 align:middle line:84%
In essence, they catalyze
spiritual and personal alchemy.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.470 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything that can
help us better understand

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.450 align:middle line:90%
what these archetypes are?

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.900 align:middle line:90%
Fortunately, yes.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.160 align:middle line:84%
While there's many layers
to these archetypes,

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.930 align:middle line:84%
one tool that we
can use that makes

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.690 align:middle line:84%
them more relatable
to our physical lives

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.810 align:middle line:84%
is the Major Arcana
of the tarot.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.410 align:middle line:10%
The term arcana comes from the
Latin arcanum, which basically

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.560 align:middle line:10%
means a mystery or a secret.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.360 align:middle line:84%
Before we go much
further, let me first

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.110 align:middle line:84%
clarify that tarot does
not come from Kabbalah,

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.900 align:middle line:84%
but it can be related
because the tree of life

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.360 align:middle line:84%
is a universal
template for organizing

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.800 align:middle line:84%
information about our lives
and the universe as a whole.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.390 align:middle line:10%
And the Major Arcana do
relate to the 22 archetypes

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.060 align:middle line:10%
of our physical
life experiences,

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.580 align:middle line:10%
so they can be mapped onto the
tree of life and its 22 paths.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.670 align:middle line:10%
These correlations of the
archetypes to the paths

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.860 align:middle line:10%
were first made by a French
initiate, Eliphas Levi,

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.270 align:middle line:10%
over 100 years ago,
and then he was

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.670 align:middle line:10%
followed by other initiates
of the Western mystery school

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.350 align:middle line:10%
tradition.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Although, there are still some
debates about the exact order

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.060 align:middle line:90%
and mapping.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.040 align:middle line:10%
So for our purposes
in this journey,

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.180 align:middle line:10%
we'll follow the sequence of
the universal Rider-Waite-Smith

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.130 align:middle line:10%
tarot deck.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.530 align:middle line:10%
This deck was first
designed in 1909

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.020 align:middle line:10%
by Arthur Edward Waite
and Pamela Colman

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.810 align:middle line:10%
Smith, two initiates of
the original Hermetic

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.720 align:middle line:10%
Order of the Golden Dawn.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.220 align:middle line:84%
The reason that we
use this deck is

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.480 align:middle line:84%
that Waite was a scholar of
alchemy, Kabbalah, Hermetics,

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.700 align:middle line:84%
and other initiatory
teachings, and he

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.550 align:middle line:84%
drew from his vast knowledge,
training, and insights

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.320 align:middle line:90%
into mystical wisdom.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And then he teamed
up with Pamela Smith

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.507 align:middle line:84%
to incorporate this into
her intuitive artistry.

00:06:57.507 --> 00:06:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And the results of
their collaboration

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.360 align:middle line:84%
produced one of the most
universal, accurate,

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:07.930 align:middle line:84%
and pure decks of archetypal
and alchemical symbolism.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.628 align:middle line:90%
Where does tarot come from?

00:07:10.628 --> 00:07:12.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, the tarot that
we know of today

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.290 align:middle line:84%
mostly traces its history
back to renaissance Italy

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:17.210 align:middle line:90%
and France.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.860 align:middle line:84%
During the Renaissance,
the artists

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.490 align:middle line:84%
deliberately infused Hermetic
and alchemical wisdom

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.260 align:middle line:90%
into their art.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.720 align:middle line:84%
But the wisdom they
drew from had its roots

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.660 align:middle line:84%
in the ancient Egyptian
mystery schools of Thoth,

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.225 align:middle line:84%
the god of wisdom,
thousands of years earlier.

00:07:32.225 --> 00:07:34.980 align:middle line:90%


00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.990 align:middle line:84%
The Major Arcana, or the
22 keys of the tarot,

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:41.840 align:middle line:84%
is a picture book of
wisdom that depicts

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.570 align:middle line:84%
the journey of mystical
ascension and transformation.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, telling
a story through images

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:52.790 align:middle line:90%
was not new in the Renaissance.

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:54.920 align:middle line:84%
After all, this is
what the hieroglyphs

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:59.130 align:middle line:84%
on the temple walls of ancient
Egypt and Sumer were all about.

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:01.730 align:middle line:10%
And what the Renaissance
artists were basically doing

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:04.850 align:middle line:10%
was reinterpreting the
Egyptian hieroglyphs

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:08.460 align:middle line:10%
into European-style imagery.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.960 align:middle line:84%
According to oral teachings
that I've received in the Modern

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.190 align:middle line:84%
Mystery School,
the 22 archetypes

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.770 align:middle line:84%
depicted in the Major
Arcana were actually

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:19.480 align:middle line:84%
originally brought to Earth
by the family of Ra, who

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.430 align:middle line:84%
are a race of evolved,
intergalactic,

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.800 align:middle line:84%
and inter-dimensional
beings, and they've

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.820 align:middle line:84%
visited this planet many times
to support our progression

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.110 align:middle line:90%
of life on Earth.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.620 align:middle line:84%
The original 22 archetypes
were essentially

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.419 align:middle line:84%
anchored in the
forms of what we call

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:39.919 align:middle line:84%
the gods and goddesses of the
ancient Egyptian pantheon.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:43.340 align:middle line:10%
They embody the original
multi-dimensional patterns

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:47.000 align:middle line:10%
of universal energies, meaning
these archetypes were not

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.680 align:middle line:10%
just about humans.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.000 align:middle line:10%
They were universal.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.730 align:middle line:84%
But by the beginning
of the 1900s,

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:56.680 align:middle line:84%
the various tarot
decks throughout Europe

00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:00.080 align:middle line:84%
had become more
artistic than accurate.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.580 align:middle line:84%
So when Waite and Smith
set out to make a new deck,

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:07.510 align:middle line:84%
they wanted it to be both
artistic and accurate.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:10.870 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to restore it
to the universal archetypes,

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:13.625 align:middle line:84%
but in a way that we can
more easily relate to today.

00:09:13.625 --> 00:09:16.470 align:middle line:90%


00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, as we explore the
tarot in this journey,

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:22.690 align:middle line:84%
it's not for the
purposes of divination.

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:26.950 align:middle line:84%
But rather, we're using them
as windows into the self.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:28.690 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
we can, of course,

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:31.660 align:middle line:84%
use these as tools
to ask questions,

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:34.300 align:middle line:84%
and they can help us see
past our blind spots,

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:38.020 align:middle line:84%
our emotional attachments,
and our mental illusions.

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:42.340 align:middle line:10%
They show us the map of
our own mind and soul.

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:45.790 align:middle line:10%
Each card is full of meaning
and layers of symbolism

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:48.670 align:middle line:10%
that help us to connect
to the archetypes.

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:52.210 align:middle line:10%
And the symbols and the images,
they act like bridges or links

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:54.640 align:middle line:10%
that help lead us
back to their source

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.180 align:middle line:10%
within the archetypal realm.

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.570 align:middle line:84%
Symbols are the language
of the unconscious.

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:03.610 align:middle line:84%
They provide a tool
for our conscious mind

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:06.310 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with
our unconscious,

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:08.650 align:middle line:90%
and with the universal mind.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:11.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, each Major Arcana
key helps to bridge

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:15.040 align:middle line:84%
the gap between this
hologram that we live in

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:20.200 align:middle line:84%
and the spiritual worlds
that are beyond the hologram.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:24.405 align:middle line:84%
How do we use the tarot in
this journey of self-discovery?

00:10:24.405 --> 00:10:25.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, through this
process, we'll

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:30.510 align:middle line:84%
be working with just one or two
Major Arcana cards at a time.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:32.650 align:middle line:84%
The Major Arcana have
a sequence to them,

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:36.220 align:middle line:84%
and they are numbered
between 0 and 21.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.670 align:middle line:84%
This book of wisdom can actually
be read in either direction

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:42.130 align:middle line:90%
to reveal different secrets.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:46.150 align:middle line:10%
For example, when starting
with key 21, the world,

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:49.930 align:middle line:10%
and reading them in the reverse
sequence up until key 0,

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:52.360 align:middle line:10%
or the fool, they're
said to depict

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:57.070 align:middle line:10%
the creation story of the
world up to our present state.

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:59.920 align:middle line:84%
But when we follow the
forward direction of the keys

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.595 align:middle line:84%
from 0 to 21, they
describe a different story.

00:11:03.595 --> 00:11:06.960 align:middle line:90%


00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.370 align:middle line:84%
They lead us on a journey
of mystical ascension back

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:13.700 align:middle line:90%
to spiritual wisdom and oneness.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.363 align:middle line:84%
As we work with each one
in this forward sequence,

00:11:16.363 --> 00:11:17.780 align:middle line:84%
they lead us through
what's called

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:23.930 align:middle line:84%
the hero's journey, the
journey of self-actualization.

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Returning to Kabbalah
for a moment,

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:30.170 align:middle line:84%
recall that we said that the 22
Major Arcana can be mapped out

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:33.380 align:middle line:84%
onto the 22 paths
of the tree of life.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, each of these paths is
really more about the 22 Hebrew

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:40.460 align:middle line:84%
letters, which are said to be
an ancient language of light

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.440 align:middle line:90%
and creation.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, in addition to these
letters being associated

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.380 align:middle line:84%
with the tree of life, in the
"Sefer Yetzirah," or the "Book

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:50.630 align:middle line:84%
of Formation,"
they're also described

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:53.360 align:middle line:90%
as being arranged on a sphere.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.660 align:middle line:10%
And in this circular format,
when every letter is then

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.210 align:middle line:10%
connected to every
other letter, it

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:04.760 align:middle line:10%
forms a beautiful mandala
known as the 231 gates.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:07.670 align:middle line:84%
When we then match the tarot
keys with their Hebrew letters

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:12.190 align:middle line:84%
around this sphere, we can see
that it becomes like a wheel.

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:15.140 align:middle line:10%
Now, in this arrangement,
the key 0, or the fool,

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:18.110 align:middle line:10%
is placed at the top of
the wheel with aleph.

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Keys 1 through 10 then
descend down on the left side.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:26.780 align:middle line:10%
Between key 10, the wheel,
and key 11, justice,

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:30.110 align:middle line:10%
is what we call a turning
point at the bottom.

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:36.350 align:middle line:10%
And then keys 12 through 21
ascend up on the right side.

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:39.800 align:middle line:84%
As this wheel spins, it goes
through one complete cycle

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.210 align:middle line:90%
of the alchemical process.

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:47.210 align:middle line:10%
Now, in alchemy, the number
seven is also really important.

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:50.930 align:middle line:10%
There are seven stages in the
transformational process, which

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:53.480 align:middle line:10%
is something that we explored
in season three of "Mystery

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.760 align:middle line:10%
Teachings."

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.320 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Egyptian
mythology, there

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.870 align:middle line:84%
were also seven stages
of the soul's journey

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:01.680 align:middle line:90%
through the afterlife.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And in Hermetic
philosophy, there

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:07.460 align:middle line:84%
are seven Hermetic principles,
so this number seven shows up

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:10.850 align:middle line:90%
in many significant ways.

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:14.560 align:middle line:84%
We can also divide the tarot
keys into groups of seven.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.790 align:middle line:10%
When we do this,
the fool, or key 0,

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:19.400 align:middle line:10%
is put into its own
category because this

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:24.730 align:middle line:10%
represents us embarking
on the spiritual journey.

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:28.390 align:middle line:10%
Then keys 1 through 7, the
magician through the chariot,

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:33.000 align:middle line:10%
relate to the stages of
preparation for the great work.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.010 align:middle line:10%
These form the early lessons
of this journey that teach us

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:38.740 align:middle line:10%
about the archetypal
principles as powers

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:42.160 align:middle line:10%
within our own consciousness.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.330 align:middle line:10%
Then keys 8 through 14,
strength through temperance,

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.760 align:middle line:10%
connect to the
experiences of life

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.210 align:middle line:10%
that take us through the
first four stages of alchemy,

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:55.930 align:middle line:10%
which are calcination,
dissolution, separation,

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:58.210 align:middle line:10%
and conjunction.

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:01.660 align:middle line:10%
And finally, keys
15 through 21, which

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.690 align:middle line:10%
are the devil through
the world card,

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:08.140 align:middle line:10%
these represent the final
three stages of alchemy

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:13.300 align:middle line:10%
that refine our soul and bring
us more spiritual attainment,

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.780 align:middle line:10%
and those alchemical stages
relate to fermentation,

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:20.550 align:middle line:10%
distillation, and coagulation.

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:22.740 align:middle line:84%
We'll explore each
of these as we

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:26.010 align:middle line:84%
go through the journey of this
season's "Mystery Teachings."

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:28.890 align:middle line:90%


00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:34.870 align:middle line:84%
As we embark on the hero's
journey, we begin as the fool.

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:36.910 align:middle line:84%
That's because the
journey often begins

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:39.070 align:middle line:84%
as an innocent
quest for adventure

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:41.400 align:middle line:90%
and achievement of ideals.

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:44.770 align:middle line:84%
We're on a search
for universal wisdom

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:47.800 align:middle line:84%
and starting with
a beginner's mind.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:51.820 align:middle line:84%
We all begin as the neophyte,
someone who lacks experience

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:54.250 align:middle line:90%
on the path of higher wisdom.

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:57.310 align:middle line:84%
The fool thus takes
a leap of faith,

00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:02.020 align:middle line:84%
then walks that path
with complete trust.

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:06.220 align:middle line:90%
Now, the fool's number is 0.

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:09.020 align:middle line:84%
The beginner's mind
is an empty mind.

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:12.350 align:middle line:84%
It's full of nothing,
meaning nothing

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:15.410 align:middle line:84%
limits our thinking or
the possibilities we think

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:17.600 align:middle line:90%
are available to us.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:21.710 align:middle line:84%
0 means nothing, and in
Kabbalah, that means ayin.

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:24.890 align:middle line:84%
It's the gate of
stillness or emptiness

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:30.530 align:middle line:84%
that connects us to the gap,
the quantum zero-point field.

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:33.800 align:middle line:90%
From here, pure spirit emerges.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Our original self passes
through the gate of 0.

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:43.100 align:middle line:10%
If we turn to the imagery of
the tarot card of the fool,

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.430 align:middle line:10%
we see a youthful and
androgynous figure

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:48.740 align:middle line:10%
who is out smelling
the roses and taking

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.470 align:middle line:10%
in a glorious
breath of fresh air,

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:55.220 align:middle line:10%
looking out upon a great
expanse of land and sky,

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:57.740 align:middle line:10%
perched at the edge of a cliff.

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:01.400 align:middle line:84%
The fool's gaze is somewhere
off to the distant heights

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:05.080 align:middle line:84%
above and beyond his
current position.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, he also has his
magical gifts with him.

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.410 align:middle line:10%
These include a
hat with a feather

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:14.750 align:middle line:10%
in it, a white rose, a
staff, and a satchel.

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:17.390 align:middle line:10%
And he also has his trusty
loyal friend with him

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:20.720 align:middle line:10%
in the form of a white
puppy, and that kind of

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:24.820 align:middle line:10%
mimics the fool's gesture
if you look at its position.

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.600 align:middle line:10%
Now, this dog
represents something

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.120 align:middle line:10%
that was wild from
nature but now has

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:33.770 align:middle line:10%
become tamed and trained to
be a loyal friend or companion

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:36.290 align:middle line:10%
and a helper of man.

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:39.410 align:middle line:10%
Now, this card depicts
all four kingdoms

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:43.370 align:middle line:10%
of the mineral kingdom, which
is the ground, the vegetable

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:47.000 align:middle line:10%
kingdom, which we can see in
the flower and the wreath,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.360 align:middle line:10%
the animal kingdom, which is
represented here by the dog as

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.810 align:middle line:10%
well as the feather in his hat,
and the human kingdom, which

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:56.700 align:middle line:10%
is the fool himself.

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:59.640 align:middle line:84%
The feather also represents
the element of air

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:03.540 align:middle line:84%
as well as the feather of the
Egyptian goddess Maat, which

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:06.260 align:middle line:90%
stands for truth and purity.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.849 align:middle line:84%
And the primary
color of this card

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:12.240 align:middle line:84%
is bright pale yellow, which
is the color of the morning

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.550 align:middle line:84%
sunshine, and it's
also associated

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:16.960 align:middle line:90%
with that element of air.

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.950 align:middle line:10%
Now, also in the card,
we see a white sun above

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:24.000 align:middle line:10%
and snow-capped mountain
peaks in the background.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.680 align:middle line:84%
The white sun radiates pure
light and energy of source.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.870 align:middle line:10%
Let's also look at
the fool's clothing,

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:middle line:10%
because the clothing
always represents

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.160 align:middle line:10%
something in these cards.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:38.580 align:middle line:10%
Now, with the fool, he has
a white undergarment on,

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:40.080 align:middle line:10%
which is the inner robe.

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:43.150 align:middle line:10%
It represents the
light of wisdom.

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:44.940 align:middle line:10%
But covering over
the top of this

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:48.540 align:middle line:10%
is a black outer
coat lined with red,

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:51.570 align:middle line:10%
and then it also
has symbols upon it.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:54.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, the black
represents ignorance.

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:57.840 align:middle line:84%
The red represents
passion and fire.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.680 align:middle line:10%
And the decorations of green
leaves and yellow circles

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:06.860 align:middle line:10%
look like either fruit
or spirit wheels upon it.

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:09.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, his purse or his satchel
at the end of the staff

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:13.580 align:middle line:84%
represents stored
memory of his spirit

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:17.400 align:middle line:84%
and all of where he came from
prior to this adventure he

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.710 align:middle line:90%
is about to embark upon.

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:21.510 align:middle line:90%


00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:25.890 align:middle line:84%
But what is this card really
trying to show us and teach us?

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:29.790 align:middle line:84%
The fool is about developing
poise in the universe.

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:33.550 align:middle line:84%
It helps us also to renew
a sense of innocence.

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:37.600 align:middle line:84%
It brings childlike wisdom
in response to the world.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And it also involves
learning to keep

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:42.390 align:middle line:84%
this wisdom alive
within us while also

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:46.170 align:middle line:84%
infusing our physical life
with higher consciousness.

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:50.790 align:middle line:84%
Each day must be seen as new
and approached without fear.

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:54.390 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, the fool
also represents inexperience,

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:57.600 align:middle line:84%
which is why the life
power of our spirit

00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.700 align:middle line:84%
must enter into this
physical journey

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:05.220 align:middle line:84%
through life to gain
real life experience.

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.230 align:middle line:90%
The fool's element is air.

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:09.690 align:middle line:90%
It's about the breath of life.

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:12.480 align:middle line:84%
Our newly awakened
super-consciousness

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:16.020 align:middle line:84%
is preparing to
expand and to explore,

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.600 align:middle line:84%
and air is an
active element that

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:22.350 align:middle line:90%
likes to move and to expand.

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:25.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, each of these
keys has a secret name

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:28.350 align:middle line:84%
or what we call
an esoteric title,

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:31.590 align:middle line:84%
and the fool's secret name
is the spirit of the ether.

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:34.450 align:middle line:90%


00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:37.240 align:middle line:84%
The fool corresponds
with the planet Uranus.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Uranus is an oddball
planet with its rings

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:42.640 align:middle line:84%
that orbit vertically
rather than horizontally

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.470 align:middle line:90%
like the others.

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly, it
was also discovered

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:50.550 align:middle line:84%
by an amateur astronomer
instead of a professional.

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:53.590 align:middle line:84%
When this planet is
active within our chart,

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:56.840 align:middle line:90%
we can expect the unexpected.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.710 align:middle line:84%
This is the planet
of change, genius,

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:03.590 align:middle line:84%
unconventional behavior,
and revolution.

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:07.960 align:middle line:84%
In astrology, Uranus
co-rules Aquarius as well as

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:13.180 align:middle line:84%
the 11th house, or the house of
friendships, within the zodiac.

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:15.640 align:middle line:84%
Friendships also
relate to our network

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:18.410 align:middle line:84%
and how they support us
in our adventures in life,

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:22.060 align:middle line:84%
as well as the kind of
friend that we are to others.

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:24.940 align:middle line:84%
The 11th house also
speaks to destiny.

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:28.720 align:middle line:84%
In simple terms, it's
our hopes and our dreams,

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:34.100 align:middle line:84%
and it's what we desire or
want to achieve in life.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:35.990 align:middle line:10%
Now, other various
key words that

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:39.740 align:middle line:10%
are associated with the fool
include things like radiance,

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:45.200 align:middle line:10%
having courage, transcendence,
being willing to take risks,

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:49.610 align:middle line:10%
beginning a new adventure of any
kind, or being at a crossroads

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:52.760 align:middle line:10%
where we have to make
a big leap of faith,

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:56.360 align:middle line:10%
and feeling guided to
make that leap of faith.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.060 align:middle line:84%
It's also about
innocence and trust,

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:04.580 align:middle line:84%
and it's the unmanifested
yet unlimited potential.

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.590 align:middle line:84%
There's various
strengths and virtues

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:09.110 align:middle line:84%
that the fool helps
us to achieve.

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:12.350 align:middle line:84%
These include things like
self-assurance and awareness,

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:14.820 align:middle line:90%
as well as originality.

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, the fool doesn't
mind being different.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:20.870 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he's fairly aloof
to other people's opinions

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:23.360 align:middle line:84%
and their judgments, which is
something that we could all

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.470 align:middle line:90%
use a good dose of.

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:27.260 align:middle line:90%


00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:28.820 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to
any of these keys,

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:30.950 align:middle line:84%
they all have strengths
and weaknesses.

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:33.300 align:middle line:90%
They all have vices and virtues.

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we mean by
strengths or the virtues

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:39.140 align:middle line:84%
is that they are the
balanced and pure expression

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.150 align:middle line:90%
of that archetype.

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:43.370 align:middle line:84%
But the vices and
the weaknesses are

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:47.120 align:middle line:84%
more imbalanced or
distorted expressions

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:50.810 align:middle line:84%
of that archetype, maybe
too much or too little

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:53.420 align:middle line:90%
of that archetype's qualities.

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:57.680 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes to the
weaknesses and the vices

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:59.900 align:middle line:84%
and the shadow side,
what we want to do

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.410 align:middle line:84%
is recognize where
they're at, where

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:04.610 align:middle line:90%
we're expressing those vices.

00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And then we want to bring them
back into a state of balance

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:11.540 align:middle line:84%
rather than the imbalance
or the distortion.

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:14.660 align:middle line:10%
So for example,
with the fool, some

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:17.450 align:middle line:10%
of the weaknesses and the vices
that come up with the fool

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:22.640 align:middle line:10%
include being foolish or being
impractical or being completely

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:26.990 align:middle line:10%
oblivious, having a lack of
self-awareness of the impact

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:29.060 align:middle line:10%
that we have on others.

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:31.880 align:middle line:10%
One other way that the shadow
of the fool might show up

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:34.280 align:middle line:10%
is when we refuse
to try new things,

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:37.010 align:middle line:10%
we remain rigid or
psychologically stuck.

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:39.790 align:middle line:90%


00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:42.358 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to working
with tarot, one of the things

00:22:42.358 --> 00:22:44.650 align:middle line:84%
that we want to really take
a look at and pay attention

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:48.250 align:middle line:84%
to is, when are we expressing
the strengths and the virtues,

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:51.040 align:middle line:84%
and when are we expressing
the weaknesses, the vices,

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.630 align:middle line:90%
or the shadow side?

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:55.300 align:middle line:84%
It's really important for us
to acknowledge our own shadow

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:57.650 align:middle line:84%
side, to tell ourselves
the truth about it

00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:02.440 align:middle line:84%
and to really stare it in the
eye, to take a look at it.

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.630 align:middle line:84%
One, we have to accept
those parts of ourselves.

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:08.668 align:middle line:84%
We need to know, OK, yeah, I've
got this going on within me.

00:23:08.668 --> 00:23:10.210 align:middle line:84%
But we don't want
to just stop there.

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:12.700 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to just say,
well, it's just how I am.

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.340 align:middle line:84%
We want to also work
on transforming it.

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:18.160 align:middle line:84%
We want to dig into,
well, why am I that way?

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:20.860 align:middle line:84%
Why am I expressing
this kind of shadow

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.080 align:middle line:84%
aspect or this distortion
or this weakness

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.280 align:middle line:90%
of this archetype?

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.770 align:middle line:84%
What is it that I need
to shift within me?

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:31.210 align:middle line:10%
And that process of going into
the shadow, looking at it,

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:34.840 align:middle line:10%
really coming to understand
why we're expressing the shadow

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:39.670 align:middle line:10%
side, this is a huge part of
what we call spiritual alchemy.

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:44.530 align:middle line:84%
So when we do this work and
we really look at ourselves

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:47.470 align:middle line:84%
and we really face
it and we really

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:51.190 align:middle line:84%
start to question and
re-evaluate who we are

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:54.550 align:middle line:84%
and what we are and why
we're behaving that way,

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:58.590 align:middle line:84%
then we can start the
process of cleaning it up,

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:01.690 align:middle line:84%
of reprogramming
and shifting what

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:04.600 align:middle line:84%
we believe about ourselves
and about other people

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.840 align:middle line:84%
and how things are
or how we need to be.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And we can start then
paying more attention to,

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:10.400 align:middle line:90%
what are the strengths?

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.850 align:middle line:84%
What are the pure,
balanced expressions

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:17.710 align:middle line:84%
of this archetype that I could
be readjusting myself to?

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:20.350 align:middle line:84%
This is all about the
Principle of Polarity.

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:23.680 align:middle line:84%
Every quality is a
spectrum of energy.

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.450 align:middle line:90%
The balance point is the middle.

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:28.150 align:middle line:84%
That is the strength
or the virtue.

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:31.120 align:middle line:84%
But then, again, too
much or not enough,

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:34.880 align:middle line:84%
too little, those are where
we get into the imbalances.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:39.220 align:middle line:84%
But regardless of where
we are on this spectrum,

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:41.120 align:middle line:90%
we can then shift that energy.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:41.920 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:44.590 align:middle line:84%
This is the process of
what we call mental alchemy

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:46.930 align:middle line:84%
or spiritual alchemy,
that we can learn

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:50.110 align:middle line:84%
to take that energy from
wherever it is right now

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:52.630 align:middle line:84%
and shift it, change
its vibration,

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:55.150 align:middle line:84%
take it through the
transformational process,

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:59.350 align:middle line:84%
and bring it to
the balance point.

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:02.560 align:middle line:84%
This is the work that we
really want to dig into.

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:05.530 align:middle line:90%
This is the alchemy of the self.

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And when we do,
then what we find

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:13.270 align:middle line:84%
is that, within that shadow,
there is gold to be found.

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:16.390 align:middle line:84%
There are gifts to be
awakened within us.

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:19.310 align:middle line:84%
See, the shadow side
isn't our enemy.

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:21.010 align:middle line:90%
It's not our dark side.

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:23.260 align:middle line:90%
It's actually our teacher.

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:25.690 align:middle line:84%
So these are parts of
us within the shadow,

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:28.810 align:middle line:84%
hidden deep within the
subconscious of our being,

00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:32.710 align:middle line:84%
that we need to reclaim, that we
need to reawaken and bring them

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:35.440 align:middle line:84%
out and allow their expression,
but we want to do it

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:38.920 align:middle line:84%
in a way that is controlled,
that we can really

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.230 align:middle line:84%
be in greater
self-mastery of ourselves

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:43.750 align:middle line:84%
rather than it just
erupting from the depths

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:45.220 align:middle line:90%
of our subconscious.

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:48.220 align:middle line:84%
We want to consciously
start to work with it

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:50.680 align:middle line:84%
and transform our
shadow into light.

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:54.770 align:middle line:90%


00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:57.480 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at how the
fool shows up in our life

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.160 align:middle line:90%
here and now.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:02.490 align:middle line:84%
Think of times when you've
been the fool in life.

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:05.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, as children, we
all come into this world

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:08.640 align:middle line:84%
with that wide-eyed
wonder and innocence,

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.860 align:middle line:84%
and we're ignorant to
the ways of the world.

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we're
ready to learn.

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:16.290 align:middle line:84%
Everything is a new
adventure to a child.

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And when we're young,
there are very few limits

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.890 align:middle line:90%
upon our imagination.

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:24.270 align:middle line:84%
We have this desire to
laugh and to play, all

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:26.200 align:middle line:90%
to our heart's content.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:29.730 align:middle line:84%
So we all start
life as the fool.

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:33.240 align:middle line:84%
But even as adults, I'm
sure we can all recall times

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:38.100 align:middle line:84%
when we felt or acted
foolish, or perhaps there

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:40.680 align:middle line:84%
have been times where
we feared the future

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.050 align:middle line:84%
and lacked trust in the
universe to guide us.

00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:45.810 align:middle line:84%
That would be more
of the shadow side.

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:47.790 align:middle line:84%
The only way that we
can keep ourselves

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:50.310 align:middle line:84%
open to limitless
possibilities that

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:52.560 align:middle line:84%
are available in
any moment to us

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:55.860 align:middle line:84%
is if we can trust the
universe, and this is what

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:59.070 align:middle line:90%
the fool is here to teach us.

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:01.680 align:middle line:10%
As we begin this
work, I recommend

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:06.240 align:middle line:10%
doing some journaling on how,
when, and in what circumstances

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.840 align:middle line:10%
you found yourself
being the fool.

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.560 align:middle line:84%
Keep separate sections
for when you've

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.920 align:middle line:84%
expressed the positive qualities
and the strengths of the fool

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.320 align:middle line:84%
versus falling into the
weaknesses or the shadow

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.390 align:middle line:90%
aspects of the fool.

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:20.640 align:middle line:10%
The more you come to recognize
the fool in your life,

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.530 align:middle line:10%
the more it will
also connect you

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:25.470 align:middle line:10%
with one of your parallel
lives where the fool

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:27.180 align:middle line:10%
is the dominant archetype.

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:30.120 align:middle line:10%


00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:33.570 align:middle line:10%
What might our parallel life
be like under the archetype

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:35.380 align:middle line:10%
of the fool?

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:37.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, one example of
the fool manifesting

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:42.180 align:middle line:84%
is as a comedian, but not
just any type of comedian.

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:44.700 align:middle line:84%
Think of someone
like Charlie Chaplin.

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:47.160 align:middle line:90%
He was a genius of his trade.

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:50.370 align:middle line:84%
His ability to express
humor non-verbally

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:52.800 align:middle line:84%
through silent films
while yet still

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:57.190 align:middle line:84%
conveying the energy of the
message was unparalleled.

00:27:57.190 --> 00:28:01.710 align:middle line:84%
He harnessed the clown or the
fool archetype in the best way.

00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:04.800 align:middle line:84%
But the most
quintessential example

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:10.120 align:middle line:84%
of the fool manifesting into a
life is as the genius savant.

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:14.850 align:middle line:84%
Savants may stand out as
unusual, quirky, and maybe even

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:20.640 align:middle line:84%
OCD, but they display pure
genius in some area, often

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.530 align:middle line:90%
music, art, or math.

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:26.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, a good example of this
is Dustin Hoffman's character

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:29.190 align:middle line:90%
in the 1988 film "Rain Man."

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:31.980 align:middle line:84%
Most savants are
either born that way

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:35.730 align:middle line:84%
or acquire these abilities after
some accident such as a head

00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:37.020 align:middle line:90%
injury.

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:40.170 align:middle line:84%
But what's fascinating is
that psychiatrists are now

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:43.620 align:middle line:84%
reporting a phenomenon that
they call sudden savant

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:47.280 align:middle line:84%
syndrome where ordinary
people like you and me are

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:51.030 align:middle line:84%
spontaneously awakening
to genius capacities

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:54.160 align:middle line:84%
with no specific
incident triggering it.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:57.420 align:middle line:84%
Scientists are now proposing
that such genius abilities

00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:01.950 align:middle line:90%
may be innate within all of us.

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:06.150 align:middle line:84%
As a metaphysician, I'd
propose that the fool archetype

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:09.160 align:middle line:84%
was at play in these
people's lives.

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And by working with the fool
and invoking its energies

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:15.360 align:middle line:84%
into your life, you
too can spontaneously

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:18.270 align:middle line:90%
awaken your inner genius.

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:21.870 align:middle line:84%
We do it by actively
engaging with the symbols

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:25.590 align:middle line:84%
and consciously using them
as communication tools.

00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Take notes, record insights,
keep track of dreams.

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:31.170 align:middle line:84%
Notice the forces
and energies that

00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:34.020 align:middle line:84%
are set in motion in
your life, and notice

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:36.870 align:middle line:84%
what you learn about
yourself through the journey.

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And to really get the
most out of this journey,

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.370 align:middle line:90%
put the tools into application.

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:44.010 align:middle line:84%
This is about feeling
and experiencing

00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:46.580 align:middle line:84%
the energies come
alive in our own life.
