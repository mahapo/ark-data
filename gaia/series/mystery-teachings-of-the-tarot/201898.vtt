00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.730 align:middle line:10%
How can we sharpen both our
intuition and our discernment?

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, the answer is one of the
keys to the path of initiation

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.900 align:middle line:84%
in our ability to
integrate various levels

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.670 align:middle line:90%
of our consciousness.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.710 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we
take a deeper dive

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.860 align:middle line:10%
into the archetypes of The
Hierophant and The Lovers.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.510 align:middle line:10%
These are the
archetypal principles

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.880 align:middle line:10%
of initiation, communication,
and relationships.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.800 align:middle line:84%
If we were to align
the hero's journey

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.733 align:middle line:84%
with the stages of development
through our lifetime,

00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:51.150 align:middle line:84%
we're now at the
point where we're

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.160 align:middle line:84%
emerging from
infancy and childhood

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.130 align:middle line:84%
into our pre-teen
and teenage years.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.250 align:middle line:84%
These early stages are vital
in forming and reforming

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.670 align:middle line:84%
the foundations of
our self-identity.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.820 align:middle line:84%
So we're now moving beyond
the initial stages of angering

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.120 align:middle line:84%
those most basic archetypes of
masculine and feminine, father

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.790 align:middle line:84%
and mother, and are now
entering into the beginning

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.540 align:middle line:90%
stages of our earthly lessons.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.330 align:middle line:10%
The Hierophant brings
us into the education

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.910 align:middle line:10%
of the hero, our whole
reason for embarking

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.830 align:middle line:10%
on this journey of life.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.920 align:middle line:84%
This lesson is to learn,
grow, and educate ourselves

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.060 align:middle line:84%
through the grand experience
of life in the physical.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.680 align:middle line:84%
Through this education,
the Hierophant

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.990 align:middle line:84%
helps us to develop both
knowledge and intuition.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.500 align:middle line:10%
The Lovers represent our lessons
of choice and making decisions,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.920 align:middle line:10%
especially as we learn
the dance of polarity

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.020 align:middle line:10%
and the experience of
our world of duality,

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.870 align:middle line:10%
and we must exercise
our free will,

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.510 align:middle line:10%
and these are really
important stages

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.940 align:middle line:10%
of growth in our search
for self-actualization

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.070 align:middle line:10%
and self-mastery.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.910 align:middle line:10%
On the mandala wheel
of the 231 gates,

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.930 align:middle line:10%
as the wheel rotates clockwise
two keys five and six,

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.220 align:middle line:10%
we continue the descent down
the left side of the wheel.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.960 align:middle line:10%
Our next step on
the hero's journey

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.540 align:middle line:10%
brings us to The Hierophant.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.660 align:middle line:84%
The word hierophant
is archaic to us.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.360 align:middle line:10%
It comes, actually, from
the Eleusinian mysteries

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.430 align:middle line:10%
of ancient Greece
dating all the way back

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.450 align:middle line:10%
to the 15th century BC.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, the roots of
the name hierophant

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.500 align:middle line:84%
mean the revealer
of holy things.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.410 align:middle line:84%
He was the chief of the
mystery school of Eleusis.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, he oversaw the
sacred rites of initiation

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.340 align:middle line:90%
in the classical world.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.460 align:middle line:84%
He would also chant
sacred words and symbols

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.610 align:middle line:84%
during the celebrations
of the mysteries.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And he's the initiate's guide
it towards sacred knowledge,

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.400 align:middle line:90%
insight, and wisdom.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.380 align:middle line:84%
His main teaching
to the initiate

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.320 align:middle line:84%
is how to develop our
intuition, and to tune

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.110 align:middle line:84%
into our own inner
voice of wisdom,

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.410 align:middle line:84%
to connect with what we
call our inner teacher.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.090 align:middle line:84%
Much of the ancient
Greek mysteries

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.900 align:middle line:84%
were adapted also from
older Egyptian mysteries.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.260 align:middle line:10%
And many have ascribed
the Egyptian God Osiris

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.190 align:middle line:10%
in his role as the priest
King to the hierophant,

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.710 align:middle line:10%
just as they've also
related the young Isis

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.170 align:middle line:10%
to the high priestess.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.130 align:middle line:10%
In the Eleusinian mysteries,
both The High Priestess

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.890 align:middle line:10%
and The Hierophant
held equal rank.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.170 align:middle line:84%
They were people chosen
by their bloodline

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.920 align:middle line:90%
to fulfill these roles.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.180 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they were
inherited positions kind

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.060 align:middle line:90%
of similar to those of royalty.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.020 align:middle line:84%
The Hierophant represents
the active teaching element

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.100 align:middle line:84%
of what The High Priestess
is simply an embodiment of.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.920 align:middle line:10%
And they both preside
in temple settings,

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.070 align:middle line:10%
so their imagery is
inside of a temple.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.040 align:middle line:10%
This represents that the
wisdom that's inherited

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.540 align:middle line:10%
is within everything.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.000 align:middle line:84%
According to A. E.
Waite, The Hierophant

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.080 align:middle line:10%
symbolizes all things that
are righteous and sacred

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.490 align:middle line:10%
on the manifested side,
meaning within the outer world

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.520 align:middle line:10%
of manifestation.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, The Hierophant's key
number is number five.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.360 align:middle line:10%
And number five is a
number of mediation.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.320 align:middle line:84%
This is because it sits in the
very middle of the numbers one

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.730 align:middle line:90%
through nine.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.600 align:middle line:84%
Thus, it represents things
like transition, adaptation,

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.250 align:middle line:90%
intervention, and adjustment.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.630 align:middle line:84%
The five can be seen as
intellectual, communicative,

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.290 align:middle line:90%
and analytical.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.910 align:middle line:84%
It deals with learning and
education and communication.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And in its positive expression,
five can be very versatile,

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.610 align:middle line:90%
witty, quick thinking.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.380 align:middle line:84%
But when it's in its
negative expression,

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.570 align:middle line:84%
it becomes nervous, gossipy,
and overly critical.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And just as the number
five is considered

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.500 align:middle line:84%
a number of mediation,
so are humans considered

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.320 align:middle line:84%
to be the mediator
between Heaven and Earth,

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.010 align:middle line:90%
between the divine and nature.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And so, this is a key
concept of the mysteries

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.660 align:middle line:84%
and it's embedded within
many of the tarot archetypes.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.470 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.820 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a closer look at
the imagery of The Hierophant.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.190 align:middle line:10%
You see a man dressed
as a high priest,

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.490 align:middle line:10%
and he sits upon a throne
of gray stone between two

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.650 align:middle line:10%
pillars of the temple.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.080 align:middle line:10%
His outer robes are
red, representing

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.280 align:middle line:10%
the active masculine principle,
while his inner robes are blue,

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.550 align:middle line:10%
linking him to the
feminine high priestess.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.550 align:middle line:10%
His sleeves and the
accents are white,

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.250 align:middle line:10%
symbolizing enlightenment.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.750 align:middle line:84%
He also wears a
triple tiered crown.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And this crown has three,
seven, and five tray foils

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.120 align:middle line:90%
on each tier.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, the number three represents
the trinity of spirits.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.670 align:middle line:84%
The seven represents the seven
sacred planets, the seven

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.370 align:middle line:84%
chakras, everywhere we
see the number seven

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.200 align:middle line:90%
that shows up again and again.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And then, the five
represents the five elements

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.130 align:middle line:84%
of earth, water, air, and
fire, and the quintessence.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.800 align:middle line:10%
Now, The Hierophant
also holds a scepter

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.930 align:middle line:10%
with three cross
bars at the top,

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.990 align:middle line:10%
resembling the same
shape as the crown.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And these represent
having dominion

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:24.990 align:middle line:84%
over the physical, astral,
and mental planes of creation.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.940 align:middle line:10%
He's like the enlightened
Hermes Trismegistus,

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.740 align:middle line:10%
who is called Thrice Great
because he achieved the three

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.590 align:middle line:10%
parts of the philosophy
of the whole world,

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.390 align:middle line:10%
meaning he mastered
body, soul, and spirit.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, Hermes had two main
students, his son, Tat,

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.000 align:middle line:84%
and his star pupil,
Asclepius, who

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.260 align:middle line:90%
went on to teach and heal many.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.450 align:middle line:10%
And like Hermes, The Hierophant
has two monks or priests

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:54.790 align:middle line:10%
kneeling before him and
attentively listening

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:56.530 align:middle line:10%
to his teachings.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:01.030 align:middle line:10%
They symbolize the devotion
of initiates of the mysteries.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.540 align:middle line:10%
Now, their garments are
decorated with the same flowers

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.630 align:middle line:10%
as we find in The
Magician's garden.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.350 align:middle line:10%
The roses on the left
represent desire,

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:16.080 align:middle line:10%
while the lilies on the
right represent knowledge.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.510 align:middle line:10%
This desire and
thirst for knowledge

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:20.760 align:middle line:10%
are the two things
that drive the initiate

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.430 align:middle line:10%
on the path of the mysteries.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:27.690 align:middle line:10%
We also see a yellow
shaped Y on their garments,

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:31.110 align:middle line:10%
and this is the symbol
for the yoke of union.

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:33.420 align:middle line:84%
These initiates are
seeking to unite

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:37.140 align:middle line:84%
their personal consciousness
with a universal consciousness,

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:41.640 align:middle line:84%
and to achieve union
with the one true self.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:46.050 align:middle line:10%
We also see at The Hierophant's
feet are these crossed keys.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.210 align:middle line:10%
These keys represent
the unlocking

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.970 align:middle line:10%
of the mysteries,
which these rests

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.010 align:middle line:10%
in the powers of
the subconscious

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:57.300 align:middle line:10%
and the super conscious
modes of awareness.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.910 align:middle line:10%
Also, notice that
there are four circled

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:03.570 align:middle line:10%
X's on the carpet underneath
the hydrophones feet.

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:07.680 align:middle line:84%
These symbols are a symbol for
Mahout, the physical kingdom

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.160 align:middle line:84%
of the four elements that is at
the bottom of the Tree of Life.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, The Hierophant's
feet are grounded

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:18.990 align:middle line:84%
in the world of practicality,
even while his head is crowned

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:20.850 align:middle line:90%
in the realm of divinity.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:25.860 align:middle line:10%
So he truly bridges
between Heaven and Earth.

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:30.000 align:middle line:10%
Now, we also see a checkered
floor beneath the carpet,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.220 align:middle line:10%
and this represents
the world of duality

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.830 align:middle line:10%
and the principles
of rhythm, as well as

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:38.850 align:middle line:10%
polarity, and the oscillation
between those polarities.

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:41.789 align:middle line:10%
The style of floor is
very similar to the things

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:44.940 align:middle line:10%
that we might see in some of the
temples of the western mystery

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:47.360 align:middle line:10%
tradition.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.930 align:middle line:10%
And we also notice though that
the pillars within this temple,

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.210 align:middle line:10%
that are on either
side of the throne,

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:56.780 align:middle line:10%
as well as the throne
itself, are stone gray.

00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:00.870 align:middle line:10%
And this gray color is the
perfect blend of the opposites.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:04.540 align:middle line:10%
It's the color of wisdom.

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:07.040 align:middle line:10%
For the Hierophant sits
between these pillars

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.950 align:middle line:10%
in a very well balanced
position, aligned

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:12.050 align:middle line:10%
with the middle pillar
of the Tree of Life.

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:14.880 align:middle line:10%


00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.750 align:middle line:10%
Now, take a notice
also at the crosses,

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:20.780 align:middle line:10%
the three crosses that are on
the white sash that go down

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.150 align:middle line:10%
the center of The Hierophant.

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:27.130 align:middle line:84%
These represent the three
cross bars on the Tree of Life.

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:29.720 align:middle line:10%
And as an initiate
ascends the Tree of Life,

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:34.240 align:middle line:10%
they must ascend by way
of these three crosses.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.400 align:middle line:84%
With each next
ascension level, we

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.030 align:middle line:84%
must attain a greater level
of balance within ourselves,

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:44.191 align:middle line:84%
and also sacrifice what
no longer serves us.

00:09:44.191 --> 00:09:47.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, there is a lot
more symbolism embedded

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.500 align:middle line:84%
into this card,
but the final thing

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:53.490 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to point out here
is The Hierophant's gesture.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:57.240 align:middle line:84%
This is called the
gesture of esotericism,

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.960 align:middle line:84%
and it means to be
still and listen.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Hearing, especially
with the inner ear,

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.970 align:middle line:84%
or our clairaudience, is a key
function of this archetype.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:11.550 align:middle line:84%
This applies to listening
to oral teachings

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.370 align:middle line:84%
from an outer
teacher, as well as

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:18.370 align:middle line:84%
listening to your own inner
voice or inner teacher.

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And this gesture is also a sign
of blessing and benediction.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.690 align:middle line:84%
So The Hierophant
is reminding us

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:28.590 align:middle line:84%
that it's a blessing to
be still and to listen

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:31.920 align:middle line:84%
to our inner guidance
before we act.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.620 align:middle line:84%
It's also a blessing to
be taught the mysteries

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.350 align:middle line:84%
and to be initiated
onto the path.

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And according to
the doctrine, we're

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:43.320 align:middle line:84%
enslaved in a world
of illusion until we

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.920 align:middle line:84%
receive the proper instruction
that leads us to true freedom.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.220 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.990 align:middle line:90%


00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, what is The Hierophant
trying to teach us?

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, The Hierophant
wants us to learn

00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:01.150 align:middle line:84%
how to walk a mystical path,
but with practical feet.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:03.550 align:middle line:90%
The Hierophant is the initiator.

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:07.440 align:middle line:84%
He instructs us and reveals
the mysteries of life,

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.610 align:middle line:84%
but he also tests
or challenges us

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:13.150 align:middle line:84%
so that we can grow and
develop further as humans.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:15.880 align:middle line:84%
Each initiation
expands our awareness,

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:19.752 align:middle line:84%
but it also demands that
we regenerate ourselves.

00:11:19.752 --> 00:11:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And on the path
of initiation, we

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.430 align:middle line:84%
must change our limiting
beliefs, identities,

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:26.800 align:middle line:84%
and lifestyles in
order to become

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.080 align:middle line:90%
more of who we truly are.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.900 align:middle line:84%
The biggest mystery of life
that it presents us with

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.880 align:middle line:90%
is our own self.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Thus, The Hierophant opens the
gate for you to know thyself.

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, how do we know if an
intuitive hit is coming

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.210 align:middle line:90%
from a pure source or not?

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:47.480 align:middle line:84%
The answer is revealed in the
placement of The Hierophant,

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.310 align:middle line:90%
who helps us develop intuition.

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:56.560 align:middle line:10%
He comes after The Emperor,
who helps us to develop reason.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.140 align:middle line:84%
What this tells us, is that
while our intuition can

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:03.670 align:middle line:84%
go beyond reason, it should
never override reason.

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:06.040 align:middle line:84%
Our inner voice will
never tell us to do

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.490 align:middle line:90%
something stupid or immoral.

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:10.420 align:middle line:84%
It will also never
try to tell us

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:15.130 align:middle line:84%
what to do or try to take
away our freewill to choose.

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:17.710 align:middle line:84%
Instead, it will
help us to recognize

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:21.190 align:middle line:84%
the universal principles
at play and offer teachings

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:26.320 align:middle line:84%
about these principles, but then
it leaves it to us to choose.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, learning to
discern the difference

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:32.140 align:middle line:84%
between our true inner
voice versus that of our ego

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:35.050 align:middle line:84%
or other voices
is one of the ways

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:37.840 align:middle line:84%
that The Hierophant
really tests us.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, The Hierophant's
teachings will

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:43.090 align:middle line:84%
highlight what areas of
our personality or our life

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:45.820 align:middle line:84%
require attention and
development in order

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.950 align:middle line:90%
to truly attain what we desire.

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:51.050 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And what are some other
important correspondences

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.020 align:middle line:90%
of The Hierophant.

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:57.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, his secret name,
or his esoteric title,

00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:00.410 align:middle line:84%
is the Magus of
the Eternal Gods,

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:03.770 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes just the
Magus of the Eternal.

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:05.900 align:middle line:84%
His element is
fixed Earth, which

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:08.630 align:middle line:84%
relates to his
astrological sign, which

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:09.880 align:middle line:90%
is the sign of Taurus.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.760 align:middle line:90%


00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you look
closely enough, you

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.600 align:middle line:84%
can even find the
symbol of Taurus

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.800 align:middle line:84%
within the throne
of The Hierophant.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And a key attribute of Taurus
is a steady maintaining power.

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:27.110 align:middle line:84%
Taurus is the second
sign of the zodiac,

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:31.000 align:middle line:84%
and it comes into being when the
farmers are tilling the fields

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.620 align:middle line:84%
and planting the crops
during the springtime.

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:38.310 align:middle line:84%
Taurus is fertile,
sensual, practical, earthy,

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:41.350 align:middle line:84%
and materialistic,
and Taurus loves

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:44.830 align:middle line:84%
to be surrounded by
luxury, and is primarily

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:49.200 align:middle line:84%
concerned with the accumulation
of wealth and prosperity.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.950 align:middle line:84%
But don't be fooled by Taurus's
essential and pleasant nature.

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:56.190 align:middle line:84%
They're known to be stubborn,
as are all the four fixed

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:58.320 align:middle line:90%
signs of the zodiac.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And when you combine this with
taurus's endurance and stamina,

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:07.390 align:middle line:84%
the bull can become a
formidable foe when crossed.

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:10.830 align:middle line:84%
A Taurus is committed to putting
both internal and external

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:13.110 align:middle line:90%
experiences into form.

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:16.350 align:middle line:84%
Thus, The Hierophant and
the influence of Taurus

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:18.030 align:middle line:84%
is that part of
us that knows how

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:21.570 align:middle line:84%
to directly apply the
sacred that is within us

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:24.270 align:middle line:90%
into the outer world.

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:26.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, in astrology Taurus
is ruled by Venus,

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:28.840 align:middle line:90%
which relates to The Empress.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And Venus also rules
Libra, and the second house

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.460 align:middle line:90%
and the seventh houses.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, the key virtues
of The Hierophant

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:40.570 align:middle line:84%
is that it gives us a balanced
expression of authority,

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:43.960 align:middle line:90%
service, duty, and tradition.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:48.580 align:middle line:84%
He strengthens our qualities of
loyalty, greater understanding,

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:53.110 align:middle line:84%
having more fertility in life,
the upliftment of the soul,

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:57.590 align:middle line:84%
freedom of beliefs, and
kindness and compassion.

00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:00.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, those strengths are the
balance or the pure expression

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:01.900 align:middle line:90%
of The Hierophant.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:05.320 align:middle line:84%
But when any of those strengths
go too much or too little,

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.720 align:middle line:84%
it becomes a distortion,
or an imbalance,

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.180 align:middle line:90%
and that creates a weakness.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:13.360 align:middle line:84%
So some of the distortions
that come in here

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:16.960 align:middle line:84%
with The Hierophant, or where
these strengths can really

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:20.650 align:middle line:84%
sour, is when we see
an abuse of power,

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:24.460 align:middle line:84%
or maybe too much
self-indulgence or arrogance.

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.250 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:31.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, as we recognize where those
shadow aspects are showing up

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:33.810 align:middle line:84%
within us and we
acknowledge them,

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:36.900 align:middle line:84%
then that is when we can
start to transform them and do

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:41.100 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual alchemy within how
this archetype expresses itself

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.210 align:middle line:90%
in us.

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:44.580 align:middle line:84%
So as we bring the
shadow to light,

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:48.630 align:middle line:84%
The Hierophant helps us to
recognize our inner conscience

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:53.880 align:middle line:84%
that guides us to find meaning
within an established order.

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:57.420 align:middle line:84%
He also teaches us to search
for the spiritual or personal

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:00.750 align:middle line:84%
philosophy through the
study of books, lectures,

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:03.510 align:middle line:90%
oral teachings, and service.

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:05.100 align:middle line:84%
So The Hierophant
effort really helps

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.590 align:middle line:84%
us to find the value in
spiritual traditions,

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:11.760 align:middle line:84%
not because of programming,
but because we've questioned,

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:15.480 align:middle line:84%
we've thoroughly examined, and
we've found personal resonance

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.415 align:middle line:90%
within them.

00:16:18.415 --> 00:16:20.800 align:middle line:84%
We think of some
times when you've

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:25.110 align:middle line:84%
either been or encountered
The Hierophant in your life.

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:28.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, as children, we
may have reflected also

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:31.090 align:middle line:84%
on the big questions
of life, such as who

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:36.500 align:middle line:84%
am I, what's my purpose, and
what's the meaning of life?

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:40.740 align:middle line:84%
All of these are The Hierophant
stimulating us in our life.

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And even as adults,
it could be any time

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:46.630 align:middle line:84%
that we're exploring
our own inner world,

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:49.090 align:middle line:84%
and devoting ourselves to
our spiritual development

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:50.500 align:middle line:90%
and training.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.500 align:middle line:84%
When we get in touch with our
inner guidance and intuition,

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.110 align:middle line:90%
that's The Hierophant in us.

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And then, the more you
come to recognize it,

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.280 align:middle line:84%
the more it will
also connect you

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:03.190 align:middle line:84%
with one of your parallel
lives where The Hierophant

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:04.660 align:middle line:90%
is the dominant archetype.

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:07.160 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, what might
our parallel life

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.050 align:middle line:84%
be like under the archetype
of The Hierophant?

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:14.619 align:middle line:84%
Well, obvious examples of
The Hierophant archetype

00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:18.760 align:middle line:84%
are as a priest or headmaster
in a spiritual tradition,

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:23.170 align:middle line:84%
like a rabbi, or a guru, a
rinpoche, a bishop, or even

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:25.780 align:middle line:90%
the Pope or Dalai Lama.

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:28.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, in this life, we're
a spiritual teacher

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.940 align:middle line:84%
in an institutional position,
whereas the archetype

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:33.640 align:middle line:84%
of The High Priestess
and The Magician

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:37.230 align:middle line:84%
are more solitary
in their operations.

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:41.350 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is a path for
the upliftment of the soul.

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:45.160 align:middle line:84%
Another possibility is a guide
who teaches and initiates

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.200 align:middle line:84%
others into the mystery
school tradition.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.800 align:middle line:90%


00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.570 align:middle line:84%
By working with The Hierophant,
and invoking its energies

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:57.290 align:middle line:84%
into your life, you too can
awaken your inner teacher.

00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:58.950 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:00.720 align:middle line:10%
Now, our next step
on the hero's journey

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.910 align:middle line:10%
brings us to The Lovers.

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:06.720 align:middle line:10%
The Lovers is an image
of polarity and choice.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:10.220 align:middle line:84%
They deal with all
matter of relationships.

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And in this choice, The Lovers,
they represent a key decision

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.380 align:middle line:84%
that must be made on
the hero's journey,

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:20.820 align:middle line:84%
and making the right choices
requires discernment.

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:24.450 align:middle line:84%
So we could say that key six is
the message that The Hierophant

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:28.260 align:middle line:84%
has to give that guides us
to the next stage, which

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:32.610 align:middle line:84%
is the victory in key
seven, or The Chariot card.

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:35.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, after developing our
intuition and connection

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:37.950 align:middle line:84%
to our inner teacher
through The Hierophant,

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:41.040 align:middle line:84%
we must now listen to
the messages received,

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.560 align:middle line:84%
and then make the right
choices as we apply

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.890 align:middle line:90%
this guidance in our lives.

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, The Lovers are
ruled by number six.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And the main function
of the number six,

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:53.640 align:middle line:90%
is what we call reciprocation.

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Six is a number that seeks
balance, symmetry, harmony,

00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.170 align:middle line:90%
and beauty.

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:02.700 align:middle line:84%
In Kabbalah, six is the
number of Tiferet, which sits

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.130 align:middle line:90%
at the very center of the tree.

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And this sphere
directly connects

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:10.680 align:middle line:84%
with every other sphere on
the tree except for one.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:14.850 align:middle line:84%
So its function is to mediate,
to exchange, interchange,

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:17.880 align:middle line:84%
correlate, correspond,
and bring all

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:22.350 align:middle line:84%
the spheres into a harmonious
concordance with each other.

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:26.400 align:middle line:84%
It represents joy, healing,
kindness, and nurturing,

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:32.520 align:middle line:84%
all great qualities that we
need for healthy relationships.

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, amusingly, there
are only four types

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:41.820 align:middle line:84%
of beings in the Tarot, man,
woman, angel, and animal.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, these characters may
wear different costumes

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:47.250 align:middle line:84%
and play different roles
throughout the deck,

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:52.320 align:middle line:84%
but there really are only four
basic types within this cast.

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:54.270 align:middle line:10%
All these figures
show up together

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:58.130 align:middle line:10%
for the first time
in The Lovers.

00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:59.610 align:middle line:10%
Now, what does this tell us?

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:03.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, this key is about their
relationship with each other.

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:08.010 align:middle line:84%
It shows how these different
aspects of ourselves interact.

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:12.750 align:middle line:10%
The woman looks to the angel,
showing that our subconscious

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:16.770 align:middle line:10%
is in touch with our higher
self when we turn our attention

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:18.690 align:middle line:10%
in that direction.

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:21.240 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious is what
receives the inspiration

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.850 align:middle line:84%
from the higher self
that's needed to help us

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:26.070 align:middle line:90%
deal with our daily struggle.

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And this then gets
transmitted to us

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:31.530 align:middle line:84%
through dreams, meditations,
ah-ha moments, when we're

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:34.590 align:middle line:84%
really relaxed, and
the cycle is also

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:39.720 align:middle line:84%
of our emotional states that
rise up from the subconscious.

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.130 align:middle line:10%
The man, on the
other hand, looks

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:44.370 align:middle line:10%
to the woman, which
indicates that we must direct

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:47.280 align:middle line:10%
our conscious attention
to our subconscious

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.485 align:middle line:10%
by actively turning inwards.

00:20:49.485 --> 00:20:52.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a
big clue to how we

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:55.290 align:middle line:84%
achieve harmony between
all our different levels

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:57.690 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:01.110 align:middle line:84%
It's also clear that this
image is depicting Adam and Eve

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:02.745 align:middle line:90%
in the Garden of Eden.

00:21:02.745 --> 00:21:06.000 align:middle line:10%
Now, behind Adam is
the Tree of Life,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.540 align:middle line:10%
and its leaves are 12
flames which link it

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:12.240 align:middle line:10%
to the 12 physical
dimensions, as well as

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.420 align:middle line:10%
12 signs of the zodiac.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:17.550 align:middle line:10%
And these represent different
kinds of life expression

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:19.770 align:middle line:10%
into the physical.

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:24.010 align:middle line:10%
Behind Eve is the Tree of
Knowledge of Good and Evil,

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:26.160 align:middle line:10%
and the fruits of
this tree symbolize

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:30.936 align:middle line:10%
the senses through which we
perceive the world of duality.

00:21:30.936 --> 00:21:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, these are assigned
to the feminine

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:36.450 align:middle line:84%
because our senses
are purely receptive.

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:40.320 align:middle line:84%
Our senses are what allow us
to experience both the pains

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:43.310 align:middle line:90%
and the pleasures of this life.

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And we can overindulge
in them and fall

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:48.750 align:middle line:84%
into the temptations
of addiction,

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:53.140 align:middle line:84%
or we can cultivate them to
embrace the forms of life,

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:57.910 align:middle line:84%
learn from them, and find
the joy in the process.

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:00.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, when the woman,
or our subconscious,

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.670 align:middle line:84%
is listening to the
guidance of the angel,

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:07.120 align:middle line:84%
she is not swayed by the
temptations of the serpent,

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:10.810 align:middle line:84%
and they remain in the
garden of joy and bliss.

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:13.840 align:middle line:84%
But if she turns her attention
away from higher guidance

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:18.370 align:middle line:84%
and gets hijacked by the lower
instincts of our animal nature,

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:21.312 align:middle line:84%
that is when we
fall into suffering.

00:22:21.312 --> 00:22:24.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, the key lesson here
is to keep our subconscious

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:28.780 align:middle line:84%
attuned to our higher self by
actively turning our attention

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:33.840 align:middle line:84%
inwards, such as through
meditation and dream analysis.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:37.000 align:middle line:10%
And to do this, we must
apply our will and discipline

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.400 align:middle line:10%
our conscious mind to
focus its attention

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:44.140 align:middle line:10%
in this direction, which is
the role of our masculine side.

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:45.640 align:middle line:10%
Now, the angel
that's depicted here

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.510 align:middle line:10%
is said to be archangel
Raphael, the angel of healing

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:52.960 align:middle line:10%
and harmony, who's also
associated with the number six

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:56.170 align:middle line:10%
and Tiferet on the Tree of Life.

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:58.330 align:middle line:10%
And the Sun here
rises above him,

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:02.950 align:middle line:10%
which is the radiant source
of light that shines upon us.

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:07.030 align:middle line:10%
It's from the Sun that we draw
our life energy and the greater

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:11.580 align:middle line:10%
fire and light into
our consciousness.

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:14.160 align:middle line:10%
This image also has a mountain
in the background, which

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.960 align:middle line:10%
represents several things.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.200 align:middle line:84%
First, it's a symbol
for the great work

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.840 align:middle line:90%
of self-actualization.

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's the
mountain that we need

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:27.120 align:middle line:90%
to climb as we do that work.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.980 align:middle line:84%
The peak of the
mountain is also said

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:32.850 align:middle line:84%
to be the home of the gods,
such as Mount Olympus.

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's also a
symbol of pregnancy.

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:38.010 align:middle line:90%
It's a phallic symbol.

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:41.115 align:middle line:84%
So what are The Lovers
trying to show us here?

00:23:41.115 --> 00:23:44.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, The Lovers are teaching
us about the hermetic principle

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:45.540 align:middle line:90%
of polarity.

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:48.630 align:middle line:84%
It says, everything
is dual, everything

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:50.800 align:middle line:90%
has its pair of opposites.

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:54.540 align:middle line:84%
So this is the path of
choice and discrimination

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:57.280 align:middle line:90%
or discernment.

00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And The Lovers can help us to
find our own true path in life.

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:05.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's go through some other
correspondences of The Lovers.

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:08.500 align:middle line:84%
Their secret name, or
their esoteric title,

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:10.700 align:middle line:90%
they actually have two.

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:15.280 align:middle line:84%
One is that they're called The
Children of The Voice Divine.

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And the other, is The
Oracles of The Mighty Gods.

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:22.510 align:middle line:84%
Now the element associated
here is the element

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:27.610 align:middle line:84%
of air, which relates to their
astrological sign of Gemini.

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:30.610 align:middle line:84%
Gemini is a mutable air
sign embodying all kinds

00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:33.010 align:middle line:90%
of communication skills.

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:35.800 align:middle line:84%
Gemini is the third sign
of the zodiac, which

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:38.640 align:middle line:84%
comes into season as the
weather is getting warmer

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.120 align:middle line:90%
and people want to go places.

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:41.290 align:middle line:90%
They want to visit friends.

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:43.380 align:middle line:90%
They want to socialize.

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:46.630 align:middle line:84%
Gemini is very mental,
active, and witty.

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:49.480 align:middle line:84%
It enjoys light and
airy social contact

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.660 align:middle line:90%
and is very communicative.

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:56.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, Gemini symbolizes what we
call The Journey of The Twins,

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.990 align:middle line:90%
and its symbol is the twins.

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:02.410 align:middle line:84%
We see this show up in stories
like "Hansel and Gretel,"

00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:05.800 align:middle line:84%
or "Raggedy Ann
and Raggedy Andy."

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And in Egyptian
mythology, Gemini

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:11.740 align:middle line:84%
is sometimes personified by
what we call the two Anubises,

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:14.770 align:middle line:90%
or the jackal headed deities.

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:17.740 align:middle line:84%
The jackals have a
keen sense of smell,

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:20.080 align:middle line:84%
and are, therefore,
associated with the principle

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:21.710 align:middle line:90%
of discernment.

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And there's a legend that
says that once a soul passes

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:29.350 align:middle line:84%
into the afterlife and it stands
before the Gates of Eternity,

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:34.060 align:middle line:84%
they will encounter these
two Anubises standing guard.

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:36.640 align:middle line:84%
The first will turn
to you and will ask,

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:39.380 align:middle line:90%
have you found joy in life?

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And then, the other
will turn and ask,

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:44.490 align:middle line:90%
have you brought joy to others?

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And in order to be granted
entry into the gates,

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:52.570 align:middle line:84%
your answer to both
questions must be yes.

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:55.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, in astrology, Gemini
rules the third house

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.450 align:middle line:84%
of communications
and siblings, and is

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:02.440 align:middle line:84%
in turn ruled by
Mercury, The Magician.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.030 align:middle line:84%
So here's some
other keywords that

00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:06.680 align:middle line:90%
are associated with The Lovers.

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.550 align:middle line:84%
First of all, there's
love, which is obvious.

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:13.030 align:middle line:84%
There's also faith,
devotion, being

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:17.410 align:middle line:84%
able to make good choices,
having versatility,

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:22.690 align:middle line:84%
creating a balance of masculine
and feminine within ourselves.

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:25.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, those strengths are the
balanced or the pure expression

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:26.830 align:middle line:90%
of The Lovers.

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:29.830 align:middle line:84%
But when they get into any
imbalances of too much or too

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:33.590 align:middle line:84%
little, it falls into the
weaknesses and distortions.

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And some of those weaknesses
or vises of the lovers

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:40.660 align:middle line:84%
include being unreliable,
lacking good communication,

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:43.505 align:middle line:90%
or lacking humor.

00:26:43.505 --> 00:26:45.880 align:middle line:84%
Some of the other weaknesses
expressed through the shadow

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:49.750 align:middle line:84%
side of The Lovers include
being unable to make a choice,

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:53.800 align:middle line:84%
to trust love, or to
risk losing control.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And another big thing
to watch out for

00:26:55.390 --> 00:27:00.040 align:middle line:84%
is difficulty in recognizing
conflicting aspects of ourself,

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:04.210 align:middle line:84%
and/or not knowing how to
love ourselves properly.

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:06.820 align:middle line:84%
It's also an
inability to get close

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:09.880 align:middle line:84%
in intimate
relationships, or falling

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:14.620 align:middle line:84%
into domination or power plays
within our relationships.

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:18.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, as we recognize any
of these shadow aspects

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:21.230 align:middle line:84%
within ourselves, and we tell
ourselves the truth about it,

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:23.350 align:middle line:84%
and we acknowledge
them, then we can

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:26.500 align:middle line:84%
start to work on
transforming them and turning

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:29.950 align:middle line:84%
the shadow into light
so that we can reveal

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:32.692 align:middle line:90%
the gifts that it brings us.

00:27:32.692 --> 00:27:33.970 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:36.970 align:middle line:84%
So different ways that we
can bring The Lovers shadow

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:40.270 align:middle line:84%
to light within us
is to restore balance

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:43.570 align:middle line:84%
by understanding that both
intellect and intuition are

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:46.400 align:middle line:84%
really important for
guidance in our lives,

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:49.330 align:middle line:84%
and by making responsible
choices, especially

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:52.100 align:middle line:90%
in our relationships.

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:54.250 align:middle line:84%
We also want to be able
to identify opposites that

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:56.560 align:middle line:84%
are needed for balance
in any situation

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:59.680 align:middle line:84%
that life presents
us, and becoming aware

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.350 align:middle line:84%
of the loving nature
of our higher self

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:05.710 align:middle line:84%
and really seeking
out that contact.

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:08.080 align:middle line:84%
Also, making the choice
to love yourself,

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:12.160 align:middle line:84%
and being able to risk loving
another person because you

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:15.510 align:middle line:90%
love yourself enough.

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And then, making a
responsible decision

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:21.390 align:middle line:84%
about a love relationship,
whether it serves or doesn't

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:26.820 align:middle line:84%
serve, whether it's time to move
on or to go deeper within it.

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:31.560 align:middle line:84%
We also want to acknowledge the
marriage of mind and spirit,

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.660 align:middle line:84%
and look to our higher
self for guidance.

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:36.190 align:middle line:90%


00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Think of times when you've
been or encountered The Lovers

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:41.800 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, some obvious
examples would be

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.880 align:middle line:84%
when you've been in
intimate relationships

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:49.630 align:middle line:84%
and experienced falling in
love, as well as all the ups

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:54.490 align:middle line:84%
and downs that come with these
relationships as they mature.

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:57.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is one of the most
people oriented archetypes,

00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:02.530 align:middle line:84%
and it's key teaching is the
art of relating, whether it's

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:05.710 align:middle line:84%
relating to ideas, relating
to creative projects,

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:08.290 align:middle line:90%
or relating to other people.

00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:12.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, regardless of the type
of relationship, whether it's

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.440 align:middle line:84%
with ideas, projects,
or people, we're

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.980 align:middle line:84%
always faced with this
experience of duality.

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is the duality of
good and evil, or yin and yang,

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:23.980 align:middle line:90%
that's within all of us.

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:26.800 align:middle line:84%
We all have our positive and
our negative, our masculine

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.460 align:middle line:90%
and feminine.

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And relationships, more
than anything else,

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:34.950 align:middle line:84%
serve as a mirror to
us for our own duality.

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's through
relationships that we are most

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:40.270 align:middle line:84%
challenged to accept
the differences

00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:43.890 align:middle line:84%
and the imperfections
of ourselves and others.

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And until we can come to a
place of absolute acceptance,

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:51.430 align:middle line:84%
then we'll continue to be
bound by this sense of duality

00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:53.290 align:middle line:90%
and separation.

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:55.480 align:middle line:84%
But once we do
accept, then we can

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:58.220 align:middle line:84%
come to see that there
is no separation,

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:01.060 align:middle line:84%
and that polarity is simply
two different aspects

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:03.250 align:middle line:90%
of the same thing.

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:05.260 align:middle line:84%
When brought into
harmony with each other,

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:08.790 align:middle line:84%
they then become a dynamic
force for creation.

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:11.170 align:middle line:84%
But so long as they're
judged as separate,

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:14.330 align:middle line:90%
they struggle with each other.

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:16.840 align:middle line:84%
So The Lovers reminds
us that what's

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.480 align:middle line:84%
required here in
any situation is

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:22.840 align:middle line:84%
a good dose of childlike
innocence, curiosity,

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.490 align:middle line:90%
and playfulness.

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:27.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, in our youth, we may have
embodied the characteristic

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:30.910 align:middle line:84%
of being multifaceted
with many different sides,

00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:33.730 align:middle line:90%
almost like the Gemini twins.

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And as adults, a key
theme of The Lovers

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:39.700 align:middle line:84%
that is trying to teach
us is to find synergy,

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:44.240 align:middle line:84%
forming a whole that is greater
than the sum of its parts.

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:46.360 align:middle line:84%
The Lovers also show
up in our capacity

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:49.240 align:middle line:90%
to inspire and motivate others.

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And if we ever need help in
establishing relationship

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:54.422 align:middle line:84%
boundaries, and getting
clear about what's

00:30:54.422 --> 00:30:57.440 align:middle line:84%
what and what is working
and what isn't working,

00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:00.880 align:middle line:90%
then we can call on The Lovers.

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.250 align:middle line:10%
And the more we come
to recognize The Lovers

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:06.220 align:middle line:10%
in your life, the more
you will realize also

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:09.440 align:middle line:10%
what one of your parallel lives
might be where The Lovers is

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:12.346 align:middle line:10%
the dominant archetype.

00:31:12.346 --> 00:31:14.700 align:middle line:10%
Well, what are some
examples of how

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:19.270 align:middle line:10%
a parallel life might look under
the influence of The Lovers?

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:21.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, one example of
the lovers manifesting

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:26.190 align:middle line:84%
is as power couples, like
Isis and Osiris, Antony

00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:31.590 align:middle line:84%
and Cleopatra, Adam and
Eve, or Solomon and Sheba.

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:33.540 align:middle line:84%
It's the interplay
between the yin

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:36.945 align:middle line:84%
and the yang, the
Sun and the Moon.

00:31:36.945 --> 00:31:39.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, they can co-create
a lot together,

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:42.540 align:middle line:84%
but their journey of love is
not without its difficulties

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:45.390 align:middle line:84%
and interferences
from those forces that

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:47.760 align:middle line:90%
would try to separate them.

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:51.570 align:middle line:84%
Their love must be stronger
than the forces of separation,

00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:56.490 align:middle line:84%
and they must transcend duality
while harnessing polarity.

00:31:56.490 --> 00:32:00.510 align:middle line:10%
An example careers might include
being a relationship counselor

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:03.960 align:middle line:10%
or coach, being a project
manager, or some kind

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:06.090 align:middle line:10%
of skilled communicator.

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Any place where good decision
making and people skills

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:12.240 align:middle line:90%
are put to use.

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:14.820 align:middle line:84%
By working with The Lovers
and invoking its energies

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:18.660 align:middle line:84%
into your life, you too can
awaken the powers of love

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:21.420 align:middle line:90%
and discernment within you.

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:23.460 align:middle line:84%
Join me again, as
we explore further

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:25.950 align:middle line:84%
into the 22 archetypes
of tarot, and how

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:30.300 align:middle line:84%
they can help us to make our
big shift in consciousness.

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:31.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard.
