00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Hi, I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard,
host of "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.730 align:middle line:10%
And today I'm going to
lead you in a meditation

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.210 align:middle line:10%
with the archetypes of the
Empress and the Emperor.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.310 align:middle line:10%
Now, together, they
help us to balance

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.790 align:middle line:10%
our creative imagination
with our reasoning abilities.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.470 align:middle line:10%
And the Empress awakens the
powers of reproduction, growth,

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.470 align:middle line:10%
and regeneration,
while the Emperor helps

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.550 align:middle line:10%
us to gain a renewed
sense of life, adventure,

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.140 align:middle line:10%
and initiative.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.240 align:middle line:84%
Let's explore some of
the practical things

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.110 align:middle line:84%
that we can do to work with both
these archetypes, the Empress

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.520 align:middle line:90%
and the Emperor.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.820 align:middle line:84%
So here's a formula that you can
follow for invoking these two

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.170 align:middle line:90%
archetypes into your life.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.690 align:middle line:84%
First, we'll work with
one card at a time,

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.060 align:middle line:90%
beginning with the Empress.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.880 align:middle line:84%
Once you're ready, find the
Empress card in your deck

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.640 align:middle line:90%
and take it out.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.940 align:middle line:84%
Place this card in front
of you at eye level.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a meditation
stool or a cushion,

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.680 align:middle line:84%
you can sit on that
in front of a table

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.980 align:middle line:84%
and place the card
upright on the table.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.425 align:middle line:84%
Get yourself into a relaxed
position and a light meditative

00:01:27.425 --> 00:01:28.225 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:01:28.225 --> 00:01:32.610 align:middle line:90%


00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Empty your mind, and
make sure that you're

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.030 align:middle line:84%
in a positive or at least
a neutral state of being

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.480 align:middle line:84%
with nothing disturbing you
either mentally or emotionally.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.940 align:middle line:90%


00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Once you're in this
relaxed and peaceful state,

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.360 align:middle line:84%
look at the image of the
Empress card for a while.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.510 align:middle line:84%
With your eyes open, study the
card for about 5 to 10 minutes.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.000 align:middle line:90%
Really take in all the details.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.550 align:middle line:84%
Study its imagery
and its symbolism.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.370 align:middle line:84%
Notice all the
little intricacies

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.760 align:middle line:84%
and really ingrain
it within your mind.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:21.980 align:middle line:90%


00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.060 align:middle line:10%
I'll remain silent now
for the next five minutes

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.670 align:middle line:10%
as we now meditate on the
symbolism of the card.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:07:11.580 align:middle line:90%


00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.420 align:middle line:84%
After those 5 to 10 minutes
of looking at the card

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.480 align:middle line:84%
with your eyes open,
next we're going

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.110 align:middle line:84%
to take it inside
and work with it

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:24.180 align:middle line:84%
inside our mind for another 10
minutes with our eyes closed.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Really build up that
image inside your mind

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:31.230 align:middle line:84%
and reproduce the entire
image with all its details

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:33.990 align:middle line:90%
firmly within your mind.

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:37.170 align:middle line:84%
Once the image is firmly
established in your mind,

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:41.430 align:middle line:84%
then use your active
imagination and your five senses

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.860 align:middle line:90%
and let it come to life.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Bring the Empress to
life and let her move.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.540 align:middle line:90%
Let her engage.

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:52.900 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps she has a message or
perhaps just in her behavior

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.380 align:middle line:84%
she shows you what
her message is.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.640 align:middle line:90%
Just observe it for a while.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.600 align:middle line:84%
Feel the energy that
the Empress emanates.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:13:04.130 align:middle line:90%


00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:08.180 align:middle line:10%
Once you feel this connection
and it's become strong,

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:12.170 align:middle line:10%
the next step is to
merge with the Empress.

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:14.540 align:middle line:10%
Become the Empress.

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:18.440 align:middle line:10%
See yourself as the Empress.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.660 align:middle line:10%
Feel her come alive within you.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:30.480 align:middle line:90%


00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.180 align:middle line:10%
When you feel integrated
with this energy

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:38.330 align:middle line:10%
and the Empress is alive within
you, now sit up in the chair

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:41.610 align:middle line:10%
and actually take on the
posture of the Empress.

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:45.960 align:middle line:10%
Assume her archetypal
form and body position,

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:49.710 align:middle line:10%
sitting in that chair,
holding the scepter,

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:52.710 align:middle line:10%
feeling that crown
upon your head,

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:56.340 align:middle line:10%
feeling the sensory-rich
environment of nature

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:57.660 align:middle line:10%
around you.

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.380 align:middle line:10%
And then you're going to
say this affirmation--

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.495 align:middle line:10%
I am the daughter
of the mighty ones.

00:14:03.495 --> 00:14:06.020 align:middle line:10%


00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:12.590 align:middle line:10%
I bring beauty, love, and
care to all my relations.

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:18.160 align:middle line:10%
Feel that energy
resonates within you

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.200 align:middle line:10%
and awaken within yourselves.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:15:06.260 align:middle line:90%


00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.230 align:middle line:84%
When you feel complete
with the Empress,

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:11.780 align:middle line:84%
you're going to put
her aside for a moment.

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And now we're going to do the
same process with the Emperor

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.620 align:middle line:90%
card.

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.690 align:middle line:90%
So bring out the Emperor card.

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Put it on the table
in front of you.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Meditate upon it with your
eyes open for 5 to 10 minutes,

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.520 align:middle line:84%
taking in all the
details, studying

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:32.150 align:middle line:84%
the card, all of its
aspects, really feeling it.

00:15:32.150 --> 00:20:33.820 align:middle line:90%


00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:38.080 align:middle line:84%
You're now going to
take that image inside.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:41.590 align:middle line:10%
Close your eyes and work
with it in your inner mind

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:44.260 align:middle line:10%
for another 10 minutes.

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:47.140 align:middle line:10%
Reproduce and build up
the image of the Emperor

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.570 align:middle line:10%
within your mind.

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:56.830 align:middle line:10%
Bring in all the details,
the colors, the energy,

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:57.630 align:middle line:10%
the symbols.

00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:01.330 align:middle line:90%


00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:05.520 align:middle line:10%
Firmly establish the
Emperor within your mind.

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:10.540 align:middle line:10%
And then imagine that this
image is like a doorway

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:12.750 align:middle line:10%
into a scenery.

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:14.980 align:middle line:10%
And you're going to
walk through that.

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:18.100 align:middle line:10%
And as you do, allow the
Emperor and the scenery

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:19.120 align:middle line:10%
to come to life.

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.690 align:middle line:10%


00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:23.880 align:middle line:10%
Observe everything
around in more

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:27.450 align:middle line:10%
of a three-dimensional
landscape.

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:28.830 align:middle line:10%
Observe the Emperor.

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:30.430 align:middle line:10%
What does he do?

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:32.190 align:middle line:10%
How does he express?

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:33.600 align:middle line:10%
What does he say?

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.290 align:middle line:10%
What is his teaching
or his message?

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:41.790 align:middle line:10%
Use your active imagination and
engage all five senses to allow

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:45.150 align:middle line:10%
this imagery to awaken.

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:47.100 align:middle line:10%
And feel the Emperor.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:51.575 align:middle line:10%
Feel the energy and the ways
of being of the Emperor.

00:21:51.575 --> 00:26:28.690 align:middle line:90%


00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:31.870 align:middle line:10%
Once you feel this
connection strongly,

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:37.360 align:middle line:10%
then merge with the
Emperor and become him.

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:40.990 align:middle line:10%
Allow the Emperor to
awaken within you.

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:43.300 align:middle line:10%
You are the Emperor.

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:44.830 align:middle line:10%
See yourself as the Emperor.

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:48.730 align:middle line:10%
Feel his energy
alive within you.

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:51.910 align:middle line:10%
When you feel this energy
integrated and settled

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:55.180 align:middle line:10%
within you, next you're
going to sit up in a chair

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:58.540 align:middle line:10%
and actually take on the
posture of the Emperor.

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:00.970 align:middle line:10%
Assume his archetypal form.

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:03.430 align:middle line:10%
Imagine that you're
sitting in your throne

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:05.320 align:middle line:10%
with the scepter
in your right hand

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:09.220 align:middle line:10%
and the orb in your left,
crown upon your head.

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:11.820 align:middle line:10%
You're fully suited
in the armor.

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:17.440 align:middle line:10%
And from this position of your
throne, say this affirmation--

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:23.080 align:middle line:10%
I am the son of the morning
and chief among the mighty.

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:27.220 align:middle line:10%
I define my world.

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:30.630 align:middle line:10%
And I am the captain of my ship.

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:32.400 align:middle line:10%
Allow those words
and that energy

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.850 align:middle line:10%
to reverberate and to
resonate within you

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:38.190 align:middle line:10%
and to awaken it
within yourselves.

00:27:38.190 --> 00:28:37.400 align:middle line:90%


00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:40.180 align:middle line:10%
When you feel this
awakening within you,

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:43.070 align:middle line:10%
you're now going to place both
the Empress and the Emperor

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:47.300 align:middle line:10%
cards next to each other and
meditate on them together,

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:51.035 align:middle line:10%
placing the Empress on left
and the Emperor on the right.

00:28:51.035 --> 00:28:53.930 align:middle line:10%


00:28:53.930 --> 00:29:00.140 align:middle line:10%
Notice and see how these cards
contrast with each other.

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:03.840 align:middle line:10%
Notice the differences.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:06.850 align:middle line:10%
And also notice how they
complement each other.

00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:08.470 align:middle line:10%
Notice the similarities.

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:12.200 align:middle line:90%


00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:16.470 align:middle line:10%
The Empress stimulates
your creative imagination,

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:19.495 align:middle line:10%
while the Emperor stimulates
your sovereign reason.

00:29:19.495 --> 00:29:22.750 align:middle line:90%


00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:24.670 align:middle line:10%
Finally, we want to
take these energies

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:28.220 align:middle line:10%
and express them
into our outer life.

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:30.310 align:middle line:10%
So examples of
how to do that are

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:34.240 align:middle line:10%
to bring the primary colors into
our life, into our environment,

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.160 align:middle line:10%
into our clothing.

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.530 align:middle line:10%
That would be green
for the Empress

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:40.960 align:middle line:10%
and red for the Emperor.

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.270 align:middle line:10%
We can also continue
this daily practice

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:46.420 align:middle line:10%
of meditating upon the symbols
and the two cards in the way

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:49.990 align:middle line:10%
that we just did as well as
working with the affirmations

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:51.880 align:middle line:10%
we just used.

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.980 align:middle line:10%
Contemplate the
meaning of each card

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:56.450 align:middle line:10%
and how it applies to your life.

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:59.290 align:middle line:10%
Watch for the archetypes
to appear in your dreams

00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:01.960 align:middle line:10%
as they awaken within
your consciousness,

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:05.170 align:middle line:10%
and then analyze their messages.

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:06.700 align:middle line:10%
And especially pay
attention to how

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:10.910 align:middle line:10%
you embody the strengths and
the weaknesses of each one.

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:13.120 align:middle line:10%
And then consciously
work to make improvements

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.290 align:middle line:10%
in these areas.

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:18.030 align:middle line:84%
Do all of this daily
for the next week.

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And again, realize
that when we're

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:22.910 align:middle line:84%
working with the archetypes
in this way, they will awaken

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:25.490 align:middle line:84%
and they will set forces
in motion in our life.

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:28.920 align:middle line:84%
They will become an
active part of our life.

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:32.570 align:middle line:84%
So if we're going to engage with
them in this experiential way,

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:36.770 align:middle line:84%
then we really want to commit to
seeing this journey all the way

00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:39.800 align:middle line:84%
through to the end,
working with each card,

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:43.370 align:middle line:84%
each of the 22 archetypes
in the order given

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:46.220 align:middle line:84%
as we go through this journey
and this season of "Mystery

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:47.410 align:middle line:90%
Teachings."

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:48.830 align:middle line:90%
Don't skip steps.

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Really go through
it step by step

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:52.970 align:middle line:90%
and give it your attention.

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:55.400 align:middle line:84%
Join me again as
we explore further

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:58.250 align:middle line:84%
into the 22 archetypes
of Tarot and how

00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:02.650 align:middle line:84%
they can help us to make our
big shift in consciousness.

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:11.000 align:middle line:90%
