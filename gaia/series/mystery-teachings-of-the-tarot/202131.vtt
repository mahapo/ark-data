00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.850 align:middle line:10%
>> Hi, I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard,
Host of Mystery Teachings.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.590 align:middle line:10%
Today, we're going to meditate
on the archetypes of Death

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.360 align:middle line:10%
and Temperance.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.540 align:middle line:10%
Together, they help us move
through big life changes

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.150 align:middle line:10%
with balance and grace.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.790 align:middle line:10%
Death is the great
initiator who helps

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.540 align:middle line:10%
us understand the cycles of
transformation and renewal.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.910 align:middle line:10%
While Temperance helps
us to adapt to those

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.060 align:middle line:10%
changes and evolve
towards greater wholeness.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.470 align:middle line:90%


00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.270 align:middle line:84%
Here's a formula
that you can follow

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.150 align:middle line:84%
for working with these
two archetypes of Death

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.040 align:middle line:90%
and Temperance.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.200 align:middle line:84%
We'll first work with
one card at a time,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.570 align:middle line:90%
beginning with Death.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.730 align:middle line:84%
Once you're ready, find
the Death card in your deck

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.540 align:middle line:90%
and take it out.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Place this card in front
of you at eye level.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.330 align:middle line:84%
If you have a meditation
stool or cushion,

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.720 align:middle line:84%
sit on that in front of a table
and place the card upright

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.790 align:middle line:90%
on the table.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.390 align:middle line:84%
Bring yourself into a relaxed
position and a light meditative

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.860 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.960 align:middle line:90%
Take several deep breaths.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.510 align:middle line:90%
Relax your body.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And begin to quiet
and empty your mind.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.400 align:middle line:84%
Bring yourself into a positive,
or at least a neutral state

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.100 align:middle line:84%
of being so that nothing
is disturbing you

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.190 align:middle line:90%
mentally or emotionally.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And really just relax into
a state of peace and quiet.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.150 align:middle line:84%
Once you've connected to
this state of inner peace,

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.760 align:middle line:84%
open your eyes and look
at the image of the Death

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.240 align:middle line:90%
card for about 5 to 10 minutes.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.180 align:middle line:84%
Study its imagery,
its symbolism,

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.430 align:middle line:90%
take in all the details.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.670 align:middle line:84%
As you're studying
it, really contemplate

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.710 align:middle line:90%
the meaning of each symbol.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.780 align:middle line:90%
Memorize these details.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.555 align:middle line:90%
Ingrain them upon your mind.

00:02:10.555 --> 00:02:16.790 align:middle line:90%


00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.890 align:middle line:10%
We'll remain silent now
for the next five minutes

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.089 align:middle line:10%
as we now meditate on the
symbolism of the card.

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:29.077 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC CONTINUES]

00:02:29.077 --> 00:07:09.460 align:middle line:90%


00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.030 align:middle line:84%
Next, we want to take
the image inside and work

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:16.720 align:middle line:84%
with it in our mind for another
10 minutes with our eyes

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.850 align:middle line:90%
closed.

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:24.220 align:middle line:84%
Really bring that image
firmly into your mind.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.070 align:middle line:84%
Build the image up
from your memory.

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:31.130 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that the frame of
the card was a doorway.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And on the other
side of that door

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.800 align:middle line:84%
is the scenery that
the card depicts.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.260 align:middle line:90%
Build up all of that imagery.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Recreate all the details,
the colors, the characters,

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.500 align:middle line:90%
what they're doing.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.430 align:middle line:84%
Create this static image
in your mind first.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And hold it for
about 10 minutes.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And once the image is firmly
established in your mind,

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:58.270 align:middle line:90%
now, let it come to life.

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:00.670 align:middle line:10%
Walk through that door
way into the scenery

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.340 align:middle line:10%
and let it take on a three
dimensional landscape

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:04.810 align:middle line:10%
around you.

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:08.170 align:middle line:10%
Use all five of your senses
in your creative imagination

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:11.290 align:middle line:10%
to bring this whole
setting to life.

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:14.800 align:middle line:10%
And observe the characters
and the scenery for a while.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.100 align:middle line:10%
Notice what they do.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:16.900 align:middle line:10%
How they behave.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.562 align:middle line:10%


00:08:19.562 --> 00:08:20.645 align:middle line:10%
Maybe they have a message.

00:08:20.645 --> 00:08:25.380 align:middle line:90%


00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.845 align:middle line:10%
And feel and sense the
energy that Death emanates.

00:08:27.845 --> 00:08:32.182 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC CONTINUES]

00:08:32.182 --> 00:12:52.300 align:middle line:90%


00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.690 align:middle line:10%
Once you connect to this
energy, the next step

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:59.530 align:middle line:10%
is to merge with
Death, become Death.

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:03.790 align:middle line:10%
Allow this archetype to
become alive within you.

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:06.552 align:middle line:10%
You are the Death archetype.

00:13:06.552 --> 00:13:09.720 align:middle line:90%


00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:13.230 align:middle line:10%
Really feel this waking
up inside of you.

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:18.940 align:middle line:10%
See yourself in the position
of Death within this setting.

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.720 align:middle line:10%
And then once you feel
integrated with this energy,

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.290 align:middle line:10%
stand up and actually take
on the posture of Death.

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:27.840 align:middle line:10%
Assume his archetypal form.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:31.200 align:middle line:10%
Imagine yourself being in
a full suit of black armor,

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:35.070 align:middle line:10%
riding a white horse, holding
the reins in your right hand,

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:37.950 align:middle line:10%
and a banner in your left.

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:44.370 align:middle line:10%
And from this position,
say this affirmation,

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:47.790 align:middle line:10%
"I am the child of the
great transformers,

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:49.890 align:middle line:10%
and the Lord of the
gates of Death."

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:53.550 align:middle line:90%


00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:57.750 align:middle line:10%
"Every ending is
a new beginning.

00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:59.580 align:middle line:10%
I am ready to transform."

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:03.190 align:middle line:90%


00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:05.620 align:middle line:10%
And feel that
affirmation reverberating

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:09.700 align:middle line:10%
throughout your being,
activating this energy

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.330 align:middle line:10%
within your cells,
and really integrating

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:14.970 align:middle line:10%
into you and into your life.

00:14:14.970 --> 00:15:01.910 align:middle line:90%


00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:03.470 align:middle line:84%
Once you feel
complete with that,

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:06.620 align:middle line:84%
we're now going to do the same
process with the Temperance

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:08.140 align:middle line:90%
key.

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.030 align:middle line:84%
So find the Temperance
key in your deck.

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:11.390 align:middle line:90%
Take it out.

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Place it in front of you
on your meditation stool,

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:15.940 align:middle line:90%
placing it on the table.

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And with your eyes open,
begin to study and meditate

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:22.000 align:middle line:84%
upon it for 5 to 10
minutes, taking in all

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.010 align:middle line:90%
those details, all the symbols.

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:29.560 align:middle line:84%
Notice the subtleties that
you might have missed before.

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:35.435 align:middle line:84%
There's many layers of
things to be revealed here.

00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:40.590 align:middle line:84%
So memorize the imagery and
the symbolism of this card.

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:41.915 align:middle line:90%
Ingrain it upon your mind.

00:15:41.915 --> 00:15:46.172 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC CONTINUES]

00:15:46.172 --> 00:20:44.900 align:middle line:90%


00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And then after those first 5
to 10 minutes of studying it,

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.060 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
now close your eyes

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.060 align:middle line:84%
and take it inside
you for 10 minutes

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:56.120 align:middle line:84%
and work with it
in your inner mind.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Build this image up
within your mind's eye.

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:02.090 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that the frame of
the card is like a doorway.

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And on the other side is
the angel of Temperance.

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:09.350 align:middle line:90%
Recreate that image inside.

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:11.540 align:middle line:84%
Really solidify it
within your mind

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:13.790 align:middle line:84%
and impress it upon
your subconscious.

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:17.782 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC CONTINUES]

00:21:17.782 --> 00:25:57.510 align:middle line:90%


00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:59.940 align:middle line:84%
After those 10 minutes of
working with it with your eyes

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:04.800 align:middle line:84%
closed, the next step is to
let the angel come to life.

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Move through the doorway
into the scenery of this key

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:12.090 align:middle line:84%
and let it take on a three
dimensional virtual reality

00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:13.560 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:16.680 align:middle line:84%
Use your active imagination,
use all five of your senses,

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:20.010 align:middle line:90%
and bring this key to life.

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:26.560 align:middle line:84%
Let the angel become animated
and observe what he does.

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:31.990 align:middle line:84%
Feel the energy and the
ways of being of Temperance.

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps, Temperance
also has a message.

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:38.190 align:middle line:84%
Receive and just take
all of this energy in.

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:41.650 align:middle line:90%


00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:45.490 align:middle line:10%
And once you feel a connection
with the energy of Temperance,

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:48.070 align:middle line:10%
next you're going to
merge with Temperance,

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:52.120 align:middle line:10%
become the angel of Temperance.

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:55.620 align:middle line:10%
Allow him to become
alive within you.

00:26:55.620 --> 00:27:00.148 align:middle line:10%
See and feel yourself
as this being.

00:27:00.148 --> 00:27:02.870 align:middle line:10%
And when you start to feel
integrated with this energy,

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:05.000 align:middle line:10%
you're going to actually
stand up and take

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.010 align:middle line:10%
on the posture of Temperance.

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:09.410 align:middle line:10%
Assume this archetypal form.

00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:12.750 align:middle line:10%
Feel those angelic
wings upon your back.

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:15.960 align:middle line:10%
Imagine your right foot
standing in a pool of water,

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:19.340 align:middle line:10%
while your left foot is
standing on solid Earth.

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:22.160 align:middle line:10%
And you hold two
chalices in your hands,

mixing the elixir of life
back and forth between them.

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:35.050 align:middle line:10%
And as you do this, you're
going to state this affirmation,

00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:38.350 align:middle line:10%
"I am the daughter of the
reconcilers and the bringer

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:39.355 align:middle line:10%
forth of life."

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:45.700 align:middle line:10%
"I am the alchemist.

I harmonize the opposites."

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:53.410 align:middle line:90%


00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:55.900 align:middle line:10%
Feel that affirmation
reverberating

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:59.170 align:middle line:10%
through your being,
activating your cells,

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:02.530 align:middle line:10%
awakening and integrating
this energy deeply within you.

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:13.490 align:middle line:84%
Once you feel
complete with that,

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:16.040 align:middle line:84%
we're now going to work
with both cards together.

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:19.640 align:middle line:10%
So place both the Death
key and the Temperance key

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:22.550 align:middle line:10%
next to each other,
with Death on the left

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:24.410 align:middle line:10%
and Temperance on the right.

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:28.190 align:middle line:10%
And meditate upon them together.

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:32.350 align:middle line:10%
As you do, notice how they
contrast with one another.

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:35.560 align:middle line:90%


00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:37.960 align:middle line:10%
Notice also how they
complement each other.

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:42.790 align:middle line:90%


00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:44.635 align:middle line:10%
How do these two keys connect?

00:29:44.635 --> 00:29:49.060 align:middle line:90%


00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:52.300 align:middle line:10%
Death stimulates change
and transformation

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:54.100 align:middle line:10%
within our lives.

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:56.800 align:middle line:10%
While Temperance helps
you to thrive upon those

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.660 align:middle line:10%
changes and find the balance.

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:01.990 align:middle line:90%


00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:06.610 align:middle line:10%
Finally, take these energies
and express them into your life.

00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:09.820 align:middle line:10%
So we want to outwardly manifest
these energies in our life.

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:11.530 align:middle line:10%
Some examples of
how to do that would

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:14.470 align:middle line:10%
be to bring the colors
into your environment

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:16.120 align:middle line:10%
or into your clothing.

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:20.470 align:middle line:10%
So for example, in Death, we
see a lot of black and white.

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:22.960 align:middle line:10%
While in Temperance, we
see both white and red.

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:25.510 align:middle line:10%


00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:27.220 align:middle line:10%
Another thing to
do is to meditate

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:30.940 align:middle line:10%
upon these symbols and these
images daily for the next week.

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:34.690 align:middle line:10%
And keep working with the
affirmations that we just used.

00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:36.430 align:middle line:10%
Contemplate the
meaning of each card

00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:38.680 align:middle line:10%
and how it applies to your life.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:42.070 align:middle line:10%
And watch for these archetypes
to appear both in your dreams,

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:45.220 align:middle line:10%
as well as in synchronistic
events within your life.

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:47.770 align:middle line:10%
And analyze and pay
attention to the messages

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:49.000 align:middle line:10%
that they're bringing you.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.070 align:middle line:84%
Especially also
pay close attention

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:55.270 align:middle line:84%
to how you embody the strengths
and the weaknesses of each

00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:56.470 align:middle line:90%
of these keys.

00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And then consciously
work to make improvements

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.420 align:middle line:90%
in these areas.

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And then realize, again,
that these archetypes,

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:04.690 align:middle line:84%
when we work with them,
they will set forces

00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:06.190 align:middle line:90%
in motion in our life.

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:09.160 align:middle line:84%
So if we're going to engage with
this in an experiential way,

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:12.310 align:middle line:84%
then really commit to seeing
this all the way through.

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:14.350 align:middle line:84%
Work with each
card in its order.

00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:16.120 align:middle line:90%
Don't skip steps.

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:17.860 align:middle line:84%
Make it all the way
through this series

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:19.900 align:middle line:84%
and really give
it your attention.

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Join me again as
we explore further

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:25.210 align:middle line:84%
into the 22 archetypes
of Tarot, and how

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:29.610 align:middle line:84%
they can help us to make our
big shift in consciousness.

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:34.000 align:middle line:90%
