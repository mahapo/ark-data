00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.928 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.928 --> 00:00:14.730 align:middle line:90%


00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard, and
this is "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.830 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.410 align:middle line:10%
How would you like to
achieve greater equilibrium

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.900 align:middle line:10%
and poise in your life?

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.740 align:middle line:84%
When we're centered and
harnessing our inner resources

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.650 align:middle line:84%
and maintaining
grace under pressure,

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.980 align:middle line:84%
that's when we'll be able to
meet any challenges that life

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.510 align:middle line:90%
gives us.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.610 align:middle line:10%
And in this episode,
we take a deeper dive

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.490 align:middle line:10%
into the archetypes of
the chariot and strength.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.340 align:middle line:10%
Now, these archetypes
together are

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.550 align:middle line:10%
about harnessing our
will and life force.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.470 align:middle line:84%
The chariot represents
the departure

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.290 align:middle line:84%
of the hero off on his
grand adventure or mission,

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.810 align:middle line:84%
while the strength
key represents

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.660 align:middle line:84%
taming our instinctual
nature in order

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.300 align:middle line:84%
to attain poise and
grace, even when

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.970 align:middle line:90%
we feel pressured and stressed.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.840 align:middle line:10%
As the wheel now rotates
clockwise to keys 7 and 8,

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.110 align:middle line:10%
we venture deeper into our
experience of the world

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.930 align:middle line:10%
and our search to master
our physical lives.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.760 align:middle line:10%
But as we come to
key 7, the chariot,

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.410 align:middle line:10%
we're now prepared and ready
to embark on our mission.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.470 align:middle line:84%
We're fully equipped with
all the foundational tools,

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.500 align:middle line:84%
qualities, and lessons
gained from the first seven

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.500 align:middle line:90%
archetypes.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.400 align:middle line:84%
We've learned about our role
in society, in relationships,

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.980 align:middle line:84%
and we've gained
self-awareness, and also

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.720 align:middle line:84%
how to use both our subconscious
and our conscious modes

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.520 align:middle line:90%
of thoughts.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.440 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.690 align:middle line:84%
We're now entering into
the beginning stages

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.170 align:middle line:84%
of seeking balance in
the world and society,

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.470 align:middle line:84%
and coming to understand
the universal laws.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.420 align:middle line:90%
Now the alchemy begins.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.642 align:middle line:90%


00:01:58.642 --> 00:02:01.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, as we take our next
step on the hero's journey,

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.260 align:middle line:90%
we come to the chariot.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.600 align:middle line:10%
Now, the chariot is the
embodiment of the hero.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.910 align:middle line:10%
He's the fool, or us, only
now more educated and prepared

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.380 align:middle line:10%
for the mission.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, the chariot's
main functions

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.350 align:middle line:84%
have to do with all matters
of achievement and success

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.580 align:middle line:84%
in whatever it is we
set forth to accomplish.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.980 align:middle line:84%
The chariot is ruled
by the number 7,

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.060 align:middle line:84%
and 7 is a very sensitive
and intuitive number.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.220 align:middle line:84%
It's a sacred number
that connects us

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.280 align:middle line:84%
to the seven spiritual
dimensions, the seven

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.340 align:middle line:84%
stages of alchemy, the seven
ancient planets, the seven

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.640 align:middle line:84%
chakras, and so on, and
it deals with matters

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.940 align:middle line:84%
of establishing
equilibrium at all levels,

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.960 align:middle line:84%
leading to mastery,
poise, and victory.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.820 align:middle line:10%
And when out of
balance, it can become

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.450 align:middle line:10%
sacrificial and delusional,
but in its very positive

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.194 align:middle line:10%
expression, it's compassionate,
spiritual, and psychic.

00:03:03.194 --> 00:03:07.450 align:middle line:10%
Now, let's take a look at
the imagery of the chariot.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.270 align:middle line:10%
We see a crowned
and royal champion

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.820 align:middle line:10%
who is at the helm
of his chariot, which

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.370 align:middle line:10%
is drawn by two
sphinxes, and they are

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.960 align:middle line:10%
ready to set off on a mission.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.500 align:middle line:10%
Now, at present,
they're at rest, still

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.930 align:middle line:10%
in their final preparation
for this adventure.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.610 align:middle line:10%
And notice how the chariot
encloses the hero within it,

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.650 align:middle line:10%
offering protection.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.620 align:middle line:10%
This idea of enclosure
and protection

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.300 align:middle line:10%
is depicted in a number of
ways here within this key.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.560 align:middle line:10%
There's the wall of the city.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.270 align:middle line:10%
There's the chariot itself.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.300 align:middle line:10%
There's the armor of
the charioteer, and also

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.550 align:middle line:10%
the castles, all of
which indicate enclosure.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.700 align:middle line:10%
Now, the chariot's shoulders
are accented by crescent moons,

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.700 align:middle line:10%
showing that there is an
influence of the moon here,

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.100 align:middle line:10%
and its cycles must be
understood and honored.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.750 align:middle line:84%
The moon especially influences
our emotions and our mood,

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.110 align:middle line:84%
and it's represented by the
faces of comedy and tragedy

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.535 align:middle line:90%
here within the crescent moons.

00:04:08.535 --> 00:04:11.170 align:middle line:90%


00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And the chariot teaches us that
the way to master our emotions

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.740 align:middle line:84%
is to create a permanent
mood of equilibrium and peace

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:22.720 align:middle line:84%
within, making this
like a daily mantra.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.350 align:middle line:84%
The chariot itself represents
the vehicle of manifestation,

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.420 align:middle line:84%
and it has the shape of a cube,
which represents our soul.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.570 align:middle line:84%
The soul is the mediator
between the physical body

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.450 align:middle line:84%
and our eternal
spirit, and the soul

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.940 align:middle line:84%
surrounds the
consciousness and gives it

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.930 align:middle line:84%
the ability to move around
and interact with this world.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.830 align:middle line:90%
It's the vehicle of incarnation.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, it represents all the
possibilities and experiences

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.530 align:middle line:84%
that life in the
physical can offer us.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.680 align:middle line:84%
It's four-squared
structure symbolizes

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.340 align:middle line:90%
stability and balance.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.410 align:middle line:10%
Now, in the alchemical
process, this chariot

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.840 align:middle line:10%
is also what we call the
athanor, or the furnace,

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.560 align:middle line:10%
which uses the fires
of alchemy to burn

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.770 align:middle line:10%
and to drive the
alchemical process forward.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, the chariot is moved by
the power of two sphinxes.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.050 align:middle line:84%
These represent our senses,
through which we can

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.900 align:middle line:90%
experience the four elements.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.320 align:middle line:84%
It's our five senses that
drive us to experience

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.090 align:middle line:90%
the physical world.

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.240 align:middle line:10%
They're our desire nature
on an emotional level,

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.380 align:middle line:10%
and the sphinxes are also
black and white here,

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.570 align:middle line:10%
like the two pillars
of polarity that we

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.820 align:middle line:10%
see in the high priestess card.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.930 align:middle line:10%
The white one represents
force and expansion,

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.920 align:middle line:10%
while the black one represents
form and limitation.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And we can think of them as
kind of being like the gas pedal

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.450 align:middle line:90%
and the brakes of a vehicle.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.730 align:middle line:84%
We must learn to
harness both of them

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:58.390 align:middle line:84%
to know when to apply which
mode of movement in order

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.950 align:middle line:84%
to achieve balance and
safety in our drive.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.770 align:middle line:10%
When we work together
in harmony with these,

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.180 align:middle line:10%
the sphinxes bring effortless
power to the chariot.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.000 align:middle line:10%
Notice also that
there's no reins.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.170 align:middle line:84%
That's because the charioteer
is the master of his own ship.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:22.040 align:middle line:10%
He steers with his mind,
and the power resides here

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.680 align:middle line:10%
in consciousness alone.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:30.520 align:middle line:10%
It is by will alone that he
sets his chariot in motion.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, take a look,
also, at the emblem

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.610 align:middle line:90%
on the front of the chariot.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:40.060 align:middle line:10%
This is an emblem of Shiva, with
an interlinked lingam and yoni.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.970 align:middle line:10%
So this shows that there
must be a perfect union

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.730 align:middle line:10%
of masculine and feminine
forces that generate all things.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.010 align:middle line:10%
The masculine force
performs the mental magic,

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:55.120 align:middle line:10%
while the feminine is
the magic of embodiment.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And this symbol is
set within a shield,

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.940 align:middle line:84%
and above that is a
winged solar disk.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, the winged disk is a symbol
that was loved and beloved

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.020 align:middle line:90%
by the ancient Egyptians.

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.870 align:middle line:84%
It represents
freedom, liberation,

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:13.510 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual transcendence.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:17.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, all together, this
is a fusion of Eastern

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:23.450 align:middle line:84%
and Western metaphysics
showing unity and universality.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:27.750 align:middle line:84%
The chariot also embodies a
link between Heaven and Earth.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.720 align:middle line:10%
You see, above the
charioteer, a starry canopy,

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:35.040 align:middle line:10%
which refers to the celestial
hierarchy of constellations.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.710 align:middle line:10%
Also, his belt
represents the zodiac,

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:40.980 align:middle line:10%
indicating his
celestial purpose.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:44.970 align:middle line:10%
And these all reflect
in earthly action.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:48.450 align:middle line:10%
So then below, with the
black and white sphinxes,

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.030 align:middle line:10%
that signifies our two natures.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.890 align:middle line:10%
Here we have above, the
celestial, and below,

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:54.690 align:middle line:10%
the animal.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:57.030 align:middle line:10%
So we have animal and divine.

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:58.950 align:middle line:10%
We have physical and spiritual.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:02.070 align:middle line:10%
We have mortal and immortal.

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:04.950 align:middle line:10%
And this hints that
the secret wisdom

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:08.940 align:middle line:10%
is attained by battling with
and overcoming our lower

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.250 align:middle line:10%
nature, while
bringing our higher

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:15.020 align:middle line:10%
spirit into the
physical world of form.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.190 align:middle line:10%
Now, the walled city
in the background

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:20.220 align:middle line:10%
indicates the world
that he's leaving behind

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:23.402 align:middle line:10%
in his quest for
self-actualization.

00:08:23.402 --> 00:08:25.540 align:middle line:10%
And another important
symbolism is

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.720 align:middle line:10%
that the chariot is
on the other side

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.700 align:middle line:10%
of the river from the city.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.820 align:middle line:84%
There's something known
as the other shore, which

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:36.810 align:middle line:84%
is a metaphor for liberation
and being set free.

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:39.990 align:middle line:10%
And this river is that
stream of consciousness

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:43.620 align:middle line:10%
that originates in the
robe of the high priestess.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:48.120 align:middle line:10%
So his consciousness is
now free to grow and expand

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.490 align:middle line:10%
after having successfully
completed his training

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:51.420 align:middle line:10%
and preparation.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.050 align:middle line:10%


00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.950 align:middle line:10%
Now, the most essential
message of key 7

00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:00.550 align:middle line:10%
is that it represents what
we call the middle way, not

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:02.950 align:middle line:10%
the extremes of right or left.

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.590 align:middle line:10%
The charioteer's posture
is standing perfectly

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:09.565 align:middle line:10%
aligned as the middle
pillar, square on.

00:09:09.565 --> 00:09:12.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you continue to study
the imagery of the chariot,

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:17.140 align:middle line:84%
you will discover that he
sums up all the earlier keys.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.450 align:middle line:90%
He is their synthesis.

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And above all
things, he represents

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:25.210 align:middle line:90%
the triumph of the mind.

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:27.760 align:middle line:84%
The charioteer represents
our inner self,

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.250 align:middle line:84%
and this archetype
brings us opportunities

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:32.830 align:middle line:90%
for self-discipline and control.

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:36.880 align:middle line:84%
But so often, we're trying to
control everything by our lower

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.600 align:middle line:84%
ego, and when we're allowing
our ego to direct our will,

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.910 align:middle line:90%
things don't go so well.

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:45.950 align:middle line:84%
The two sphinxes will pull
in different directions

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.430 align:middle line:90%
when the ego is in charge.

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:50.320 align:middle line:84%
To truly be the
captain of our ship,

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.840 align:middle line:84%
we must surrender
the ego's control

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:57.040 align:middle line:84%
and become receptive to
the eternal will of spirit.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.350 align:middle line:84%
The more we prepare our
soul to be a receptive

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:02.590 align:middle line:84%
vehicle for spirit, the
more the eternal will

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:05.050 align:middle line:90%
can express through us.

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:07.360 align:middle line:10%
As Paul Foster Case
puts it, he says,

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.390 align:middle line:10%
"Complete receptivity
is the secret

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:14.260 align:middle line:10%
of the most powerful
manifestations of will."

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And Eliphas Levi puts it that
all magic is in the will.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:22.750 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Greek mythology,
the archetype of the chariot

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:25.810 align:middle line:84%
was related to Apollo,
the son of Zeus,

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:30.430 align:middle line:84%
who drove the sun across
the sky in his chariot.

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:33.850 align:middle line:84%
The sun in this case is
a symbol of our spirit,

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:38.140 align:middle line:84%
and its vehicle of
transport is our soul.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:41.830 align:middle line:84%
But what are some other
correspondences of the chariot?

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:45.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, his secret name,
or esoteric title,

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.130 align:middle line:84%
is the child of the
powers of the waters,

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:52.180 align:middle line:84%
and the lord of the
triumph of light.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.610 align:middle line:84%
His element is
water, which relates

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:57.470 align:middle line:84%
to his astrological
sign of cancer,

00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:01.120 align:middle line:84%
which is an active water
sign in the zodiac.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.670 align:middle line:84%
The highest expression
of cancer is

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:09.160 align:middle line:84%
a supporting, nurturing depth
with very balanced emotions.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.590 align:middle line:84%
Cancer is the fourth
sine of the zodiac,

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:14.800 align:middle line:84%
and it's very intuitive,
sensitive, psychic,

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.920 align:middle line:90%
and receptive.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.590 align:middle line:84%
But when confronted,
the cancer normally

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:22.710 align:middle line:84%
will react from emotion,
rather than intellect,

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:25.350 align:middle line:84%
and this can cause
difficulties if they're not

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.350 align:middle line:90%
in control of their behavior.

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:32.450 align:middle line:10%
In astrology, cancer rules the
fourth house of home and family

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:35.030 align:middle line:10%
and security, and
it's also ruled

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:37.520 align:middle line:10%
by the moon, which is
why we see the moon so

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.820 align:middle line:10%
prominent in the chariot card.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:46.025 align:middle line:84%
Cancer is thus very protective
of their home and their family.

00:11:46.025 --> 00:11:48.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, some other key
words associated here

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:53.180 align:middle line:84%
with the chariot are
enlightenment, discipline,

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:57.350 align:middle line:84%
motivation, and being able
to overcome obstacles.

00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:00.700 align:middle line:90%


00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, those strengths
are the balanced,

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.720 align:middle line:84%
or the pure expression
of the chariot.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.630 align:middle line:84%
But when they get out of balance
with too much or too little,

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:09.610 align:middle line:84%
they become distorted,
and they form

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:12.200 align:middle line:90%
weaknesses, or shadow aspects.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.050 align:middle line:84%
So some of those
weaknesses that we

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:17.800 align:middle line:84%
need to watch out for that
might be revealed within us

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:25.180 align:middle line:84%
are arrogance, having an
inflated ego, deterioration,

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:31.990 align:middle line:84%
elusiveness, instability,
avarice and greed, cruelty.

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:34.630 align:middle line:84%
Another way the chariot's
shadow might show up in us

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:38.230 align:middle line:84%
is when we engage in battles
that really have no purpose,

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:39.905 align:middle line:90%
or that can't be won.

00:12:39.905 --> 00:12:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And we need to
really discern, which

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.327 align:middle line:90%
battles are worth fighting?

00:12:44.327 --> 00:12:45.910 align:middle line:84%
Another thing we
have to watch out for

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:48.790 align:middle line:84%
is a lack of
self-control, or relying

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:52.960 align:middle line:84%
on some form of self-denial
as a way of exercising

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.910 align:middle line:90%
control over ourselves.

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:58.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, as we begin to recognize
which aspects of the shadow

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:00.670 align:middle line:84%
are showing up within
us, that's when

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:03.250 align:middle line:84%
we can begin the work
of transforming it.

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And as we do that
spiritual alchemy

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:07.450 align:middle line:84%
of transforming the
shadow into light,

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:11.830 align:middle line:84%
it reveals the gifts that
were hidden within the shadow.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:14.740 align:middle line:84%
So as we bring the shadow
to light with the chariot,

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.620 align:middle line:84%
it helps us to
solve problems using

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:21.700 align:middle line:84%
various skills that have been
gained from past experience.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.370 align:middle line:84%
It helps us with having
greater compassion,

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:27.070 align:middle line:84%
and considering different
issues from another person's

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.200 align:middle line:90%
perspective.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And then it awakens
the hero in us.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.900 align:middle line:90%


00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Think of times when you've
been or encountered the chariot

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:40.310 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:42.550 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you've
experienced the capacity

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:46.850 align:middle line:84%
to create movement and change
with a sense of balanced will

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:48.850 align:middle line:90%
and use of mind.

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:53.080 align:middle line:84%
Chariot people are natural
motivators and catalysts.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.510 align:middle line:84%
So who's helped
motivate you, or been

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:59.690 align:middle line:84%
a catalyst for positive change
and empowerment in your life?

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:02.770 align:middle line:84%
Whether it was a role
model when you were a kid,

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:05.710 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps someone you look
up to now who you maybe

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:11.630 align:middle line:84%
aspire to be, these people have
been the chariot in your life.

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:14.410 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps you've been the
chariot, or the role model

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:16.820 align:middle line:90%
and catalyst for others.

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.240 align:middle line:84%
The more you recognize
the chariot in your life

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.190 align:middle line:84%
here and now, the
more it will also

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:24.000 align:middle line:84%
connect you with one
of your parallel lives,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.246 align:middle line:84%
where the chariot is
the dominant archetype.

00:14:27.246 --> 00:14:30.410 align:middle line:10%
What might our parallel life
be like under the archetype

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:32.210 align:middle line:10%
of the chariot?

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:35.840 align:middle line:10%
Well, this archetype is often
the hero of our epic adventure

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.610 align:middle line:10%
movies and books.

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:40.490 align:middle line:10%
Recall the stories of the
Knights of the Round Table

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:42.980 align:middle line:10%
and their quest
for the Holy Grail,

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:45.890 align:middle line:10%
or you could think of Luke
Skywalker and the moment

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:48.740 align:middle line:10%
when he's needing
to use the force

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:51.740 align:middle line:10%
and be completely
receptive to that will,

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.960 align:middle line:10%
like when he's flying
his fighter jet to drop

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:57.380 align:middle line:10%
that bomb in a weak
spot of the Death Star,

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.060 align:middle line:10%
or you could think
of a chivalrous

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:02.600 align:middle line:10%
Knights Templar on a journey
to the Holy Land protecting

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.400 align:middle line:10%
pilgrims along the way.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.670 align:middle line:84%
But as for more
contemporary examples,

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:11.000 align:middle line:84%
we might think of the astronauts
who were some of the first

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.900 align:middle line:84%
to explore outer space,
or any kind of explorer,

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:19.820 align:middle line:84%
for that matter, who
seeks adventure and glory.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.730 align:middle line:84%
Other careers that work
with this chariot energy

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:27.110 align:middle line:84%
might be as a motivational
speaker, a coach, or a change

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:30.110 align:middle line:84%
agent hired to help
transform a company--

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:34.460 align:middle line:90%
any kind of catalyst for change.

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:37.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, once the furnace
of the chariot

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:40.320 align:middle line:84%
is prepared and ready
to begin the great work,

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:44.100 align:middle line:84%
the next step is to
light the fire within it.

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.550 align:middle line:10%
This brings us to
the strength key,

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:49.400 align:middle line:10%
and the first stage of
the alchemical process

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.890 align:middle line:10%
known as calcination.

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:54.170 align:middle line:10%
This archetype represents
the vital essence

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:57.740 align:middle line:10%
of the alchemical
fire in so many ways.

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:01.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, fire is an energy that must
be respected and controlled,

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:04.820 align:middle line:84%
otherwise it burns
us or our work.

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:07.340 align:middle line:84%
So controlling this
energy is about applying

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:12.260 align:middle line:84%
the right mix of form and
force, severity and love,

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.690 align:middle line:90%
to bridge the polarities.

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:17.600 align:middle line:84%
But like an acrobat who's
balancing on a tightrope,

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.000 align:middle line:84%
we must rhythmically
and continuously

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.890 align:middle line:90%
readjust to maintain balance.

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And the symbolism
of the strength key

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:29.450 align:middle line:84%
suggests that force should
always be mitigated by love.

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Perfect order and
perfect discipline

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:35.840 align:middle line:90%
combine into perfect control.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, strength is
ruled by the number 8,

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:42.770 align:middle line:84%
so let's explore the numerology
of that number for a moment.

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:46.650 align:middle line:84%
The first thing to notice about
the number 8 is its shape.

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:50.580 align:middle line:84%
It's the perfect reflection
of above and below.

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we turn
this on its side,

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:55.870 align:middle line:84%
it's also the same as
the symbol for infinity,

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:59.750 align:middle line:84%
and this symbol relates to the
eternal rhythms of vibration

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:01.910 align:middle line:90%
and the laws of harmony.

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:04.819 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the middle, where
the two loops cross over,

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:08.270 align:middle line:84%
we have the balance
point between polarities,

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:12.800 align:middle line:84%
or the junction between
Heaven and Earth.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Let's now explore the imagery
and symbolism of the strength

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:17.869 align:middle line:90%
card.

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:20.150 align:middle line:10%
We see a woman in
a gown of white

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:22.910 align:middle line:10%
who gently holds
the head of a lion

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:25.790 align:middle line:10%
and appears to be taming him.

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:28.310 align:middle line:10%
The scenery is out in
nature, with the mountain

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:30.740 align:middle line:10%
of the great work
in the background,

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:34.790 align:middle line:10%
and the lion has become
her faithful companion.

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:37.610 align:middle line:10%
This lion is a symbol
of Leo, as well as

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:43.010 align:middle line:10%
the fiery solar energy from
which we draw our life force.

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:46.460 align:middle line:10%
The lion is a masculine energy,
while the woman is obviously

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:48.950 align:middle line:10%
a feminine energy,
and the two are

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:51.500 align:middle line:10%
interconnected by
a wreath that forms

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:55.130 align:middle line:10%
an infinity loop between them.

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:57.110 align:middle line:10%
Now, the strength
key represents a kind

00:17:57.110 --> 00:18:01.220 align:middle line:10%
of marriage between the
feminine and the masculine.

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:04.850 align:middle line:84%
The wreath of roses joins
them in a complete and happy

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:05.860 align:middle line:90%
mixture.

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:08.960 align:middle line:10%
It's a very harmonious affair.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.570 align:middle line:10%
Each requires something
of the other inside of it

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:14.690 align:middle line:10%
for this harmony
to be established.

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:18.860 align:middle line:84%
It's very similar to the concept
captured within the yin-yang.

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:24.200 align:middle line:10%
Each contains the seed of
the opposite within it.

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:28.190 align:middle line:10%
Now, in alchemy, the lion
has very special meaning.

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:30.410 align:middle line:10%
If you ever see a
green lion in alchemy,

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:32.840 align:middle line:10%
it's about the raw
energy of nature

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.960 align:middle line:10%
before we've applied
our will to it.

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.780 align:middle line:84%
Whereas a red lion
represents the natural forces

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:42.110 align:middle line:84%
under perfect control after
many changes have already

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:46.450 align:middle line:84%
taken place through
the alchemical process,

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:50.410 align:middle line:84%
an old lion represents
the purified consciousness

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:53.560 align:middle line:84%
that is achieved
through the great work.

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:57.850 align:middle line:10%
And here, the gold lion
represents solar energy

00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:02.830 align:middle line:10%
and the vital life force, or
Kundalini energy, within us.

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:05.830 align:middle line:84%
The powers of the lion are
now able to be directed

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:09.550 align:middle line:84%
by consciousness through a
harmonious partnership that's

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:11.440 align:middle line:90%
been established.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.930 align:middle line:84%
Strength also shares
very similar symbols

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:15.760 align:middle line:90%
as the magician key.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:19.000 align:middle line:10%
He also wears a
white robe of purity,

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.430 align:middle line:10%
and he has the same infinity
symbol over his head.

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.270 align:middle line:10%
And the main color
for both of these keys

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:27.520 align:middle line:10%
is yellow, representing
that element of air,

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:31.850 align:middle line:10%
as well as a harmony and
balance within nature.

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:35.480 align:middle line:10%
The magician also points
to a garden of flowers,

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.610 align:middle line:10%
and now we see that
this garden grows

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:40.270 align:middle line:10%
on the wreath of strength.

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:43.880 align:middle line:10%
And the garden represents
a sense of organic growth,

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:47.860 align:middle line:10%
as well as the roses,
which represent desire.

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Both the magician card
and the strength card

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:53.210 align:middle line:84%
are very calm in
their expressions,

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:56.410 align:middle line:84%
and they're acting as
transparent conduits for higher

00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:59.560 align:middle line:90%
will to flow through them.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.650 align:middle line:84%
This is how they
accomplish what they do.

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:05.490 align:middle line:84%
But as a feminine,
strength represents

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:08.190 align:middle line:90%
the subconscious side of us.

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:12.180 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, she's taking in what
the magician or consciousness

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:14.880 align:middle line:84%
has actively focused
on, and she's now

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.490 align:middle line:90%
embodying it innately.

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:20.130 align:middle line:84%
We've reached a place where
our subconscious is more

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:25.310 align:middle line:84%
aligned with our conscious
pursuit of personal evolution.

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:27.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, strength also
represents befriending

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:31.090 align:middle line:84%
an ally or a
companion on the path,

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:32.920 align:middle line:84%
but we must show our
strength in order

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:36.970 align:middle line:84%
to win this being's
loyalty and friendship.

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:40.450 align:middle line:84%
The woman handles the
lion like a beloved pet,

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:43.810 align:middle line:84%
and this shows that we
should love and appreciate

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:48.376 align:middle line:84%
all parts of ourselves,
even our baser instincts.

00:20:48.376 --> 00:20:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And this key shows that we
should be kind and loving,

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:54.130 align:middle line:90%
yet firm with ourselves.

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:56.860 align:middle line:84%
There's no need to beat
ourselves up about things.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:00.550 align:middle line:84%
Taming our ego is
like taming a pet.

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:06.250 align:middle line:84%
We need consistency, clarity,
positive reinforcement, reward,

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:08.530 align:middle line:90%
love, and boundaries.

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And for us, a regular
practice of meditation

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:17.190 align:middle line:84%
brings this greater
mastery and self-awareness.

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:20.310 align:middle line:84%
What is strength
trying to show us?

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:22.380 align:middle line:84%
This archetype stimulates
the development

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:26.010 align:middle line:84%
of true spiritual
strength and grace.

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:30.390 align:middle line:84%
It's about facing and overcoming
our doubts and fears, which

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:33.465 align:middle line:84%
can rise up from the
ego and lower self,

00:21:33.465 --> 00:21:37.410 align:middle line:84%
and it teaches us to overcome
any sort of indecision,

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:40.740 align:middle line:84%
and to move forward
with confidence.

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:43.050 align:middle line:84%
But consciously
choosing to do this

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:46.230 align:middle line:84%
from the viewpoint of
a positive, empowered,

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:48.660 align:middle line:84%
and meaningful
outlook, and then we

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:50.850 align:middle line:84%
can program our
subconscious pattern

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:53.685 align:middle line:84%
in a way that truly serves
us to achieve that mastery.

00:21:53.685 --> 00:21:56.590 align:middle line:90%


00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:59.360 align:middle line:84%
So let's go through some other
correspondences of the strength

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.830 align:middle line:90%
card.

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:04.130 align:middle line:84%
The esoteric title, or the
secret name of strength,

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:07.250 align:middle line:84%
is the daughter of
the flaming sword,

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:10.800 align:middle line:90%
and the leader of the lion.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:14.160 align:middle line:84%
The element here is what we
call the fixed fire, which

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:19.470 align:middle line:84%
relates to Leo, the
astrological correspondence.

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:21.600 align:middle line:84%
Strength is obviously
ruled by Leo,

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:25.020 align:middle line:84%
with the lion being a
key part of this card,

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:28.710 align:middle line:84%
and Leo's attributes are
dynamism and courage,

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:31.510 align:middle line:90%
creative power, and strength.

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:33.700 align:middle line:10%
Now, the sun passes
through Leo, which

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:36.430 align:middle line:10%
is the fifth sign
of the zodiac, when

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:39.170 align:middle line:10%
it's at the height
of the summertime,

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:44.020 align:middle line:10%
and it's therefore a fixed fire
sign, and is ruled by the sun.

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:48.880 align:middle line:84%
The sun is happy,
vibrant, and romantic.

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:52.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, the symbol for Leo
also represents a serpent,

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:55.600 align:middle line:84%
and since Leo
governs the spine, it

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:58.720 align:middle line:84%
relates to Kundalini
energy that moves

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:02.440 align:middle line:84%
through the spinal channels
in the practice of yoga.

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:06.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, this Kundalini is what
lights that fire in our body's

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:09.990 align:middle line:90%
own alchemical oven.

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:13.260 align:middle line:84%
So in astrology, Leo
rules the fifth house

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:16.230 align:middle line:84%
of pleasure, creativity,
and self-expression,

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:18.470 align:middle line:90%
and it's ruled by the sun.

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And very similar to the
moon, in ancient astrology,

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:24.360 align:middle line:84%
the sun was assigned the
rulership of this sign,

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:27.240 align:middle line:90%
and it's only ruling over Leo--

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:31.830 align:middle line:84%
very much like how the moon
rules only over cancer.

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:33.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, the ancient
Egyptian goddess

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:36.390 align:middle line:84%
that was associated with
this key of strength

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:38.610 align:middle line:84%
and the sign of Leo
is none other than

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:41.400 align:middle line:84%
the lion-headed
goddess Sekhmet, one

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.350 align:middle line:84%
of the oldest-known
Egyptian deities.

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:48.300 align:middle line:84%
She's a warrior goddess, as
well as a goddess of healing,

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:51.360 align:middle line:84%
and she's a protector of Ra
during his nightly journey

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.040 align:middle line:90%
through the underworld.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:57.300 align:middle line:84%
She can be fierce, and she
can also be benevolent.

00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:59.730 align:middle line:84%
Her name is derived
from "sekhem,"

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:03.150 align:middle line:84%
which means power, or
might, and her legends

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:08.190 align:middle line:84%
display both the shadow and
the light of the strength key.

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:10.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, other key words
associated with strength

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:16.740 align:middle line:84%
include courage, power, might,
fortitude, force, vitality,

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:19.800 align:middle line:90%
passion, and love.

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.210 align:middle line:84%
Some of the
strengths and virtues

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:25.140 align:middle line:84%
that she helps us to achieve
are greater willpower,

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:29.760 align:middle line:84%
self-reliance and
self-restraint, proper limits,

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:33.960 align:middle line:84%
and peacekeeping abilities,
the righting of wrongs,

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:39.120 align:middle line:84%
holding a state of
serenity, inner alchemy,

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:42.930 align:middle line:84%
facing reality,
defending the weak,

00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:45.610 align:middle line:90%
and having grace under pressure.

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, these strengths
are the balanced,

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:50.410 align:middle line:84%
or the pure expressions
of this key.

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:52.980 align:middle line:84%
But when we go too much
or too little of these,

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:56.320 align:middle line:84%
they become weaknesses
and shadow aspects.

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:59.280 align:middle line:84%
So some of the weaknesses
and the vices of strength

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:04.080 align:middle line:84%
include being wavering, being
subservient, getting too much

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:08.130 align:middle line:84%
into fear, being selfish,
having an attitude

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:12.630 align:middle line:84%
of being burned out, and
taking advantage of others.

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:middle line:84%
Some of the ways that the
weaknesses of strength

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.190 align:middle line:84%
express themselves
through its shadow side

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:20.340 align:middle line:84%
include a lack of
courage or integrity,

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:25.730 align:middle line:84%
having insecurities, and
destructive aggression.

00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:27.650 align:middle line:84%
It could also come
in the form of rage,

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:31.510 align:middle line:84%
or possibly an
expressed abusiveness,

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:35.600 align:middle line:84%
a lack of compassion,
and being more selfish,

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.600 align:middle line:84%
as well as having
violent tendencies.

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.310 align:middle line:84%
So we must be
careful to not become

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:45.110 align:middle line:84%
a victim of our own untamed
nature because of fear.

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:47.930 align:middle line:84%
That's the same thing as
fearing our own power,

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:50.495 align:middle line:84%
and therefore not learning
how to control our impulses.

00:25:50.495 --> 00:25:53.230 align:middle line:90%


00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:55.000 align:middle line:84%
When we can recognize
and acknowledge

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.630 align:middle line:84%
how the shadow side of strength
might be showing up in us,

00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:01.090 align:middle line:84%
that's when we can start
to transform it and do

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:06.040 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual alchemy of
changing the shadow into light.

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And some of the ways to bring
our shadow into the light

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:13.840 align:middle line:84%
is to find a way to make our
animal nature a more peaceful

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:17.140 align:middle line:84%
companion to us,
making peace also

00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:18.880 align:middle line:84%
with that dark
side of our nature,

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:22.420 align:middle line:84%
and extending compassion
to that part of ourselves

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:25.030 align:middle line:90%
and others when we see it.

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:27.130 align:middle line:84%
Having an inner
strength allows you

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:31.010 align:middle line:90%
to heal yourself and others.

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:32.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of the
other benefits that

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:35.050 align:middle line:84%
can be gained by
working with strength

00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:37.100 align:middle line:84%
is that it helps
us to strengthen

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:39.890 align:middle line:84%
our use of our own
life force energy,

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:42.800 align:middle line:84%
and it gives us an opportunity
to burn away the dross,

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:45.410 align:middle line:84%
or the things that
don't serve us.

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:49.010 align:middle line:84%
It helps us stimulate a
desire to overcome material

00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:52.310 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual barriers.

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:55.400 align:middle line:84%
Think of times when you've
either been or encountered

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:59.330 align:middle line:84%
someone with strength in
your life, someone who's

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:02.750 align:middle line:84%
able to handle stress
and pressure with grace

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:07.810 align:middle line:84%
and equanimity, who faces their
fears and their doubts head on,

00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:10.610 align:middle line:90%
and they learn to conquer them.

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:12.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, as children,
we're often fearless,

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:15.950 align:middle line:84%
and our creative
imagination runs freely.

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:19.820 align:middle line:84%
But inevitably, we have some
accidents, we make mistakes,

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:22.160 align:middle line:90%
and we get burned by the fire.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And this usually
teaches us that we

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:26.690 align:middle line:84%
have to have a healthy
respect for the fire

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:28.700 align:middle line:90%
and be more cautious.

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:32.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we handle these
learning experiences with grace,

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:35.360 align:middle line:84%
then they inform our future
choices in a good way.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.190 align:middle line:84%
But if we don't
handle them well,

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:41.030 align:middle line:84%
then we develop fears,
insecurities, and attachments

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:44.030 align:middle line:90%
that weaken us later in life.

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:48.500 align:middle line:84%
The strength archetype wants
us to now overcome those fears,

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.920 align:middle line:84%
while learning the lessons
from our experiences.

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And that requires healing,
and healing requires

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:57.270 align:middle line:90%
self-love and acceptance.

00:27:57.270 --> 00:27:59.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, any time we're
applying the discipline that

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:02.240 align:middle line:84%
is needed to
control our impulses

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:04.730 align:middle line:84%
and to overcome our
fears, we're also

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:07.670 align:middle line:84%
drawing upon the
power of strength.

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And any time we're able
to maintain our composure

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:13.580 align:middle line:84%
and stay centered in the face
of someone else trying to attack

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:15.500 align:middle line:90%
us, that too is strength.

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:19.950 align:middle line:90%


00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:22.890 align:middle line:84%
What might our parallel life
be like under the archetype

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:24.740 align:middle line:90%
of strength?

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, one example of
strength manifesting

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:30.600 align:middle line:84%
is through overcoming a
direct challenge or test.

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:35.940 align:middle line:84%
We can think of something like
Hercules wrestling the lion,

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:39.690 align:middle line:84%
or Daniel when he was thrown
into the den of lions.

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:41.670 align:middle line:84%
In modern day life,
we can also look

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:44.730 align:middle line:84%
to people who have really
mastered themselves

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:47.340 align:middle line:90%
to be at the top of their game.

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Examples could include Olympic
and pro athletes, performing

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:57.030 align:middle line:84%
artists, leaders who tend to be
really in the spotlight a lot,

00:28:57.030 --> 00:28:59.880 align:middle line:84%
and it would be a life
where they shine on stage,

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:05.580 align:middle line:84%
or they really get to express
their passion and creativity.

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:09.660 align:middle line:84%
The people of strength have
serious dedication, discipline,

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:12.450 align:middle line:90%
and creative vision.

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:14.850 align:middle line:84%
By working with strength
and invoking its archetypes

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:16.980 align:middle line:84%
and energies into
your life, you too

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:18.860 align:middle line:90%
can master the lion within you.

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:22.830 align:middle line:90%


00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:25.020 align:middle line:84%
Join me again as
we explore further

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:27.690 align:middle line:84%
into the 22 archetypes
of tarot and how

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:31.950 align:middle line:84%
they can help us to make our
big shift in consciousness.

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:33.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard.

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.820 align:middle line:10%

the mysteries of tarot

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:37.770 align:middle line:10%
