00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.560 align:middle line:10%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard,
host of "Mystery Teachings,"

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.210 align:middle line:10%
and today, I'm
going to guide you

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.065 align:middle line:10%
on a meditation with the
archetype of the Fool.

00:00:30.065 --> 00:00:32.780 align:middle line:10%
Now meditating on the
Fool helps us to connect

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.850 align:middle line:10%
to our original spirit.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.760 align:middle line:10%
It also helps us to take
leaps of faith in life

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.300 align:middle line:10%
and gain greater trust in
divine wisdom to guide us.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.250 align:middle line:84%
Now for the purposes
of this journey,

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.110 align:middle line:84%
we want to focus on the
Universal Waite Tarot Deck

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.910 align:middle line:90%
only.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.710 align:middle line:90%


00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.380 align:middle line:84%
When you get a new deck, the
first thing that you want to do

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.360 align:middle line:84%
is take those cards
out of the plastic

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.400 align:middle line:84%
and out of the box
that they come in,

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.340 align:middle line:84%
and then place them
somewhere high in your home,

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.290 align:middle line:90%
like up on a high shelf.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And leave them there for 72
hours so they can breathe.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.890 align:middle line:84%
This calls an
energy from above it

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.890 align:middle line:90%
and infuses it into the deck.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.710 align:middle line:84%
After that initial
72 hours, then you

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.117 align:middle line:90%
may start working with them.

00:01:16.117 --> 00:01:17.700 align:middle line:84%
Now when you're not
working with them,

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.540 align:middle line:84%
the best way to store them is to
keep them wrapped in silk, not

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.890 align:middle line:90%
in the box that they came in.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.680 align:middle line:90%


00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.470 align:middle line:84%
Once we have our deck,
we're now ready to use

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.340 align:middle line:84%
the imagery of the Major Arcana
as windows into the soul.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And the goal is to now
build up these forms

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.380 align:middle line:90%
within our own mind.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.710 align:middle line:84%
So we'll be looking at each of
the images of the tarot cards.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.340 align:middle line:84%
We're going to study
them each one at a time

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.260 align:middle line:90%
and we take all the details in.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.940 align:middle line:84%
As we then study
it, we want to then

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.640 align:middle line:84%
be able to recreate
it inside of us

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.100 align:middle line:90%
and work with it in our mind.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.500 align:middle line:84%
We're going to use our
active imagination,

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.700 align:middle line:84%
engaging all five senses to let
that imagery and the characters

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.040 align:middle line:90%
come to life within us.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.700 align:middle line:84%
We can ask them questions
and receive insights.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.320 align:middle line:84%
Then the next step
is that we want

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.250 align:middle line:84%
to do something called
assuming the archetypal form.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.200 align:middle line:84%
We're going to merge
with the character,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.250 align:middle line:90%
we're going to become it.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.470 align:middle line:84%
So once you're ready
to start this process

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.130 align:middle line:84%
and work with the cards,
begin with the Fool.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Find the Fool card in
the deck and take it out.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.190 align:middle line:84%
Place this card in front
of you at eye level.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.490 align:middle line:84%
Now if you have something like
a meditation stool or a cushion,

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.770 align:middle line:84%
you can sit on that
in front of a table

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.510 align:middle line:84%
and place the card
upright on the table.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.880 align:middle line:90%
Try to get it at eye level.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.800 align:middle line:84%
Then get yourself into
a relaxed position,

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.750 align:middle line:84%
a light, meditative state, relax
your body, empty your mind,

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.420 align:middle line:84%
and make sure that you're
in a positive or at least

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.630 align:middle line:84%
a neutral state of
being while you do this,

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.880 align:middle line:84%
meaning don't have
anything disturbing you

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.250 align:middle line:90%
mentally or emotionally.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.160 align:middle line:84%
Once you're ready, look at
the image of the Fool card

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.150 align:middle line:84%
for awhile, about 10
minutes with your eyes open.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.760 align:middle line:84%
Study its imagery
and its symbolism.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.335 align:middle line:90%
Take in all the details.

00:03:10.335 --> 00:03:14.320 align:middle line:90%


00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.450 align:middle line:10%
We'll remain silent now
for the next five minutes

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.150 align:middle line:10%
as we now meditate on the
symbolism of the card.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:08:10.940 align:middle line:90%


00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:15.500 align:middle line:84%
Take it inside and work with
it in your mind for another 10

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.060 align:middle line:90%
minutes with your eyes closed.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:20.110 align:middle line:90%


00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:23.620 align:middle line:84%
Once the image is firmly
established in your mind,

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.280 align:middle line:90%
let it come to life.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.920 align:middle line:90%
Just observe it for a while.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.880 align:middle line:84%
Feel the energy that
the Fool emanates.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.445 align:middle line:84%
Watch how the Fool
behaves and moves.

00:08:33.445 --> 00:13:27.120 align:middle line:90%


00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:30.990 align:middle line:10%
And after you've observed
the Fool for a while,

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:33.930 align:middle line:10%
next, you want to
merge with the Fool.

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:35.550 align:middle line:10%
Become the Fool.

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.610 align:middle line:10%
See yourself being the Fool.

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:42.060 align:middle line:10%
See yourself taking
on this behavior.

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:47.090 align:middle line:10%
See yourself being in the pose,
having this energy emanating

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:52.950 align:middle line:10%
its vibrant light, having
that sense of playfulness.

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:55.590 align:middle line:10%
Take your time with
this and really sink

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:57.780 align:middle line:10%
into this experience.

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:02.140 align:middle line:10%
Let it fully come
alive within you.

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:06.810 align:middle line:10%
And at some point, when you feel
integrated with this energy,

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:09.390 align:middle line:10%
you're going to stand
up and physically take

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:11.850 align:middle line:10%
on the posture of the Fool.

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:14.190 align:middle line:10%
You can imagine
having your arms out

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:17.550 align:middle line:10%
and imagine like a staff
in your right hand resting

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:19.890 align:middle line:10%
on your shoulder, and
then the left hand

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:21.390 align:middle line:10%
is holding the white rose.

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:24.780 align:middle line:10%
And you're taking one step
forward with the right foot,

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:29.400 align:middle line:10%
and your gaze is up
out into the distance.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.040 align:middle line:10%
So take on this
position physically

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.410 align:middle line:10%
and assume the form of the Fool.

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:37.020 align:middle line:10%


00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.940 align:middle line:10%
When you're in this
position, you're

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:43.550 align:middle line:10%
going to state this
affirmation out loud--

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:46.420 align:middle line:10%
I am the spirit of the ether.

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:49.330 align:middle line:10%
I trust in divine
wisdom to guide me.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:15:53.320 align:middle line:90%


00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.300 align:middle line:84%
The other thing we
want to do is then

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:57.310 align:middle line:84%
bring these energies
into our life

00:15:57.310 --> 00:16:00.190 align:middle line:84%
and express them
outwardly, which

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:03.670 align:middle line:84%
is something that we
can do in multiple ways.

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:08.230 align:middle line:84%
For example with the Fool, go
do something playful and joyful.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Let down your
guard and be silly,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.760 align:middle line:90%
be lighthearted or carefree.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.910 align:middle line:84%
See the world with the
eyes of wonder and optimism

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:19.800 align:middle line:84%
again, like you did
when you were a child.

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Other things you can do are
bring the primary colors

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:26.010 align:middle line:84%
into your environment
or your dress.

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:28.290 align:middle line:10%
The Fool's main
color is yellow, so

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:31.920 align:middle line:10%
wear some bright pale yellow.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:35.610 align:middle line:84%
Keep working with those
affirmations daily as well.

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And the meditation itself,
meditating with the Fool

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:42.750 align:middle line:84%
archetype, taking it in,
building it inside your mind,

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:45.757 align:middle line:84%
assuming the form,
saying the affirmation,

00:16:45.757 --> 00:16:47.340 align:middle line:84%
all of these things
are things that we

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.470 align:middle line:90%
can do on a daily basis.

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Working also,
contemplating the meaning

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:54.510 align:middle line:84%
of the card, the
images, the symbols,

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:58.200 align:middle line:84%
looking deeper into every
little aspect of the card,

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.030 align:middle line:84%
and considering
and contemplating

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:02.650 align:middle line:90%
how it applies to life.

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:04.869 align:middle line:84%
Another thing to do is
watch for the archetype

00:17:04.869 --> 00:17:07.150 align:middle line:90%
to appear in your dreams.

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:09.280 align:middle line:84%
The more you're actively
engaging with it

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.500 align:middle line:84%
in a conscious
way, the more it's

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.020 align:middle line:84%
going to show up and
give you messages

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:18.700 align:middle line:84%
during your dream time, so pay
attention to those messages.

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.150 align:middle line:84%
Also, really pay
attention to a notice

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:23.950 align:middle line:84%
acknowledge how you embody the
strengths and the weaknesses

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:25.510 align:middle line:90%
of each archetype.

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:28.510 align:middle line:84%
Consciously work to make
improvements in those areas

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:31.120 align:middle line:84%
where you might be expressing
the weaknesses or the shadow

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.220 align:middle line:90%
aspects.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And also realize that when
we're working with archetypes,

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:38.870 align:middle line:84%
in this way, and
we're invoking them,

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:42.540 align:middle line:84%
they will set forces
in motion in your life.

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:45.080 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to really
engage with this experience,

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.740 align:middle line:84%
then commit to seeing
it all the way through.

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:52.910 align:middle line:84%
Work with each key as we
go in the proper order

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:54.560 align:middle line:90%
during this season.

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.500 align:middle line:84%
Don't skip steps,
don't half-ass it.

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.060 align:middle line:90%
Really give it your attention.

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:01.570 align:middle line:90%


00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:04.360 align:middle line:84%
When we draw an image
inside of us like this

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:07.570 align:middle line:84%
and then assume its
form, it affects us down

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:10.720 align:middle line:90%
to a cellular and atomic level.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:14.160 align:middle line:84%
It starts creating
something new inside of us.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:18.100 align:middle line:84%
And as we work with all the
cards in their proper sequence,

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:21.340 align:middle line:84%
it ultimately
reorganizes our soul

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:24.500 align:middle line:84%
and it creates a new
system within us.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, they become
innate, active expressions

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:29.910 align:middle line:90%
of our own energies.

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And this is a process
of building up

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.550 align:middle line:84%
what we call the magical
body, or a new, more conscious

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:37.215 align:middle line:90%
version of ourselves.

00:18:37.215 --> 00:18:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And through it, we can manifest
more of our full potential

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:43.050 align:middle line:90%
and multi-dimensional essence.

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:45.480 align:middle line:84%
Join me again, as
we explore further

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:48.330 align:middle line:84%
into the 22 Archetypes
of Tarot and how
